I am joined today by the deputy chief medical officer, Dr. Ronan Glynn, and Professor Philip Nolan, the chair of our modelling group.  I will provide an update on the current epidemiological situation, the impact that our vaccination programme is having on the risk profile of the disease, and recent developments regarding further easing of public health restrictions, as the committee requested.  I also have a short slide set with me today and I can take members through that if it is helpful to better describe the current epidemiological situation and related matters.</p> <p>  The last 18 months has seen a considerable burden placed on individuals, communities, and society as a whole.  We wish to thank the public for their solidarity to date and their continued efforts to help stop the spread of Covid-19.  We also wish to extend our sympathies to those who have lost loved ones to Covid-19 despite our collective best efforts as a society.  The epidemiological situation in Ireland at present indicates high incidence with an uncertain trajectory.  While incidence in those aged 19 to 24 years and 13 to 18 years has fallen in recent weeks, we have noted an increase in testing rates and confirmed cases in children aged five to 12 years.  This trend, and in particular the impact of the return to school and the opening of the third level sector, will continue to be monitored closely by us over the coming weeks.</p> <p>  The total number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in hospital has begun to reduce and the total number of confirmed cases in intensive care units, ICU, has stabilised recently.  There continues to be low mortality relative to the number of Covid-19 cases.  While the majority of infections are occurring largely in the young, unvaccinated population, the current force of infection is resulting in a significant number of infections in older, vaccinated people.  At the same time, the number of outbreaks notified in settings with vulnerable populations, such as nursing homes, has increased in recent weeks and this is being closely monitored by the HSE, in the first instance, and also by us in NPHET.</p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s Covid-19 vaccination programme continues to make significant progress. As of yesterday, 14 September, 88% of those aged 16 years and over are now fully vaccinated, with 90% having received at least one dose.  Vaccine uptake and completion has been very high in all age groups, ranging from 81% completion in those aged 16 to 49 years, through to 95% completion in those aged 50 to 69 years, to an almost universal vaccination, in those aged 70 years and over.  However, vaccination has been offered to younger people relatively recently, and many younger cohorts have yet to receive their second dose.  Those aged 16 to 29 years, given their high levels of social contact and partial vaccination, have still the potential to sustain a large wave of infection until such time as this cohort achieves very high levels of immunity through vaccination.  Fortunately, uptake in younger cohorts is high.</p><p> Covid-19 vaccines are providing very effective protection from severe illness and have fundamentally changed the risk profile of this disease.  This will facilitate a transition in our approach to managing the pandemic over the medium term, entailing a shift from a focus on regulation and population-wide restrictions to one that is appropriately based on public health advice which will facilitate the exercise of personal judgment and personal protective behaviours.  However, notwithstanding the great benefits that vaccines have brought, it is likely that the Delta variant will continue to circulate extensively globally and in this country in the coming months, particularly among individuals who have not yet been vaccinated or those who have not been fully protected through vaccination.</p><p> In the context of this highly transmissible variant, it is unlikely that vaccination alone, even at the high levels of vaccine coverage that we are achieving compared with many other countries, will bring the effective reproduction number below 1.  This means that through autumn and winter, possibly in the face of high levels of infection, we will remain dependent upon high public understanding and buy-in to the basic public health measures that we have emphasised all the way through this pandemic in order to minimise opportunities for transmission of the virus.  As a result, here will be an ongoing requirement for: clear guidance and communication for the public on the evolving disease profile and the strategies they can take to mitigate those risks; a focus on the vital importance of rapid self-isolation for those who have symptoms of respiratory viral infections; a partnership approach between employers and employees to ensure that the importance of self-isolating when symptomatic is understood, communicated as well as facilitated; sector-specific measures to ensure safe environments, including formal requirements for mask wearing in certain settings such as healthcare, indoor retail environments, and on public transport; and, importantly, robust public health surveillance and response capacities, including testing, contact tracing, surveillance and sequencing capacities for Covid-19.</p><p> Throughout the pandemic, focus has remained on protecting those most vulnerable to the severe impacts of Covid-19 and on protecting health and social care, education, and childcare services.  These continue to be and must be prioritised.  The continued burden of Covid-19 and the significant backlog of non-Covid care, due to both the demand for Covid care in the early part of this year and the recent ransomware attack suffered by the HSE, means that our health and social care system and, in particular, our hospital system, remain in a challenging position.  Should Covid-19 admissions begin to increase once again, this will place additional pressure on the hospital system and will have a significant impact on the delivery of non-Covid care.</p><p> We cannot predict with certainty the future trajectory of the disease and, consequently, we cannot fully rule out the possibility that the reintroduction of any given measure to enable us to respond to the disease and what challenges its transmission might pose for us.  We must continue to ensure our response is agile and flexible, with an ability to pivot rapidly and respond to any emerging threat that might arise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Karina Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  The roll-out of the Covid-19 and seasonal influenza vaccine programmes is managed by the HSE.  I will update the committee on the need for the Covid-19 vaccine boosters and NIAC's seasonal influenza vaccine recommendation.</p><p>NIAC brings together a broad range of experts to formulate its advice.  Its members regularly participate in meetings of the World Health Organization and European advisory bodies on immunisation.  NIAC has sent comprehensive recommendations to the Chief Medical Officer on issues regarding the Covid-19 vaccination programme relating to priority groups for vaccination, vaccine safety, pregnancy, children, adolescents and, most recently, booster vaccinations.</p><p> The most effective way to prevent Covid-19 related hospitalisation, severe illness and death is to ensure that all eligible people are fully vaccinated.  They are strongly encouraged and should be facilitated to complete the vaccination course.  An additional Covid-19 vaccine dose may be required because of an inadequate protective response to the first course, waning immunity or the emergence of resistant variants.  Additional doses are often collectively referred to as boosters.  However, distinction should be made between the need for an additional dose where the scheduled course is inadequate, to which we refer as an extended primary course, and the need to reinforce a waning immune response, which is a booster dose.  An additional dose or doses of the original or a modified vaccine may also be required to protect against a resistant variant.  Those with severe immunocompromise, for example, after organ transplantation or receiving immunosuppressive treatments, may not have adequate protection following a primary vaccine course.  For them, an additional primary dose increases the likelihood of achieving protection.</p><p> Residents of long-term care facilities and many older people living in the community have suffered severe disruption to their quality of life, with negative impact on their psychological and social well-being during the pandemic.  This group has a poorer response to the primary vaccine course and more rapidly waning immunity because of their age and underlying medical conditions.  In order to optimise their protection, NIAC has recommended that an additional vaccine dose should be given to those aged 12 years and older with immunocompromise associated with a suboptimal response to vaccines, those aged 80 and older and those aged 65 and older living in long-term care facilities.</p><p> NIAC has recommended that the Covid-19 and seasonal influenza vaccines may be given at the same time or separated by any interval.  This will allow the uptake of both vaccines to be optimised.  This year, an adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine is recommended for those aged 65 years and older as it provides better protection for this age group.</p><p> NIAC continues to examine evidence regarding the need for booster Covid vaccines for other age groups.  These include those at increased risk of severe Covid disease, other older persons and healthcare workers because of their pivotal role in providing essential health services.  Consideration for boosters takes into account whether the additional doses are safe, whether they are needed and whether they can provide benefit.  Influencing factors include community levels of circulating SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of the high vaccination rate in Ireland, with more than 90% of adults fully vaccinated.  This high uptake is a testament to the public confidence in the programme and credit to all involved in the development and roll-out of the vaccine programme.</p><p> NIAC is conscious of the global demands on vaccine supplies and recognises that facilitating vaccination on a global level is important on a humanitarian and global equity basis and essential to limit the continuing threat of Covid-19 in Ireland.  NIAC is cognisant of the WHO position and advice on global vaccination and our duty to address inequities.  Until global control is achieved, all countries remain at risk and return to normality will be compromised.  Vaccines are a global public good for the benefit of all.  NIAC is mindful that low and middle income countries have insufficient doses to protect those most at risk.  Less than 2% of people there have received a first dose of vaccine and it is estimated that many will not receive a vaccine until late 2023.</p><p> Ending the pandemic requires global co-operation.  Failure to mitigate high community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in any country can facilitate emergence of resistant variants and prolong the global threat.  NIAC welcomes Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the COVAX facility, which supports low and middle income countries in vaccine access.  NIAC encourages the Government to continue with, and expand its commitment to, the global co-ordinated effort based on the principle of solidarity to foster equitable access to Covid vaccines.</p><p> In upholding the principles of moral equality, minimising harm and fairness, as set out in the national allocation framework for equitable access to Covid vaccines, NIAC seeks to protect those most at risk from severe Covid while recognising that access to life-saving vaccines for those most at risk should not depend on country of origin or residency.  As stated by the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, "It is more important than ever in this difficult time to uphold a form of solidarity that is inclusive of everyone, which recognises that respect is due to everyone, and not exclusive to those that live in our own town, region, or country".</p><p>NIAC acknowledges the significant support of our voluntary members and the collaboration with, and by, all involved in the vaccination programme in pursuing a common goal of reducing deaths and severe illness from Covid.  Through maintaining confidence in a high-quality vaccination programme, we can maximise vaccine uptake and reap societal benefits.  I thank the committee for its attention.</p></speech>

I ask all members to observe the time limit and stick to the subject under discussion.</p></speech>

We are eternally grateful for their efforts and the leadership they have shown over the past 18 months.</p> <p>  I was a little bit concerned about Dr. Holohan's statement on outbreaks in nursing homes.  Nursing homes are where the most vulnerable in our society live.  I ask him to elaborate a little bit on these outbreaks.  Are there specific reasons for them, outside of the standard reasons we would expect such as community transmission?  Is there anything unusual about them?  Is it possibly down to some staff not being vaccinated?  It is very concerning and the fact Dr. Holohan has noted it and is monitoring it very carefully is a concern.  I ask Dr. Holohan to share with us a little more information on the outbreaks in nursing homes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#D00400"><p>We have some specific data on nursing homes.  We are keeping a close eye.  In recent times, we have experienced a number of outbreaks in nursing homes.  The first explanation for this is what we call the force of infection; there is just so much infection out there in the population, although it has reduced somewhat in recent weeks.  We do not have 100% vaccination, although we do have very high levels of vaccination, and we do not have a vaccine that is 100% effective.  We will always have some people who will be vulnerable if they encounter another individual and pick up the infection.  This is exactly what has happened in our nursing homes.  It is also what has happened in these age groups in the community.  We have seen a rise in the incidence in the corresponding age groups in the community.  This leads to several things.  Perhaps Professor Butler will wish to speak on one of these, which is the decision to accept the advice of NIAC on boosting vaccination for people who are residents in nursing home facilities and who are over the age of 65.  There is also the continual importance of maintaining high levels of compliance with infection prevention and control.  This continues to be every bit as important now as it was at the beginning of the pandemic.  We do everything we can in our nursing home communities for the patients and staff to maintain high levels of infection prevention and control.</p> <p>  The Senator partly answered his own question in his remarks on staff.  We have high levels of vaccination among staff.  We believe there has been a challenge in some nursing homes in maintaining high levels, particularly perhaps among those who work in nursing homes but who come from agencies.  Maintaining a focus on ensuring we do not deploy staff who are not adequately vaccinated, if it can be avoided, is at the core of what the HSE is trying to do in terms of its management of nursing homes.</p> <p>  There are several points we would make in general terms and I will ask Dr. Glynn to share some of the specific data.  We have much less of this than we had for corresponding level of infection at previous times in the epidemic.  This is good news in terms of the level of protection.</p><p>For those people who pick up this infection in the nursing home communities, in terms of the impact of that infection, we did not always have very high levels of hospitalisation as compared with, perhaps, other parts of the population, but the effect in terms of mortality was a very different experience.  Although we have had some mortality in these communities, it is at a much lower level than we would have experienced at previous points in the pandemic when we did not have the benefit of vaccination protecting the people who reside in them.</p></speech>

In terms of mortality, are there any specific figures available on the number of people we sadly lost?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#E00300"><p>We do have that.  We will share it with Senator Conway.  I will ask Dr. Glynn to outline it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#E00400"><p>We have data from 27 June to 11 September, inclusive.  Over that period, there were seven outbreaks in community hospital or long-stay units and 51 in nursing homes.  That is 58 outbreaks in total.  Across those 58 outbreaks there were 896 cases recorded and 31 of the people involved were hospitalised, which was 3.5%.  Unfortunately, 31 passed away giving a mortality rate of 3.5%.  Last week there were four new nursing home outbreaks reported involving 24 confirmed cases.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#E00500"><p>In terms of the booster programme Dr. Glynn spoke about, perhaps Professor Butler might go into a bit more detail on the plan to roll out the booster jabs to long-term care facilities and nursing homes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Karina Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#E00600"><p>I am happy to talk about that.  In terms of the booster programme, the reason that we have recommended the booster shot for those living in nursing homes and for those over 80 years of age is because we know they have particular vulnerability.  First, their initial response is not as good overall.  Some people within the cohort will have very good responses.  If we take those groups as a whole, however, they will not respond as well as younger age groups so their primary response is not as good.  The second point has been supported by data, initially from Israel but now also by data that has come out this week from Public Health England, which shows that their immunity wanes more quickly over time.  That was the reason for recommending booster shots.</p> <p>  One of the points I would like to emphasise and to which Dr. Holohan referred is that although we see a creep up in the amount of infections, the impact has been very different in the vaccinated population versus the unvaccinated.  For the elderly who are fully vaccinated - most of them are - when they get infection, most of them have a milder disease than they would have had last January.  In terms of the actual plans for the implementation of those recommendations, that falls into the remit of the HSE.  I think those plans are being made at the moment but I cannot speak to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#E00700"><p>I will make another reflection from my own perspective.  As restrictions ease and we move back into some element of normality, people are possibly going to drop their guard in terms of the public health advice on mask-wearing, handwashing and so on.  Does NPHET have any plans for some form of winter information campaign to keep up the people's awareness of the fact that, in addition to vaccination, the public health advice is being maintained?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#E00800"><p>Yes, we do.  The reason is exactly as Senator Conway says, namely, to maintain as high a level of compliance as we can with all the basic and important public health measures which, as I outlined in the opening statement, we are going to have to continue to keep up.  It was in our most recent advice.  We have always emphasised the importance of clear public communications but perhaps we must take a new approach to communications that will emphasise the areas in respect of which we need to keep up a high level of compliance as we move forward with the easing of measures.  For example, on the question of people with mild and other respiratory symptoms, in previous times we might have soldiered on when we had illnesses.  We must accept now that we are probably putting other people at risk by doing that.</p><p>It is important when people have symptoms that at the earliest stage possible they stay away from school, work, the pub or inviting people over to their house until about 48 hours after their symptoms have resolved.  We are going to have to change our cultural behaviour in that regard.  All of that will be underpinned by clear and consistent messaging.  Any of us who has a leadership responsibility, not just we in NPHET but everybody who is involved in communicating and messaging to the public, must reinforce this message as much as possible.</p><p> Going right back to the beginning of the pandemic, before we had a testing capacity or vaccines on the horizon, the behaviour of the person who is symptomatic and who is likely to be transmitting - even though we know there is a risk of people who do not have symptoms also transmitting - is important.  If each individual who has symptoms is behaving responsibly and staying away from the kinds of settings I mentioned, if we keep up a high level of compliance with mask wearing and social distancing in circumstances where that matters and if people are particularly aware of the risk of transmission in indoor environments, those things, combined with the exceptionally high and almost unprecedentedly high levels of vaccination that we now have in this country compared with almost any other country in the world, will be necessary to keep the level of infection suppressed.</p><p> When we look at the 16 to 30 years age group in which we have a level of vaccination - it is now in the low 80s - the reality is that as they come together in the kinds of environments in which such young people come together, there will be an increased risk of transmission and we will have outbreaks and infection.  We will continue to see that as the virus becomes a part of our-----</p></speech>

I thank them for all the work they have done in the past 18 months, which has been nothing short of phenomenal.  Well done to the CMO and his team and Professor Butler and her team on all their work.</p> <p>  I will start with the final paragraph of Dr. Holohan's opening statement which grabbed some headlines and merits some clarification.  We all accept that there is no certainty about where this disease is now or may be in the coming weeks and months.  I wish to ask about the statement that we cannot fully rule out the possibility that the reintroduction of measures may be required into the future.  For the purposes of clarity, is it Dr. Holohan's view that we are still on track in the first instance for the ending of restrictions on 22 October?  When Dr. Holohan referred to the reintroduction of measures, I assume that could be a range of measures and not necessarily the type of lockdowns that we have seen in the past.  Some clarity on that might be useful.</p></speech>

What I am saying is that we can never rule anything out, but we do not think we are going to be in a situation where some of the significant restrictions that had to be imposed on the Irish population are likely to be necessary on the basis of anything we see in front of us right now.  In broad terms, we are optimistic about the trajectory of the disease at this point in time.  The likelihood is that over the course of the coming weeks the important criteria that we set out in our last advice to the Government and need to be satisfied before we think we are able to move on, if I could put it in those general terms, will be met and that the range of measures that are still in place will be eased.  We think we are a short number of weeks away from that and we do not see anything at this point in time emerging in the international scene, globally, by way of concern about a new variant.  We cannot forget the potential of other forms of viruses to create pandemics.  In particular having had the experience of the past 18 months, I am simply saying we cannot rules things out in terms of a response, but that is not the same as saying that we expect-----</p></speech>

I will return to the presentation Dr. Holohan gave to members of the committee some months ago when the Delta variant first arrived?  As he will recall, there were a number of projections.  The scenarios were "optimistic", "central 1", "central 2" and "pessimistic".</p><p>I am looking at the optimistic scenario, which was 81,000 cases.  Central scenario 1 was 187,000 cases and central scenario 2 was 408,000 cases.  The pessimistic scenario was 681,000 cases between July, August and September.

Our more optimistic assumptions about the Delta variant and about social mixing are therefore underpinned.  We have updated those models.  To reinforce what the Chief Medical Officer said, if we take the most optimistic scenario we are currently looking at, which is not unreasonable, we are just past the peak of infection and case numbers should decline from here on in.  That may be happening given the data we have now.</p> <p>  There are important assumptions in those models that children are somewhat less likely to get this disease and less likely to transmit it.  Very importantly, we also are assuming that we all adhere to those very basic measures the Chief Medical Officer has outlined, that is, self-isolation if symptomatic and so on.  Modelling at the moment suggests two things, however.  We appear to be following an optimistic track but if we relax on those basic measures or if children are a greater driver of infection than we anticipate, then there is the potential for an additional wave of disease, particularly-----</p></speech>

I will follow on from that point because it segues into my next question on test and trace.  There has been some public commentary with regard to children, especially in schools.  In his opening statement, the CMO said that "we have noted an increase in testing rates and confirmed cases in children aged five to 12 years".  There was also some public commentary and, I believe, a leaked document from NPHET that looked at the possibility of relaxing the rule of self-isolation for children who are asymptomatic.  My understanding is that as of today, approximately 12,000 children are self-isolating and there are approximately 1,200 new cases a day.  Would those figures be correct for starters?</p></speech>

Obviously, we have to keep children safe, which is our main priority first and foremost.  Does Dr. Holohan anticipate that we will see a change in direction or a change in advice from NPHET with regard to that self-isolation rule for children?</p> <p>  Second, am I right in saying that throughout the pandemic, 29 children were admitted to ICU who were suspected Covid cases but only one quarter of those tested positive?  Are those figures also correct?</p></speech>

We have a NPHET meeting scheduled for tomorrow.  My hope and expectation is that within a very short period, which I do not want to put a date on specifically but within a short period, we believe we will have had enough time to monitor the impact of the resumption of the school year on potential transmission.</p> <p>  As the Deputy rightly said, we have seen a significant increase in testing.  That level of increase in testing has outstripped the increase in incidence so in other words, the positivity has dropped.  What we have seen is that increase in incidence, particularly in the five to 12-year-olds, is explained by the huge volume of additional testing that has now been done in that age group.  It is not a true underlying change in the incidence of the disease in those age groups, which is a very important observation.  We want to maintain that observation for a sufficient time, which we think is not much longer, to allow us to say that we are in a position to change to a different form of management of the disease, not just in respect of schoolchildren but in respect of testing and contact tracing for the whole of society.  We do not believe it is necessary-----</p></speech>

As I said, we need to be sure that we have allowed sufficient time to observe the resumption of the school year, which is only two weeks in the case of primary schools.  We are not that far away from being able to have that certainty, if it is there.  We remain hopeful that we will be in a position to change that in the near term, not just for schoolchildren but in terms in testing, contact tracing and the wider public health management for society as a whole.</p></speech>

I hope that in the next weeks and months, perhaps when Dr. Holohan next appears before the committee, members will be able to talk to him about wider healthcare issues and non-Covid healthcare issues.  That will be important.</p> <p>  I have one final question for Professor Butler.  I understand the need to make sure those in nursing homes, those aged over 80 and certain categories of people who are immunocompromised get a booster jab or what Professor Butler called an extended primary dose.  Is it the case or is it possible that other people beyond those groups, for example, patients with blood cancers or other types of patients who are immunocompromised, may also get a booster jab?  Is this the start?  In time, will we see others getting a booster jab as well?  In terms of the first categories that have been signed off on, how many people will get a booster jab?  How many people are we talking about and what is the timeframe?  When do we expect to get them their booster jabs and have that completed?</p></speech>

I do not have them to hand today.  I do not remember and I would not want to give the Deputy misinformation.</p> <p>  The Deputy's first question is very important.  In fact, that was the first category of people for whom we recommended boosters.  Those with immunocompromising conditions or who are undergoing treatments that compromise that ability to respond to their primary course will get booster doses.  That would include, for example, patients with haematological malignancies who are in that recent phase.  That is outlined and will be done in parallel with the groups that we prioritised in the beginning for vaccination.  That is already in place.</p></speech>

That includes every single one of us, whether it is front-line healthcare professionals, people involved in the role that NPHET carries out or people at a political level making decisions based on the advice.  Each one of us will be changing our response because of the fortunate position in which we find ourselves, with high levels of vaccination and, hopefully, increasing confidence about the level of control we are achieving with regard to the disease.  We need to find a way of moving on and incorporating our response to what will become an endemic disease into our public health management of the entire set of risks that might pertain to the population over the course of the winter.  That is a perfectly natural evolution in response to any emergency.</p></speech>

We have examined the experience of the southern hemisphere, as we always do, during its winter, which was our summer just ended.  We are gaining some reassurance from that.

Regarding the points he raised in his opening statement about personal judgment and personal protective behaviours, I found myself being much more conscious again about handwashing and so on over the past week or two, coinciding with the general return to work.  They are the actions that protected us but someone mentioned their being relaxed a little.  Dr. Holohan might comment on some of the measures that we can take in that regard.</p> <p>  Could Dr. Holohan give us a tour through the most severe manifestation of long Covid to date?  How long does NPHET believe long Covid will last for people?  What are the symptoms associated with it and the regularity of those?  What time span for long Covid has been seen to date and what are the most chronic symptoms and prognoses in respect of same, particularly among those without underlying conditions?</p></speech>

One of the main issues that we are concerned with and that we will emphasise over the coming months is that of hand hygiene, which the Deputy mentioned.  The key issue is something that the Chief Medical Officer referenced already, in that we must have a low index of suspicion for ourselves when we are symptomatic and that we remove ourselves from activities or environments where there are other people if we have any suspicion that we might have the beginnings of a cold or flu.  That will be the single strongest action that we can take over this autumn and winter.</p> <p>  Reference has also been made to the need for a national communications campaign over the coming months.  While that will be a key part of what we do, what will also be important is that each sector, organisation, club, retail outlet and so on continues to support its staff in isolating when necessary, has hand sanitiser present when necessary and ensures that its environment is well ventilated.  All of the basic measures that we have emphasised over the past year will remain important through this winter.  Hopefully, they will form part of a cultural shift that will protect us all from these kinds of illness in the years to come.</p></speech>

The issue with long Covid is that there are a number of different syndromes that are gathered together under it.  It covers people who have been very sick in ICU, who have a prolonged rehabilitation time that is very defined.  It can take time to recover from the effects on their multi-organ systems, including their kidneys.</p><p>There is another group of people who have had quite mild symptoms but who do not return to full health for a time.  It can take some weeks or months.  Their health status can mainly be characterised by fatigue, brain fog and those kinds of difficult-to-quantify symptoms.  Speaking as a paediatrician, the good news is that the risk of that kind of syndrome in children seems to be much lower and, for those who have it, it seems to last for eight to 12 weeks.  Some studies have been done on this matter in Italy and Germany and the data coming out from those have been reassuring.</p></speech>

I was interested in the paper from NIAC and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI, regarding the length of immunity.  I have a further question on it.  Professor Butler has already summarised the paper.  Like many people, I received my second vaccine dose in June, so six months for me will be around December.  Clearly, NIAC and the RCPI are constantly getting a great deal of data, some of it contradictory.  Those data are interesting to read.  The Israeli data were particularly interesting.  We are only getting a synopsis of it.  Is there anything that the paper left out?</p> <p>  My final question is for Dr. Holohan.  What can the State do to assist our front-line healthcare workers?  We hear various stories of them being in a state of exhaustion.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked whether we had left out anything.  If I gave the committee something today, I would probably have left something out by tomorrow because the data are evolving quickly.  The answer is "Yes".</p> <p>  There are conflicting data.  What we know is that antibody levels can decline over time, but we do not know how important which antibody level is in terms of protection from infection and whether the decline means everything in terms of protection.  Our immune system consists not just of those antibodies but also our cellular immune system.  The data coming out show that the immunity induced in the cellular immune system is much more long lived than that measured through antibodies.  The whole story is not out yet by any means.</p></speech>

There is a great deal of confusion about what level of vaccination is required to achieve herd immunity.  We have a large young population, many of whom, and certainly the under-12s, will not be getting the vaccine for some time.  The teenaged cohort is only being vaccinated now.  At what point would Dr. Holohan say that herd immunity will be achieved in the overall population?  What percentage is required?</p> <p>  My second question is on antigen testing.  Given the high level of vaccination and the requirement to get back to work and other activities, does Dr. Holohan see a role at this point for antigen testing as a screening tool?</p> <p>  My third question is on public health messaging.  Why is it that the issue of ventilation always seems to be an afterthought?</p><p>Reference has been made to reminding people about hand washing, but we do not seem to be talking about ventilation to the same extent.  Is that aspect not as important, if not more important?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#L00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Others may contributute regarding what I am going to say, but we do not have a percentage for herd immunity.  That is for the simple reason that the level of transmission of this virus and its responsiveness to the vaccines means that we will not get a high enough percentage in that context to control the disease on its own.  We will need other measures.  Even if we achieve high rates of vaccination, the vaccines are not perfect, far from it, in their ability to prevent transmission of the virus.  It is not possible for us to talk in terms of achieving herd immunity to this virus in the same way that we do with a disease such as measles.  If we achieve a level of 95% in that case, we know that the chances, in effect, of an unvaccinated person in the remaining 5% running into someone with measles will be very low.  In the context of this disease, however, we do not think that herd immunity is a concept that we should be talking about.  Our message in this case is that the further we can go and the higher we can get regarding the percentage of people vaccinated, the better we will be.  Equally, every individual vaccinated means better protection for him or her from the severe effects of this disease.  That is our basic message.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.77" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#L00400"><p>In the last round of the advice we gave, which was accepted, we identified five criteria that it would be important to satisfy before we could move on, if you like, in respect of our collective response to the vaccination programme.  By moving on, I do not just mean in the context of social and economic restrictions, but also in the evolution of our public health management and so on.  One criterion we identified, and which was accepted, was that the target for the vaccination rate should be 90% of the population of people over the age of 16.  That was the target which was set.  I already observed that we have reached a rate above 88%, which is really good news.  If there are still people out there, especially in the group aged 16 to 30, or in a position to influence individuals in that group, and I am sure there are, we need them to keep pushing on as much as possible.  The HSE has done a good job, but we must keep going.</p> <p>  Turning to the specifics concerning antigen testing, a significant review of its role in screening, conducted by HIQA, will be considered by NPHET tomorrow.  We of course see a role for antigen testing and we have always done so.  We are specific, however, regarding the circumstances in which we think the role of antigen testing has an evidence base to support its use.  We do not think that role exists now for its use as a screening test in asymptomatic situations.  </p> <p>  I will let Dr. Glynn address the issue of wider public health messaging.  If I am not mistaken, he mentioned ventilation during his initial remarks.  </p></speech>

As a word, it perhaps tends to get left aside.  However, when we have talked about elements of our response to the virus, such as having open windows in settings, the use of carbon dioxide monitors and people from different households travelling together in cars at different stages of the pandemic, the importance of ventilation and of there being a safer environment outside rather than inside has been a core part of our public health messaging.  It will increase in importance again now as we move into the autumn and winter months.  People will be inside more than outside during that time and the importance of ventilation in that context will increase.</p></speech>

I reiterate that there seems to have been a complete lack of emphasis placed on the importance of ventilation.  We have not been taking the advice of the expert groups in this regard.</p> <p>  I have some questions for Professor Butler.  The first concerns the issue of staff in nursing homes.  My understanding is that patient-facing staff in the HSE are required to be vaccinated.  Should we be seeking to have a similar requirement in the nursing home sector?  I refer to a requirement for all patient-facing staff in those settings to be vaccinated.  </p> <p>  Moving on to the issue of antibody testing, does Professor Butler see a role for such testing to assess waning immunity to the virus in certain categories of people?  </p></speech>

The problem is that we do not know which specific antibody is the most important.  It is probably not the anti-spike antibody with which people might be more familiar.  It might instead be the antibody against the binding domain.  In addition, however, we do not know what threshold signifies that people will be protected as against not being protected.</p></speech>

Moving on, some weeks ago the WHO issued a statement concerning the lack of uptake of vaccinations across parts of Europe.  That was in the context of an 11% increase in the number of deaths in the region, with a projection of around 230,000 deaths occurring by December.  Do the witnesses think that travel within the EU is now a significant risk factor in respect of suppressing the virus here, even given our high rate of vaccination?</p></speech>

Hopefully, we will make progress here in driving down the level of infection further.  It may well be the case that we will be enabled to travel to countries with higher levels of incidence of the virus and, if so, the basic public health messages that we will now be emphasising for the entire population will be relevant to people travelling internationally.  Travelling to other countries does not mean that people can go on holidays from all the protections they maintain at home.  When abroad, people must keep up their hand hygiene, continue to react to symptoms in keeping with the basic public health messages in that regard and maintain the basic practices of keeping out of indoor environments that they think might be risky, etc.  All those personal protective behaviours that we think of as being important here at home will also be important when people are travelling.</p></speech>

The recommendation already adopted and which the HSE is preparing to implement in respect of people who are immunocompromised and in need of an additional dose of a vaccine, as opposed to a booster shot, is that all these aspects will be part of the advice, guidance and informed consent procedures that the HSE has put in train.

Deputy Lahart asked what we would like to see in place.  The lessons we need to learn as a country from how we best do our public health management is to do our utmost to prevent transmission of this infection.  That is the best way we can protect the under pressure healthcare staff and allow them to do the job they are primarily there for, which is not to care for people who are sick as a consequence of this preventable infection.  In that context, we need to be responsive in picking up outbreaks at a very early stage-----</p></speech>

It will include testing of our wastewater system, which has the ability to pick up low levels of infection in the population.  It will include what is called our GP central surveillance system, which is a standing arrangement that exists for flu every winter, with 60 practices around the country that report their rates of influenza-like illness, ILI, and do some additional testing.  That is our early-warning system.</p> <p>  We think it might also be important for us to look at the possibility of doing some early access to testing for people in specific environments such as third level because of the nature of this infection.  Almost every wave we have experienced has initiated in that age group.  We think maybe some other forms of surveillance are needed, particularly of people who are attending emergency departments or are admitted to ICU, as well as a wider testing arrangement to support our clinical services, in other words, to help clinicians to determine, when it is necessary for them to do so, whether they are dealing with a case of influenza, Covid-19, respiratory syncytial virus, RSV, or something else.  It will be the sum total of all those kinds of requirements that will generate our need for ongoing PCR testing.  It will have a very different purpose and perhaps a different scale from the testing that we have been doing up to now.</p></speech>

In regard to Dr. Holohan's statement in relation to the future trajectory of this disease, we all know Covid-19 is evolving and unpredictable.  At what point in the trajectory of the disease, if it goes on an upward spiral, will measures be reintroduced?  What point do we need to reach in terms of the numbers of people in ICU or being hospitalised due to this disease?</p></speech>

We are going to express cautious optimism that that will remain the situation.  The scenarios that might arise and could give rise to those requirements will be potentially related to new variants and the emergence of challenges that, at the moment, we do not see any signs of in the international sphere.  What we have seen over the course of the past couple of months is the emergence of this highly transmissible Delta variant, which appears to have suppressed the spread of many of the other variants that had so-called vaccine escape potential, in other words, variants that vaccines were not as effective against.</p><p>Even though there was some impact with the Delta variant in terms of effectiveness of vaccines, it was not as great as perhaps with some of the other variants which were identified as variants of concern.  We have seen a suppression of those, because Delta has essentially taken over transmission in the world.  On the basis of our experience of Delta, and how we think things are going in this country, we think things at this point in time are going better than they are going in perhaps the four regions of the neighbouring country of the UK and it gives us a basis for expressing some cautious optimism that we will not need to go back the road in terms of some of these kinds of restrictions.  The two things that are going to influence that are the very high levels of vaccination that we have achieved, and maintaining that and, second, the extent to which the public keeps up compliance with the basic and simple - you could say bog standard - guidance that we have given in regard to social distancing, mask wearing, avoiding indoors and the importance of being aware of the circumstances in which transmission is likely to arise, and that is where the ventilation question comes in.  There was an extensive component in our last letter of advice dealing specifically with the question of ventilation - in the letter to the Minister-----</p></speech>

If the Deputy could have posed that question to me two years ago, before this all began, I never would have had, in my answer to any hypothetical question two years ago, the kinds of things that we found ourselves recommending to Government, to be closing retail, to be closing international travel, to be closing schools and universities and so on.  I never would have envisaged that even though I would have known that these things were theoretically possible.  If the Deputy had asked me this question two years ago as a hypothetical question as he is asking me now, it would not have featured in any way in my answer and yet all of these things have become part of his reality, my reality and everybody else's reality for the past 18 months.

My second question relates to the opening of schools and to children between the age of five and 12.  This question is to Professor Butler.  As we know, this disease has killed millions of people across the planet, and largely children of that age group have come through unscathed, in terms of death.  It has obviously disrupted everybody's lives across the planet.  Schools in this country have opened in the past two weeks.  How satisfied is Professor Butler about the protection of unvaccinated children in that age group?  Has she confidence in regard to the measures which the Government has taken thus far?</p></speech>

Studies are ongoing which are looking at what dose might be necessary and, indeed, whether it is needed for children.  From NIAC's perspective, we have no recommendations in terms of vaccination for children.  From the general public health perspective, I am sure Dr. Glynn or Dr. Holohan might want to speak to that.  On what has been done in our schools, the school systems have really taken on board the need to keep that environment a safe one for children.  To a certain extent, we are very fortunate.  This infection has been different from many other infections in that when children acquire infection - it still remains the case, even with the Delta variant - it is for the majority of them a mild infection and, in fact, that may contribute to their overall immunity ongoing.  From NIAC's perspective, there is no recommendation regarding vaccination for children at this time.</p></speech>

Why is it the case that children have come through largely unscathed by this terrible disease?</p></speech>

It may be to do with their immune system and its ability either to tolerate this virus and not get the kind of hyper-inflammatory system that we have seen in some of the adults later on.  It is a key question to be answered generally, but one of the things that we see very often with a coronavirus is that children get it and have very mild illnesses and then, as adults, are not troubled by it later on.</p></speech>

It has been a difficult time for everyone.</p> <p>  A letter was sent to the Minister on 25 August setting out the likelihood of the number of people contracting the virus over the next number of months.  It set out peaks.  I wonder about the increase in numbers.  Over the past week or so all universities have returned.  Approximately 220,000 students are moving from home or work back into third level.  In respect of the peak, do we expect this will be a contributory factor?  At what stage do we think this will start to play out?  How do we work towards trying to reduce the number of people contracting the virus over the next three to four weeks?  A large number of people are moving within a very short timescale.</p></speech>

We have gone from 100 cases per 100,000 people per day in early August in that age group to below 40 cases.  There has been a 60% reduction in the incidence in the university going cohort.  That is allied with mitigation measures that universities have put in place around reducing crowding, mask wearing in the vast majority of indoor settings and the installation of CO2 monitors to ensure adequate ventilation.  We have modelled scenarios where things might go wrong.  Based on what we have seen over the last period of time, we would not expect a significant wave of disease as that group of students returns to third level.  The situation will have to be monitored.</p> <p>  To broaden the discussion, last year when we opened schools the demand for testing tripled and the incidence went up about 50%.  In the past two weeks as we have opened schools again from a higher base demand for testing has tripled.  We are now testing close to 1% of the primary school going age cohort every day.  That is good and prudent.  It means that if there is any resurgence or surge in disease in that age cohort we will see that.  The threefold increase in testing is again translating into about a 50% increase in detection.  There may have been infections that were out there during the summer.  In other words, we may now be detecting cases the equivalents of which, with lower testing during the summer, we were not detecting in July and August.</p> <p>  I want to make a final point on mitigation measures in third level and schools.  There is a great deal of discussion about the balance between ventilation, mask wearing, hand hygiene and so on.  It is really important to state that even though people may say they think aerosol transmission is more important than other modes of transition and, therefore, ventilation is as or more important, we simply do not have the evidence to back that up.  We know that the virus is transmitted by some mix of direct contact, short range droplet and aerosol transmission where we are close to each other and literally spraying those droplets at each other, long range aerosol transmission and surfaces.  Even though we know surfaces probably do not matter much, we simply do not know the balance between the others.  Our public health doctors tell us it is usually close contact. </p> <p>  It is very important that in the public health messaging we get the balance right.  Hand and respiratory hygiene, physical distancing and mask wearing and ventilation remain important, but there is no way of knowing which of those is more important so we need to-----</p></speech>

Does he think that the worst possible scenario is not likely to happen, given the information he outlined on the third level sector?  On the number of people aged between 16 and 29 years who have received one vaccine, do we have any idea of the total number who have received both doses?</p></speech>

Dr. Glynn might answer the question on vaccination.  We model a range of scenarios, in order to be prudent, from what we call conservative or optimistic out to pessimistic.  In advising Government recently, we had evidence that we were more likely to track the optimistic scenarios.  The basis for that optimism is the very high levels of vaccination and the fact that, if we look at the population in general, even though we are getting back towards normal, people are still being very prudent in terms of their observation of the basic measures, such as handwashing, hygiene and ventilation.  On that basis, it is plausible that we are past the peak of infection in this population.  The most optimistic scenario shows the peak having happened in the past week of August and first week of September and case numbers starting to decline from there.  That seems to be what is happening at present.</p></speech>

The emphasis in that situation has to be to ensure that all staff are vaccinated and facilitated in whatever way possible to become vaccinated.  In studies that have been done, the antibody levels in staff are very different from those in nursing home residents.</p> <p>  The other consideration is that we have to be mindful that the vaccines are a scarce resource and that, in using them, there are three things that we have to be happy about, namely, that a third dose is safe, that it is actually needed and that it will achieve what we set out to do.  In terms of healthcare workers, that is a group that we are keeping under consideration because of their particular role.  As yet, the evidence has not supported a need for a third dose in that group for those who are already vaccinated.</p></speech>

My first question will circle back to children and the idea of mask mandates.  As has been said, there will not be a recommendation around vaccination for children.  It was inevitable that there would be an enormous number of children being tested and in and out of school.  Dr. Butler said that infection can build immunity.  How can we marry those things?  I have heard commentary to the effect that if children get Covid, it is not as serious and the evidence would imply that it could, perhaps, boost their immunity.</p><p>How do we marry the two?  We have children who are being sent home and who cannot go to school.  The restrictions are quite hefty in school settings.  Obviously, school settings have more than just children in them; there are teachers, special needs assistants, clerical staff, janitors and so on.  We are being contacted by lots of parents whose children are just not in school.  How do we tie those two together?  How do we speak to parents about this because there is a great deal of concern out there?  I ask Professor Butler to provide a little clarity on that.</p></speech>

Am I saying that it is a good thing for children to get this infection, akin to the chicken pox parties that people talked about?  No, I am definitely not saying that.  The onus on us is to protect our children from this infection because while most children, thankfully, have a mild illness and do not suffer consequences, there is the potential for significant illness and for the post-Covid inflammatory syndrome that some children experience.  When we talked about it earlier, one of the Deputies referred to the numbers and the fact that, thankfully, there were as few as 30 children in ICUs related to Covid since the beginning of the pandemic and only eight of them were PCR-positive at the time, with acute infection.  The others were there related to the inflammatory syndrome.  Covid is not something that one wants to expose one's children to.  The whole point is to reduce the force of infection in the community and having those people around the children vaccinated and protected so that children do not acquire infection.</p></speech>

I thank Professor Butler for that.</p> <p>  On ventilation in schools, there has been a delay in providing ventilation equipment because of a fault in the units.  Is there any concern that this will have a knock-on impact?  The article I read suggested that the equipment will all be in by next week.  Is there any concern around that ventilation equipment or are we just hoping that everything will work out?</p> <p>  There has been much talk about the ethics around second, third and booster doses of vaccines when many developing countries are still waiting desperately for vaccines.  Professor Butler has said that we must make sure that booster shots are safe and actually needed.  Has there been any conversation about booster shots for particular vaccine types?  I have friends in Iceland, for example, who got the Janssen vaccine initially and who have already been given a booster vaccine.  Is there any conversation around the different types of vaccine people received and the booster or is that just too complicated?</p></speech>

What we know is that the use of heterologous vaccines, that is, using a different vaccine for a second or even third dose, actually produces a good immune response.  There is some emerging data to show that if a person is given an RNA vaccine in the beginning and is then given a viral vector vaccine like the Janssen vaccine, that can also produce a good response.  It does seem that we are gathering enough data to say that from an immune response point of view, if vaccines are mixed in that way people can get a good immune boost.  Then it comes down to working out the best way and that data is coming out now.  There should be more data available within the next week from studies that are going on in the UK, but for now we are happy to use an RNA vaccine to boost those whom we have said will need a booster, irrespective of whether they have had a viral vector or RNA vaccine.</p></speech>

I hope everyone can hear me.  I will start by thanking the witnesses for the phenomenal work they have all been doing for the past year and a half.  I can only imagine how difficult it must have been at some points in the course of the pandemic.  My first question relates to something Senator Hoey mentioned.  In their submission the witnesses reference additional or booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines as a way of protecting people against resistant variants, especially those who are severely immunocompromised.  How do we reconcile the need for boosters with the limited global supplies of vaccines?  Do the witnesses think that without global co-operation we are prolonging this threat?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.146" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#S00200"><p>Professor Butler might want to comment on this but our role is to provide advice and guidance to the Irish Government, through our Minister, around decisions that get taken in the best interests of the Irish population.  Obviously that is the role that we carry out and we take seriously and so on.  On the point the Senator is making in terms of the global situation, of course we understand the nature of infectious diseases in a global context.  Until we achieve global control of this disease there is still going to be a risk to every part of the globe, and that remains the case, including the emergence of variants.  In particular, we are concerned about some of the progress that has not been made in some wealthier countries, where vaccination uptake has not been as good as it has been here.  It is a bit like a person half-completing a course of antibiotics, which increases the risk of the emergence of resistance.  The issue of a half-vaccinated population presents a particular challenge because it is not going to suppress infection and is going to continue to offer an opportunity to, and perhaps select out, those viral strains that have a competitive advantage in terms of vaccine escape.  We are concerned about all of those kinds of issues but our role and responsibility, in the context of all of that, is to give advice and guidance on how we maximise protection of the Irish population.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.148" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#S00400"><p>In a word, "yes".  We think we are not far away from a point whereby all of the criteria we set out in the advice we provided to the Government, which is accepted as the basis upon which we might consider moving to another phase in terms of our management of the pandemic, are met.  That was the basis, ultimately, on which we advised Government and the Government then identified a series of dates for easing of certain restrictions.  For example, next Monday some of the measures relating to the workplace will kick in and a final date of 22 October has been identified.  We think we are not far away from the point of achieving those criteria which, on the one hand will look at our vaccination uptake rate.  We have a target of 90% for the over 16s which we are very close to at this point, which is almost unprecedented in comparison to many other countries.  We also look at the features of the disease and its behaviour, having the disease doing what we want it to do and we see a lot of encouraging trends at the moment in terms of the downward incidence in some of the age groups.  We want to see that continue and will monitor the impact of the return to school and some of the other measures that were eased in the early part of September before we will be in a position to advise in relation to the criteria moving on.  However, we are optimistic that we are close to that point.</p> <p>  At that point, we will change utterly the environment in which we consider testing.  Heretofore we were testing every single case and were advising every single individual who had symptoms to contact a GP to arrange a test.  We provided walk-in testing facilities and online facilities for people to book tests and so on.  We will have to evolve our management of the pandemic because of our success in achieving all of these indicators to one whereby we test to support clinical decision making, that is, to support doctors in clinical situations who need to determine whether a sick patient is sick because of influenza or because of Covid-19 because that could influence the management of that patient and also for monitoring purposes or what we call surveillance.  That will be based on our primary care surveillance system, the surveillance of things like waste water and maybe some other forms of surveillance in the third level sector, as mentioned previously, and in those environments where we have particularly sick and vulnerable people.</p><p>It is a different form of testing and for a very different purpose.  Our contact tracing arrangements and the wider parts of our public health management are evolving to reflect a situation where we now have a population which we have to regard as being as protected as it can be through vaccination and the huge effort that has been made to get as many people vaccinated as possible.  It is still our hope and expectation that the small remaining numbers of people who remain to be vaccinated will come forward for vaccination.  Looking at the entire population, even though we have done as well we have, between 1 million and 1.5 million people are not vaccinated, either because they are children or people who have not come forward for vaccination.  There is still time.  There is still capacity to deliver vaccines on the part of the HSE.  If there are individuals out there or people who have influence over individuals who are not yet vaccinated, getting vaccinated is still the most important thing that an individual can do.</p></speech>

I have one final question.  As a committee, we heard from a group of medical experts about the importance of vitamin D.  As mentioned by Deputy Shortall, we also met with a group on the issue of ventilation.  Are these issues that NPHET might consider highlighting in its public messaging campaign?  I am delighted to hear that there will be another public messaging communications campaign.  Dr. Holohan has already commented on ventilation, but I would welcome his thoughts on vitamin D and its importance going forward.</p></speech>

On vitamin D, leaving aside Covid and the different views in regard to Covid and vitamin D, what I can say for certain is that a significant proportion of our adult population in this country are vitamin D deficient.  Even if Covid had never come along, we should be encouraging people to get adequate levels of vitamin D, particularly as we move into autumn and winter.  That should be a component of our public health messaging more generally, and regardless of Covid, over the coming months.</p></speech>

Does NPHET believe that now is the right time to wind up self-referral testing centres given that over 21,000 people applied for testing in one day - Monday last - which is the highest one-day number since the pandemic started?  I will try to get responses to as many of the Deputies' questions as I can.  If there is insufficient time to get answers to all of them today, I ask that the witnesses respond to them in writing to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.155" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#T00700"><p>As already stated, a significant component of the testing we are seeing at the moment is driven by the very sharp increase in testing of schoolchildren, which we have seen at previous stages in the pandemic.  In response to the question, today is not the day but we think we are not far away from the point at which those criteria have been met, whereby we are thinking of changing the regime of testing along the lines I have previously described - in the interests of time, I will not describe it again - and also changing the purpose of it.  We are in the happy situation that we have such high levels of vaccination, and of all of the other criteria being satisfied that enable us to have the confidence to say that we change our public health management.  That is not the same - it is important to point this out - as promising that this disease, which will be with us, will not continue to cause a challenge for individuals who pick it up and will end up having severe infection and being admitted to hospital and ICU.  We will see some mortality.  That will be a continuing feature of our management of the disease, as well as outbreaks in some settings, particularly where those settings involved the gathering of large numbers of unvaccinated people.  Vaccination still is the message, in spite of the very high levels we have already achieved.</p></speech>

What age profile are we seeing being tested and testing positive?</p></speech>

It is the 5 to 12 years age group in which principally we have seen a very significant change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.158" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#T01000"><p>Principally, the testing of children under four has trebled, with almost no increase in cases detected.  The testing in children aged 5 to 12 has trebled, with, as I said, about a 50% increase in cases detected.  That may simply be increased ascertainment.  In other words, it is not an increase in incidence, but that more cases are being found because of the high level of testing.  We will see that in the next couple of weeks.  The demand for testing is declining in almost all other age groups.</p><p>In those age groups, it is being driven by people developing symptoms and coming forward for testing, whereas in the younger age group, it is being driven by concern about contacts and those asymptomatic contacts coming forward for testing.  This phenomenon is usually transient.  Not only is there consideration about how policy might change in the coming weeks, but human behaviour will change in the coming weeks as people become less concerned about the impact of schools opening.  That is what we saw before.</p></speech>

When we think the criteria are satisfied - as I said, we are not very far away from that point - we will not continue to emphasise the importance of all individuals with symptoms being tested.  It will be more about individuals who, on clinical grounds, a doctor believes it is important to understand what the nature of their symptoms is caused by.  We expect that to be a far smaller volume of testing for clinical purposes, with the test essentially being ordered by a doctor as opposed to an individual.  We are not at the point yet where we think that change can be made, but we think we are close to it.</p></speech>

At very high levels of vaccination, it is not surprising to find that about half of the cases are in vaccinated people.  What that tells us is that we are only seeing the tip of an infection iceberg, that for every infection you see in a vaccinated person the vaccines are preventing seven, eight or nine infections in other people.  The unfortunate thing about that statistic is what you are not seeing is the infections that have been prevented in the vaccinated people, but you are seeing the modest number of breakthrough infections in the vaccinated people and in a similar number of infections in unvaccinated people.  Further, when you look at the numbers admitted to intensive care or, sadly, the numbers dying, they remain quite radically different.  The significance of an infection in a highly vaccinated population is different because that infection is significantly less likely to progress to severe disease and very much less likely to result in a death, particularly in the healthier and younger part of the vaccinated population.  In no way should that statistic erode confidence in the vaccination programme.  We should constantly be reminding ourselves of the huge numbers of infections that vaccination is preventing and the huge numbers of hospitalisations and deaths that vaccination is preventing in those people who are vaccinated.</p></speech>

There are one or two slides that show how we compare to both the neighbouring regions of the UK and the rest of Europe in terms of our current incidence.  That might be able to illustrate where we stand in relative terms.  I know time will not allow us to go through the slide deck fully but we can make it available to members of the committee.  With some of the slides it is a case of a picture being worth a thousand words.  It is much easier to show and demonstrate how we are doing and what we are keeping a track of as compared with other countries by showing the committee some of those graphs, if we have time for that.</p></speech>

That has been scheduled to roll out with the recommendations for the usual groups to be vaccinated.  The modifications this year are that the Covid-19 vaccine can be given at the same visit as the seasonal flu vaccine, or separated from it by any interval, and the only other modification to the programme is that an adjuvanted influenza vaccine is being recommended for those 65 years and older because it is shown to have increased protective effect in those age groups.  The seasonal flu vaccine plan is to start and the good thing is that hopefully combining the vaccines - not combining them together but administering them on the same day - might optimise the roll-out of the vaccines together, for example, in nursing home facilities with the booster shots.</p></speech>

From the witnesses' observations, how is the population's natural immunity building up and resisting the virus?  Is it in accordance with expectations or is it short of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.174" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#V00700"><p>I will again defer to Professor Butler's expertise as an infectious disease expert on that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.175" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Karina Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#V00800"><p>The answer to that is in the decline in numbers of hospitalisations and in severe illness and death.  That is the far end of the wedge but it shows that the vaccine programme is working and that people are developing protection against severe illness and death, which was the target of the vaccination programme.  Public Health England did antibody testing throughout the population and data just released within the last week show that about 90% of the population there have some level of antibodies, either from natural infection or from vaccination.  With our very high vaccination rates we can assume that, at least in our adult population, we are reaching levels of immunity and protection against severe illness and death as was hoped for.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, many front-line workers paid the ultimate price for being on the front line and we extend our sympathies to them and their families.  A number of front-line workers have also reacted to the vaccines.  All vaccines have a potential for reaction, some greater or lesser than others.</p><p>How do we deal with a situation whereby a front-line worker has had one dose of the vaccine and is warned not to have another by medical practitioners and experts?   How is that being dealt with?  What do such people do?  Do they continue on or do they exit from the front line?  What is the advice?  Can we be sure that they are not in any way penalised for being in that category of people who react to the vaccine?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Karina Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#W00200"><p>One of the good things about this programme is that we have more than one type of vaccine.  Fortunately, reactions seem to be type-specific.  For example, people will be familiar with the RNA vaccines and the allergic reactions to them.  If they have had reactions to such vaccines, they can have a different type of vaccine.  Similarly, with the AstraZeneca vaccine, if someone has had an adverse outcome related to that then it is possible to get an RNA vaccine to complete the vaccination.  There is a much larger group who have thought they have had an allergic reaction and while we have not been directly involved with this issue, I am certainly familiar with it.  The HSE has done an amazing job.  It set up special clinics for those who thought they had an allergic reaction with supervision, if it was still deemed appropriate for them to get that reaction, to enable them to become vaccinated.  A lot of work had been done by the allergy group, together with NIAC and others, to get good information for those who think they might be allergic to vaccines and to overcome it.  A number of steps have been taken.  There are always some people who will not respond to vaccines and for those people, the onus is on us to continue to drive the force of infection down in the community and to continue our public health measures to protect them.</p></speech>

We will be short of time but we will try to accommodate everyone.  I call Deputy Cathal Crowe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.180" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#W00400"><p>I thank NPHET for coming before the committee this morning.  I also thank the witnesses for all the work both NPHET and NIAC have done over the past 18 months and continue to do.  We are in a pretty good place relative to where we were at the start of this year and in springtime.  I have a number of questions.  My first question, for Professor Butler, is about vaccines that are outside the big three that the EMA has approved, such as the likes of Sinopharm, which a lot of people who lived in Asia and the Middle East have been vaccinated with.  Is there any word coming from the European Medicines Agency, or from NIAC here in Ireland, on accepting the bona fides of Sinopharm and determining that those who have been vaccinated in Dubai, Qatar and other places, who have now come back to Ireland, are vaccinated and that that vaccine is deemed to be safe, with the same bona fides as Pfizer, Janssen etc., and would qualify for digital Covid certification?</p></speech>

At the moment, the vaccines that are recognised as regards ensuring that someone is fully vaccinated are those that are licensed by the EMA, the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, in the US and the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, MHRA.  That is where we will get our guidance.  There are other vaccines under rolling review in the EMA including, for example, the Sputnik vaccine and we will be guided and take advice from there.</p></speech>

The first relates to school buses.  NPHET advice and Government policy is that school buses can carry 50% capacity.  Yet, all forms of public transport are now gone back up to 100% capacity.  I travelled to the D&aacute;il this morning on Irish Rail and there were a lot of people travelling on the train.  That is good to see but it is hugely frustrating and largely inoperable in rural areas to have only half capacity on school buses.</p><p>I wonder where that thinking came from and when NPHET would expect to review it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#X00200"><p>We would not have given specific advice in regard to the return to full capacity on public transport, and that was a Government decision.  Obviously, all of these things remain under ongoing review and, clearly, again, as part of our ongoing look at data specifically around the return to education over this number of weeks, we are considering all of these issues.  Again, as per the CMO's comments earlier, we would hope to see a transition across a range of measures, albeit ensuring that the basic preventative measures remain in place through the autumn and winter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#X00300"><p>I take it this can work quite well in Dublin, where a teenager can hop on their local Dublin Bus service and make their way to school and home again in the afternoon.  It is quite different in a rural county like Clare, however, where the local school bus might be bringing children on a 10 km or 12 km journey each day.  Many of them are in the same bubble when they go to the school environment, so it is proving inoperable.  I hope that it will remain under urgent review because we have had two chaotic weeks of the school year so far.</p> <p>  My final question to Dr. Glynn relates to international travel.  We have had a pretty good six or seven weeks of international travel, I would say, and I say that as someone who is watching this through the aviation lens and the international travel lens.  From a public health point of view, has it been as successful as I consider it to be, or can more be done?</p> <p>  Has NPHET spoken with any of its counterparts?  I know it often speaks with colleagues across Europe but has it spoken with people in North America?  It concerns me that there are still very significant restrictions in terms of Irish people travelling to the United States.  I wonder has NPHET any dialogue open with counterparts in the United States in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.186" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#X00400"><p>I will come in on that point.  We have not had a specific discussion on that.  I take it the Deputy is implying the idea that we would advocate that Irish people would be exempted from the restrictions that the United States has in place in terms of its own travel arrangements.  No, we have not done that.  What we continue to do is to co-operate in line with all of the European agreements in regard to travel.  In broad terms, travel has gone well in this country.  When I say that, I am talking about the provisions that were put in place specifically to try to mitigate and manage down, as much as we reasonably could, the level of importation of the virus.  We had mandatory hotel quarantine arrangements in place and, as the Deputy is aware, we provide ongoing advice to the Minister based on an ongoing assessment.  That now relies on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control assessment around threats coming from other European countries, as well as what we call annex one countries, or countries that we regard as having low enough incidence for us to consider them as being equivalent, or we could look at it in those terms, in order to make those assessments as to which of those countries should be the subject of mandatory hotel quarantine or any other provisions in regard to international travel.  We think our reliance on that as a measure will decrease over time, which should be good news because, in broad terms, much of the world is now experiencing the same.  Whatever about the level of incidence, that incidence is being driven by the same variant that we are currently dealing with, and that has had an effect in terms of the nature and the relative import of different regimes in different countries at a different point.</p> <p>  We are always going to have to be mindful, as we travel individually, of what we can then do to both assess the risks that we subject ourselves to or are going to be exposed to, and how we can best then try to prevent those.  The airlines have done a great job in terms of trying to ensure that the process of travel - in other words, transmission while people are travelling - is minimised as much as possible and then, beyond that, it is for the individual to make the assessments in terms of social, business or other engagements they have, in the same way they should do if they were at home.</p> <p>  In broad terms, Europe is experiencing a significant challenge in terms of the level of infection that it is experiencing.  We experienced it in western Europe maybe ahead of other parts of the rest of Europe but we think that, heretofore, those arrangements that we had in place to try to minimise the importation of the disease had an important role to play and will continue to heighten and maintain high levels of understanding on the part of the public around the risks that arise to them as they travel internationally in regard to this disease.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the high levels of disease in Northern Ireland.  Has NPHET been monitoring the situation in Northern Ireland from the perspective of the Border counties and has it particular concerns about our Border counties?  Does Dr. Holohan envisage there is a greater threat of regional lockdown in the Border counties because of the high levels of infection in Northern Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#Y00200"><p>I would say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the last question in regard to regional lockdowns.  On its own merits, that is not in our planning at this point in time.  In a more general sense, obviously, we share the concerns that the Northern Ireland authorities themselves have about the very high levels of infection. As things stand, and members will see this in some of the graphs we have circulated, we have incidence in the last seven days in Northern Ireland of 535 per 100,000 as compared to 190 here, so it is heading for threefold the level of infections we have had here, and they have been persistently higher than us, going right back to the middle of June.  The experience we have had in Ireland of this so-called fourth wave is a much lower level of incidence right the way through than in every other part of the three countries that make up Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but particularly Northern Ireland, and they continue to experience the high impact of that in terms of hospitalisations.</p> <p>  We have a regular arrangement where my colleague, Michael McBride, and his team and I now sit down every fortnight to review the disease and to look in particular at some of these Border issues.  There is no doubt that, at least in part, the persistent high incidence we have seen in the counties of Monaghan, Donegal in particular, Cavan and, from time to time, some of the other Border counties like Louth, particularly over the last two to three months, is much closer to the incidence that Northern Ireland is experiencing than the experience of the rest of the Republic of Ireland.  That has been a particular challenge for people who live in those Border counties.</p> <p>  That is not to say that all of that can be explained by the infection, if I can put it in these terms, spilling over the Border.  There is a lot of mobility between certain parts of some of those counties and Northern Ireland.  It may also be the case that similar social circumstances that lead to spread and transmission in Northern Ireland apply in some of those counties as well, so it will be a mix of those kinds of reasons.  There is no question but that the Border counties of Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan have experienced a very significant challenge, with high levels of infection that reflects much more what has been happening in Northern Ireland than what has been happening in the rest of the Republic, where our disease experience has been much better than any part of the UK.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.193" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021091500002#Y00500"><p>It is not a question but a comment, so the witnesses will be delighted to hear they can relax after their long session.  We are very grateful.  The first Covid case in Ireland arrived on 29 February last year, and it seems like eons ago.  It was a very significant turning point.  I feel a little emotional thinking about it and I cannot imagine how Dr. Holohan and his team felt.  It seems now that, without being complacent or taking anything remotely for granted, but in a guarded way, that we are in a phase of emergence and are coming out of the emergency.  While I do not want to be so bold as to speak for the committee, I know I do speak for the committee and for many Irish people.  We discovered in that time that through NPHET, NIAC, the HSE and the other statutory agencies, volunteers, the Defence Forces, garda&iacute;, nurses, teachers, retail staff, emergency staff and all of those associated with every phase of this, and who continue to be associated with every phase of this, that Ireland had a resilient, independent and, most importantly, scientifically grounded team that stood its ground when it needed to stand its ground, and yielded when the evidence suggested that yielding was appropriate.  I want to thank Dr. Holohan personally and all of those who work for him on behalf of the constituents I represent, and particularly those who endured seen and no doubt unseen sacrifices during that time, for the amount of hours that they invested in this whole endeavour on behalf of the State, as they continue to do and will continue to do.  I thank them for their fortitude, their resilience, their consistency and their dedication to the task.</p><p>Irish people will know that if, God forbid, we entered an emergency phase again, we have exactly the right personnel to guide us through; that there is no need to fear and that we know so much.  The country owes the witnesses an incalculable debt, for which we are grateful.  We have never met them personally and I look forward to that opportunity, perhaps in a social context which is now allowed, to express our thanks on a one-to-one basis.  It has always been on a screen.  I thank the witnesses, on behalf of the people I represent.  Our debt to them is incalculable.  I ask them to keep up their good work.  I hope they get a chance to recharge their batteries from time to time.  I imagine they and their teams are exhausted, but they carry the best wishes of all Irish people.</p></speech>

The role the witnesses had to play was very often a lonely path to which they stuck despite criticisms and adverse "expert" opinion, of which there was much.  As Deputy Lahart said, the witnesses continued to stick to their ground in the public interest and the interest of the health of the nation.  They did extremely well.  That was a lonely road at times.  I was part of the Covid committee.  We met with many of the witnesses during that period and we listened to the comments.  We also have to recognise the people who were supportive, helped the witnesses and stood by them in difficult times.  We also have to remember the frontline people who lost their lives and those who continue to risk their lives and well-being in the course of their work.  There were many of them.  We have gone over the number of casualties in the country of whom there are more than 5,000 already.  There were those who were cynical in the beginning and said this was only a flu and would pass over.  Well, that was not true.  Of course.  To each and all of the witnesses, both here and outside, we have to thank them for their sacrifices and dedication.  As Deputy Lahart said, we hope they have an opportunity to take time out and recover from it.</p> <p>  That concludes the business for this morning.

Broadband is top of the agenda for many people, particularly in rural areas.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus should note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-the Convention Centre Dublin.  Hopefully, we will not return to the latter at any stage.  It is great to back in Leinster House.  Reluctantly I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any members contributing via Microsoft Teams to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely and only I, as Chairman, and the necessary staff essential for the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask for everyone's forbearance should any technical issues arise.  </p> <p>  I now invite Mr. Hendrick to make an opening statement on behalf of NBI.  As our meeting is limited to two hours, Mr. Hendrick has only five minutes to make his opening statement.  We are anxious to ask questions and have a discussion on the issues as quickly as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.202" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hendrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021091500002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to discuss the national broadband plan.  I am Peter Hendrick, CEO at NBI, and I am joined by Mr. T.J. Malone, who is CEO of NBI deployment and leads the team building the NBI network, and by Ms Tara Collins, our chief marketing officer who oversees all stakeholder and community relations.</p> <p>  Speaking on behalf of Mr. Malone and Ms Collins, who had the opportunity to meet committee members in person out in the field in recent weeks, it has been a pleasure to present first-hand how the NBI network is being deployed.  I hope these sessions have been informative and helpful as it is always hard to convey the size, scale and complexity of the NBP without this context.</p><p>For this reason, there remains an open invitation to all committee members to experience the work of our teams out in the field.</p><p> I thought it might be helpful if I started by providing the committee with an update on NBI&rsquo;s progress.  Our teams have now scaled, with construction active across all 26 counties and over 1,000 people hired, onboarded and working on the project.  That includes our key sub-contractors Actavo, Entegro, Indigo, KN Group, Secto and TLI.  We are also working with infrastructure operators such as Open Eir and Enet.  I would like to acknowledge all the hard work that has been done by everyone involved to date, and the collective commitment to bring high-speed broadband to those that need it most.  Across the project there have been major achievements, despite operating for 19 out of 21 months in an environment where Covid-19 has caused unprecedented disruption.  More than 251,000 premises have been surveyed, of which in excess of 221,000 are designed or are in detailed design.  These activities are a vital precursor and are continuing at pace.  It is the survey and design activities that are creating the pipeline for the build works and, ultimately, for premises to be passed.  Right now, there are more than 108,000 premises under construction with works under way.  More than 20,000 premises are currently able to place an order via their preferred retail service provider.  I am happy to say that, as of this morning, that number has increased to 23,000, with the release of almost 3,000 premises in Dundalk.  This will rise to 60,000 premises from December.</p><p> Since the commencement of the project, there have also been other major achievements outside of the fibre to the home programme build.  Some 371 broadband connection points, BCPs, including in schools, have been installed by NBI.  With respect to the BCP programme, NBI met its contractual obligations for 2020 in full.  Already, the BCP project is having a major impact and will be even more vital as we move into a post-pandemic Ireland.  They will facilitate remote working by putting connectivity into the heart of communities in advance of the fibre to the premises roll-out.  With BCPs and schools, it is important to recognise that, taken together, we are building a network of over 900 strategic connection points for community use by the end of 2023.  We are making progress on the schools programme, with 140 delivered by NBI.  We have already announced our commitment to accelerate installations for primary schools in the intervention area.  Originally, many of these schools could have been waiting up to seven years.  We are delighted to be able to bring this forward and bring next-generation broadband to the next generation.  We have also increased our minimum speeds from 150 Mbps to offer 500 Mbps as the minimum.</p><p> As the CEO of NBI, I am incredibly proud of the work that our team has delivered, particularly among the turbulent conditions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The impact of Covid-19 has resulted in the need to introduce extensive mitigation strategies and re-baseline original roll-out targets.  Obviously, the original volume projections were conceived pre Covid, and could never have predicted or accounted for the operational environment created by the global pandemic.  If we cast our minds back to the end of last year and the beginning of 2021, which was when NBI was scaling construction work and moving into the final stages of construction for the first deployment areas, there was a sudden and significant increase in Covid-19 cases.  The number of active Covid-19 cases increased from 15,000 to 17,000, which was already the highest since March 2020, and then proceeded to hit more than 100,000 active cases by January last.  To provide the committee with some context to this disruption to our construction programme, during this second wave of Covid-19 from December 2020 to March 2021 one of our major contractors faced having 40% of its total workforce unable to work at a given time due to Covid-19 cases or personnel being close contacts of confirmed cases.  The extreme number of Covid-19 cases at the start of 2021 made it impossible to predict certain elements of the roll-out progress during that period and added significant risk to the programme.  This was not just a factor felt by NBI; the pressure was also felt by every one of our subcontractors and other partners.  During this second wave, the impact was arguably felt more severely than the first wave due to where we were at in our mobilisation plan.  The impact of this disruption meant that by April 2021, we had to re-baseline the plan for 2021, targeting 60,000 premises for year end.</p><p> The team is as frustrated as anyone with the fact that the pandemic has disrupted our original plans.  The principal objective on which our entire team remains focused is delivering high-speed broadband to homes, farms, schools and businesses as quickly as possible.</p><p>As we head into 2022, this will mean finding ways to recover delays to the programme and increase the volume of our completions.  In fact, in areas where we were affected by Covid-19, such as surveying, we have already recovered and are ahead of the plan.  To underpin all of this, we have contracted with Open Eir to increase the volume of pole replacement and duct repair commencing from 1 October 2021.  We have also been working closely with our many tree-trimming contractors to significantly increase the volume of their work, as completion of these two areas of work is required before we can begin to install the NBI network.</p><p> I assure the committee that the management team of NBI and our board and shareholders are very positively disposed to bringing forward the overall completion of the project, a goal that we believe is achievable.  This principally involves bringing forward the completion timescales for premises currently scheduled to be passed in years 2025 and 2026.  Extensive work is already under way, which includes the procurement of additional contractor resources to commence in the fourth quarter of this year to meet the increased output of the Eir &ldquo;make ready&rdquo; programme.  Other operational efficiencies and experiences gathered from the initial deployment areas can be industrialised to assist with project acceleration, as can the new section 254 licensing processes with the support of local authorities.  These plans to catch up and ultimately bring forward completion of the roll-out will continue to mature over the coming six to nine months.</p><p> I would also like to provide an update on some specific matters that have been progressed further to requests from the committee.  First, with regard to premises in the amber area that are located adjacent to commercial operators' networks in the blue area of the map, NBI is consulting with the market, via a tender process, to identify alternative wholesale solutions.  If suitable solutions are identified, they will be provided by third-party operators but would be provisioned, activated and assured by NBI and would be subject to the same contractual service-level agreements, SLAs, as the rest of the NBI Network.  The pre-qualification process has been completed for this and we are moving to the next stage of the tender process.  We expect frameworks to be in place by the end of the year with pilot implementations to be done during the first quarter of 2022.</p><p> Second, we are acutely aware for the need to engage with, communicate with and inform all stakeholders.  Central to our marketing activities are two core themes, namely, addressing any information deficit and managing the expectations of end users.  A range of marketing, communications and stakeholder engagement initiatives are being deployed, such as targeted door drops, e-zine updates, local press releases, local advertising, our social media channels, in-person information events and county council presentations, to name a few.  Specific to the website, NBI&rsquo;s website is an always-on development and its evolution is built with best-in-class user experience principles, based on research, experience and testing.  In particular, recent focus has been on a simplified menu structure and site navigation; simplified frequently asked questions, FAQ, categorisation to make information easier to find; increased use of graphics and iconography; animated videos to explain and demystify some topics; and a new interactive roll-out map displaying anticipated roll-out date ranges for all end users.  We also operate a contact centre with dedicated communication channels to assist with queries from end users and political stakeholders.  The team strives to provide seamless experiences across all touch points, which includes phone, email and social networks.  The role of the contact centre is to provide information on the roll-out of the programme and to register stakeholders for email updates, so that we can keep them informed as the programme progresses and share updates specific to their premises.</p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s NBP is part of a much broader pathway set out by the European Commission to ensure every household has access to high-speed broadband by 2025 and gigabit connectivity for all by 2030.  Commercial investments from Eir, Siro and Virgin Media, as well NBI&rsquo;s deployment to 544,000 premises, is placing Ireland at the forefront of European nations in terms of providing high-speed broadband to 100% of the population.  The migration from legacy broadband to fibre broadband is already well under way.  The latest ComReg data show that, at the end of the second quarter of 2021, there were almost 309,000 premises with fibre connections in place, out of a total of 2.2 million fixed-line subscriptions, showing an annual growth of 54%.  A report published in May 2021 by the Fibre to the Home Council Europe states that almost 56% of homes in Ireland have access to full fibre, compared with the European average of 44%.  The same report cites Ireland as the fastest growing market, in volume and percentage terms, for fibre to the premises subscribers.</p><p>I conclude by stating that NBI is acutely aware of how vital high-speed broadband has become to our lives.  Despite the extreme and turbulent conditions faced during the last 19 months because of the impact of Covid-19, the work of our team provides a platform and gives us the confidence to deliver the project on time, or earlier, and on budget.  We welcome the opportunity to take questions from the members of the committee.</p></speech>

The first speaking slot is for a Deputy from the Fine Gael party.  I will limit each speaker's time to seven minutes initially.  We see then if we have time remaining at the end.</p> <p>  I will zoom in on two areas.  Public representatives are getting queries about broadband provision every day of the week.  It is a major issue on the ground.  In his presentation, Mr. Hendrick referred to one major contractor having 40% of the total workforce.  I read in media reports that this contractor was doing 60% of the work.  Is that correct?  I also read that the contractor is from the UK.  What were the circumstances in which NBI ended up in a situation with a UK contractor doing 60% of the work with 40% of the workforce?  Would it be fair to say that if that contractor was not confined in any way during the roll-out, it would then have been possible to have reached the target of 115,000 premises earmarked to be have been in place by the end of this year, rather than the figure of 60,000 which was achieved?  When the detail is examined, is that a fair summation of why the target figure of 115,000 has not being reached this year?  Would that be a fair comment?</p></speech>

It was due to commence activity in summer 2020.  It was part of the framework agreement in the context of the building programme and also part of our connections programme.  Unfortunately, that company could not bring resources into Ireland because of Covid-19.  It is a separate contractor from the contractor that had 60% of the workload.  The contractor in that case was KN Networks.  They are two different contracts, but both had an impact in respect of the scale of our programme in 2020 and 2021.</p></speech>

However, it was not only that one contractor that was affected.  The other contractor was also affected but not on the same scale.

We are just giving an example of the impact on one specific contractor, that had 60% of the workload, to give an idea of the overall scale of the impacts experienced in this context.</p></speech>

The media reports stated that a UK contractor accounted for 60% of the work and that it was extremely constrained by the impact of Covid-19.  What I am hearing today is that the work of the contractor from the UK, Kelly Communications, was taken up by KN Networks.  NBI then had two contractors in place, with KN Networks doing 60% of the work and Secto Services undertaking the remaining 40% of the roll-out.</p> <p>  I will ask a hard question.  It is not correct to say in that context that the impact on the UK contractor was the reason for the delay in the roll-out.  NBI had the contractors in place to take up the slack that arose because Kelly Communications could not carry out its allocated work.  I ask Mr. Hendrick to comment on that aspect.  I also ask him to tell us when NBI will catch up on its specified targets for the roll-out.  Has the Department contacted NBI regarding whether penalties will apply because of the delay in fulfilling its contract?  I am interested in finding out when NBI envisages that it will meet its targets.  It has a seven-year plan for this project.  When will that be published?  Is it possible that the time required for this programme can be reduced from those seven years?  </p> <p>  I was contacted by person who lives in Limerick, only a short distance outside Lisnagry, which is an intervention area.  People there have received an update from NBI stating that the earliest possible date for connections in the context of this roll-out will be between January 2025 and December 2026.  Those people are probably looking over their ditches at the existing fibre cable of another operator, yet they are being told that it will take three to four more years to be connected to broadband.  Work has been done on the cap intervention areas and on the pilot programme.  I will let my colleagues pick up on those aspects.  </p> <p>  I want to drill down into the reasons that explain why NBI has achieved only 50% of its target for this roll-out.  This is not about a contractor from the UK not being able to do work here.  There must be some other reason to explain this situation and I would like to know what it is.  I also wish to know when NBI will catch up on the targets set down in its contract.  What is the target for the completion of work by the end of 2022?  In addition, when will NBI publish its plan regarding its envisaged seven-year programme of work?  Can the time required for the completion of the work be reduced?  Moreover, there appears to be a low rate of take-up in respect of the line that the NBI has laid to date and the witnesses might confirm whether this is the case.</p><p>Media are calculating it is of the order of about 14%.  Will you deal with those very quickly?  I will let my colleagues pick up on other points and areas that I have not covered.</p></speech>

J. Malone, to give you some more detail in terms of the recovery plan, the numbers for 2022 and a sense of the momentum of the build programme.  In terms of the impact, and I accept it is not one thing that has delayed the programme for this year, Covid-19 has impacted on all of the supply chain and all of our partners feeding into that supply chain.  The UK contractor, Kelly Communications, is just one element of it.  Obviously, there is a reprocurement activity that we have to do.  We do not just immediately award to another contractor.  There is a delay in terms of looking at what the mitigations are and whether a contractor can mobilise and meet the demand of the additional workload.  There are many moving parts in terms of all the impacts we have experienced.  In March 2021 we sat down with the Department and looked at all of these, and we looked at a rebaseline, and under the contract we considered what reliefs we could get.  We had to spend a good deal of time showing the Department all of the things that feed into the delay and ultimately the relief and the changed milestone deliverables for 2021.  There is a huge amount of detail in this that-----</p></speech>

In terms of penalty, we do not get compensated for our operational costs and all our overhead costs.  In terms of that delay we also suffer the loss of revenue.  The contract does not see NBI made whole for some of these delays.  Even though we get relief on time, we do not get compensation.  I would say the cost to NBI is quite significant in terms of our operational overhead costs and our loss of revenue.</p></speech>

How does NBI plan to make up for the lost time, and what assurances can it give that we will not be here six or 12 months down the line, notwithstanding, that we hope we will not have Covid-19 to deal with in the same way.  However, there are many moving parts to this project.  We hear about supply lines, materials and the workforce.  There are two questions.  The questions are on the schedule for getting back on track and when the seven year plan will be published, and on assurances that we will not be here again in six or 12 months' time.</p></speech>

If we take this year, we are running approximately six months behind where we would like to have been.  Our whole purpose has been about trying to make sure we get back on track and that we can recover that ground and get back into a seven year plan that we are contracted to do.  That plan will be submitted to the Department in the coming week, with the timelines on that as well.</p> <p>  If we look at next year's plan, the 2022 plan, that would have seen us delivering somewhere in the region of 90,000 homes for that year.  That was the original plan laid out for next year.  Next year will see us pretty much back on track on that.  We will deliver close to 7,000 premises a month, which gets in about 84,000 homes for next year.  We will strive to surpass that, if possible, but that is what we are looking at.  That gets us back into the run rate we had originally envisaged, and all the work we are doing at the moment gets us to a point where we start recovering from there.  Next year gets us back on to the run rate.  From the end of 2022 to 2023 onwards, we then start to eat into that gap and pull it back into the seven year plan.  As Mr. Hendrick mentioned earlier, much of the work has been done.  We have engaged with Eir on the Eir "make ready" part of it, we have engaged with suppliers to make sure there is no shortage of materials in the market and we are talking with our contractors on a continuous basis, not alone just to pull back the seven year plan, but we are obviously looking to see where we can accelerate from that point and bring this plan in sooner than the seven years.  We are extremely confident on the seven years and working to see exactly how much we can knock off that plan and bring in some of those 2026 and 2025 numbers as well.</p></speech>

To be a bit parochial about it, and talk specifically about my own county of Meath, I want to ask if NBI has information on, how many houses have been surveyed in Meath in the past 12 months, and how many houses have been connected or have been passed.  I am most interested in the number passed.  There have been 23,000 to date.  How many of them have been in County Meath?  I appreciate that there is a network of distribution and of roll-out in terms of regional or local exchanges and the deployment areas, but I am looking at my own county, and huge swathes of it, almost half of it, are not due for completion until 2025 and 2026.  Is it the case that all of the deployment areas or the regional exchanges will be operated at the one time?  I ask that question in terms of the distribution and the scheduling of areas.  Is it the case that we are going to be lopsided for whatever reason, or will there be an even distribution based on the technological constraints?  Are there other considerations in terms of the roll-out?</p></speech>

One of the mandates that we had when we sat down to look at the deployment plan at the very start was to ensure that no county was left behind and to bring all 26 counties at the one time.  If I was to look at this from a logistical and selfish and from a normal roll-out point of view, you would tend to go into one county, finish that county and move to the next county.  From a contractor's and from a sensible point of view, to try to finish, you would do one county and move on.  However, because of the nature of this, and we are very conscious not to disadvantage any particular county, we have set out to bring all 26 counties together at the one time.  Obviously, different counties have different numbers of houses and premises.  If you take Cork, it would be by far the biggest county in terms of premises that fall into the intervention area.  Meath would have somewhere in the region of 18,500 or 19,000 homes.</p> <p>  In terms of the initial areas in Meath that we are looking to take on board, we split the country into 227 different deployment areas.  Deployment areas are basically what most people would know as an exchange area.  Those particular areas could be based in one county.  Skerries would be one, for instance, and that could bleed into other surrounding counties.  Dunboyne and Clonee would be in the Deputy's area.  That would cover premises in Dublin, Meath, and it would bleed into Kildare and surrounding counties.  It would cover all of those areas.</p> <p>  On the first ones coming up in the Deputy's area, houses would be served from the Drogheda area and the Skerries area.  Dunboyne and Clonee would also be done.  All of those are surveyed and designed.</p><p>Delvin is another location in the Deputy's area that is being surveyed and designed.</p><p> The key for us, particularly in the Meath area, is getting that through the local authorities.  In general, local authorities have been fantastic to work with.  We have found the engagement with Meath County Council a bit tougher.  We have had conversations and recent engagement with the CEO of the council and others.  We are moving forward in Meath but we have been slow getting engagement in the county to get the roll-out through.  In general, the local authorities are key, as I said.  If I were to fast forward to the next two years, 2022 and 2023, we would be looking at approximately 5,700 premises going live in Meath in that period.</p></speech>

I read it last night.  I am not a technophobe but it was a jargon-filled statement, if he does not mind me saying so.  I think I got my head around most of it.</p> <p>  I was the chair of the Southern and Eastern Regional Assembly in 2014.  I remember chairing a meeting of 53 councillors from Fingal across to Clare and down to Kerry and Cork.  It included basically half the country or more in population terms.  It struck me at that meeting, which took place more than seven years ago, that half of the councillors in the room, including those from Dublin and Cork city councils, Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, pretty much said nothing, while councillors in the other half of the room were totally frustrated.  Alex White was the Minister at the time.  We were promised at that stage that everything would be delivered.  I appreciate that was before Granahan McCourt and National Broadband Ireland were involved but it has been a very long wait for a lot of people.  As a Senator living in Dublin who represents people from across the country, and who has four grandparents from the country, I appreciate that broadband is as important as electricity and running water.  That was the case even before Covid but it is more so now because broadband allows people work in their communities without having to travel and spend hours in traffic on motorways and so on.</p> <p>  I have looked at NBI's website and read Mr. Hendrick's statement.  There is a lot in it and, to be fair, the website is quite detailed.  NBI is saying the intervention area covers 96% of the land mass but only 23% of the population.  Does that mean the 77% of premises in the country not covered are all based in the 4% of the land mass that is not in the intervention area?</p> <p>  Of the total 544,000 premises, 23,000 have been delivered.  The roll-out will be for the seven years from 2019 to 2026.  At this stage, after two years, less than 5% of the premises have been delivered.  I appreciate there is front-loading of surveying and so on.  How realistic is achieving the figure of 60,000 by Christmas?  By the end of 2021 and 2021, how far will NBI be?  There is an enormous amount of frustration.  I hear of people who have to drive with their laptop to park in hotel car parks to pick up a Wi-Fi signal.  I appreciate the connection points are good but it has taken so long for many people.  It is not acceptable from the point of view of the State and members of the public that the roll-out is at this stage.  Will Mr. Hendrick address those points first as I am conscious time is short?</p></speech>

When I think about the intervention area, it is defined not necessarily by geography but by broadband speeds.  When the former Minister, Alex White, announced the plan originally it was based on a 30 Mbps threshold.  Any premises that had less than 30 Mbps was deemed to be in need of an upgrade to high-speed broadband.</p><p>That map, or the amber area as we call it, was completed after consultation, the final part of which took place in September 2019 when the Department asked all the retail and wholesale operators in Ireland what were their plans in terms of delivering high-speed broadband to every area across the country.  It received 180 responses to that plan and, ultimately, the outcome of that was all of the premises that are in the intervention area.  The challenge is that they are not necessarily all located in one area.  They tend to be in every county be that urban, suburban or rural.  The challenge for the network is that it needs to cover a large distance in order to service those premises.  Equally, we need to make sure that the capacity and future-proofing of the network meet the demand for the next 25, 35 or 40 years.  It was as a result of the mapping consultation undertaken by the Department that we ended up having to look at this from a nationwide perspective.  It is not simply in one geographical area.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.</p><p> On the 23,000-----</p></speech>

If he is saying that NBI has to target 96% of the landmass which represents 23% of the population, is it fair to say that the other 77% who are not being targeted live on 4% of the landmass?</p></speech>

Just because we are building a network, does not mean there are houses all the way along the route that do not have broadband.  Some do have broadband greater than 30 Mbps.  The premises that do not are the ones we are serving.  We have to build the infrastructure to get there.  That is, therefore, part of the challenge.  We have to build the infrastructure no matter how far they are away.</p></speech>

The 23,000 premises include those which are available today to place an order.  That number is increasing.  Every two weeks we update the industry forum.  The industry forum includes the retail or wholesale operators that have signed up to sell services on the NBP network.  Today, there are 46 retailers that are actively signed up and are looking to sell services on our network.  That number increases every two weeks.  As we start to build the network, that number will increase.</p> <p>  In terms of the overall count, I appreciate that 23,000 does not sound like a large number.  If, however, we look at the forward indicators in terms of getting to a point where we will be able to offer a service, we must consider at what stage we are at with the surveys.  We have half the entire country surveyed as of today.  Those surveys then have to be designed.  We have to check what poles need to be replaced and what ducts need to be repaired.  Once we have the designs complete, we then issue them to Eir for the "make ready" aspect of their infrastructure.  We are putting cables up on Eir's poles and in its ducts.  We need Eir to do what is called a "make ready" programme.  It will replace any poles that need to be replaced or repair any ducts.  Equally, we have to trim trees in order to put the cables on the poles.  There is a whole element of pre-work required.  We have designs being submitted to Eir,.  In the coming weeks, we will increase those designs.  Today, there are 108,000 premises that are actively under construction and work is happening on the ground throughout 26 counties.  In the coming weeks - Mr. Malone can go into this point in more detail - we will be issuing contracts for subcontractors in respect of 195,000 premises.  One can see the momentum is building and there is a time between when we issue the contracts and when we get homes passed.  Those numbers will start to increase very quickly versus where we were 12 months ago.</p></speech>

NBI has a detailed website.  Perhaps the plan as outlined by Mr. Hendrick could be put on that website so that people can see that X amount are ready now, by December that figure should be 60,000 and by next March it should be 90,000.  It could include the 108,000 premises referred to and the 195,000 premises that are going into the system.  People in each area need to know this.  Counties like Longford have 8,000 premises but Dublin has almost 14,000.  The point was raised that Cork, with 80,000 premises, has the largest number.  Every single premises houses a family.  These are people who could work from home and those who are trying to run businesses in rural Ireland, where businesses are needed more than anywhere else.</p> <p>  I have one final question as I am conscious of time.  On the cost of the investment, I appreciate that some people call it a cost while others call it an investment.  I regard it as an investment in the areas that need it most.</p><p>There will be 544,000 premises between schools, farms, homes, business premises and so on.  How much does that work out at, roughly, per premises in terms of the cost of State investment?</p></speech>

Clearly, it is a national network.  Delivering post to a very remote location costs more than delivering to an apartment block, and it is the same with electricity and so on.  I am looking for the average cost, that is, the total cost of the programme divided by the total number of premises.  What is the cost?</p></speech>

What I would say is that the cost in the first number of deployment areas is in line with our budget expectations.  As well as passing homes, we are also connecting homes.  We are in a good place from the perspective of the cost of the project.  On the Senator's point regarding the website and communications, it is important that we are saying today that we are very confident in the programme.  Given what we have done to date in terms of the build programme, the connections programme and the take-up, we are very confident today in terms of the programme coming in on time and on budget.  Our real focus now is on the recovery from 2023 onwards in terms of bringing that six-month delay back in, and also in terms of acceleration.  In the meantime, we can come back with some numbers.</p></speech>

There is a great degree more and we are surveying at the moment or have completed surveys in approximately 90 of the deployment areas.  For the actual construction part, we have done or started on 25 and we have 40 contracted at the moment, which brings us to 145,000 premises.  We have run the tenders for the next 50,000 premises, which brings us up to 62 deployment areas.  Those tenders have been run, they have come back in, the evaluation process has been conducted and we are now ready to sign contracts in the next two to three weeks with those contractors for the next 50,000 premises.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming before us today and for their continued engagement with the committee.  I want to recognise the fact that I was on a field trip with Mr. Malone, Ms Collins and some more of the NBI team in parts of County Clare like Cratloe, Meelick and Ardnacrusha.  It was great to see on the ground the issues NBI encounters on a daily basis and great to get an understanding of the issues, where the pinch points are and the type of work that NBI does to make this enormous project a reality.  It would be beneficial if this whole committee went out and saw on the ground the type of work and the challenges that are posed.  Coming away from that day, I had a deeper understanding of that work, and I thank the witnesses for that.  I thought it was a very good exercise and perhaps, as I have suggested, this committee should seek to have such a field trip in the future.</p> <p>  There is disappointment with the level of progress.  Obviously, Covid had to have a deep impact on the type of work NBI is doing.  It is encouraging to hear that NBI is determined to make up the six months it has lost and it is good to hear of the work it has put in place in the gap intervention areas, which is one of the issues the committee homed in on.</p><p> Will the witnesses elaborate on that type of work and when they expect we will see the outcome of that work in terms of pilots?  I notice the witnesses were calling them clusters and reference was made to identifying these clusters and going in to address the issues.  With regard to Cratloe, I made representations and I know NBI is advancing a solution for a particular road there, which is very welcome.</p><p> In regard to County Clare, as Mr. Malone described it, the project is coming out from the exchange in Limerick and building back into south-east Clare and east Clare, then going back into areas like Shannon, Newmarket, Ennis and Clarecastle, as well as west Clare and north Clare.  It would be advantageous if the witnesses could explain to the committee, which is a public forum, why it needs to be that way, why these delays will happen and why the scheme is to be built in a particular way.  They might also explain how many houses in County Clare have been surveyed and how many connections will be made by the end of this year and into next year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.279" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hendrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021091500002#M00300"><p>Absolutely.  When we take the intervention area as it stands today, we start with approximately 537,000 premises.  When we talk about what we call infill, some of those are premises that are currently amber premises.  We have defined them in terms of how we are looking at it from a solutions-based approach.  We define them in terms of adjacent infill, where they are next to what we call a blue area, where there is a commercial operator, or urban infill, where premises are more urban but there is not a commercial network providing a service today, and then rural extension.  As part of the procurement process that we have under way, we have engaged with a number of infrastructure providers to see how we could extend parts of our network and their network in terms of finding a solution.  It helps us to also focus on the wider roll-out plan and the acceleration plan.</p> <p>  That is under way at the moment.  We have gone through pre-qualification to see if each of these infrastructure providers can meet the contractual requirements in terms of service obligations, future-proofing and the SLAs, and we have had a positive outcome from that.  We are going through that framework process over the coming months and we will have a pilot early next year.  That pilot is to test that all of the technical pieces work and also the integration between our software systems and their software systems, where appropriate.  Quite a lot of work has been going on since the beginning of the year to look at this.</p> <p>  In addition, to answer the question around some of the additional premises that come in later on, we are now approaching almost 550,000 premises on the map.  Some of that is because of GeoDirectory updates, where new premises have been added into the map, and there are also premises that are not getting 30 Mbps, whether it was because their commercial operator thought they were going to build out the network or that they simply are not getting the speeds the commercial operator thought they were offering and, hence, they are coming back in through the work of our team, through the work of Deputies and Senators and also through feeding into the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Those numbers have grown so at all times we are evaluating solutions in order to fill all of those requirements for premises that we can connect into networks locally or premises that have been added in.  There is a constant evaluation of new premises in terms of the programme.</p> <p>  On Mr. Malone's side in regard to the roll-out programme, he is very much focused on the larger-scale project, getting the plan to where we can recover from the delay of Covid, and also identifying what are the key enablers that we can do in terms of accelerating that plan.  Hopefully, I have answered that question and Mr. Malone can give a bit more detail on the sequencing of the build programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.280" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. T.J. Malone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021091500002#M00400"><p>To give some background on the sequence, as Mr. Hendrick said earlier, we have 47 different service providers that have signed up for us, which is a huge number of service providers.  We are acting as a wholesale provider.  We are not a retail service provider.  We basically build the motorway and they come on it.  We hand over our traffic at a point where we can meet all of the different bodies.</p><p>We have two different data warehouses located in Dublin where all the different service providers come into.  At that point in time there is a single point where we can hand over all the traffic that comes back off the network.  From there, we buy dark fibre that is already in place and which goes all the way out to what we call the regional exchanges.  They are the first ones that are in place to get up and running.  They serve as the core focal point of the first deployment areas.  There are 33 of them all around the country.  They are the first ones we need in order to get the speed into getting the roll-out commenced in the early stages.  From there we then build out.  It must be contiguous, so you go from one to the next and so on.  If you build a particular deployment area that is not in sequence and it falls out of sequence and does not have a connectivity back to the previous one then you just do not have light.  Light does not travel to it and you end up with what we call a stranded asset, or a set of houses are built, that look great and all the network is in place but we cannot actually provide any service to them.  That is the nature of why we must build out in the sequence we are doing.  As I said earlier, you could potentially go into a county and build all of the county out faster in a contiguous way and go clockwise and anticlockwise doing that, but we are trying to bring all 26 counties together across the entire country.  That is the reason.  I gave an analogy the last time around that it was like having a Christmas tree with the light at the top but if you cannot plug it into the socket at the bottom then you cannot get light to it.  That is basically it.  You have to work in a pattern the whole way up.  Included in all that, we must build in resilience.  Our operating service level agreement, SLA, here is that we are in operation 99.95% of the time.  If for any reason there is a break in the network we must be able to minimise the disruption, minimise the number of houses affected and reverse the path back to the other areas.  We are constantly building backhaul and contingency into the plan.  That is the sequencing and that is why we are going through with it.</p><p> If we go back to County Clare itself, we probably have somewhere in the region of just over 10,000 premises surveyed in the county at the moment.  The first of those premises will be coming live in October, November and December.  They will be fed out of the Limerick deployment area.  We will have somewhere in the region of 1,640 premises that will go live within the coming weeks and months in County Clare.  The ones that follow on from that are a few premises coming in from Gort, and then Kilkishen is the first main one located in County Clare itself, followed by Corrofin.  By the end of 2023 we are looking at somewhere in the region of 5,500 premises up and running, with Corrofin coming in just after that as well.</p></speech>

Obviously we had delays due to Covid.  The 114,000 figure was re-baselined and we are looking at 60,000 this year.  One of the requests the committee put in was that we would have a complete plan for the entirety of the seven-year programme.  I believe that is done now.  We go on the website and we get everything.  Does that include the catch-up on Covid delays?</p></speech>

That is the work we have got going on at the moment.  We contracted Eir to increase its output from the first of October and that is phased over 18 months.  Eir is going to increase the number of poles and the number of ducts it is going to repair.  Over the course of quarter 4 this year we are engaging with contractors around their ability to mobilise more resources to increase into 2023 to recover it.  We will have a better sense over the next six to nine months of what that recovery and acceleration plan looks like.</p></speech>

In parallel we are working on the increase in volume from Eir.  We have that contracted now.  We contracted it during the summer.  That kicks off on 1 October.  Then there is the procurement activity we must undertake.  We are ahead on surveys, we are getting ahead on design and all that will feed into the volume we need to contract with our subcontractors.  At the beginning of next year we hope to be in a position where we actually understand what the recovery looks like from 2023 and what our plan is for bringing some or all of the deployment areas forward from 2026 and obviously 2025.  I am not sure it will necessarily be contracted early next year but we are working with the Department on all the enablers to ensure we get to a position where we can bring forward those deployment areas in 2025 and 2026.</p></speech>

There is a requirement on Government to ensure that people are offered alternatives in the short term and that it assesses and ensures what the best is for those people because we all know the realities that exist in some areas and the absolute necessity of broadband connectivity.</p> <p>  I welcome the work that has been done on capacity regarding contractors and what have you but if we are talking into the future about this acceleration, NBI will need to ensure that it is already dealing with contractors on whether they have the capacity.  I assume it is also dealing with Eir and ESB Networks in the context of ensuring that they have the capacity to be part of that acceleration.  We are talking about improvements in dealing with local authorities with the section 254 guidelines, but is there a need for a greater level of capacity within the authorities?  Mr. Malone spoke about Meath County Council and certain difficulties.  What can we, as a committee, do to improve that work?  I am aware that there were also difficulties in dealing with CI&Eacute; and others on crossing their lands and so on.  Where does that matter stand?  Has the engagement improved and are we close to a solution?</p></speech>

Beginning with the question on local authorities, I will explain section 254 for people listening.  When we set out on this project, a number of new telegraph poles needed to be put up in order to allow us to build our network across the entire country.  We use as much existing infrastructure as is in place but it still requires an number of new poles.   We set about getting a standardised set of guidelines in place with each of the local authorities.  At that stage, we engaged with the County and City Management Association, the road management office, the Local Government Management Agency  and the Department.  We brought all parties together to get an idea of what good looks like because the thing you need more than anything when you are rolling a programme of this scale is predictability and fluidity for our contractors in order that we can predict with certainty that we can work when we go into a particular area.  It is no different from building a house.  When you put in your foundations, you need to know that your bricklayers are coming next and when your plasterers, roofers, etc., are coming.  We are exactly same, only we have polers, cablers, etc., coming.</p> <p>  The biggest concern we had was that the local authority in County Galway would have one set of guidelines and that the authority in County Kerry would have a different set.  We have engaged with them and that has now been agreed and is in place.  It was signed off on and introduced by the Minister at a large forum involving more than 200 members of planning sections within the local authorities that was held on 5 May.  The introduction of it is now starting to take place.  Like anything, it takes a little while before it beds in with all the local authorities.  In general, the local authorities are all extremely engaged and see the importance of this.</p><p>They are working very well with us to get this.  Obviously, we are tight for resources.</p></speech>

Will more capacity be required in the future to deal with an acceleration of the broadband roll-out?</p></speech>

When we go in, we are competing with these priorities in every local authority that is under time constraints.  The Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Environment, Climate and Communications are working together to legislate for a timeframe in this regard.  We are all working together to get that done.  I believe it will be done later in the year.  The first thing is to ensure that a timeframe is in place for applications for section 254 licences to put up new poles.  The Department issued a circular on 18 August.  This went out to all local authorities and the planners within them and said that, while we are waiting on the legislation, applications for licences relating to the national broadband plan were to be given priority.  We are starting to see that across the board.  As we start to build and accelerate-----</p></speech>

Does the planning permission issue with local authorities account for much of the delay in the roll-out to date?  Would it make sense for local authorities to set up dedicated units to deal exclusively with these matters?  I presume NBI is seeking road opening licences.  That all falls under that category.  How big of a component of the delay in the roll-out was the absence of a structured arrangement with the local authorities?  Would it make sense for each local authority to set up a dedicated unit to allow planning applications relating to the roll-out to be fast-tracked?  Would that speed up the process a great deal?</p></speech>

It has put a massive amount of pressure on our side.  We have had to resurvey and redesign certain areas to accommodate the guidelines that came out.  It is also putting massive pressure on the local authorities to get through backlogs quickly so that we can proceed on time.  It has not specifically delayed the roll-out but, to answer the Chairman's second question, we should definitely have a dedicated resource for the national broadband plan.  I believe that it where Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; was coming from as well.  It is not just our licences that are being processed.  The authorities are processing licences on behalf of NBI, on behalf of Eir for its "make ready" works and on behalf of our contractors to allow them to carry out work on the ground.  They are not only processing applications for licences for poles, but also applications for road opening licences.  There are two parts: the road engineers and the planning departments.  When you go to the local authorities, you are also dealing with municipal districts so you could be dealing with four or five different people when you are dealing with one particular application for a set of poles.  To answer the question in short, if we had dedicated resources within each local authority that could handle our licence applications and process them in a timely fashion, it would be of great benefit to us in attempting to complete this plan in less than the seven years.</p></speech>

There will be somewhere in the region of 664 or 665 crossings across the entire 227 deployment areas over the coming years.  These crossings may be overhead or underground.  It was important to get an agreement in place with CI&Eacute; from a commercial point of view, a technical point of view and, above all, a safety point of view.  We spent several months getting such an agreement in place and I am glad to say that we are now in a position to sign.  We had a meeting last week at which all the final bits and pieces of the terms and conditions for the master agreement were agreed and the agreement will now be signed in the coming days.  We will then apply for each individual licence we need as we go forward.</p> <p>  One of the issues we have had with TII and the national roads infrastructure is that, if you apply for a licence in respect of part of the national roads infrastructure and there is already a licence in place, you cannot get a licence until the previous licence has been closed off.</p><p>That other licence might have nothing to do with our project.  It could be for something else that is happening, whether it is a local authority, Irish Water or somebody else bringing something down a national road.  In fairness, TII has come to the party with us.  We have had a trial taking place in Blessington for the past couple of weeks whereby we have concurrent licences open.  We are doing that a view to extending the practice across the rest of the country.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Hendrick, Ms Collins and Mr. Malone for being available and for engaging with us in our meeting today.  They were also available earlier in the day and I took the opportunity to meet them briefly in Buswells Hotel.  In particular, I thank them for taking time to travel around the country over the summer and meet with members of this committee in their constituencies and walk us through situations in which broadband is being installed.  That was very welcome.  It is best practice engagement.  Forgive me for saying this, Chairman, but the chief executive of Aer Lingus is running away from the committee while we have another entity here that is running to engage with us.  This is what our committee would like to see from all bodies with which we deal.</p> <p>  The NBI website has been improved and there is much more information available.  That information is more localised in nature and allows people to drill down in terms of what they want to access.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  My first question would be applicable in respect of any part of the country in which NBI has crews at the moment.  When NBI came to Clare, we could see where cables were being brought above and below ground.  I was brought into a housing estate where substantial works were required in terms of ducting and installing additional chambers.  There were some significant civil engineering works involved.  If that was the case in one housing estate in Clare, when it is replicated throughout Clare and the remainder of the country, is that a factor in pushing up costs for NBI?  Was this factored in by the company when it submitted its initial bid?</p></speech>

When we go out to do a survey, we identify the amount of work that needs to be done.  In the area to which the Deputy referred, we needed to put in stand-off chambers.  If we survey an existing Eir chamber and there is not enough room to locate our equipment within it, we have to build what we call a stand-off chamber - a chamber beside the existing chamber - into and out of which we can bring cables and in which we can locate our equipment.  All of that has already been factored into our costs.  Ours is a fixed-price contract with the State.  All of those matters have been factored in.  As Mr. Hendrick alluded to, in the first three deployment areas that have been completed, we are able to go back and check to see that we are coming in on budget in the context of what we predicted.  The work that was done upfront early on is now paying dividends.  As the Deputy quite rightly said, there is a significant amount of work involved.  We estimate that somewhere in the region of 12% to 14% of the infrastructure required for this project will be new, whether it is poles, chambers, ducting or whatever.</p></speech>

The important takeaway for us and for the public is that this is a fixed-price contract and that NBI will come in within the price range agreed.  As was stated earlier, the ambition is to pull this back from being a seven-year roll-out to a five-year roll-out.  People in the rural extremities of Ireland would really appreciate that.</p> <p>  The next question for Mr. Malone also refers to the day in Clare and our visit to a level crossing.  NBI explained how the live broadband cable went down the road and then stopped.  There was a whole rigmarole in the context of getting it across the level crossing to continue onward.  Significant licence arrangements are required by NBI with Irish Rail and other entities.  Can Mr. Malone elaborate on how that is progressing?</p></speech>

We have been working with them for the past six or eight months.</p><p>As the Deputy quite rightly said, where we are crossing a live railway, safety is paramount, as is making sure we and our contractors take all of this into account.  CI&Eacute; must have the appropriate oversight from an engineering point of view to make sure when awarding a licence that everything is very clear and that all of the criteria and documentation needed are there and accounted for at the time.</p><p> We have been working with CI&Eacute; over the past months to make sure we can put in place a master agreement.  The Deputy must understand this is a project that has never been seen before.  The terms and conditions CI&Eacute; may have had with other operators in the past and which may have worked will not work for a project of this scale and this size.  We have been working extensively with CI&Eacute; in recent months to try to get our service level agreements and that we get the proper documentation put in place when we apply for licences on how it would work and how CI&Eacute; could work at speed with us.  We are glad to say we are finally in a position whereby both parties are happy and in the past week we have reached an agreement.  It will be signed and put in place in the coming days and we will then start crossing CI&Eacute; lines.</p></speech>

I presume this will speed things up.  Obviously these are initial teething problems but if licences are in place the problem in Cratloe should not be replicated elsewhere in the county or country.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, for a programme of this scale and size and for the contractors it is all about fluidity.  It is about us getting on the ground and making sure we can do the work when we are there the first time instead of having to parcel premises into deferred areas and then come back.  Our ambition is to get as many premises up and running and turned on as quickly as we possibly can.  The Deputy made reference to people looking over fences at other people.  There is nothing worse than having to walk away and leave a few houses stranded over something simple.  I am glad to say we are in a position to keep it moving.</p></speech>

In general, where is the roll-out at in County Clare?  I have seen the teams working on the ground.  In my locality not a day goes by without one of the vans passing on the road.  Everyone is anxious to know where the roll-out is at in County Clare and what timelines we can expect in terms of the network being live and available to homes.</p></speech>

As I said when we came before the committee previously, each deployment area is further broken down and split into ribbons.  Each ribbon has a number of houses in it.  Each ribbon of fibre might have four or five different ribbons within it depending on the size of the deployment area.  The first deployment area serving houses in Clare is fed from Limerick and it has a number of ribbons.  They will start to be released from the end of this month onwards.  In October and November we will see premises in Clare come live for the first deployment area, comprising 1,636 premises.  The next one we will see is Gort and we will then see Kilkishen, which is the main one.  This will be somewhere in the region of the first or second quarter of 2023.  By the end of 2023, we will have approximately 5,500 premises covered and released in Clare.  At present we have approximately 10,000 surveyed.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their engagement.  National Broadband Ireland is the first entity I have seen that has gone beyond the committee room and gone down on the ground to see what is happening and engage with members there.  All of the questions I had have been asked with regard to looking into chamber holes and looking up at polls along the roadside.  This is practical stuff.  I had a pretty dull list of questions because all of the questions I needed to have asked about County Clare were answered in County Clare.  This should be a lesson for all other entities coming before the committee.  We are a lot happier and have many of our questions answered with this high level of engagement.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

This is a huge contract.  It is a massive undertaking.  It is very complex with regard to technology and logistics.  I thank the witnesses for their willingness to share information, to engage with us and to keep the public informed of progress.</p><p> I do not have to state it, but the performance and delivery of NBI is crucial to the lives of the many thousands of people who require high-speed broadband.  It is also vital in terms of our ability to grow the economy, particularly in the context of an emphasis on regional development.  As a Deputy who represents a rural constituency, I know the lack of broadband connectivity is having very negative impacts on the ability of rural communities to remain sustainable.  As a result, the work of NBI is absolutely vital.</p><p> Mr. Malone made two big statements.  He indicated that NBI may be looking at recovering the time that has been lost due to the Covid delays.  I ask him to confirm that is what he is saying.  He mentioned that, under the contract, NBI has relief on time.  In other words, it is contractually bound to deliver within a specified time but, because of the impact of Covid, it will get some relief in that regard.  It hopes to make up that time, however.</p><p> Mr. Malone also mentioned that it is a fixed-price contract.  All those who are in business are aware that there is currently a shortage of materials.  The cost of materials has increased.  In some instances, manufacturers and suppliers are taking advantage of the Covid shortage to hike up prices.  Is Mr. Malone saying that those cost increases have to be covered by NBI and will not be passed on?  Are they covered under the existing contract?</p><p> There is massive frustration and, at times, anger in rural Ireland when people see that their neighbour across the road or a short distance up the road has broadband but they do not.  There are gap areas.  At previous meetings of the committee Mr. Malone undertook to look at this and see how NBI can contribute to bringing a service to those people who are caught in the gap areas.  Can he indicate the timescale in terms of the progress by NBI on this matter?  Is NBI getting co-operation from the other networks in terms of assisting each other to provide that service?</p><p> Finally, the natural question for me to ask is what level of engagement and co-operation is NBI receiving from Tipperary County Council?  Mr. Malone does not have to answer that today but if he can, I would appreciate it.   Across Tipperary, how many houses have been surveyed and how many have been passed and released?  When does Mr. Malone expect numbers to be connected?</p></speech>

The Deputy made a number of other points that I will address.  The Deputy is right in what he heard in respect of making up the lost ground.  We are currently six months behind on the programme but it is absolutely our intention to make that time up and bring it back within the initial seven-year plan.  That is our intent and it is absolutely what we are planning.  We are very confident that we can do that.</p> <p>  As regards materials and the rise in the cost of materials within the contract, I refer to the overall envelope of subsidy that has been allowed for this project.  Any increases above and beyond that entire subsidy fall to NBI to cover.  Likewise, the Department has inserted a clause whereby it has the ability to recoup from NBI savings resulting from reductions across the board in materials, etc.  There is a robust contract in place to cover those matters.</p> <p>  In the context of Tipperary, there are approximately 29,500 properties in the county.  None of them have yet gone live or been passed but several projects are under construction and will be going live towards the end of this year or at the start of next year.  These include Tipperary town and its perimeter deployment area, as well as Clonmel, which is coming under construction, and Roscrea.  There are several areas where work is under way.  Tipperary is probably well served from that point of view.  We believe that approximately 10,500 premises in the Tipperary area will be passed and ready for service by the end of 2023.</p> <p>  As regards engagement with Tipperary County Council, we have found it very good to deal with, as has been the case with the vast majority of local authorities.</p><p>We have found no issues there at all.  This is also the case with the majority of people, who are open, helpful and looking to see how they can speed things up with us.  </p></speech>

Therefore, a critical part of our project and the contract is to ensure that it is of equal service to anyone who is in an urban area and has an equivalent fibre-based service.</p> <p>  On the deployment plan and its impact on people who live close to other networks, obviously we are deploying this across all 26 counties and it is difficult to meet all demands at any one time.  Hence, we looked at two things.  The first was how we approach infill premises.  These are premises that are close to what we call the commercial areas.  These premises are in urban areas and could be connected to networks today if we had a contract in place with certain operators.  That is under way at the moment.  We have a pre-qualification framework in place, as I said earlier on.  We will put that in place at the end of this year, with pilots early next year.  I hope this will resolve the challenges that a number of people face today with broadband.  </p> <p>  It has been helpful to have 46 of the retail operators signed up to the NBP programme and connecting to the NBI network.  This means we are getting a great adoption of customers, particularly with some of the wireless operators.  Some of their customers are transitioning from wireless to fibre.  The net impact is that they are freeing up capacity on their own network.  This means that retail operators are delivering a better service to customers who may not fall within an area that we cover today but who are just outside it.  A number of operators have come back to us and told us the customer experience has been fantastic.  This is on foot both of just connecting to our network and the ongoing delivery of 500 Mbps, which has been transformational for people's lives, and because it has freed up a significant level of capacity on the network, particularly for people who are working from home and who utilise a lot of video content.  This is a combination of our deployment in every county, the releasing of capacity on legacy networks that probably are finding with Covid-19 the increase in demand of bandwidth has had an impact on the services they deliver and the infill review we are doing with wholesale providers.  </p> <p>  In terms of the contract and relief, obviously we have relief for the 2021 plan in respect of what we experienced with Covid-19 and our supply chain.  However, it is critical from our perspective, as well as that of the Department, that we put all of the enablers in place including all of the contracts with our suppliers, with Eir and with our subcontractors, to recover from that delay.  Certainly, that is our focus from here until the end of 2022 in order that we can start showing the acceleration of the plan towards the end of the project.  </p></speech>

Deputy Cathal Crowe referred earlier to the time the witnesses gave to members to travel around our various constituencies to look at the installation on the ground.  We got a sense at first hand of some of the difficulties the team is encountering, such as collapsed ducts, networks legacy issues, knowledge of where these ducts go and all the other stuff that goes with it.  This was quite helpful.  I was also pretty impressed with the standard of installation.  Many years ago, I did a bit of work on fibre when it first came in.  I, therefore, kind of understand the complexity of that project that the team has taken on, as well as the complexity of the cable installation, management, all the other issues and bespoke situations in which they will end up and all the other factors that can complicate an installation like that.</p><p> I will follow up on Deputy Lowry.  The witness spoke about capacity release, where people have signed up and where the connection may be releasing capacity on other networks.  Does he have feedback from people?  People often say to me: "I should be getting 30 Mbps here but I am only getting 5 Mbps, yet I am outside the NBI so what can I do?"  Is it those people for whom we are seeing some capacity release?</p></speech>

There is only a certain amount of spectrum available to provide services to a number of customers.  Obviously, if one develops or designs the network to service 1,000 customers, for example, there is a shared amount of bandwidth available to the 1,000 customers.  One particular operator in Cavan has found that by customers migrating onto the fibre network, the number of premises that are connecting to the network has reduced.  With the increase in bandwidth from people working from home, there were challenges in meeting the demand.  What has happened now is that as the operator takes customers off and they are on fibre, it has freed up additional bandwidth.  Ultimately, therefore, one gets a better balance of customer experience across the fibre and the wireless network.  These are homes that fall outside the area we are servicing.  They might be connected from a base station within our area, but they ultimately fall outside the area in which we have built the network at that given time.</p></speech>

In order to achieve that we have had to do many things, and surveying is a critical part of that.  We are surveying what is involved in the connection.  We feed that into the design.  Then there is the scope of works that is required to complete that connection.  Is it the installation of a pole or do we need to go underground?  How many metres of cable are required and what type of installation is it?  How many crews are required to complete that installation?</p> <p>  When we receive an order from the retail operators through our software systems directly from their software systems and feed that back to them, they get all the information, for example, the type of order and it requires a timber pole in somebody's driveway or in a field to connect the house, it might be 150 m of cable and will require two contractors on site and will take four hours to complete the job.  The end user has a complete view of what is going to happen.  We are glad to say that of the connections we have completed to date, we are at a very high what we call "net promoter score", which is unseen today in the telecommunications industry.  We are at 92%.  Of all the connections, it is very high.  Ultimately, we want that to feed into the in-life performance from a reliability perspective.  As a result of the work we have done up front - survey, design, the scope of works and the bill of materials in terms of the installation - and feeding that all the way back so the customer knows the day we are going to turn up, how many people are required to do the job and how long it is going to take, the customer experience is very high.  Ten working days is our standard installation.</p></speech>

That is an impressive part of the overall project.  Finally, could the witness provide an update on Wicklow?  I know that NBI is quite advanced in Kilcoole and Blessington and that other areas are going through the design stage as well.  If he has time, Mr. Malone might offer Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; an update on Louth.  One of our Green Party representatives there, Anthony Murphy, would be interested too.  If Mr. Malone could outline the position in Wicklow and Louth, in that order, we would appreciate it.  Somebody can let Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; know what is coming.</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, Kilcoole is the furthest advanced at present.  There are almost 2,000 premises in Kilcoole.  We see all of Kilcoole being released back into the market as being available for service by December this year.  We are hoping that it will start in November and bleed into December, but the 2,000 premises in Kilcoole will be available by December.  We are also building out in Blessington.  Blessington is one of those deployment areas that is quite large and spans a number of premises from a build point of view.  It comes into the Kildare jurisdiction and also comes into south Dublin.</p><p>It comes into the back of City West, etc.  There are approximately 1,400 premises in the Blessington area or in the Wicklow area.  We have a number of ribbons there.  We are working on the first four ribbons within Blessington to try and have them ready by the end of this year or in early January.  The Blessington project is well advanced and making good progress.  The next ones to come after that will be Redcross and Enniskerry.  Both of them have been surveyed and designed, and will be part of the patches we are releasing in the next deployment areas once they go into construction.</p><p> If it is acceptable, I will jump back to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s questions.  There are in the region of 8,800 or 8,900 premises in county Louth.  The first two deployment areas there are Dundalk and Drogheda, which make up 4,300 premises.  That means almost 50% of the premises are in the first two deployment areas.  Dundalk is going very well and we will start to release premises in Dundalk in the coming weeks.  We expect Dundalk to be completed and released by December.  Drogheda is just starting construction at the moment.  We are just working on some licensing issues in order to get the licences freed up for the Drogheda area.  Some of them also bleed into Meath.  We are also making good progress in Drogheda.  As I said, 4,325 of the 8,791 premises are in the first two deployment areas in Louth.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their level of engagement, not just today but, as articulated by a number of other members of the committee, also previously.  Unfortunately, I was unable to avail of the offer to meet on-site, but the offer was greatly appreciated and the level of engagement makes a significant difference in our being able to do good work with the witnesses at meetings like this and beyond.</p> <p>  Mr. Malone spoke in detail about the obstacles, many of which are understandable.  In answer to a question from Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, he said it would be 2023.  It may be an answer to a slightly different question.  When does he believe NBI will be operating at a consistently good capacity so that it is hitting good targets?  While it might be dealing with some everyday obstacles, is it generally going at a clip that would make Mr. Malone and his colleagues happy?  I am not talking about targets; I am just talking about when it will feel it has that momentum.  I ask him to answer that question after which I have a few more questions.</p></speech>

This year has been all about coping with where we are and getting ourselves into a good position to get into 2022.  "e envisage getting consistency, fluidity and programme delivery on the ground, and up and running, in 2022.  We see 2022 as the year for us.  There are obstacles, problems and issues out there.  In any project of this scale, one will experience unknowns throughout.  We believe we have come across the vast majority of them in the first year.  We have come across a number of issues, found solutions and dealt with them.  No doubt, we will find others as we go through it.  In the first 12 or 18 months of any project of this scale, the big issues are reached fairly early in the project and solutions are found to work around them.  We touched on some of them earlier, including the local authorities, the section 254 issues and the make-ready works.  We have worked through all of those to put ourselves in a position so that we are confident when we hit 2022 we will start to get into a steady pace.  We call it industrialised.  That is where we get into an industrialised state whereby, from that point, we can then start to have a platform to move on to meeting and exceeding the targets.</p></speech>

Are phone calls answered by in-house staff or is it that outsourced?  How many calls are being answered?  I have not heard of many problems with it; I am not coming from that angle.  However, if NBI is moving to a more industrialised pace and people are seeing stuff being done, I imagine it will be busier.  I want to make sure the phone line is operating well because people may not have Internet access for chat and that kind of thing.</p></speech>

I will hand over to Tara Collins.  The contact centre falls under her remit and she would be abreast of all of the deployment plans and scalability so I will let her answer that question.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, our dedicated line for political representatives is included in the contact centre.  The team in the contact centre has doubled in size in the past 12 months.  We are meeting all of our service level agreements.  The team there strives to provide seamless experiences across all of our touch points, which include telephone, email and all of our social networks.  In addition to our marketing activities on social media where we proactively market, we also man the social networks in terms of responding to all of the queries that come in.  The role of the contact centre is to provide information on the roll-out of the programme primarily and register stakeholders for email updates because in respect of feeding into our take-up, we need to create demand and be able to communicate directly with end users.  We have just exceeded 50,000 registrations so we are communicating directly with 50,000 people in the intervention area.</p> <p>  The Deputy's other question concerned the quantities.  We are managing 350 to 500 points of contact every week.  In busier times, this can go up to about 600.  The maximum we have seen on a weekly basis is about 600 points of contact but we are well manned.  The operation is outsourced to the Rigneydolphin Group with which we have a very good relationship.  We are very happy with the level of service it is providing.  It is also managed in-house through my team via our head of customer experience so it is tightly managed.  </p></speech>

That is good to hear.</p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Hendrick and concerns the board of directors.  I note on the website that the board of directors and the members of the board are not listed.  It is just the chair - David McCourt - who is listed.  I know National Broadband Ireland is a company and not a semi-State body but in the case of semi-State bodies that deliver large pieces of infrastructure such as the ESB or Irish Water, the board of directors would be listed.  Could this be done in the interests of transparency given the important investment National Broadband Ireland is making?  Is it something National Broadband Ireland could discuss?</p></speech>

Deputy Lowry summed up for many of us the importance of the national broadband strategy.  It is akin to rural electrification.  Our country requires this national broadband plan to be successful.  The rebirth of our country in a post-Covid world hinges on the national broadband plan being successful.  I am not trying to be dramatic.  If we are looking at a new working from home strategy and a new way of doing business, connectivity domestically, regionally and internationally is important.  All of us recognise that in a world where our corporation tax regime is being questioned, we require a high-quality national broadband plan to sell our country.</p> <p>  I commend our witnesses on their engagement with the committee.</p><p>What they did during the summer with members of the committee was very successful.  They brought members to on-site locations to explain, show and engage.  I propose that the Chairman write to the Working Group of Committee Cathaoirlaigh and recommend that other agencies adopt the same model of engagement.  It allows for greater transparency and gives us greater confidence in dealing with queries and issues and it shows us the work that is being done, notwithstanding the roadblocks relating to many issues about which we have heard today.</p><p> We made reference to the website and engagements.  Will the witnesses present to us, not today obviously, a county-by-county and, with counties, area-by-area breakdown of the work and activity in train?  That would be important for our work in dealing with people.  I could list places like Ballygarvan and Waterfall in my area as examples of places where there is a lack of clarity, but  I will not do that today.</p><p> The issues of the delays relating to and the symmetry with the councils need to be ironed out.  We have all experienced delays in getting contractors, whether it is builders or tradesmen.  There are rising costs in construction from the point of view of work and materials.  What effect will that have on the national broadband plan?  Is there a contingency plan in the context of rising costs?</p></speech>

Contractors are split across design and build.  We have three design contractors and four build contractors.  We are looking to bring additional build contractors onto the pitch to help.  There is a shortage of labour in the market in general.  We have close relationships with our contractors.  We give them forecasts of what is coming and when it is coming.  Many of our contractors are working with outsourced recruitment agencies and internal agencies on the ground in different countries around Europe looking for labour and bringing it into the country in respect of places where there are shortages.  They are also engaged with some universities, including Technological University Dublin and Kerry college, where apprenticeships are being run over 18 and 20 weeks in which they go through specific design for fibre-optic-related and civil engineering-related activities in the field.  They are working with them and putting some of their own people through that.</p> <p>  On cost, we have frameworks and agreements in place with the contractors in respect of rates for set periods.  Over the periods when they come up, we review the rates up or down with them, depending on where the market is.  NBI's contract is on the basis that whatever the envelope is from subsidy, we have to work within that regardless of rising costs.</p></speech>

We are working with the contractors in respect of three areas: the ongoing work; the recovery of the seven-year plan; and to see where we are positioned from an acceleration point of view to bring that back in.  We are confident we can get back the six months we have lost within the seven years of the plan.  We are working with them in granular detail on what a deployment plan would look like and what resources they can make available.</p><p>Taking that into account, and as Mr. Hendrick said earlier, 2022 is kind of banked now.  The figures we are looking at for 2022 are there, so any incremental decrease on the seven-year plan timeframes would take effect from the end of 2022 or from 2023 onwards.  That gives us time to work with the contractors to source those additional crews and that different capability.  We have seen some programmes around Europe - fibre commercial city programmes rather than rural programmes - finishing off.  In Portugal and places like that, the contractors are engaging with individuals and other contractors from those countries and getting great success in bringing them across as well.</p></speech>

Despite what Senator Horkan alluded to, there is a lot of detail in the opening statement in the context of the issue of subcontractors and the disruption.  As an educationalist, I impress on the witnesses the importance of our education establishments, especially primary and post-primary but now also third level.  The frustration people have experienced with the Covid delay in the roll-out of broadband will last only for so long.  NBI has a window of opportunity that I think the witnesses all know they need to work on and to build on.  Importantly, as Senator Horkan said, the jargon will take us all only so far; it is the delivery that will be critical.  I say that with respect.</p> <p>  What NBI did over the summer, I stress again, is very important.  I ask the witnesses to consider doing that on a regional basis with county councils or regional assembly groups because it is about ensuring there is confidence in the work being done.  Again, it is very important we get this delivered.  I look forward to having our witnesses back before the committee.  M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas.</p></speech>

They are around the city and on the outskirts and then they bleed, as we said, into south Clare as well.  They are all really well advanced.  We are effectively just finishing off the bits and pieces of splicing, testing and then getting ready to hand them over.  Coming on from Limerick, we go into Tipperary.  They are the next two deployment areas that have premises that feed in.  By the end of 2023 we will see approximately 6,200 premises in the Limerick area ready for service.</p></speech>

I welcome that.</p> <p>  May I have clarification on a couple of points?  They involve a bit of detail.  The target for the end of the year was 115,000 and it was said that NBI will do about 70,000 to 100,000 every year thereafter.  Is NBI still on target to meet the 70,000 to 100,000 from 2022 onwards?  What is its rough target for those years?</p></speech>

We are targeting between 70,000 and 85,000 premises to be delivered next year so we are bang on target from that point of view and from what we said.  From then on, as we said, our key area is that we are working with all the parties involved, whether it is Eir, our contractors or our procurement teams for the supply of materials from our supply chains, etc.  We are actively engaged with all of them to see how we can better that and improve from the back end of 2022 onwards.</p></speech>

I referred earlier to somewhere in Lisnagry.  Is NBI quite near the city?  Is it, say, beside University of Limerick in Castletroy?  They are being told they will get roll-out of broadband.  That is an intervention area between January 2025 and December 2026.  That is three to four years away.  Obviously, they are utterly frustrated.  They are working from home and need high-capacity, high-speed broadband if they are to work with companies.  They do not have that at the moment.</p><p>When these people go into the system, is that based on a seven-year timeframe?  NBI will publish a plan very shortly on the seven-year roll-out.  If someone goes up on the system, will that be based on a seven-year or five-year timeframe?  When does NBI reach a point when it looks at bringing it back from seven years?  Is what NBI publishing now for seven years?  Am I correct in saying that?</p></speech>

At this point, however, we are not sure of the extent to which that will be the case.  That will not be until we get all of the different criteria back and understand what that gives us.

What has been the take-up to date?  What does NBI believe the take-up will be?  If take-up is less than 60%, could there be an additional cost to the State?  I know it is a fixed-price contract and there has been great work on the ground, but the committee also has a wider, macro remit, as Mr. Malone will appreciate.  This contract comes at a great cost to the taxpayer and will be of great benefit when it is rolled out.  I ask for an answer to that question because I have to probe that issue.  Is the financial model built on a 60% take-up by consumers?  Will NBI reach that target and, if not, is there a contingency whereby there may be additional costs to the State?  The scenario is similar to the tolled motorways and road tunnels when the State had to pay a subsidy if a certain volume of traffic was not achieved.  I am not sure if Mr. Malone or Mr Hendrick should answer the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-15a.375" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hendrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021091500002#Z01000"><p>I will respond.  Unlike what one will see in a toll contract, we take on the revenue risk of the take-up.  NBI, its board and its shareholders are taking on that risk.  To give the committee some sense of this, broadband networks typically involve take-up over time.  When we looked at this in 2018 and 2019, we had considerable evidence from Europe and other markets where people were transitioning from what we call legacy broadband networks on to fibre.  Some of this was based on how far one could go with those networks in both capacity and speeds.  What we are finding now is that the demand for content and bandwidth is so much higher.  Hence the reason we are delivering 500 Mbps.  We are, therefore, seeing an earlier adoption of users transitioning from those legacy networks on to our fibre network.</p> <p>  Another key enabler in our take-up is the number of operators that we have selling and have signed up to our network.</p></speech>

They are proactively engaging with their customers, whether it is on a wireless or copper-based network, and offering them either free installation, six months free or 12 months at 50% discount.  They are incentivising their customers to move over to what they would see as a more reliable and higher speed network.</p><p> If we look at this at the macro level, from a European perspective there is an ambition that all premises throughout Europe will have gigabit capable services by 2030.  This is why we are seeing a massive shift by commercial and State funding to bring all of this infrastructure onto fibre-based networks.</p></speech>

For us to assist NBI in its roll-out, it would appear that one of the areas that probably requires a bit of tightening up is being able to get road opening planning licences through the local authorities.  We will write to the Minister for Transport and Communications and the Minister with responsibility for local authorities to ask them to establish designated units.  NBI might advise the committee on what it will need in those units.  Obviously it will need planners and engineers.  NBI needs to tell us specifically.  Many operators ring us to try to get road opening licences through.  I am familiar with this issue.  It is not as efficient as I would like it to be.  Will the witnesses give the committee an indication of what they believe would be required?</p> <p>  Are there other areas where there are blockages in the logistics?  Is there an issue with access to labour?  What does NBI see as being the blockages over the next 12 months to it rolling out the contract as quickly as possible?  What needs to happen so that by the end of the year it will be coming back saying it will get it to five years and that the person who made the representation to me would find the link-up to be much quicker?  I also ask the witnesses to flesh out the 60% figure.  What will NBI do practically on the intervention areas?  People are tearing their hair out.  They see neighbours 100 yards up the road on fibre broadband while they are not on it.  I am aware of a lady who is looking at a wait of two to three years according to the website.  What will NBI do practically?  The witnesses have spoken about a pilot scheme.  Does NBI need assistance from us?</p> <p>  I know I have asked many questions but it is a round-up.  To recap, I have asked NBI to write to us with regard to local authorities, I have asked whether there are other blockages with which we can assist, I have asked about the intervention areas and I have asked the witnesses to confirm once and for all that there are no financial downsides for the taxpayer in the NBI deal and that there may be an upside if the cost of materials decreases.</p></speech>

We appreciate the committee's support today and to date.  We will follow up with further details on what we are doing with the RMO and the local authorities, and how we think we could seek further assistance.  We appreciate that.  Let us consider what other activities we could come back to the committee with, in terms of support.  From a communications and stakeholder engagement perspective, we have seen great support.  That local community and communications plan is something we are very committed to.  Every week our team engages on the ground with politicians and local councillors, and it is very important that we continue that.  Given its scale and complexity, it is a hard project to explain.  Certainly, getting to premises earlier is our focus.  In terms of the intervention areas and the programme of activities, we will feed back into the committee on our progress.  Equally, in terms of how we see the deployment of the network releasing capacity to other operators and how that benefits both the end-users' businesses and homeowners, that is actually making the overall intervention area deliver a service, even though we are not there yet.  We are an enabler to improving the existing broadband networks-----</p></speech>

It is a huge amount of money, but if it is rolled out successfully the benefits will be enormous in terms of people getting access to broadband fibre whether they are in Dublin, Tokyo or rural County Limerick.  We saw during Covid-19 that we can operate from home, but we need broadband of a high calibre nature.  There may be some upside.  It is a &euro;2.6 billion fixed contract.  If the costs go up, NBI is taking the risk.  If there is a reduction in the cost of materials, there could be a rebate to the taxpayer.  Will Mr. Hendrick nail that on the head, because obviously NBI hears speculation, but there is an opportunity here in a public forum to give absolute clarity and state categorically that there is no downside in terms of risk for the taxpayer in terms of cost, only a possible upside?</p></speech>

It has been approved by the European Commission at a state aid level.  The contract in itself has many protections and legally binding obligations that fall on NBI to deliver the project, one of which is that we do not get any more subsidy than is in the subsidy envelop, and that all of the associated revenue risks sit with NBI.  Any gains in terms of savings on materials or labour costs go back to the State, so there is definitely more gain.  We see that today in the number of deployment areas that we have completed.  We see that the budgeted costs that we had originally envisaged are coming in on or below budget, so we have a high degree of confidence that there will be savings in this project.  There is no downside.  We take the-----</p></speech>

We will discuss this as a committee.  There is obviously ongoing engagement at local level.  For us, it is very simple.  We are here, as a committee, to ensure that broadband is rolled out as quickly as possible.  We also have a remit to protect the public purse.  We thank Mr. Hendrick, Mr. Malone and Ms Collins for attending today's meeting and engaging with us.  We look forward to further engagement.  Mr. Hendrick will appreciate the intervention area is a huge issue for us.  We welcome the fact that you are starting to do something on that in the first quarter next year.</p><p>Mr. Hendrick will appreciate that the intervention areas are a major issue for the committee.  We welcome that NBI is to start something in that area in the first quarter of next year.  Perhaps it will provide further details on specific areas of the country as the process evolves in order that we can put flesh on it.  Members look forward to continuing engagement at the committee with Mr. Hendrick and his colleagues.</p><p> The next meeting of the joint committee will be held in private on Tuesday, 21 September.</p></speech>
