We are joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee.  He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Deering and Farrell.  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 31 January, which was our last meeting.  Are those minutes agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is matters arising from the minutes.  I have one serious item to raise, which we will be coming back to discuss.  It relates to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  We had an item of correspondence here the last day, reference number 1897.  It was signed by Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, Office of Government Procurement.  We had written to him well before our meeting asking for information about the role of the Office of Government Procurement in respect of the national paediatric hospital.  He summarises the limited role it is playing, said it was established and that there is a procurement process and a contracts committee, called the Government contracts committee for construction.  He states that the hospital board commenced its engagement with this committee in May 2014 and goes on to say that it sought a derogation because of its unique nature.  The Office of Government Procurement, of which Paul Quinn is the chief procurement officer, notes that the derogation was given in respect of working through that committee.  Nevertheless, the contracting and sanctioning authority were responsible all the while.  He addresses the use of the frameworks and of eTenders and provides a summary of the role of the Office of Government Procurement in the procurement arrangements for the national paediatric hospital.  He says his office is at the disposal of the Committee of Public Accounts should we require more detailed information.  </p> <p>  What I find totally unsatisfactory with that letter from a very senior Government official is that he makes no reference to the fact that he was a member of the board of directors.  He states that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board commenced its engagement with the Government construction contracts committee in May 2014.  His office provides the chair and secretary of that committee.  He was appointed as a member of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on 2 August 2013 and there is a clear conflict of interest between the two positions, given the derogation, his being a member of the board and his being on both sides of that debate.  What I find more disturbing is that he did not inform this committee of this.  He should have at least highlighted it.  This level of not providing information in response to a letter from the Committee of Public Accounts is totally unsatisfactory.  I accept that he had a dual role.  We were entitled to be informed of that.  This letter is not acceptable from a person of that office.  We know there are issues in respect of that matter.</p> <p>  I will take comments on this issue.  I propose that we write back to Paul Quinn expressing our grave disappointment that the information we would expect as a matter of courtesy and candour to be made available to the committee should have been omitted.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-07a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019020700002#B00300"><p>Yes.  It is displayed on the screen.  We wrote well in advance to the National Development Finance Agency and the Office of Government Procurement to ascertain their roles in respect of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  Depending on the response, we were to decide whether to meet them.  We had sought the information well in advance of the meeting and received this reply with no reference to the fact that Mr. Quinn was a member of the board.  At a minimum, he should have referred to that.  There are other issues on the work programme about the hospital board that we will deal with.  I am strictly referring to this letter as a matter arising from last week's minutes.</p></speech>

Specifically in respect of that letter, could the Chairman remind us what roles Mr. Quinn had?  He is head of the Office of Government Procurement.</p></speech>

He was a director since 2 August 2013.  The hospital board and the Government contracts committee, of which the Office of Government Procurement provides the chair and secretary, commenced discussions on the matter in May 2014.</p></speech>

I think we need the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before us anyway.  That is the logical next step for the committee.  We need the Secretary General of that Department.  Given that Mr. Quinn is head of public procurement and had that dual role, and that there are questions around management of conflict of interest, I think he should come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Department should also be here if we have a further sitting.  There are now questions about the relationship between the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and about lines of communication in terms of process, that this committee should examine.  I propose that we write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform asking that the Secretary General come before us.  Mr. Quinn says he wants to be helpful and he is at our disposal.  It would be useful for him to come to that meeting as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-07a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019020700002#B01100"><p>I will make one observation of which I want people to take account for a moment.  We need to invite the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss the management and control of major capital projects, including the children's hospital.  If we write to him specifically on the children's hospital, he is utterly within his rights to say he is not the Accounting Officer in respect of that project.  I do not want to write a letter to which we are guaranteed a refusal.  It is not good for the committee to be making a request that we know will be refused.  If we frame the request as being in respect of major Government contracts, for which he has a responsibility, we may have a better result.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-07a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019020700002#B01200"><p>I would support that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-07a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019020700002#B01300"><p>Otherwise, he would refuse to attend this committee as he is not the Accounting Officer for that project.  He has a broader responsibility and I think that is the invitation we have to extend.  He should not refuse that invitation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-07a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019020700002#B01400"><p>When we wrote to him, we did so in a specific context.  It was a piece of input that we felt would be necessary to understand the process, to understand controls and where the section he heads up in respect of procurement fits in to making sure proper controls are in place.  We did not just pick this out of thin air.  It was a piece of information that we required.  Is there going to be any issue if he comes here saying he reports to the board?  If we are going to have an engagement on this, it has to be on his role and responsibility when he was on the board.  Did he report to the Minister?  Was he required to report to the Minister?  He was not picked out of thin air, either, to sit on that board.  There was expertise being placed there.  Where was that interaction?  We got that reply in response to a request.</p><p>We made the request so that we could look at this matter and learn how the process worked.  He needs to be able to answer on that, rather than saying-----</p></speech>

We need to be clear about that.</p></speech>

There is a liaison officer between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health, who often sits here during meetings.  There will be two lines of contact.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-07a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019020700002#C00500"><p>I will leave to the Chair the methodology by which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform comes in here.  It is necessary for the Secretary General of the Department to come in and I suspect he wants to come in, to one committee or another.  The head of procurement, who sat on the board, should also come in.  It is only through this that we can get to the bottom of where this was going.</p> <p>  Circular 12/2010 explicitly states the requirements of a civil servant who sits on a State board.  If we go by what the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il, however, all the circulars on this matter are a waste of time and not worth the paper they are written on.  The requirements were also incorporated, verbatim, into the code of conduct for State boards, which was launched in August 2016 by the current Minister.  His responsibility is listed in that circular, as is the responsibility of all civil servants on State boards.  It states when he or she must go to the Secretary General and when he or she must immediately go to a Minister.  There is a process issue here, beyond this whole topic, and that is also an issue for us on the Committee of Public Accounts.  Is this circular being adhered to across the Civil Service?  It is bigger than the hospital board issue.</p></speech>

He was in a meeting with the Taoiseach at the time, coincidentally, and the Taoiseach was informed on the same day, as was the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  The steering group minutes show that there were concerns in April, May, June and all the way up.  Those steering group minutes-----</p></speech>

The steering group was set up in May and the other board in September.  They obviously had concerns back then or they would not have put in these layers of accountability.  It was confirmed to me at yesterday's health committee meeting that attempts were made throughout October, and certainly on 17 October, by the Department of Health to sit down with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss this.  The Department of Health was not able to sit down with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is the most amazing and unbelievable thing in all of this, which is why we need the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to come before us.  The budget negotiations were ongoing and the rows between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about budget allocations and overspends were on the front page of every newspaper, but on 9 August the Taoiseach, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Health were all aware of it.  The Department of Health was trying to sit down with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss it but it never happened.</p> <p>  There are multiple issues here.  One of them is the fact that somebody was sitting on the board who was subject to Circular 12/2010.  Another is that there was a failure to sit down and discuss the issue, despite the fact that everyone was aware that there was an overspend of at least &euro;200 million at this stage.  If that does not justify us getting information from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, nothing does.</p></speech>

I think the Department should come in as soon as possible and a director be appointed.</p></speech>

All the circulars are out there but there is company law governing the responsibility of a director to do his or her fiduciary duty to the board of which they are a member.  Does the companies legislation supersede the circulars on the role of a director?  Maybe this means half of these circulars are meaningless.</p></speech>

I was confused about that role within a company.  We have covered the point for the moment and I do not want to go into the nitty-gritty of it now.</p> <p>  At our last meeting we cleared, noted and agreed the minutes of the meetings of 17 January, 22 January and 24 January.  The meeting of 17 January was with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Prison Service.  We asked the Department to respond to us, in writing, with specific information on two items and we asked the Prison Service to respond on 16 items.  Three weeks later, the Committee of Public Accounts has not had any replies to any of the questions.  It is not acceptable to the Committee of Public Accounts to write out to these two bodies and not receive answers.  Unless we have the response by next Thursday, the same group of people will be back here again.  When we write to an organisation for information, they cannot disappear into the wind and not get back to us.  There has been three weeks with no communication from them.  If we do not have the answers by next Tuesday evening, they will be here on Thursday to tell us why.  They are now formally on notice to be here next Thursday morning at the commencement of business at 9 a.m. if we have not received replies by Tuesday evening.  Can we agree to that?  I propose that this is a procedure we will follow.</p><p>If we ask for information, we should receive replies or else an explanation of why it is not possible.  We had to do it once last year and I do not intend to start this year on the same road.  </p><p> As we have noted and agreed the minutes, we will move to the next matter on the agenda, namely, correspondence received since the last meeting.  Thank God the correspondence is light because we have been busy over the past few weeks.  </p><p> In category A, the first items are Nos. 1913 and 1920 from the Office of the Attorney General, providing briefing material and an opening statement.  They are to be noted and published.  </p><p> Nos. 1914 and 1921 are from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution, proving a briefing note and opening statement.  They are to be noted and published.  </p><p> Nos. 1915 and 1922 are from the Chief State Solicitor's office, providing a briefing note and opening statement.  They are to be noted and published.  </p><p> Nos. 1919 and 1928 are from the Department of the Taoiseach, providing a briefing note and opening statement.  They are to be noted and published.  </p><p> No. 1910, from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE, was received and circulated before the last meeting but we did not note and publish it.  It provides a copy of the terms of reference of the review of the escalation of costs in respect of the new children's hospital.  We will seek to obtain a copy of the revised terms by the conclusion of the meeting.  If they have been completed, we would like a copy.  Otherwise, we should be informed.  I understand that the revised terms of reference have been published and, therefore, I would like to see them.</p></speech>

If the terms of reference require naming people who are culpable in respect of the overrun, that is unlikely to end up in the public domain.</p></speech>

Rather, the information is likely to remain available only to the two contracting parties, according to legal advice I have sought.  While the Government may well be given an indication of who is liable according to the terms of reference, nobody else will, and that is entirely unsatisfactory.  Whether an identification could legally be made outside of those parameters is another matter.  We all know the limits of the committee.  There was a referendum on foot of the Abbeylara case.  Let us not just merely examine the terms of reference but instead consider what they might or might not deliver.  It is not the case that we are demanding a head on a plate.  It is a question of where we can fit into the system a method of accountability.  Unless we learn a lesson from the matter, we will repeat the mistakes of the past.  Can we do what I have outlined, as well as obtaining a copy of the terms of reference?</p></speech>

He did it on CervicalCheck when he said no woman would have to go to court, despite having no legal basis to make that commitment.  He has done exactly the same in this regard.  If it is just to bounce the issue into the future, it is wholly inadequate.  If it is the case that the terms of reference will not do that, we must also consider what we need to do to fix an utterly flawed process.  That may well involve inviting Mr. Robert Watt of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to appear before the committee.</p></speech>

I propose we discuss their contents briefly in private session and provide a short summary of our observations when we return to public session.</p> <p>  The next item, No. 1925, from Professor Chris Fitzpatrick, consultant obstetrician, gynaecologist and master of the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, dated 6 February 2019, requests an opportunity to appear before the committee in respect of the financial overrun at the national children's hospital.  He was in a key position because the co-location involved the Coombe Hospital, of which he was the master, and the issue was fundamental to the decision on the co-location.  It was not suggested to move the hospital miles away but he suggested another site, adjacent to the current site, that would have facilitated all the issues.  He said he highlighted the cost overruns.  Nobody knows when the Coombe Hospital will be co-located with the new paediatric hospital.  We will not invite everybody to the committee who writes to it, but we will just hold the door in this regard, while thanking him.</p><p>We will not decide just yet.  We may decide that he will go to the Joint Committee on Health, if it wants to see him, but his entire email to us is strictly about financial matters related to the project.  He could have a useful input to make and perhaps on the day Mr. Watt is to attend the committee to discuss capital projects we might have a separate session.  I would not like to dismiss it, nor would I like to accept it straight up.</p></speech>

First, it is a serious letter from a committed person setting out issues about accountability and money.  Clearly, we cannot invite everybody to appear before the committee.  I agree with the Chair in that regard, but we have to decide how we will put this matter in context.  Therefore, we should not say yes now, but we should certainly come back and look at the letter to see how we will deal with it.  I am in favour of him coming, but I see the dilemma.  There were different groups yesterday and so on.  This matter has to stay on the agenda and we need to come back to it to discuss it and give it proper thought.  He has gone to some trouble and, if we are about governance, certainly there are serious issues.  That is my tuppence ha'penny worth for the moment.</p></speech>

We will have to make quick contact with him because of the GDPR, but I propose that we publish the correspondence.  Normally, we do not publish letters from an individual, but this is different because he wants to appear in public.  If we have to seek formal agreement to allow publication of the letter, so be it.  If it is granted, we should publish it.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is from Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, requesting that we follow up on an item with Mr. John Pollock about various meetings and the minutes of the meetings of the finance sub-committee of the paediatric hospital board.  We have asked for copies of the minutes as a result of last week's meeting and various other minutes of meetings of different groups.  That matter has been dealt with. </p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is statements of accounts received since the last meeting.  There is a large list which I will move down through quickly.  The first is for the Criminal Assets Bureau which received a clear audit opinion.  </p> <p>  The special account established under section 4 of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006, an insurance scheme, received a clear audit opinion, as did Pobal.</p> <p>  The Limerick Institute of Technology received a clear audit opinion, but non-compliant procurement to a figure of &euro;663,000 is noted.  Without going into the detail every time it arises today, the liaison officer produced for the committee a comprehensive report last autumn on the items highlighted as non-compliant in all of the accounts.  I will ask for it to be brought up to date in the accounts received to the end of December.  We will include a summary in our next periodic report in the section dealing with the issue of non-compliance.  Much work has been done behind the scenes.  When the document is updated, we will circulate and summarise it for inclusion in our next periodic report.  We need to cover this issue but without delving into every specific detail as we move along.  The matter is noted.</p> <p>  Beaumont Hospital board received a clear audit opinion.  Again, the figure for non-compliant procurement is estimated at &euro;24 million.</p> <p>  The Health and Social Care Professionals Council to promote standards of professional education, training and competence for health and social care professionals received a qualified audit opinion.  The council accounts for the cost of retirement benefit only when it becomes available and is not in compliance with FRS 102, international standards, but it is complying with the direction of the Minister.</p></speech>

The figure for non-compliance was &euro;799,000.  We will include this topic in our periodic report.</p> <p>  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology received a clear audit opinion, as did the Institute of Technology Tallaght.</p> <p>  The National Haemophilia Council which advises the Minister for Health and agencies on any matter related to haemophilia received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  Nscda (Operations) DAC which is developing and running the National Sports Campus received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, received a clear audit opinion, but non-compliant procurement is noted at a figure of &euro;2.9 million.  We have raised the matter recently with the RTB and asked for details.  We will ask for the matter to be followed up.</p> <p>  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The Mental Health Commission received a qualified audit opinion, again because it did not comply with international accounting standards in dealing with retirement benefits, as the Comptroller and Auditor General knows.</p> <p>  The Crawford Art Gallery received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  Waterford and Wexford ETB received a clear audit opinion.  Again, non-compliance with procurement is noted at &euro;3 million.</p> <p>  Health and Safety Authority received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The Health Research Board received a qualified audit opinion.  It in the health area and does not meet international financial standards in dealing with retirement benefits at the direction of the Minister for Health.</p> <p>  The Grangegorman Development Agency received a clear audit opinion, as did the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and Horse Racing Ireland.</p> <p>  The Oberstown Children's Detention Campus received a clear audit opinion.  However, attention is drawn to the statement of internal control which discloses that the board did not as part of the audit carry out a review of the effectiveness of the systems of internal control for the period.  This relates to its account for 2018.  Has it been done since, or has the Comptroller and Auditor General had an opportunity to verify it?</p></speech>

Today we will be dealing with the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach in considering Vote 1 - the President's Establishment and Vote 2 - Department of the Taoiseach.  We will meet in private session to clear some items and then resume in public session immediately after the votes at 2 p.m. to deal with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</p> <p>  Next week we will meet the broadband providers.   We will meet representatives of BT at 10 a.m., of Eir at 11 a.m., of the Regional Internet Service Providers Association at noon, of Imagine at 2.30 p.m. and of Enet at 3.30 p.m.  It will be an interesting session.</p> <p>  In the following week, on 21 February, we will deal with financial statements for 2015 of Kildare-Wicklow ETB.  I hope it will not take all day.  In the afternoon session we are proposing to deal with some of the housing issues with which we are dealing concerning the interim regulatory committee of the Irish Council for Social Housing which is the approved housing body. </p> <p>  On 28 February in session 1 we will be back discussing housing matters.  In session 2 we will deal with the remainder of the Vote for the local government fund, the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and central government funding for local authorities.  Representatives of the Department of Housing will be here, together with representatives of the Housing Agency and the chief executives of a number of local authorities to discuss housing.  The session will be of interest.</p> <p>  In the following week, on 7 March, we will deal with the accounts for which the Minister of Finance is responsible.  We will deal with chapters 1, 2, 3 and 22 of the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Exchequer outturn, the collection of pension contributions, the control of funding for voted services and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  We will also deal with the appropriation account for Vote 8 - Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Mr. McCarthy will let the Accounting Officer for his Department handle it.</p></speech>

The balance, totalling &euro;2.6 million, is related to expenses of the President's Establishment.</p><p>In addition to the direct charges on the Vote, other costs relating to the operation of the Presidency were charged to other Votes and to the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  These amounted to an estimated &euro;5 million in 2017.  This includes &euro;2.3 million spent by the OPW on maintaining the grounds and premises at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, the President&rsquo;s official residence.  A breakdown of the net allied expenditure is given in note 1.1 of the appropriation account.</p><p>  Vote 2 provides for expenditure by the Department of the Taoiseach in support of the Taoiseach and the Cabinet.  Gross expenditure in 2017 totalled &euro;28.3 million.  All the expenditure related to one programme, with a breakdown given in note 3.  Administration costs, including salaries, totalled &euro;15 million and accounted for 53% of the total spend.  Almost &euro;9 million was spent on various statutory inquiries.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, is the only agency under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The council received &euro;1.9 million in grants in 2017.</p><p> There was a significant underspend on the Vote in 2017, relative to the amount provided by the Oireachtas.  As a result, just under &euro;9.2 million was liable for surrender at the year end.   Explanations for the variances are given in note 3.</p></speech>

I am attending at the request of the committee to assist in its examination of the 2017 appropriation accounts for the Department of the Taoiseach and the President&rsquo;s Establishment.  As the Chairman stated, I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Denis Breen, head of corporate affairs, and Ms Geraldine Butler, finance officer.  The committee will have received, in advance of this meeting, briefing documents detailing the 2017 expenditure and outturn of the Department of the Taoiseach and the President&rsquo;s Establishment as set out in the 2017 appropriation accounts and other supporting documentation.  I propose to briefly outline the role and structure of the Department of the Taoiseach and to give an overview of the Department&rsquo;s 2017 appropriation account as well as an overview of the President&rsquo;s Establishment appropriation account for 2017.<br/><br/>The Department of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s work centres on supporting the work of the Taoiseach and the Government both at home and abroad.  The core functions of the Department are delivering the Executive functions of the Taoiseach and the Government, providing the Government secretariat, supporting the Taoiseach in carrying out his duties as head of Government including in relation to the Oireachtas, constitutional issues, protocol, the European Council, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council, working with the Office of the President and with the Oireachtas and engaging with the formulation and implementation of Government policy mainly through the system of Cabinet committees, senior officials&rsquo; groups, the programme for Government office and the parliamentary liaison unit.  The Department is responsible for the office of the Taoiseach, as well as providing some support for the T&aacute;naiste and Independent Ministers in Government.  The Department is also the site for the Office of the Government Chief Whip, who also has responsibility for the Central Statistics Office.  We provide support for the Ministers of State assigned to the Department who have responsibility for Defence, European Affairs and for data protection.  The Department also provides the Government Information Service, provides briefing and advice to the Taoiseach on the full range of domestic policy issues and on international affairs, including through the work of the NESC, to which the Comptroller and Auditor General referred earlier.  The Department also supports the Government in the formulation and implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s EU, Northern Ireland and international policies, including co-ordination across the whole of Government.  We also deliver support services through our corporate affairs division which includes human resources, finance, ICT and other services.<br/><br/>In 2017, changes were made to the structure of the Department following the appointment of a new Taoiseach and Government.  These included new Ministers of State, responsibility for Brexit co-ordination moving to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the establishment of new Cabinet committees.  The Department supported the Taoiseach's intensive engagement and negotiations with EU leaders on a wide range of issues, including Brexit.  Through the Cabinet committee structure, the Department engaged with other Departments on a wide range of national policy issues, as directed by the Taoiseach, such as housing and homelessness, climate change, health and justice reform, infrastructure planning and investment, gender equality and disability, economic planning and rural development.<br/><br/>In addition to the existing responsibilities, the Department undertook additional preparatory work during 2017 in the areas of pensions reform, Ireland's bio-economy, the national planning framework, the national development plan, Global Ireland - Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025, and the establishment of the North East Inner City, NEIC, programme implementation board.  Press and protocol support services continued to support the large programme of events including the state funeral of the late Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, and visits by Heads of State and senior EU officials.  The Department was centrally involved in supporting the Taoiseach and the National Emergency Co-ordination Group in its response to Storm Ophelia in October 2017.  Across all areas of the Department&rsquo;s responsibility, considerable time and effort also went into answering parliamentary questions, preparing material for use in the Oireachtas, processing freedom of information, FOI, requests, answering letters and queries from the public, organising events, preparing speeches, and responding to media queries.<br/><br/>The outturn for the Department of the Taoiseach in 2017 was &euro;27.58 million against an Estimate provision of &euro;36.74 million.  This lower than anticipated expenditure resulted in &euro;9.16 million being surrendered back to the Exchequer at the end of December 2017.  The significant variations in expenditure relate primarily to programme spending.  Under subhead A4 -Tribunal of Inquiry - spending was &euro;3.5 million less than estimated due to the number of legal cost claims settled in 2017 being lower than expected.  Obviously, we have no control over third-party legal costs incurred by tribunals and it is impossible to predict the timing of settlement of third party costs or the level of costs falling due at any particular time.  Under subhead A5 - Commissions of Investigation - spending was &euro;2.4 million under estimate.  The commissions are independent and their expenditure levels depend on the needs and requirements of their investigations.<br/><br/>Subhead A1 - Administration Pay -  was also under estimate due to a significant turnover of staff and delays in filling posts at some grades during the year.  Just over &euro;15.3 million was expended on pay and administration in 2017, with the balance expended on programme expenditure.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, quite a lot of our spending is on investigations.<br/><br/>The Department&rsquo;s 2017 appropriation account was audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In his report, the Comptroller and Auditor General noted that, in his opinion, the account properly presented the receipts and expenditure for the Department for the year ended 31 December 2017 and that it has been prepared in the form prescribed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Comptroller and Auditor General also stated that he had no matters to report with regard to the statement provided by me, as Accounting Officer, on internal financial control.<br/><br/>My role as Accounting Officer for Vote 1 is very different to that of Accounting Officers for other Votes.  Generally, the Secretary General is the Accounting Officer for the Votes and also the administrative head of the Department and as such can answer for the actions of the Department.  Although I am the Accounting Officer for Vote 1, I have no executive or operational responsibility for the Office of the President.  This is entirely appropriate given the constitutional position of the President.  As the committee is also aware, Article 13.8.1<sup>o</sup>of the Constitution states:</p><blockquote>The President shall not be answerable to either House of the Oireachtas or to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and functions of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of these powers and functions.</blockquote> <p>As Accounting Officer, I obtain assurances that the office operates properly through my direct contact with the Secretary General to the President and from the audit performed by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The outturn for the President&rsquo;s Establishment for 2017 was &euro;3.6 million against an Estimate provision of &euro;3.9 million.  This lower than anticipated expenditure resulted in &euro;294,236 liable to surrender back to the Exchequer.  The account for the President&rsquo;s Establishment was audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In his report the Comptroller and Auditor General noted that, in his opinion, the account properly presented the receipts and expenditure of the President&rsquo;s Establishment for the year ended 31 December 2017 and the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for that opinion.<br/><br/>That concludes my statement to the committee.</p></speech>

Before I call the first speaker, I acknowledge receipt of Mr. Fraser's opening statement, briefing note and the annual report for the Department of An Taoiseach for 2017.  I also want to acknowledge receipt of information in respect of Vote 1, the President's Establishment and the opening statement in that regard.  I further acknowledge receipt of the document, The Presidency in Review, 2011 - 2018, which was published towards the end of last year.  That contains some financial information of which the public may not have been aware.  It is welcome that its publication has been achieved.  As a matter of course, the Committee of Public Accounts will be examining all Votes on a routine basis, which is what it should do.  Today's meeting includes an examination of the Vote for the office of the President.  Last year was the first time that we conducted such an examination but it will be a normal part of our work from now on.  We also indicated earlier that we will be reviewing the accounts of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  I do not know if any Committee of Public Accounts has done that before but we will be doing it.  We will also be reviewing the accounts of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I do not know when the commission was last before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Every one of the Votes will be examined by this committee at some stage and there will be no exceptions from now on.  I just wanted to put that on the public record in case people think we are picking and choosing particular items.  Everything is on our agenda.</p> <p>  Deputy Aylward is first and he will have 20 minutes.  Everyone else will have ten minutes because we will have a second session this afternoon and there will be a different main speaker at that stage.  Speakers will be called in the following sequence: Deputy Aylward, Deputy Cullinane, Deputy Catherine Murphy, Deputy Connolly and Deputy MacSharry.</p></speech>

I will begin with Vote 1, the President's Establishment.  I note &euro;3.7 million and then &euro;2.6 million under various headings and then a sum &euro;5 million.  That comes to a total of &euro;11.3 million in costs for the President's Establishment.  Am I correct?  I see &euro;3.7 million in total gross expenditure and then on the next page, a sum of &euro;2.6 million for allied service expenditure and then &euro;5 million is mentioned for maintenance and other works.  We are talking about a total of &euro;11.3 million.  Am I reading that correctly?</p></speech>

We have received a summary.  Net voted expenditure in 2017 was &euro;3.609 million.  Allied services expenditure, including the amount from the Central Fund, was &euro;5.039 million, thus giving total expenditure of &euro;8.918 million.  The figure includes the salary and pension payments of the President and the particular allowance referred to previously.  The total is &euro;8.918 million for the year under review.</p></speech>

That clarifies the matter.</p> <p>  I wish to clarify the position on the discretionary fund.  I was looking at the documentation and the presentation submitted last night and could not see a reference to the &euro;317,000 discretionary fund.  Why is it not included in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General?</p></speech>

It includes the emoluments and allowances of the President.  The total figure is &euro;894,000 which includes the figure of &euro;317,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-07a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1368" speakername="Bobby Aylward" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019020700002#H00500"><p>The reason I am asking the question is it was controversial at the time.  It was raised during the presidential election and we were all being told that it should not be debated in the Houses because of the sensitivity of the issue and so on.  Now that the election is over and we have a new President in place, I am keen to know about the funding of &euro;317,000 and accountability for it per annum.  As it accumulates, it will come to big money over five, six or seven years, or whatever the term is.  Why is the figure not included?  It is not explained.  Perhaps Mr. Fraser might add something to explain to the public the sum of &euro;317,000.  What explanation do we have for it?  I simply wish to appease minds among the general public.</p></speech>

We were before it previously.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General said, it is included in the figure for the Central Fund, from which it is paid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-07a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019020700002#H00700"><p>I will explain it for the benefit of the public because it relates to the President's Establishment.  There is a payment of &euro;894,000 from the Central Fund to the Vote.  It includes the allowances for the President, pension payments to former office holders and what is called the 1938 allowance paid under a statutory instrument.</p></speech>

It is important to note that it is paid from the Central Fund by the Department of Finance.  The Secretary General of the Department of Finance is the Accounting Officer for the Central Fund.  Am I correct in saying he is the person responsible?  The Secretary General of the Department of Finance will shortly be before the committee to deal with the Vote for the Department of Finance.  We will put him on notice in that regard.  We will ask him to answer the question as it relates to the Central Fund.  Am I correct, Mr. McCarthy?</p></speech>

I do not know this stuff as well as I know the material for the Department of the Taoiseach.  It comes under the heading of net allied services.  The figure for pensions is among the main items.  The biggest figure is for the OPW, as someone mentioned.  The OPW does a great deal of work in the upkeep of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, the grounds and so on.  That is the main item of expenditure.  There is a little expended on shared services, of which every Department avails.  The figure for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is related to security.  The figure for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade relates to foreign travel.</p></speech>

It is not for airplane tickets but all of the facilities the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provides for the President, both at home and abroad.  The briefing material provided for the committee states where the President visited in 2017.  It is, of course, a matter of public record, but it is included in the briefing material somewhere.  There were state visits to Cuba, Australia and New Zealand.  The state visit to Australia and New Zealand was nearly one month long.  There were then official visits to Colombia, Peru, Italy, Vatican City and Scotland.</p></speech>

When it comes to where the President visits, his personal wishes are important, but it is part of the diplomatic statecraft of the State.  If countries offer the opportunity to make a state visit or if we offer people the opportunity to make a state visit, it is obviously based on whatever we think is in our national interests and where we want to deepen friendships.  The obvious example is the President's visit to Britain a number of years ago.  We see incoming and outgoing visits.  Obviously, the farther away he goes, the longer he will be there and that will be reflected in the costs of the state visit.  He was in Croatia and Greece last year.  That would not have cost as much as visiting Africa, Australia or New Zealand.  As committee members can see, the cost was a little higher in 2017 and 2016.  The differences are in the region of hundreds of thousands of euro, depending on where he visited.  It is included in the detail of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade figures.  The figures for the Department Defence relate to Army services, including soldiers.</p></speech>

I am keen to be helpful, Chairman, but I am not the Accounting Officer.  It was mentioned that the President had published a document.  I had no involvement in its preparation because, as I said, it is quite properly none of my business.  He sets out in some detail in the report what he does and the fact that there are 20,000 visitors each year and 223 in-house events.  I gather he will publish a report annually.  I also understand he has set up an audit committee for the allowance and that he has refunded the surplus to the Exchequer.  Again, these are not my responsibilities.  I simply know this from my contacts with the other Accounting Officers.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, ours is probably the smallest or second smallest Department.  The SCU was the main reason for the increase.  Some staff were assigned to data protection, justice reform, the north east inner city initiative and internal records management and data protection encompassing the GDPR and so on.  Five staff were assigned to various support services such as HR, finance and private offices.  That accounts for the 14 extra staff.  The nature of the Department is that the amount of work for which we are responsible varies.</p></speech>

A significant number of staff join on secondment for a few years and allow us to draw on their experience gained in other sections of the Civil Service and the public service.  We have an above average percentage of staff on secondment, but they are all public servants, most of whom are civil servants.  The work comes and goes.  In 2018 there were changes to the Citizens' Assembly; the staffing level of the GIS was reduced and more staff were appointed to work on Brexit, justice reform and commissions of inquiry.  It varies each year.</p></speech>

Eir provides the switchboard in Government Buildings which is run by a couple of Eir telephonists who have been with us for a long time.</p><p> We have tendered for newspapers since, but it is very difficult to get value on them because they cost the same wherever they are bought.  We buy them from a newsagent on Leeson Street.  There was a company carrying out secretarial services for the Moriarty tribunal.  Obviously, we do not decide on that.  The Cregan commission employed an office equipment firm.  The Moriarty tribunal also employed another company.  I do not know what it was doing.

It involves the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other Departments.  That is understandable.  To move on to the Department of the Taoiseach's Vote, I want to explore redundancy and severance.  It has always been my understanding that a job is made redundant as opposed to an individual.  Is it then accurate to count it as a redundancy if someone new is recruited because there is a different officeholder?  Is it actually the job that is made redundant?  What I am really trying to get at is whether there is the same number of people.</p></speech>

In the event that there is a change of administration those rules are applied to the individuals.  The amounts can vary depending on service, salary and all sorts of things.  We apply the rules.  In 2016, as the Deputy can see, almost nothing was paid - &euro;47,000.  That looks to me as though one person got severance.  To look at 2017, as the Deputy will know there is quite a lot of turnover when the Taoiseach changes, even if the party stays the same.  Staff lose their jobs because the jobs go with the officeholder.  They get paid in accordance with finance circulars.</p></speech>

I understand that it cannot be predicted in advance but some of the legal costs arising from the Moriarty tribunal related to Deputy Lowry.  Am I right on that?  That was quite a long time ago.

The Deputy is talking about the Moriarty tribunal.  The McCracken tribunal, which was held previously, does not cost us money any more.  Ultimately, we spent approximately &euro;2 million on the Moriarty tribunal last year.  That is up to &euro;61.3 million.  Although I am not aware of the details, there are outstanding claims.

We guessed &euro;10 million in the 2017 Estimate and it ended up being &euro;6.5 million.  We guessed &euro;4.5 million last year and it ended up being &euro;2 million.

I think it has been discussed by the committee on a previous occasion with the State Claims Agency.  It is undoubtedly a difficulty for Accounting Officers because of the independence of commissions and tribunals to provide that level of detail.  We would certainly in the past have pressed for some estimate of what is the residual cost outstanding to try to include that.  However, it is a very difficult matter.  It may be that certain potential claimants have not even lodged a claim yet, so one cannot begin to estimate how much of that would survive through taxing and through challenge.</p></speech>

That went on almost every weekend over 12 months and it was a forerunner to a number of successful referenda.  I remember the first and second divorce referenda.  Had we had something like the Citizens' Assembly in advance, we may well have ended up saving money by virtue of the fact we were spending on a useful initiative.  I was on the Constitutional Convention, which was a forerunner to the Citizens' Assembly, and a number of referenda will happen as a consequence of that.</p> <p>  This is an historical figure.  I presume it is because it is set up under the Department of the Taoiseach that this happens.</p></speech>

The secretary of the convention and the secretary of the assembly would have been assigned by me, although, after that, I do not go near them because of the nature of their work.  It was effectively civil servants from the Department of the Taoiseach who designed and ran both of those.</p></speech>

What happens in general is that those reports are sent to the Oireachtas and the Government, and the Government responds to them.  As the Deputy knows, the convention gave rise to two or three referenda, that on marriage equality being the one people remember best and one on how old the President could be was defeated, and there may have been others.  We are going to have one in October on presidential voting rights which I believe dates back to the Constitutional Convention.  The Government or the Oireachtas either go with these things or they do not.  The assembly dealt with some policy matters, for example, on older people and climate change, and the one that is best known is the eighth amendment, which was the hardest piece of work done.</p> <p>  It is an example that reflects Deputy Aylward's point.  I could be asked to set up a Citizens' Assembly from scratch and I might have to find six or seven people from nowhere and they have to be quite skilled people because these are very difficult and sensitive jobs.  In this case, we have run the assembly since the arrival of the last Government.  It is not in place at the moment but there is talk of having another one on a few issues.</p></speech>

That is a subject of litigation between him and the former Minister for Justice.  Anyone who has done an inquiry for the State is given an indemnity in respect of the work they do in that inquiry.  That is the subject of litigation so there is every chance that it will give rise to costs, depending on the court's decision.</p></speech>

Why was there a delay with security vetting?</p></speech>

From memory, the recruitment ban was lifted around this time in 2017 and the reversal of pay cuts began.  There was a bit of a problem with ramping up and extra people coming in.  That gave rise to delays, both on panels and in security vetting.  It takes a while.</p></speech>

On page 7 of the appropriation account, the figures for Vote 28, Foreign Affairs and Trade, show a marked increase in expenditure from &euro;241,000 to &euro;667,000.  Was that dealt with?</p></speech>

It is not an enormous figure.  It is a function of the extent and duration of the President's official visits.  In the year in question there were quite a lot of State visits.  There was one to Cuba and quite a long one to Australia and New Zealand.  The further one goes and the longer one is away, the more expensive it is, including for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which has fewer people on the ground in some places.  That figure fluctuates depending on the extent of diplomatic engagement.</p></speech>

Mr. Fraser referred earlier to the core functions of the Department of the Taoiseach and, I suppose, of the Taoiseach.  One of them is engaging with the formulation and implementation of Government policy.  There is a focus at the moment on the relationship between different Departments, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach.  I think the national children's hospital overspend is an obvious case where people became aware of it whenever they did.  It is a very significant problem and is very much in the public domain at the moment.  What would be the Taoiseach's role in that area apart from it being raised at Cabinet level?  What would the reporting structures be?  If a board identifies a problem, which then goes to the Department of Health, which then goes to the Minister for Health, at what point does it get to the Taoiseach?  Is it only at Cabinet level that it would be brought to the Taoiseach's attention?  If his role is to formulate and implement Government policy, and it is Government policy to build the national children's hospital, what would his role be in terms of oversight?</p></speech>

Mr. Fraser is the Accounting Officer.  The Taoiseach held a number of meetings with the Opposition to brief them on what are problems in this process.  This is the place where we tease out those problems in terms of cost, in my view.  What is the estimated cost of this commission and how much has been spent thus far?  What is the anticipated overall cost as opposed to the initial estimation?  I ask Mr. Fraser to talk us through those costs.</p></speech>

I attended one meeting and I can have my own perspective and others will have theirs but from Mr. Fraser's perspective, as the Accounting Officer for the Department of the Taoiseach, how have we arrived at a situation where the cost has increased from less than &euro;5 million to &euro;20 million?</p></speech>

The Oireachtas committed initially to writing a cheque for less than &euro;5 million.  The cost has now increased to &euro;20 million.  I appreciate the point that is being made by the Accounting Officer, that there has been consultation with Oireachtas Members and Opposition leaders, but people will be concerned about the fact that costs have increased from &euro;5 million to &euro;20 million and, possibly, &euro;20 million plus.  Mr. Fraser, as the Accounting Officer, will have to sign off on the cheque.  As of yet, we have no indication of when a report will issue from this commission.  Was an interim report sought?</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform arranges for an informal collection of data on costs on a quarterly basis for commissions of investigation, tribunals of inquiry, commissions to inquire into matters and various reports, for example, the Ferns report.  Those are the four key headings.  We write to the Departments on an administrative basis quarterly to get that information so we can see what the actual costs are.</p></speech>

As Mr. Fraser said earlier and previously, we have looked at commissions of investigation as being a speedier and more cost-effective mechanism for dealing with these issues than the previous tribunals of inquiry might have previously been.  As the Deputy will see, some of the costs referenced here are significantly lower for commissions of investigation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>tribunals of inquiry.  That mechanism is one that is being implemented going forward.  Just to be clear, the Department's role in this process is to collate the data from the relevant Departments on a quarterly basis.  We will try to furnish the committee with that information if we can.</p></speech>

There should be no new national campaigns run by the unit.  Where expenditure was committed but not yet spent, it should be redirected to non-contentious campaigns like Healthy Ireland or Brexit preparation, which has been done.  The Government Information Service, GIS, should continue to have a co-ordinating and supporting role for national cross-government communications, as has always been the case, but campaigns should be led and funded by the relevant line Departments, which is being done.  Project Ireland 2040 should be the responsibility of the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board, which is outside our Department.  That was done.  International communications - Global Ireland, the Security Council campaign and the diaspora work - should be led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  All other activities should continue as before, including <i>www.merrionstreet.ie</i>, central support services, providing services to the media, managing media events and producing communication material across all platforms.<br/><br/>The committee endorsed these recommendations, which also called for us to continue the streamlining work, the capacity building work, the continuing professional development work, the single Government identity project, which members will see being rolled out, the <i>www.gov.ie</i>project, which we are doing, and efficiency measures, for example, rationalisation and consolidated buying.  It was also recommended that the research survey proceed, but that has not gone ahead yet.  All my recommendations, which the committee endorsed, have happened.</p></speech>

Mr. Fraser mentioned the word "President".  There was an account published, which is not an audited account and which is not a detailed explanation of what the breakdown is.  This is not about the current President.  For the record, I voted for the President and my party campaigned for him.  However, just because it is the President, do not drag an individual into what is taxpayers' money and the expenditure of it.  There may need to be adjustments.  I have asked for an explanation for the 1938 Act.  Perhaps the President should be given more money in terms of this allowance.  A refund was given, which is great, but it is about appropriate oversight.  I am just asking a basic question, which is whether it includes wardrobe.</p></speech>

What I am most respectfully asking Mr. Fraser is whether he can give us a breakdown, without the amounts necessarily, because it is perfectly legitimate that it might include wardrobe.  Mr. Fraser might inquire from the Accounting Officer, with whom he obviously has a relationship.  If it is the same audit function between one and the other, I am sure it is not rocket science to ask the question.  Can we get a broader list of what kind of things it includes and whether it includes things like wardrobe?  I am just interested to know.  It is perfectly appropriate that it might.  I just want to know and the public might be entitled to that too.</p></speech>

The Department of Finance will be here in a couple of weeks and is on notice that we will ask about this payment being made from the Central Fund, as other payments from the Central Fund get made.  We can ask that Secretary General whether there is a mechanism for accounting for that onward payment.  That is something we will tease out.  The public sees it very simply.  There was expenditure at June 2017 of &euro;8.648 million for the President's Establishment and most of it was Voted expenditure while &euro;317,000 was not.  The public will ask why, if the Comptroller and Auditor General can audit &euro;8.3 million of the &euro;8.6 million, someone cannot audit the other &euro;317,000.  Of the fund, 95% is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  From a layperson's point of view, it is not unreasonable to ask why that is not 100%.  That is another day's work and probably a matter for policy or legislation.</p></speech>

We are joined this afternoon by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, and he is accompanied by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.</p> <p>  Before we get into the afternoon's business, I want to comment on the private session we had before the break.  Two items came up in the private session and I want to put the result of that on the public record.</p> <p>  The first item dealt with correspondence Nos. 1923, 1924 and 1929.  One was from the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, and the other two were from the Ceann Comhairle's office in respect of the same letter.  The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality wrote to us saying that they believed we went outside our remit in our discussions on the Vote for the Irish Prison Service three weeks ago.  I informed the committee that I had spoken to the Ceann Comhairle yesterday evening on the matter.  The Ceann Comhairle has indicated that the matter is being considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, I think next week.  I am satisfied, as Chairman, that we were within our brief and remit when we discussed the Vote.  Without further discussion, and to inform people, I expect the CPP to deal with the matter appropriately and that the Committee of Public Accounts will continue its work within its remit, as we always do.</p> <p>  I shall move on to the next item.  We had legal advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor, OPLA, in Leinster House.  On 28 November 2018, the committee agreed to seek a briefing from the office in respect of section 172 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, following the committee's discussion in respect of NAMA's correspondence on the topic regarding Project Nantes.  We had a detailed briefing.  This follows on from the letter from NAMA, No. 1761, which we published last December.  Essentially, the parliamentary legal advisor advised us that she agrees with the interpretation of section 172, as outlined in the NAMA letter before Christmas.  We received a detailed briefing but that is strictly privileged so I am not in a position to publish or distribute that.</p><p>A clear distinction was made between when NAMA sells property over which it has a charge and when it can separately sell a loan or a loan book.  The parliamentary legal advisor said section 172 applies to where NAMA sells a property over which it  has a charge but does not apply in respect of a loan sale.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to correct me if I say anything wrong on this because he is familiar with this issue.  A section 172 declaration is not required in respect of a loan sale even though NAMA has been seeking one in many situations.  It was not legally required, however.  It was probably an extra element of assurance for NAMA but it was not legally required.  It is another day's work but not for this committee.  The legislation did not specifically deal with the sale of loans.  Only the sale of property was dealt with when the NAMA legislation was being established, all of ten years ago.  The legal advice to us stated a director of a company that was involved in purchasing a property or even a loan book from NAMA is not necessarily a connected person.  A person is only a connected person under the strict criteria laid down in the Act.  In layman's English, that is if one is an associated debtor, or if the organisation buying is a corporate body, a subsidiary or a related company, or if the person is a nominee of the debtor.  A director of a company can be a director of a company that is involved in these transactions that may not be a nominee of the original debtor.  There was a presumption because a director was involved in this that it was in contravention of the NAMA legislation.  NAMA is satisfied it was not and the parliamentary legal advisor has confirmed that view to us today.  I am just putting this on the public record because many people have been asking us for the up-to-date position on it.  This committee accepts the position as set out by NAMA and as now confirmed by the OPLA.</p></speech>

We are examining the Appropriation Accounts for 2017: Vote 3 - Office of the Attorney General; Vote 5 - Office of the Director Public Prosecutions; and Vote 6 - Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  In case the public thinks otherwise, the witnesses present are not the Attorney General, Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and Chief State Solicitor, but the Accounting Officers who are responsible.  They are not necessarily the legal people involved.  We are joined from the Office of the Attorney General by Mr. Damien Moloney, director general, Ms Lynda O'Regan and Mr. David Donnelly.  We are joined from the Office of the Director Public Prosecutions by Mr. Barry Donoghue, deputy director of public prosecutions and Accounting Officer, Ms Elizabeth Howlin, Ms Helena Kiely and Mr. Declan Hoban.  From the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, we are joined by Ms Maria Browne, Chief State Solicitor.  I did not realise until now that she was present.  She is joined by Mr. Owen Wilson and Mr. Michael Fallon.  It is a bit unusual to have three Accounting Officers here together but they are all in the legal sphere.  To help the committee, we decided to have the three groups together.  The committee wants to deal with each of the 40 Votes as voted expenditure.  We do not have 40 separate meetings so we have to combine some groups.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off or switched to airplane mode.  Leaving them in silent mode can interfere with the recording system.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put to them clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>We shall start with the opening statement of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I propose that we take the three opening statements together and then move on to questions from members.  We will try to deal with this as a group meeting.  Since members are not all legal experts, their questions might sometimes stray across two offices.  The witnesses know their demarcation lines and can assist us when it comes to answering questions.</p></speech>

The 2017 Appropriation Account for Vote 3 - Office of the Attorney General shows gross expenditure of just over &euro;14.5 million in respect of the programme for the provision of legal advice to the Government, Departments and offices, and for legislative drafting services.  The expenditure included Exchequer funding of &euro;2.2 million for the Law Reform Commission, LRC.  Appropriations-in-aid totalled &euro;668,000 for the year, almost all of which related to retained pension-related deductions from staff salaries.  A net surplus of just over &euro;1 million was due for surrender at the end of 2017.<br/><br/><b><i></i></b>The Office of the Chief State Solicitor also provides legal services to central government Departments and offices, including representing their interests in actions taken on behalf of, or against, the State.  This office does not charge for its services. <br/><br/>The 2017 Appropriation Account for the office's Vote records gross expenditure of &euro;33.1 million.  This mainly comprised administration costs of &euro;18.3 million and payments of fees to counsel totalling &euro;13.6 million.  Appropriations-in-aid totalled &euro;1.1 million.  The surplus for surrender at the year's end was &euro;349,000. <br/><br/>At the end of 2017, the accumulated value of taxed costs awarded to the State but not yet recovered totalled &euro;9.6 million.  This was marginally up on the comparable position in 2016.  Receipts in 2017 totalled &euro;397,000, representing only about 4% of the 2017 year-end figure. <br/><br/>In my report on the Appropriation Account for Vote 6, I drew attention to a material level of non-compliance with EU and national procurement rules in respect of contracts operated by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor in 2017.  This is explained by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.<br/><br/>The DPP is the State's chief prosecutor in alleged criminal cases, and is independent in the exercise of her functions. <br/><br/>The 2017 Appropriation Account for Vote 5, for the office of the director, records total gross expenditure of &euro;41.7 million, charged to a single programme.  Administration costs, including salaries, amounted to &euro;16.8 million.  Payments to State solicitors, who act outside the Dublin region on behalf of the director, amounted to &euro;6.6 million.  Fees paid to counsel retained by the director totalled &euro;16.4 million in 2017.  The original voted provision for this area of spending was &euro;14.5 million.  The additional expenditure of &euro;1.9 million was attributed to a greater than expected level of activity in certain courts.  To accommodate the additional spending on fees, a Supplementary Estimate was voted.  This allocated expected savings on other subheads to meet the additional fees, and increased the resources available to the director by a net &euro;418,000.  At the year end, the net outturn on the Vote was a surplus of just under &euro;190,000, which was due for surrender to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

The Attorney General's Office has three of those constituent offices but has two Accounting Officers.  I hope that will all become apparent in the opening statements.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and committee for the invitation to discuss the 2017 Appropriation Account of the Office of the Attorney General and the 2017 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am pleased to report that the office did not feature in the annual report.  I am joined by my colleagues Ms Lynda O'Regan and Mr. David Donnelly.</p> <p>  I will commence by touching on the work of the Office of the Attorney General.  Our primary function is to support the Attorney General in discharging his functions as legal adviser to the Government.  In that regard, the office provides two main services to our clients - legal advice and legislative drafting.  The scope and variety of the legal work is broad, with new areas of work being added continuously.</p><p>The advisory section of the office is organised into five specialist groups covering all major legal specialisms.  This set-up allows the members of the group to become expert in the areas to which they are assigned and to provide a high level of expertise to clients.  To develop the expertise of the legal advisory staff further and to encourage close collaboration with Departments, the office has been running a secondment programme since 2006 whereby advisory counsel from the office are recruited and placed as legal advisers within Departments.  At the end of 2017, the office had 24 legal advisers seconded across 14 Departments and offices.  The office also assigns an advisory counsel as legal counsellor to the permanent representative in Brussels.  In March 2017, a second advisory counsel was seconded to the permanent representative to deal with Brexit in particular.  The office had two advisory counsel working as seconded national experts in the European Commission and another in the European Parliament.</p><p> The legislative drafting service is provided through the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  That is a constituent office, organised into four groups, each serving a number of specific Departments.  This enables the drafters to build up a high level of familiarity with the work of the client Department, which in turn facilitates drafting on complex topics.  Much of the work of the office, particularly the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, is primarily driven by the Government's legislative programme.  Both the advisory and drafting sides of the office hold meetings and are in regular contact with client Departments to allow for ongoing review of the services being provided.</p><p> The administration side of the office provides administrative support to both the advisory and drafting sides.  It is organised into a number of business units covering human resources, finance, library and knowledge management, information technology, change management, training and development, corporate services and registry.  Senior management from the administration side participates in the office's management committee, currently called the management committee and previously a management advisory committee.  There is also a joint Chief State Solicitor's office-Attorney General's office management committee, which meets less frequently but acts as an umbrella for the constituent offices.</p><p> The office constantly re-assesses the need to provide legal services to its wide range of clients and so seeks to ensure that its lawyers are fully trained and resourced.  This involves making sure that legal staff are fully expert in their areas of legal work and have at their disposal all resources to do their work to the highest standard required by Government.  Knowledge management and information sharing is a central feature of how we operate.  Precedents, procedures and practices are recorded and made available as appropriate to staff.</p><p> With regard to the 2017 appropriation account, the office operated an administrative gross budget of &euro;15.66 million of which the outturn was &euro;14.54 million.  A significant proportion, &euro;11.26 million, close to 72%, of our budget was allocated to salaries.  This high proportion reflects the fact that the office is a legal professional organisation providing legal services to the Government and Departments and does not have expenditure programmes as such.  The next largest allocation is the &euro;2.24 million, 14.3% of our budget, for the Law Reform Commission, the sole office under our aegis.  That money is channelled through our Vote as a grant-in-aid.  The remaining &euro;2.16 million, 14% of the budget, is allocated to training, IT, premises, telecoms and so on.  During 2017, the office had savings in excess of &euro;1 million.  The majority of that excess, approximately &euro;800,000, arose in subhead A1, salaries.  Some &euro;156,000 arose in A2, due to reduced dependence on contract legal expertise.  Some &euro;52,000 was from our subhead concerning the Law Reform Commission.</p><p> The savings in salaries arose due to delays in the planned filling of vacancies due to the lack of availability of panels and security vetting.  The savings in A2 arose due to lesser reliance on contract drafting expertise from outside the office.  The savings on the Law Reform Commission were due mainly to staff changes.  In all areas of expenditure, the office closely monitors and controls expenditure to ensure appropriate use of funds and maximum value.  Each month, the office's management committee is briefed on the office's financial position including such issues as the formulation of annual budgets and measures required to meet savings or staffing targets imposed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p> The office operates a financial management system which greatly assists me and also informs the monthly presentation on financial matters to the members of management committee.  There is ongoing development of an interface with the financial management system and the case records management system, ACME, to allow for the development of costing as well as enhanced financial and non-financial management reports.</p><p> The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office has a separate Accounting Officer but we work closely with it through our constituent office of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  We have a joint Attorney General's office-Chief State Solicitor's office management advisory committee which meets a number of times throughout the year.  In addition, we share a number of IT systems and knowledge management initiatives to ensure efficiencies and expertise are shared.  In conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's office, the office has an audit committee which includes three external members, one of whom acts as chair.  Each year, the committee agrees a programme of audits and the resulting reports and recommendations are presented to the local management committees and made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p> The committee will be aware of the Government's extensive legislative programme which places heavy demands on the office, both in the formulation of advice on legislative provisions as well as their actual drafting.  The increasing pace in the delivery of Government services means that much of the advice has to be provided and the drafting carried out in a way that meets that increasing pace, at relatively short notice.  There is an increasing demand for advisory and drafting services.  Government amendments should be pointed out specifically.  Almost 300 Private Member's Bills have been introduced since 2016.  The nature of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union has yet to be determined.  However, Brexit has resulted in increased requests for advisory and drafting services, often at short notice.</p><p> The law is constantly changing, through case law, new legislation and the way it is interpreted or reinterpreted.  New developments of law emerge continually, including through the actions of the European Union and its Court of Justice as well as the European Court of Human Rights and changes in international law.  Our main challenge will be continuing to adapt to ensure we meet the demands of our clients, including Departments and the needs of the Government.  I thank the Chairman and committee members for their attention.  If members have any questions, I am at their disposal.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Owen Wilson, assistant chief State solicitor, and Mr. Michael Fallon, head of corporate services.  I am pleased to be in a position to say that my office does not feature in the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 2017.  As requested, I have provided the committee with details of expenditure in 2017 and an update on expenditure in 2018.</p> <p>  As members will have seen from the briefing material, my office deals with a very wide range of legal work on behalf of the State.  The office is a constituent part of the Office of the Attorney General and the legal services we provide range from litigation, to commercial, to advisory, to property and other transactional services.  The office has five legal divisions, each headed by an assistant chief State solicitor and organised by area of law, and a corporate services division.  Legal divisions are further organised into sections dealing with specific types of legal matters.  The corporate services division provides organisational and management services which support the legal work of the office.  The two main areas of spend for my office in 2017 were payroll and counsel fees.</p> <p>  Within the administration subheads, payroll is by far the largest expenditure at &euro;15.7 million in 2017.  This equates to 47.4% of the entire expenditure from the Vote for 2017.  The authorised staffing number for 2019 is 275 and we are in the process of filling a number of vacancies.  The ability to recruit in a timely manner and retain specialist staff, both legal and administrative, is an ongoing challenge.  Expenditure on the remaining administrative subheads, such as staff training and development, library and information services, knowledge management, utilities, building maintenance, photocopying and document preparation, telephone and postal services, and ICT facilities, amounted to &euro;2.6 million or 7.8% of total expenditure in 2017.</p> <p>  The provision of legal services is spread across five legal divisions, each headed by an assistant chief State solicitor, which is equivalent to assistant secretary.  These divisions are the administrative law division; the advisory, commercial and employment law division; the constitutional and State litigation division; the justice division; and the State property division.</p> <p>  With regard to challenges, we are a demand-led office and there is a direct and pronounced correlation between our clients' issues and the services we provide to them.  Aside from our transactional work, by and large it is difficult to forecast with any degree of certainty the exact scale and extent of litigation which may be taken against the State in any given year.</p><p>Some of the work can arise at very short notice and outside of normal office hours.  Specialist work requires the ongoing development and maintenance of the appropriate expertise, and the ability to respond to new developments in the law is a continuing requirement.</p><p> Expenditure on legal services includes counsel fees, general law expenses and external legal services, and accounted for 44.8% of overall expenditure in 2017.  The main area of expenditure under this heading is on fees paid to counsel, which in 2017 accounted for 41% of the entire expenditure of the office.</p><p> The bulk of the expenditure on counsel fees is, to a large extent, dependent on the level of activity in the courts at any given time and so is always difficult to forecast accurately.  Recent years have seen an increase in the level of complexity of the work being handled by the office in areas such as judicial review, immigration and asylum law, environmental law, and commercial and EU litigation, and this has resulted in increased spend on counsel, including senior counsel.  The management of expenditure on counsel fees is a key activity for my office, and there are significant controls in place to manage this expenditure.</p><p> In terms of oversight and risk, as my colleague mentioned, the office maintains an audit committee jointly with the Office of the Attorney General.  The committee includes three external representatives, all of whom, including the chair, are from the private sector.  It has been in place for a number of years and meets regularly.  Internal audit services are tendered externally and our current auditors were engaged following a joint Attorney General's office-Chief State Solicitor's office, AGO-CSSO, competitive tendering process in 2017.</p><p> The office maintains a risk register which is reviewed every six months.  Progress is monitored by the office's management board, together with a number of joint AGO-CSSO committees, including the risk management committee and the audit committee.</p><p> I will do my best to assist the committee in its consideration of the 2017 account for my office.  In the event that I do not have the information available to me here today, I will do my best to provide any outstanding material within two weeks.</p></speech>

I will highlight some points from the opening statement that might be of assistance to the committee.</p> <p>  The number of files received during the year 2017 was approximately 13,600, which was 500 up on the previous year, but I make the point that the sheer number of files coming into the office does not represent the extent of work required in those cases.  Particularly in the area of white-collar crime, there is a tendency for these files to be very large.  For example, I understand the data on our system for those files that we dealt with relating to the banking cases amounted to 388 GB.  I am not technically minded but those of the members who are technically minded will appreciate that amounts to a lot of data.  Some of these files can be very large.  That is also reflected in other areas.  For example, in murder cases, sometimes gangland cases, a very large amount of data comes into our office and has to be assessed and analysed.  That affects the amount of work that is required in those cases and affects the throughput.</p> <p>  Another factor I will highlight is that, as the Chief State Solicitor said, sometimes we are required to follow what others do.  The number of court cases and court sittings can affect the amount of work we do and the amount of fees paid.  There has been an increase, from four to six, in the number of judges sitting continually in the Central Criminal Court.  That increases the number of cases being processed by the courts and increases pressure on the fee area.  Similarly, since I last appeared before this committee, in 2015, there are now two Special Criminal Courts sitting simultaneously and that increases the number of cases being processed by that court and the fees payable.</p> <p>  Regarding developments since I last appeared before the committee, I will mention a number of issues.  First, on victims of crime, the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 has been passed by the Oireachtas.  We set up a small unit in July 2015, called the victims liaison unit, to ensure that the office complies with its requirements relating to victims and their families.  That unit has been very proactive and has engaged with outside agencies, ensuring training and so forth for garda&iacute;.</p> <p>  We also receive, through that unit, requests from victims for reasons for decisions not to prosecute.  Looking at a three-year period from 2016 to 2018, we received approximately 1,800 requests for reasons from victims.  We also received requests for reviews of decisions because, under the victims directive and under the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, a victim is entitled to ask us to reconsider a decision not to prosecute.  Over that same period, we received 637 requests for reviews.  Approximately 40% of those cases relate to sexual offence complaints, and in a small number of cases we have reversed the decision not to prosecute and instituted a prosecution.  In terms of our requirements for victims' rights, this also has an effect on court processes.  We have to ensure that prosecutors, whether solicitors or counsel, are fully in a position to meet the requirements of victims under the directive.</p> <p>  The work of the office in the area of international matters falls into two parts.  The first is extradition, where we seek the return of someone from another country to stand trial in Ireland.  The second area relates to mutual assistance requests where we are looking for evidence in another country.  I mention in my opening statement that the area of mutual assistance has grown quite heavily, and over the period from 2015 to 2017, the number of requests for mutual assistance doubled.  That was largely driven by requests for information in the area of electronic evidence.  Many requests go to America seeking electronic evidence from the large service providers there.</p> <p>  As part of the response to the banking crisis, we established a small special financial unit which dealt with all the banking cases over the years.  Since the conclusion of those cases, the unit still operates and deals with other white-collar crime cases in close liaison with the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.</p> <p>  In my opening statement, I mentioned issues to do with information and communications technology.  I will highlight two of those.  In some of those, we are proactively involved with others in the area, which is obviously very important in the modern world.  One of the matters which we piloted is the electronic transmission of disclosure material to both prosecution counsel and defence solicitors.  The Chairman and committee may be aware that in prosecution cases an important part of the work is to ensure there is disclosure to the defence on matters which may assist to undermine the prosecution case or enhance the defence case.  A lot of that material can be quite sensitive and we have put in place a secure electronic transfer system with defence solicitors and counsel.  That is operating at present in the Central Criminal Court and will be extended into the Circuit Court later this year.</p> <p>  We are also heavily involved, through Ms Helena Kiely, in the so-called criminal justice operational hub, which is a very important project from the point of view of the criminal justice system generally.  It will allow data to be shared from the beginning of a case right through, from the Garda to ourselves, to the courts system, to the probation service and prison service.  In due course it will be able to produce statistics, which is a problem in the criminal justice area because everybody assesses cases on a different basis, which means statistics do not match from one agency to another.</p> <p>  In terms of the expenditure for 2017, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, the largest area of cost is fees to counsel, which came to &euro;16.4 million.  As I stated, that is largely driven by the number of trials which are set by the courts.  Any increase in business will affect the amount of fees paid to counsel.  Extra sittings of the Central Criminal Court and of the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, which have happened, and the new Court of Appeal are all matters which generate further court work and extra pressure on the fees side.</p> <p>  I will end with two issues that are challenges for the future.  The obvious one is Brexit in terms of the criminal justice system.  From our point of view, we are working with the Department of Justice and Equality in terms of contingency measures.  We are involved in two groups looking at mutual assistance, extradition and data protection.  On extradition, at some point at the end of March, it seems that we will be working under a different system with the United Kingdom.  Most of our extradition arrangements are with it.  We have been working with the people there on the basis of the European arrest warrant, which is a slimmed down version of extradition which works quite well.  We will have to move into another area, which will be challenging.</p> <p>  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is a very important part of Government policy.  One aspect of that commission's report referred to the role of garda&iacute; in terms of prosecution work.  The Chairman may be aware that the Garda has a heavy role in prosecution work.  In most cases in the District Court outside Dublin and in Dublin, the Garda decides whether there should be a prosecution and conducts that prosecution.  It is an unusual model from that point of view.  The issue was looked at 20 years ago or so by the Nally group, which did not recommend any change.  If we were to move away from the present system where the Garda essentially prosecutes cases in court, there would need to be an important analysis of what that would involve.  It seems to me a considerable cost would be involved in replacing inspectors and superintendents in courts with lawyers.</p><p>That is something that I think we will be working on with the Department of Justice and Equality and Garda, in terms of working out some method to see how that recommendation can be implemented.  I think that is going to be an important challenge for the prosecution service.</p></speech>

Having had that option, we had a contract with a particular supplier.  That supplier has left this particular segment of the market.  Having left this particular segment of the market, it did not stop business; it just left this segment of the market that provided this audit service to smaller outfits like ourselves.  So we had to go back out to the market and seek a new supplier and tender for that.  In the meantime we have obtained a new agent providing this service.  Those reports are commissioned by the audit committee with the three outside members.</p></speech>

That is something we also consider in terms of the time and effort involved in pursuing the debt in terms of our staff's time and in employing taxation and cost accountants for that purpose.  I should correct myself in that sense when I said that cost recovery is done in-house.  In more recent times, with the transfer of management of costs against the State having passed to the National Treasury Management Agency and the State Claims Agency since last year, cost accountants are involved in taxing costs so that is another cost.  That is one of the things we would take into account in assessing overall whether it is worthwhile pursuing.</p></speech>

In terms of costs, when somebody external is being brought in to draft legislation when there is a capacity issue, does it cost more in net terms to bring in an external person or is it cheaper to have it done in-house, if the staff was there theoretically?  Is there an added expense to bringing in drafters?  Do they get more per hour than the person who works in the office every day?</p></speech>

The arrangement has changed over the years so in about 2001, the arrangement was that they got paid the equivalent of an assistant secretary's salary and they were located within the premises.  They have not been located on the premises for quite a while with the effluxion of time and Revenue practice and so on.  The current incumbent lives abroad and he is paid on a daily rate and in net terms the daily rate works out at about a couple of hundred days each year.  It varies depending on workload because he is piecemeal and he gets paid a daily rate.  That daily rate still comes in at more or less the equivalent of an assistant secretary salary if he worked the complement of 200 days.</p></speech>

GDPR is a huge part of this and agreements have been made with all of the agencies to allow for the data modelling.  We are at the modelling stage of how this would work in practice.  There is an overreaching data sharing agreement that is being drafted at the moment.  We are not at a stage where live data are being shared or the projects are up and running but the two projects that it will focus on to begin with are charge sheets and court outcomes, so that information can be at the centre for all agencies with relevant information.  It is looking to emulate the Causeway system, which has been in operation in Northern Ireland for some time and which has been a great success in having real-time information for all agencies.  That is also useful as a predictive measure for Departments on where resources will be needed.</p></speech>

In bedding this down for the future, do the witnesses consider this to be just a blip in terms of a minority Government or a confidence and supply Government with the make up of the D&aacute;il?  If the workload seems to have been constantly increasing, would it not be better to try to crystallise some of the staff into permanent positions, rather than constantly relying on external people to come in for continuity in the office?  Mr. Moloney might address that.</p></speech>

The structures have changed in response to where we are.  The structures do not necessarily anticipate political decisions made by the electorate or elsewhere but the structures have changed.  In a manner of speaking, we have become more responsive to the needs of Government in terms of drafting Committee Stage amendments to a greater number of Private Members' Bills.  We obviously do not do so for all 300 because the system would have ground to a halt had we been doing so, but we do it for the amendments to Bills the Government shows an active interest in, which is a smaller subset.  The structures have changed in the sense that the public law expertise used to just vest in the Office of the Attorney General.  To the extent that the Attorney General offers any assistance or support to the Oireachtas, it was that every Government Bill that arrived on the floor of the Houses of the Oireachtas, was accompanied by a warranty from the Attorney General of the day that the Bill was constitutional and legally sound.  Clearly, if there are many Private Members' Bills, an equivalent is needed to make that operable on the side of the Oireachtas, and while the Attorney General supports the Oireachtas in that respect, he is the adviser to the Government.  The structural changes have been around the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser, the elevation in the rank of the legal adviser, the increasing of the numbers of staff in the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser and the creating of the public law expertise.  I have a very good working relationship with the parliamentary legal adviser and that is important.  It is important to both branches of Government to make sure that in a co-operative sense, the public law expertise the State has is shared in an equitable way, so that the State does not find itself funding two separate services that do not co-operate where it is possible for them to co-operate.</p><p>I could answer further but I do not want to take up all of the Deputy's time.</p></speech>

In recent years, the Comptroller and Auditor General has been inquiring about that with us in terms of our processes and one of the things we did was we converted an informal meeting with the LRC into a more formal one, so it was a structured meeting process, and that is an added check or control.  Basically, it prepares its own accounts and, for reasons that are statutory in origin, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform presents its accounts and the Taoiseach presents our accounts.</p></speech>

I sign off each month on a regular statement from the commission about what it has done and what it needs to do for the coming month in terms of the drawdown for the grant.  I get to see closely what it is doing and when there are new programmes involving finance or expenditure it meets with us.  That is what I meant about the informal element; we have a lot of informal meetings because the commission has a lot of plans but there are formal structures in place.  I do what I refer to as "walk the land" where I visit Departments or outlets &ndash; we have secondees in Departments as well &ndash; and I do that with the LRC.  The visits are a form out outreach but we have formalised that more so it is not just a case of dropping in.</p></speech>

In terms of incoming staff, the Public Appointments Service, PAS, does external competitions for us and we do a number of our own competitions as well.  We do specialist competitions in certain areas of the legal stream.  We find, for example, that is difficult to get staff in IT and we are going to the market again to fill those positions.  It is difficult to source IT expertise from within the service.  Another issue is the periods of notice people in the private sector have to give before they can come in, which could be three months plus.  We had a situation where we were waiting a considerable time for somebody to come in.  It is a combination of the time to do the competitions, the time that it takes people to come in through vetting but also the speed with which some people can leave the office.  Following the mobility that was introduced across the Civil Service, we have a lot of people who are from outside Dublin and they take the opportunity to move, which adds to the situation in terms of the throughput.</p></speech>

They may have learning or speech difficulties or other difficulties.  We have done an element of training with State solicitors.  At a conference 18 months ago, a speech and language therapist spoke to the prosecutors in our office and to State solicitors about language difficulties.

The reason we have directors on boards, be that a nominee, private sector shareholder or the State, is because there is a value in that, but that value is hard to define because of the obligations of the director to the board as well as to the shareholder, leaving the director in a very difficult situation.  I would imagine, for any director in that situation, there are challenges.  We see value in it as well so there remain civil servants on boards.</p></speech>

Mr. Moloney, referenced challenges in his opening statement and cited the legislative programme as an issue that has added to the workload of his office.  Please talk me through that.  There is a constitutional provision that the office can only give advice to Government.  I mean the role of the Attorney General is to formulate advice on the provisions of a Bill and advice in terms of drafting Bills.  Is that the constitutional position?  Is that what Mr. Moloney was saying?</p></speech>

The drafting of legislation, and the provision of legislation, I would say, is included in the scriptor advice.</p></speech>

That is why I want Mr. Moloney to talk me through exactly what he does and his role.  He said "both in the formulation of advice on legislative provisions as well as their actual drafting".

I find that extraordinary.  It is part of the problem as we in the Opposition come up against advice given by the Office of the Attorney General.  That is the position.</p> <p>  Teachta Connolly dealt with an issue in Mr. Donoghue's opening statement.  He spoke about the largest single area of the &euro;40.9 million cost being &euro;16.4 million arising from the fees paid to counsel who prosecute cases on behalf of the director.  He states the establishment of the new Court of Appeal in 2014 and the Special Criminal Court in 2015 have contributed to a steady rise in fees in counsel expenditure in recent years.  Is the increased expenditure down to an increase in volume, in cost to counsel or both?</p></speech>

In other words, a lengthy trial will cost much money and some of these cases are quite lengthy.  If the Special Criminal Court is dealing with lengthy cases and there are two courts sitting, there would simply be a greater volume of cases going through the courts.  Similarly, if there is an extra one or two judges sitting in the Central Criminal Court, the throughput of cases is just higher.  That is the primary reason for the increase in fees.</p></speech>

If it goes outside that, a senior person in the office would assess the higher fee, if necessary.  If it goes beyond that, we must seek sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for a higher fee.  There are limits beyond which we must seek sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

The standard fee for a murder case is just over &euro;7,000 for senior counsel.  That would involve all the preparation work that counsel would have to put into that case and the first day of the case.  With respect to value for money, those fees have been cut heavily as part of the general cutting of fees.  They were reduced on two occasions by 8%.  An additional 10% was taken off those fees across the board in 2011.  The Bar Council has made a reasonable case that the 10% cut was not reflected in other cuts to professional fees and so forth.  The fees have been cut back quite a bit.  The increase in fees reflects the throughput of cases in the courts because of more court sittings and more cases being processed.</p></speech>

Deputies should bear in mind that with commercial matters, a bit like complicated specialist fields in which particular firms engage in that we would not necessarily, as a process point that advice is not always internal to the Office of the Attorney General.  We would not necessarily have some of the skill sets to the degree required for certain things.</p></speech>

We must fish around, as they say.  Perhaps the witnesses will help us with others who have legal powers to prosecute in their own right.</p> <p>  The next question I want to ask Mr. Donoghue I will put simply.  I am looking at the DPP's annual report.  There is lots of good information in it, and I know that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does a lot of prosecution work in the District Court.  I think it is mentioned somewhere in the report that this issue was being looked at, or there is some reference to it.  What was the reference?</p></speech>

The Commission on the Future of Policing's report in a short passage recommended that essentially garda&iacute; be pulled out of criminal cases in the District Court and that some other system be put in their place, either a national prosecution service or an extended State solicitor service.  It is a very short passage, and teasing it out would be difficult.  It might be of interest to the committee that when this was looked at 20 years or so ago by the Nally group, it said 400 more lawyers would be needed to replace garda&iacute; in the courts, so it does not come at no cost.</p></speech>

I think we understood that that inspector gets an additional allowance of something like &euro;5,000 a year for doing court prosecutions.  The Committee of Public Accounts members on the day were amazed by the outstanding value for money.  We felt that if those thousands of cases that are dealt with for a minimal cost of &euro;5,000 per prosecuting inspector, as the case may be, in a number of courts around the country, they would cost multiples of multiples of that if there were to be a State agency or legal people doing the prosecution.  In all my time here it seemed the best value for money the State had achieved in anything.  From the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts, then, we would want a costing on that.</p></speech>

I have no scientific evidence for this claim but I think the cost of what they are being paid relative to what it could otherwise be is very minimal.</p> <p>  Turning to the number of prosecutions received, the volume of work, the throughput, the cost and the staff, I am looking at chapter 2.1, page 14, of the DPP's annual report.  Mr. Donoghue will be familiar with the report.</p></speech>

In other words, most of the cases going to the District Court are dealt with by the Garda, so there is a framework of delegation.  Over time, we had discussions with Garda headquarters and we delegated more cases which we were happy it could make a decision on.  During that period, therefore, we delegated more cases to the Garda so it would not have to send the files to us, and this affects the number of files coming to us.</p></speech>

There was a change in the practice of letting cases out.  It is called a general direction and it changes from time to time.  The details are on our website.

What is the office's success rate in the courts?  Is the conviction rate 94%?  Is that at District Court level?

To explain briefly, if we decide to prosecute somebody in the District Court, the case is usually dealt with by the Garda.  It prosecutes the case and it does not give us a return necessarily in all those cases.  We do not have the statistics.  Our statistics are purely on indictable cases so cases in the Circuit Court, Central Criminal Court and Special Criminal Court.</p></speech>

The Court Service's outcomes, which will be a conviction or an acquittal, is one of the first messages they want to put into the centre so that agencies like ours will be able to get accurate statistics at District Court, Circuit Court and Central Criminal Court levels.  The project, which is called the criminal justice hub, is mirroring what is available in Northern Ireland.  It is trying to automate messages from different criminal justice agencies into a central hub.  They are collated so that we will have an accurate position on individual accused but also in respect of statistics, that is, the number of incidents, the number of offences directed, the number of convictions and the number of people who are likely to serve sentences this year.  It will provide a statistical analysis of figures that every agency will know is accurate and can refer to going forward.</p></speech>

Perhaps the State should call on the Attorney General's advice in that regard or perhaps it is already involved.  The matter regularly appears on the committee's agenda.  There were agreements in 2002 and 2009.  I acknowledge that this primarily concerns the Department of Education and Skills.  Some of the properties are being transferred to the HSE, while others are still caught up in the process.  Approximately 15 years later, the State has been unable to complete the transfer to which it committed.  We are receiving quarterly reports because we are not satisfied that it has received the attention it deserves to fulfil the commitment.  Given that the Office of the Attorney General advises Departments on commercial issues, leases, trusts and so on, is it involved in this matter?</p></speech>

The point I was making was that we are moving from a system of extradition, with which we are familiar and which has been tried and tested with the UK since 2003 - the European arrest warrant - to something which is different.  That is the challenge essentially, that we will have to deal with an entirely different system.  Without being too complicated about it, if somebody is being extradited from the United Kingdom to the United States, it will be under a particular type of system.  We are going to go into that same system so we will have to be assured that we know what the courts require in that different system.  My main point was that the European arrest warrant was designed to be a streamlined system for Europe.</p></speech>

The Chairman mentioned the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and that we did not want to see a situation to arise where the work was done and the CSO might complain about the form the statistics took.  As mentioned, the same applies to the GDPR.  Can we be confident that when the justice hub is completed - I would like to hear the projected finishing date - we will not find ourselves in a situation where concerns will be raised that the enterprise is in breach of it in dealing with people's personal data?  We want to make sure it is not a waste of time and money.</p></speech>

While people talk about the GDPR, justice agencies operate under the law enforcement directive which is Part 5 of the Data Protection Act.  Getting that right, even before the data modelling was completed, was a big part of the design.  We want to ensure the protections and obligations of all of the criminal justice agencies under Part 5 of the Act and the law enforcement directive are all accounted for at a very early stage.  A data protection sub-committee is working as one of a number of sub-committees under the public board.  I sit on the board, while our data protection officer is a member of the data protection sub-group.  Data protection agreements were in place before any data modelling was done.  Therefore, any member of the technical project team would know that we were data protection compliant.  The legal office is obviously in tune with data protection requirements.  Much of the data we possess is sensitive and we have obligations in that respect.  The data protection directive and implementation of the Act have been a big project within our office.  As there was heightened awareness of the issue last year, it was very much at the forefront of our mind in starting the project to ensure the data protection aspects would be correct.</p></speech>

There is no finishing date as such.  The system entails the development of a series of messages between agencies that in time will become more detailed.  A number of projects that have to be completed very quickly have been identified, including recording court outcomes for statistical purposes and which many agencies require.  We are planning to roll out that aspect in the latter part of the year.  I am told by the IT and technical people that when it is rolled out, there will be near-time accuracy.  In time, as we ensure the data are correct and of high quality, they will become real time data.  There is a process which involves many of these projects to ensure the data will be of the correct quality.</p></speech>

Even if the hub is established perfectly and working in real time, it is worth noting that there have recently been data breaches within the HSE related to the termination of pregnancies.  We were warned that that would probably happen; I just want to flag that there are people who are very fond of accessing everybody's information.  If information in the hub was to get into the wrong hands, it would obviously be a very serious matter.</p></speech>

There will be access levels in terms of those who will need to see particular information and when they will need to see it.  That is an essential part of what is being agreed to.  Most of the information held by every agency will not go to the centre.  There will only be access to the messages people need to consume and what they generally need to know.</p></speech>
