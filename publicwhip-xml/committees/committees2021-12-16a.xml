    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021121600002#A00400"><p>No apologies have been received.  I would like to begin by welcoming our members and witnesses to the meeting.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerks, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of where the Parliament has chosen to sit.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and joins us this morning, when we will engage with officials from the Department of Health to examine the 2020 appropriation account, Vote 38 - Health.  The Department has also been advised that the committee might wish to examine matters relating to the value for money review of the nursing home support scheme, or fair deal scheme, as well as analysis undertaken by the national paediatric hospital development board on the new children's hospital.  Arising from consideration of an item of correspondence at last week's meeting, we also sought information regarding the governance arrangements pertaining to the State expenditure on prescription medicines.</p> <p>  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, and by Mr. Kevin Colman, Mr. John O'Grady and Ms Fiona Larthwell, principal officers.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Jim Deane, principal officer in the health Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are all very welcome. </p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I would ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent or switched off.  Before we start, I wish to explain some of the limitations of parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references that our witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, one of today's witnesses is giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present on campus.  That witness has already been advised and they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objective of such policies.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  To assist our broadcast and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not being directed to a specific witness, I would ask each witness to state their name when they first contribute.  I am mindful of the fact that we are online and there is sometimes a delay.  I do not want to interrupt anyone but if I have to intervene, I ask members and witnesses to comply with that and ensure we are not talking over each other.  I ask members and witnesses to be mindful that it is a little more difficult to run a meeting remotely than when we are all physically present in a committee room.  I ask them for their co-operation in that regard.</p> <p>  I now call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.</p></speech>

This represented a 19% increase on the gross expenditure of &euro;17.5 billion incurred in 2019.  The majority of the gross expenditure in 2020, amounting to just under &euro;20.5 billion, was paid to the HSE.  This was spread across 14 subheads in the account.  Other subheads of the Vote provide for payments of grants and other support to bodies under the aegis of the Department and funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund and Sl&aacute;intecare initiatives.</p> <p>  Receipts into the Vote in 2020 totalled &euro;488 million.  These comprise mainly &euro;270 million recovered in respect of the cost of providing health services to EU nationals under EU regulations, and receipts of &euro;168 million from the proceeds of excise duties on tobacco products.</p> <p>  At year end, net expenditure under the Vote was &euro;120 million less than provided for.  With the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;68 million in unspent capital allocations was carried over for spending in 2021.  The remainder of the surplus for the year, &euro;52 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.  I issued a clear audit opinion for the appropriation account.</p></speech>

There is usually a five-minute time limit.  I see Mr. Watt has provided a concise statement.  He is welcome and may proceed.</p></speech>

It is good to join them this morning. I have a brief statement, as the Chairman mentioned.  As Accounting Officer for the Department of Health&rsquo;s Vote 38, I am pleased to be here today to discuss the 2020 annual report and appropriation account of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Kevin Colman and Mr. John O&rsquo;Grady, from the resources division, and Ms Fiona Larthwell from the social care division in my Department.  I will now set out the main points of the 2020 accounts as they pertain to Vote 38.<br/><br/><i></i>The initial 2020 net provision, current and capital, for Vote 38 was &euro;17.9 billion, which consisted of a gross provision of &euro;18.3 billion and appropriationsinaid of &euro;430 million.</p><p>As the scale of the challenge presented by Covid19 became clear, it was evident that unprecedented action was needed here to prevent the spread of the disease, high rates of hospitalisation and intensive care unit admissions, and significant mortality.  New structures and processes were put in place between the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE to facilitate timely decisionmaking while also ensuring that high levels of governance were maintained, where the HSE reported to the Department each week on the estimated Covid19 related noncapital and capital expenditure that had been incurred to date.</p><p> Additional funding of &euro;1.997 billion was voted to the Department in a Revised Estimate in June 2020 to support the measures outlined in the national action plan on Covid19.  This represented the expenditure approved by the Government for Covid19 measures taken up to the date of the passing of the Revised Estimate.  A further net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;514.5 million was approved to meet additional funding requirements that arose to the end of 2020.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General stated, this resulted in a net overall provision for Vote 38 of &euro;20.44 billion, incorporating a deferred capital surrender of &euro;30 million carried over from the previous year.  The 2020 outturn was &euro;20.3 billion, leaving an overall surplus of &euro;120 million.  The Department of Health received sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to carry forward &euro;68.2 million of unspent allocations in respect of the capital elements of subhead M2 into 2021.</p><p> As members are aware, the pandemic has been an extremely difficult time for frontline employees and workers in the health service.  They have responded with diligence, resilience, agility and a level of commitment that has been extraordinary.  With the support of the Department and the Government, the HSE has introduced new capabilities and innovations across the system.  These include implementing eprescribing in general practice and introducing alternative care pathways and new models of care.</p><p> An example of the innovation of the health system was seen in responding to Covid19 last year.  New testing and contact tracing capability was implemented, with the delivery of 720,000 GP referrals, 2.3 million laboratory tests and more than 440,000 contact tracing calls during the year.  We have implemented a hugely successful Covid19 vaccination strategy with one of the highest levels of uptake in Europe and we are making very strong progress in delivering booster vaccines across the population.</p><p> Further investment in the overall reform of the health system includes very significant investments in clinical strategies such as the cancer, gynaecological and maternity strategy, coupled with an unprecedented investment to address the shortcomings identified by the 2018 capacity review that has seen us deliver the largest increase in acute and critical care beds and in community beds in decades.  Allied to increasing acute capacity, we are undertaking a critical shift left in moving care out of acute settings and into the community, with the recruitment of an additional workforce of more than 3,000 staff to implement community care networks across every community in Ireland.</p><p> The Department has continued to successfully discharge its other functions.  Importantly, we seek to frame policies and legislation to promote health.  The life expectancy in Ireland is now estimated at 82.8 years, which is above the EU average of 81 years.  However, with the prevalence of preventable noncommunicable diseases, it is important to promote healthy behaviours and prevent ill health.  Under the Healthy Ireland umbrella, which is a Government of Ireland initiative, we work crosssectorally to achieve this objective.</p><p> We also support the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Ministers of State in their work, including their legislative priorities and their public and parliamentary accountability.  For example, in 2020, the Department processed more than 9,224 parliamentary questions, representing 24%, or almost one quarter, of all parliamentary questions tabled to Ministers across the entire government system.</p><p> The Department continues to enhance its governance and performance oversight in respect of the services and reform being delivered by the HSE.  In line with Sl&aacute;intecare, legislation was enacted in 2019 to introduce new accountability structures in the HSE, with the formal appointment of a non-executive and competencybased governing board.  In recognition of these new structures, the Department put in place a revised engagement model with the HSE and its board with a view to strengthening the oversight of governance and performance management and accountability of the HSE.  This oversight model is operational and will continue to be improved and enhanced as necessary to ensure there is more effective oversight within the Department.</p><p> This improvement work continues.  The Government has committed to bringing forward regional health areas.  A business plan for the implementation of regional health areas been developed by the Department.  The HSE has provided feedback and implementation considerations on this business plan.  A memorandum for Government on the next steps for implementation is being drafted.  I anticipate the Minister will bring the memorandum to Government for decision in January 2022.  To ensure we have front-line and expert input as we move forward, the Minister established an advisory group.  Given this progress, the Minister has informed the hospital group boards that they are being stood down this month as their terms of office expire.  There are many reforms and improvements taking place that are providing better healthcare to citizens.  Together with our colleagues in the HSE, we are focused on further reforms in 2022.</p><p> Finally, I thank the staff in the Department of Health for their ongoing commitment and dedication to our work programme across many dimensions of our work.  I look forward to continuing to work with the committee and with the Oireachtas and am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

The next speaker will be Deputy Hourigan, who, along with all other members, will have ten minutes.  I ask members to keep to the time.  If time permits, I will allow members back in for a second round.</p></speech>

I want to touch first on the issue of the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  In July, an official of his Department told the committee categorically that costings of &euro;2 billion for the hospital had not been considered but, three weeks ago, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform refused to rule out the figure of &euro;2 billion.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has provided an estimate in excess of &euro;2 billion.  Has Mr. Watt considered such a figure to date?  Is it referenced in the report that he has and that the committee has requested?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021121600002#B00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  We have provided very detailed notes and briefing on this matter.  I know the committee has considered it several times.   We have set out clearly what we think the estimate is for the hospital and the related satellite and integration works.  We have also identified that there is a significant risk, given the delay in the project.  It is delayed, as the Deputy is aware, likely into 2024 now, and that will increase the costs of the project.  There are ongoing issues in respect of construction inflation.  There will be further claims relating to contract stipulations in the context of inflation above 4.5% in 2019.  There are ongoing claims and disputes between the contractor and the board.  There is uncertainty in respect of what the final figure is.  We have set that out.  We do not at this stage have any update on the figure we have put in the public domain, but there is heightened risk in respect of that estimate for the reasons I set out in the note that I forwarded to the committee and which we outlined before.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021121600002#B00600"><p>As we have stated previously, we are not speculating.  We do not think there is any benefit in us speculating at this stage on what the estimate of the final figure will be.  We know there are pressures and we have stated that repeatedly.  I understand there is a legitimate request for certainty in respect of the costs from the committee in terms of discharging its role to have a latest view on whether there will be a cost increase but, against that, we have to manage the interests of the State and the taxpayer and that is why we are-----</p></speech>

That report is now with the Department.  Can Mr. Watt provide the committee with the report?</p></speech>

He said he would be able to discuss updated costings once he received the report.  He has had the report since May but has thus far refused to furnish us with it and now cannot even confirm costings.

Elderly people in nursing homes are being exploited by being charged for items and services such as bed sore creams, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and painkillers that they would normally access free of charge if they were living in the community.  The HSE advised the committee that it has engaged with the Department about this issue.

I put it to Mr. Watt that people on this committee are well aware of the complex and live contract involved and that it is a multi-strand process.  Everyone on the committee and indeed the public understand there are escalating construction and material costs at the moment and that the contract is subject to claims.  It is very unsatisfactory for Mr. Watt to say today that "discussion of costs by officials, however hypothetical or otherwise at this time, may prejudice enforcement of the existing contract, and very likely negatively impact or jeopardise the Development Board in its ongoing engagement with the main contractor".  Ultimately that statement presents itself less as a discussion of the complexity of a contract and more as an attempt to constrain, control or remove the public oversight of this project.  Nobody likes to talk about spiralling costs, but oversight of public spending is a fundamental principle of public life.  It is not Mr. Watt's role to act as gatekeeper.  It is completely valid for the Committee of Public Accounts to ask these questions.  We should have access to that report.</p></speech>

I have appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts and the health committee previously on this for a whole day.  Our colleagues have appeared many times to discuss the children's hospital.  I do not think it is a fair characterisation to say we are not willing to answer questions on it.  We have done so repeatedly.  I am very happy to do it today again if the Deputy wishes.  I am happy to discuss the costs.</p> <p>  The different factors that have increased the cost of this hospital are well known.  The risks that now relate to finishing out this contract relate to inflation.  There is a provision within the contract for paying an amount above the prescribed 4.5% that is in the contract.  There are delays in the contract that will of necessity push out the cost because it will need to be managed for a further period.</p> <p>  Then there is the issue of claims.  I sent a note to the committee setting out the detail of the claims, the scale of the claims, some settlement of the claims that have taken place and so on.  It is our judgment and it is not a clear decision absolutely as to what is the right or wrong decision but there is a trade-off here between providing detailed information on our assessment of what the likely outcome of the settlement of these disputes will be-----</p></speech>

His words in the statement today were that "discussion of costs by officials, however hypothetical ... could negatively impact or jeopardise ... ongoing engagement".

I ask Mr. Watt to outline the oversight.  His opening statement mentions hospital group boards being stood down and advisory groups.  It is to be hoped we are in the process of moving to regional areas with Sl&aacute;intecare.  What oversight does the Department have on capital expenditure regarding both existing capital assets and new projects?  This week the health committee dealt with the closure of the Owenacurra centre in Midleton.  This decision seems to have been made entirely by the local agency in direct contravention of Government policy in A Vision for Change because it will leave east Cork with no mental health places.</p> <p>  There seems to be almost no oversight from the Department.  It is some person in a room making a decision and they seem to be a law unto themselves.  There is no comeback and no possibility to change it even though it is in breach of Government policy.  Why is there so little oversight from the Department on decisions like that where a building is allowed to be run down to the state it is in?  How does that fit into this new model that is being described to us?</p></speech>

It is the reform plan that has been set out.  We are now developing an implementation plan.  As part of the implementation of this, the boards of the hospital groups are being stood down.  We decided not to replace them because a number of members were due to leave and we had to replenish the membership.  It was decided to stand down the groups, in effect, in preparation for the new structures we and the HSE are working on to deliver a key aspect of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p><p>Regarding oversight of capital, we agree the overall capital budget.  Every year, discussions take place between our Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, there is a decision on the allocation, and a view is reached on what capital projects can be delivered, which is set out within the national service plan and the letter of determination the Minister shares with the HSE.

One set of figures relating to 2019 shows that the average cost per patient per week in a public nursing home was &euro;1,616 while the cost in a private nursing home was &euro;992 per week.  That is a 62% difference.  Someone referred to additional costs being imposed on patients in private nursing homes, but is this not a sizeable disparity between the cost of providing care in a public nursing home compared with a private one?  There is a criticism of private nursing homes in terms of additional charges and their low pay rates, but if it is costing &euro;1,616 per week in public nursing homes, is there not an argument to be made that there is significant disparity in the level of support being provided as well as discrimination in real terms?</p></speech>

This review was carried out in 2019 since when costs have increased substantially.  The private nursing homes are not able to carry the costs and, therefore, are imposing them on the patients.  There is a great deal of justified criticism to the effect that the homes are not entitled to do that.  On the other hand, the Department has sat on this report for a long time.  When is the review of the funding that should be provided under the fair deal scheme to give people in private nursing homes a level of care that compares favourably with public nursing homes?</p></speech>

The latter shows a significant cost differential.  Most of it appears to be accounted for by staffing.  There are two issues in that regard, namely, the overall pay costs per grade and the different mix of staff.  Within the public system, there are more nurses and fewer healthcare assistants whereas the private system tends to employ more healthcare assistants relative to nurses.

It is not a question necessarily of us saying we are not providing enough support for the private settings; we are asking why is there such a large differential.  Ultimately, the State is picking up the tab across all settings.  Generally, with regard to the fair deal scheme, the allocation is &euro;1.4 billion.  That is taxpayers' money.  Some 23,000 to 24,000 people benefit from the scheme.  There is an enormous challenge in terms of its sustainability and how that relates to home care supports.</p></speech>

I do not expect Mr. Watt to respond in respect of what happened back then because he has only been in his role in the Department since this time last year.  The committee completed a report on the fair deal scheme and its recommendations were accepted by the Department in full.  That was 11 months ago.  The point made by Deputy Burke is that this report was published by the Department at 9 o&rsquo;clock last night.  Can Mr. Watt understand the frustration felt by the Deputy and other members at the committee at being treated in that way?  We make recommendations that were accepted in full and 11 months later we still had not got the report but, hey presto, the night before the meeting, when everybody had left, the report came through.  I am saying this to Mr. Watt as Chairman of the committee.  To me, that seems like bad practice and to be a smart alec manner in which to treat this committee.</p></speech>

I find that very disappointing.  Officials in the Department are working incredibly hard on this issue, and on the report produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the report produced by the NTPF and the report produced by Tom Ferris.  There is also the nursing home expert working group on Covid-19.  All those reports cover more or less the same ground.  We have implemented the vast majority of the recommendations in those reports.  I think I sent the Chairman a note this week setting out once again our response to the vast majority of those.  There is one issue about a report, which, I accept, we should have published earlier, but the committee should acknowledge the significant response to these reports that have been set out.  This issue is very important.  In response to Deputy Burke's earlier comments, the value for money report sets out, in more granular detail, what we broadly know already in terms of this differential.  We are committed to working further in terms of what that might mean with respect to the pricing of any supports.  The officials in the Department are working on this.  They are doing many things.  They have responded quite proactively to the recommendations of those various reports.</p></speech>

Since then the Department has been refusing to speculate, as Mr. Watt put it, and that has lead to fears the costs will be substantially more.  The figure of &euro;2 billion has been set out.  Does he recognise there is a failure on the part of the Department to be transparent, which means it is difficult for this committee to meet its obligations with regard to accountability when we do not have and are not being provided with that information?</p></speech>

It was decided in 2015 or 2016 that that type of contract would not have led to any bidders for this project and that a two-stage process, where works were undertaken and as those works were being done, design would be finalised and we would go from a draft stage to more a more complete design and then tender for the project, would be followed.

It is good to engage again following our previous engagement in July.</p> <p>  I will stay on the children's hospital and follow up on some of my questions in July.  It is clear that we will not get a copy of the report.  To an extent, I appreciate why not.  When the committee visited the site, it was clear there were all sorts of claims, some of which were legitimate in theory because the design of the project had changed.  I can appreciate that.  However, Mr. Watt must realise that we, as the Committee on Public Accounts, are very interested, as I am sure he and other Secretaries General, as to what the final cost will be.  As I have said previously, this is an essential project.  We are in, whether we like it or not.  We need a new state-of-the-art children's hospital.  However, the Committee on Public Accounts would like to know even a guesstimate of costs.</p><p>Regardless of what the report states, it would be helpful to give a ballpark figure to this committee, and ultimately to the public, to say how much the project may cost, subject to legal fees and other charges.  Will Mr. Watt give an indication of what percentage of the project is complete?</p></speech>

I absolutely agree with the Deputy but there are different views on this.  That is just the reality of it.  Those views are legitimate on both sides.  We have a legitimate view here, which is not in any way about stifling the committee or not being supportive of transparency.  It is just a different view about advancing the State's interests.

Were any materials or products pre-purchased at any point during this construction phase to try to bring down the cost, or are they being purchased at the point of need?</p></speech>

Analysis was done by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  In an email to the committee, I note that Mr. Watt stated that the analysis was not in relation to the progress of the national paediatric hospital but it related to forecasting of critical paths and scenarios for the optimal completion of the project.

That is something on which the board and the contractor continually engage.  There are more than 1,000 people working on the site now and the members probably saw the activity when they were there.  It is to ensure the project is adequately resourced to deliver on the type of timeframe.  Second, it is to get to a better place in terms of the dispute resolution.  At the moment there is more positive engagement in terms of disputes.  We are trying to engage more positively, to expedite the claims and get through things faster.  These are the two things that stuck out, along with the obvious complexity of the project.  This project is four times bigger than the most recent hospital built in the State, which was Tallaght hospital.  This is an absolutely enormous site and when one actually gets involved and looks at the complexity of the project it is incredibly complex.</p></speech>

With regard to the MDU refusal, there are departmental legal costs in excess of &euro;1.6 million, which is extraordinary.  Is that the Medical Defence Union?  That case has been rumbling on for quite some time.  What has been going on for longer, and is quite frightening from my perspective, are the legal costs for the Department in the thalidomide case.  Is that the case that has been going on since 2010?  I am conscious that there are only a handful of survivors left of this case.  These are the second ever largest legal costs for the Department, as were stated in the 2020 accounts.  Will Mr. Watt please clarify both of those items?</p></speech>

The MDU is the Medical Defence Union.  As the Deputy will recall, as the market for indemnity collapsed, particularly for maternity services, the State stepped in and provided the clinical indemnity scheme, which in effect is managed by the State Claims Agency in order that cover is provided.  Cover was provided by the Medical Defence Union in advance of that scheme.  There are various legacy cases that still have to be addressed.  Because the income to the Medical Defence Union fell away as practitioners moved to the State claims scheme, the MDU did not have the future income to deal with the liabilities it had incurred or was accruing on foot of cases that predated the establishment of the State scheme.  When the State-----</p></speech>

Representatives from the HSE recently appeared before the committee to discuss the procurement of the personal protective equipment, PPE, that had to be sourced.  In the context of the relationship between the Department and the HSE, what role, if any, did the former have in supervising the procurement at that stage?  Obviously, it was a difficult time and so on.  I would like to hear from Mr. Watt about that.</p></speech>

I was on the other side, in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I recall, from my perspective over there, the engagement between Paul Reid and the Department of Health on the procurement.  Obviously, it was done very quickly in difficult circumstances.  We were trying to access PPE, which was in short supply, and we needed to get it quickly to protect people.  The procurement of that was a challenge.  From my perspective in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we were trying to ensure we had proper sanctions and reporting and that, where possible, we were complying.  I cannot say exactly what role my predecessor, Jim Breslin, played <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the HSE, but I imagine he and the finance team were involved with the HSE, because the sums were so enormous, to work through exactly how we would go about that.  The HSE was taking the lead, but the Department would have been supportive of what it was doing.</p></speech>

I am hearing from pharmacists there is some confusion with the HSE today in respect of having ordered stocks and who they can give it to.  From a departmental oversight perspective, how is the Department linking in with the efficiency with which that is being done, the supervision of any wastage and the overall costs?  Clearly, the priority is to get the vaccines to people as quickly as possible, but is this an ongoing management issue or matter for supervision?</p></speech>

It probably has occupied most of our time in the past week.  At the weekend, I and members of the management team in the Department spent most of our time on the booster campaign, looking at what implications there would be for the health system if people were to be moved out to the vaccination centres and how we could access staff from other parts of the public service.  Colleagues have been engaging with GPs and pharmacies on what more could be done, how we can galvanise more and how we can get supplies.  There are issues around the 15-minute waiver, which the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, acted on yesterday with the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC.  There are a whole variety of issues the Department is dealing with.  A group meets every Monday at 2 o'clock, where Paul Reid, the Minister for Health, I and other colleagues are involved.  Given the concerns about the new variant, a key part of our response and our protection is to ensure we get as many boosters out there as possible within the next few weeks.</p></speech>

On foot of that, they were advised they would be able to vaccinate people over the age of 18, so they ordered many more vaccination doses.  I am thinking of one pharmacy in Blackrock that ordered an additional 800, obviously at a cost, and was then told later in the afternoon that the vaccinations were restricted to the over-50s.  I am sure this is just a management issue that can be ironed out, but all these things add up in terms of both urgency and cost.  That is just feedback I thought I might highlight with Mr. Watt while I have the opportunity.</p> <p>  A couple of weeks ago, representatives of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, appeared before the committee, along with representatives of the State Claims Agency.  One issue on which we are following up as a committee, and I think the Comptroller and Auditor General is too, relates to the clinical indemnity scheme, which Mr. Watt mentioned earlier.  What is the relationship between the Department of Health and the State Claims Agency in respect of payments by the latter?  Much of this is rooted in health, incident management supervision and so on.  Will Mr. Watt talk us through that?</p></speech>

When there is a case, the State Claims Agency manages the day-to-day case, decides the strategy and recommends a course of action.  When it comes to feedback on what we can do to reduce the incidence of cases of negligence and harm, it is about patient safety, incident management and different ways we respond.  A patient safety office has been established and we have new protocols in respect of incidents and a new approach for how we engage with people who have suffered from an incident.  The Department's role is to get feedback from the State Claims Agency in terms of its understanding of what is going on, and then to look at the policy response and whether we can do things differently to reduce the number of claims and to manage the claims process in a more efficient way.  The number of claims is unsustainable for the State.  The amount of money we are paying out is incredible and it must have gone up by more than 100% over the past ten years.  It is incredible, so-----</p></speech>

While I am not an expert in this area, I understand it comes down to clinical governance and management, protocols and practices and so on at an intervention and acute level.  That is where a lot of work has been gone in and there will be a lot of further work.  The absolute focus needs to be we do everything we can to reduce the number of those events.</p></speech>

I, too, want to start with the issue of the national children's hospital.  I was present at the meeting of the committee in January 2017, when members of the NPHDB were in.  The figures were discussed.  The projected cost had gone from &euro;983 million to &euro;1.433 billion for the building of the project, and to &euro;1.7 billion when the fit-out was taken into account.  On that day, we got a one-page breakdown of how the costs changed between 2017 and 2018.  As I recall, we looked for it and it was dragged out of the people who were there.  Reading from the report that was given to us that day by members of the board, there are two sentences that I want to reference, in particular:</p> <blockquote> 	The February 2017 figure was &euro;983 million, which was the approved business case. The project was tendered on a two stage basis. The bill of quantities for the first stage was based on a partially developed design. The second stage included involvement of contractors with designers in finalising the design and confirming the actual quantity of materials. This included a targeted schedule of &euro;66 million value for money savings ... The November 2018 figure of &euro;1.433 billion is the cost to completion in 2022 based on a completed and fully developed design. All risks on quantities, programme, omissions, co-ordination and ground conditions are now transferred to contractors.  </blockquote> <p>We now know that the hospital will not be delivered for a further two years.  There are building costs for a further two years.  Are those costs on top of what was included in that &euro;1.433 billion?  Building inflation was very low going into 2018.  We are now in a very serious position in respect of building inflation.  That will add to the costs of this hospital.  More than &euro;4.5 million in inflation is built into the contract.  Were any penalty clauses built into the contract?  Contracts have two sides to them.  The obligation on the part of the contractor was to build the hospital by 2022, which it did not do.  Part of that was because there was not a sufficient number of builders on-site or oversight.  Does the Secretary General accept that the figure of &euro;1.433 billion is the cost to completion in 2022?  If it is not being delivered until 2024, does he also accept that it is going to cost more by virtue of the fact that it is going to take two years longer?  Is there the prospect of a counterclaim with the contractor who had an obligation to deliver the hospital by 2022 being looked at?  It is what the contractor signed up for.</p></speech>

I am not involved in the day-to-day details of the contract, so members of the NPHDB are probably best placed to answer those questions.  For there to be a counterclaim, one must demonstrate that there has been a breach of contract, and that the delay is due to contractual failure as opposed to external factors.  I presume the contractor will argue that external factors have impacted upon its ability to deliver the contract.</p></speech>

No work was done.  We know that there was an inadequate number of staff on the site and that caused delays initially.  Is that part of the obligation on the contractor?  The more we go into this, the more building inflation is going to be an issue.  It is part of the reason the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Oireachtas on Health want to keep a close watch on this to keep costs down - not to put it out into the public arena to drive costs up.  That is where we are coming from.  I do not feel that is accepted.</p></speech>

A slippage of two years is really serious.  The previous Secretary General at the Department of Health made a commitment to provide this document to the committee when it was due.  I think it was due at the end of last year.  Mr. Watts subsequently joined the Department and suddenly, the attitude changed to providing a copy of the document to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health.  Was the change of Secretary General material to that change in attitude?  Who is advising Mr. Watt on what should happen in this matter, or is he the final arbiter?</p></speech>

Mr. Watt has accepted today that mistakes were made in the implementation.  He might tell us what those mistakes were.  How does he see it?  He can hardly expect us to feel confident in the people who made the mistakes in how this contract was progressed.  It is part of the reason we want to see it and adjudicate on it for ourselves.  What were the mistakes that Mr. Watt said were made?</p></speech>

I had done that before in my previous role.  There are issues with the final design.  A decision was taken to move on this when it was understood that there was a final design.  In actual fact, the design was not final.  We know now that many of the specifications were not correct.  That has led to significant cost escalations.  Mistakes were made.  While the two-stage process was the right approach to adopt, errors were made in how it was implemented, particularly in relation to in making the decision, which was understood to be on the basis of a final design.  It was the case that the design was not complete at that stage.</p></speech>

It is important to have the Secretary General in the committee.  As part of my contribution I want to acknowledge the enormous work that has been done by many of our healthcare professionals around the country that are under the remit of the work of the Department.  That needs to be acknowledged.</p> <p>  A number of important issues across many different areas have been brought up with Mr. Watt today, but I want to focus on one particular area.  The Department has one of the biggest budgetary allocations of any Department in the State.  One concern that I have, and it is important that we look at it in the year ahead, is around staffing within the organisation, particularly in the context of front-line medical professionals.  In terms of attracting staff and getting value for public money, which is important, is Mr. Watt satisfied with the current salaries within the HSE system for doctors, nurses and consultants in general?  Does he think it needs a degree of analysis of where we currently stand in that particular area, in order to prevent the exodus of skilled working professionals who are going to places like Canada and Australia?  This is common for many people in my age group.  I want to ask Mr. Watt this from the outset.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.369" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021121600002#N02000"><p>There are now 131,000 full-time equivalents in the health system.  That figure is up about 10,000 since the beginning of 2020.  There is significant recruitment taking place and net increases in staff.  Within that, there are people who have left for a variety of reasons.  Those may be for the reasons that the Deputy mentioned - they may be leaving to work in other places for better opportunities, better employment or better salaries.  Overall, however, the system is able to recruit more staff and to provide better services.</p> <p>  Consistently, of course, there are gaps.  We would have liked to have done more recruitment this year than we were able to do.  There are gaps in many different areas.  I am sure the Deputy is familiar with the areas where there are gaps and staff shortages.  The question of salary can be an issue, depending on the area and on the sector.  There are other issues involved around working conditions, the physical environment, the hours people are expected to work and so on.  There is a variety of different issues.</p> <p>  Pay is constantly kept under review.  It is under ongoing review as part of the overall pay agreement.  The HSE, as a big employer, is always looking at trends in the workforce, the number of applicants for jobs and the ability to attract people.  It is an ongoing concern.  Certainly, into the future, as we try to recruit more people, we need to train our own people and provide them with more opportunities.  We are providing more opportunities for people to go into medicine, nursing and all the different areas.  The number of available college places has increased again for this September.  There are plans to increase it further.  There is a wide range of issues.  Salary can be an issue and we keep a close eye on it as part of an ongoing review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021121600002#N02100"><p>We need to explore this further.  There needs to be proper analysis done on why young graduates often feel that they need to leave the country.  We are seeing in places like Canada and Australia that opportunities are being presented to young graduates who have studied here.  The State has gone through the enormous cost of supporting their education and higher education.  There is no disputing that.  However, I feel we need to look at this.</p> <p>  Like many public representatives and indeed the public, I question the overall strength of the public healthcare system in this country, considering the level of investment and the billions upon billions of capital going into this area.  I would like to see the Department undertake a body of work that involves a deep-rooted analysis of why this happening.  It should get into the universities and talk to people who are nearing the completion of their higher education before they start work in our hospitals and the healthcare system.  I feel there is a necessity to do that.</p> <p>  We have seen throughout the pandemic that so much strain has been put on the health system in general.  ICU capacity has been increased from 200 to 300 beds.  We want that figure to increase further to give us scope to prevent us going back into lockdown situations and scenarios with new challenges that may arise as a result of the pandemic.  An enormous level of urgency is needed in this area.  Could the Department look at this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.371" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021121600002#N02200"><p>I agree with the Deputy.  There are areas in the health system which are challenged, and there are challenging roles.</p><p>He mentioned ICUs where the Government has increased the number of beds and has plans to increase them further next year, which is really critical and important.  Our big challenge is to get trained ICU staff, particularly nursing staff, of which I understand there is a short supply around the world.  There are many different elements here.  It is about salary, training and working conditions.  There is also an element that people will want to go and live in Canada, Australia and other places for a period.  That is part of what many people want to do when they graduate.  That is the reality of it.</p><p> The key thing for us, however, is to ensure that we are attractive so that people come back.  The majority of people who go away for a few years come back and then find employment in the health system.  There is an ongoing challenge to make the jobs attractive, however.  Pay is one aspect of it but it is really about the opportunity to learn and the physical environment in which people work in terms of the general atmosphere.  If people are working in an environment where they are under strain all the time, which has been the situation for large parts of the health system for the past two years, that is a very difficult environment to have to face every day.  We all hear the stories of the enormous effort people have put in and will have to put in even more in the next few months to deal with the challenges that will probably be coming down the tracks.  In terms of what we can do as a Department, I will certainly take that back and reflect upon it.</p></speech>

I am against the clock.</p> <p>  Is Mr. Watt in any position to inform us about the healthcare sector in Ireland, particularly the area of nursing?  This has been repeatedly brought up to me by many people who are nursing.  One would not expect that perhaps two thirds of the way into their careers, many of them are actively considering quitting.  Does Mr. Watt feel this is an area into which the Department needs to put an effort around reviewing working hours?  He acknowledged conditions and there is obviously a cost to the State.  We are losing these highly-skilled workers who have a role to play.  Many of them came back into play to give their country that service when it came to the pandemic, which was greatly appreciated.  The point has to be made, however.  Will that issue be analysed by the Department in the short- to medium-term future?</p></speech>

We have a lot on.  I am aware that the chief nursing officer has ongoing engagement with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and representative bodies, and works with the different elements about this whole question of working hours and conditions and so on.</p> <p>  It has been a real challenge for people over the past two years in particular.  I hear what the Deputy is saying and I do not disagree with him.  I will take it back and see if there is any further work.  There might have been work we have done that I am not familiar with that looks at it in more detail.  We can do that.</p></speech>

I ask him to go away and look at that particular issue.</p> <p>  One other point of concern is that we have all seen what has happened with the children's hospital.  It has been extraordinarily disappointing and frustrating.  It has definitely been a turning point for many regarding overruns on State projects and putting in the necessary safeguards.</p> <p>  In my region, outside of my constituency but well within the catchment area of services that are being provided, we are looking at the potential for a new elective hospital to be built in County Cork.  What safeguards is Mr. Watt putting in place now when it comes to the construction of a new hospital build so that we do not have a repeat in Cork of what happened in Dublin with the national children's hospital?</p></speech>

The new elective hospitals will be part of that and so on.  Obviously, the big issue is about the actual procurement model and the two-stage approach that was used for the children's hospital.  I do not think that will be used for the electives.  It will be different.  In many ways, the elective hospitals are not as complex.  They have a significant footprint, particularly the one proposed for Dublin, but I do not believe they are as complex as the children's hospital.  There is a new approach to try to avoid the unsatisfactory situation that developed with the children's hospital and the costs associated with that.</p></speech>

I am interested in getting a bit of insight from him on it.  It is all well and good to talk about the initial contract being awarded.  What safeguards will be placed in the contracts to analyse and go through them in detail whereby, for example, one year into a multi-year build, which many of these types of projects are, it can be said that serious issues are very clearly arising and come up with some type of resolution process with the contractor or contractors that will be appointed for those building projects?</p></speech>

It is not like a project where we say we are going to build a road and then it is finished.  There are many different aspects to it.</p> <p>  The key thing is that significant progress is being made.  There are plans particularly for next year because of the funding that is available.  The Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform announced very significant funding in the budget for the health system.  That will mean an increase in core spending of more than &euro;1 billion.  That will enable us to recruit more staff, enhance community care, increase the number of beds, advance the digital projects we are doing and all the different aspects of that, improve universal care by extending free GP care to six and seven-year-olds and take other steps.  It is an ongoing process.</p></speech>

I do not think one can separate improvements to the overall health budget and say they are Sl&aacute;intecare because in effect, I see now the overall reforms and enhancements.  Over the past number of years, I believe &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion has ultimately been allocated to measures that could be labelled as "Sl&aacute;intecare".  Some of the aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare include enhanced public capacity.  I mentioned the increase in staffing in reply to Deputy O'Connor's question.  We have increased the staffing very dramatically.  Much of that is Sl&aacute;intecare-related.  We increased the number of ICU beds by 800.  These are all aspects around enhancing capacity.  Then, there are some of the eGovernment initiatives.  It is something we can reflect upon and come back to because the question of how much we are actually going to earmark for it is an interesting one.</p></speech>

There is the outpatient waiting list where there are over 600,000 people now waiting.  There is the inpatient and day-care waiting list, where there are 75,000 people who are waiting.  We have had a structural problem with waiting lists.  We were making some progress before Covid.  The number of people waiting for longer than six months, in terms of inpatient and day cases, had come down.  The challenge in terms of how to-----</p></speech>

As of 30 November, we had 897,000 people on some form of public hospital waiting list.  That figure was published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, last Friday.  What will be done to reduce waiting lists in the coming years?  What does the Department envisage to be an acceptable level?</p></speech>

People waiting for longer than ten or 12 weeks for an outpatient procedure is not acceptable.  I do not think that there is any acceptable waiting beyond a certain period.  There will always be people who have to wait a few weeks.</p> <p>  It is interesting when one looks at the numbers.  There are over 600,000 people or outpatient consultations.  In 2019, the last year before Covid, there were 3.5 million outpatient consultations, so there is a number of those 600,000 who are waiting too long.  Thankfully, many of them will be seen quickly.  There is about 200,000, I think, who have been waiting for more than six months out of a total of 3.5 million.</p> <p>  In terms of inpatient day cases, IPDC, there are about 1.3 million procedures a year.

The people who are waiting too long probably account for about 5% or 6% of the overall delivery in any given year.  The question then is how can we increase capacity and activity to ensure that people are not waiting longer than ten or 12 weeks.  That involves an enhancement of capacity.  Against the enhancement of capacity, there are more people every year incoming and flowing on to the list looking for care.  This is primarily, but not exclusively, because of the demographic changes and demographic structure in society.  There are, therefore, a number of different challenges.  How can we increase productivity and activity in the public system and how can we access the private system to get more activity because the private system has volume and capacity which we can access?  That is a real challenge for us.</p></speech>

There was, I think, &euro;100 million allocated to the NTPF for 2020, of which &euro;80 million was spent.  Obviously, Covid impacted upon that.  For 2022, the Government has allocated &euro;150 million for the NTPF so that will increase the number of procedures it is able to purchase in the private system.</p> <p>  We also have the Safetynet procedures, which are about critical time dependent care and is non-NTPF.  A lot of people are being treated in private hospitals.  Last week, we occupied 1,800 beds in a given week.  A significant number of people are now getting procedures, thankfully, with that.  The plan is to extend Safetynet for the period ahead, particularly if we are dealing with another surge in the hospital system and increase that.</p></speech>

Locally, I have been given a timeline of 2026 for the expansion of the emergency department at Mayo University Hospital.  I would love to review the HSE's capital and estates programme to see what level of resources are provided for these types of projects.  It is unacceptable that it will be five years before anyone in Mayo University Hospital will get access to an additional emergency department.  While it is great to get funding of &euro;8.4 million approved, it is the delivery of the project that is causing a huge issue.  Ultimately, it will be reported back to the Minister but if the HSE's capital and estates team are not accountable, this falls down.  I have an issue with that.  Deputy Hourigan raised this matter with the Secretary General previously.  Who makes the decisions?  Is it the HSE or the Department?</p></speech>

There are many different projects and many projects have been delivered.  I cannot comment on the project in Mayo to which the Deputy referred.  I do not know the details.  The reality of building any project is that there is a delay and it takes a number of years.  We are always focused on trying to accelerate project delivery because it is not satisfactory.  It takes time, however, from conception and design to procurement and then actual delivery.  It depends on scale.  The challenge for society in terms of how quickly it takes us to build public projects is a wider issue.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt may not be familiar with the Finglas primary care centre project and he can revert to me with an update in writing.  We know how important primary care is in the area and the HSE has done significant preparatory work on the site.  Unfortunately, the project has been dogged by planning delays and other issues.  As with Deputy Dillon, who I am sure will advocate for capital projects in his area, I ask that the Department ensure the primary care centre in Finglas, an area of real need with a very low number of GPs in some parts, is delivered to the community so that we can tackle not just the GP waiting lists and related issues but also provide for more holistic healthcare.</p><p>I had to attend DDoc with my son in the Coolock primary care centre last week.  I was quite envious of the facility it has.  I am sure Mr. Watt does not have project details in front of him at the moment, but if he could take that on board, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the one in Coolock and one in Ballybough too.  They are fantastic facilities.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I am not in a position of influence here, when lobbying on behalf of Finglas primary care centre, which I am sure has great merit, or Deputy Dillon's project.  We will come back to the Deputy about it.  I have seen it on a schedule.  It is to be hoped we can get it up and running.  It is critical to have the infrastructure to provide a proper space for the different teams I mentioned earlier, including the community networks, the community intervention teams, the teams for chronic disease management and the teams for older people.  I know that part of the city well.  The demographics are such that many demands are placed on the system as that generation moves on.</p> <p>  Deputy Dillon asked about Sl&aacute;intecare.  An important aspect of what we are trying to do is to provide that care in the community, including home care supports, to ensure people do not have to go to emergency departments and can get out of the hospital system as quickly as they can, because many people should not be in these acute settings.</p></speech>

I turn to the registration of births and deaths.  While it is primarily a HSE function, is the Department of Health concerned about the significant delays that appear to be emerging as a result of Covid and the cyberattack?  There are delays in Dublin of up to 11 or 12 weeks for people registering births and deaths.  That has a significant knock-on impact on people's ability to avail of State services.  It could be a matter of getting access to a local general practitioner, processing probate, or applying for a passport.  Deputies from Dublin all see significant delays.  I ask Mr. Watt to expand on the solutions to it.  Is the Department concerned about or aware of it?  Has it captured the delays and the number of people impacted?</p></speech>

I am aware there is an issue with delays.  I do not know anything about it.  I guess that it is partly Covid related.  I do not know why that is or what we might do about it.  I will find out and come back to the Deputy.  I guess the situation is a function of the challenges the system faces.  Regarding births, do people have to register the child in person?  Is it done in person?  I do not know enough of the detail.  Let me look into it.</p></speech>

It is provided by the HSE.  There has been a significant failure by the HSE in conducting an important function.

If there is a delay, that will have the impacts the Deputy has mentioned, which could be quite serious for individuals and families.  I will look at it and come back.  I can see the difficulties a delay would lead to but I do not fully understand the cause of the delay.  There might be a plan in place to deal with it in the HSE.  I will not say anything because it might be putting something in place.  I do not have the details.</p></speech>

I believe 11,000 people are caught in this situation.  Many who contact my office are not aware of why it is happening.  We all understand the cyberattack had a crippling impact on the HSE's ability to administer data and its IT systems.  The idea that private companies are now making services available to register services outside of Dublin is a concern.  They are providing that service to people in Dublin at a cost above what the State charges so that they can effectively queue in an office outside Dublin which has lower demand.  That is a significant failure of the State.  I appreciate it is a delegated function of the HSE.  I ask Mr. Watt to take from this meeting the idea that we need to examine what is happening here.  The Department needs to set targets for when the HSE should have deaths and births registered.  When it falls below them, there should be penalties.  I imagine, from what Mr. Watt is saying, there is no specific service level agreement for this area.  Are any specific targets set?  Does the Department give the HSE any specific measurements regarding the administration of this function?</p></speech>

I would be amazed if there are not targets with a commitment to register within a certain timeframe.  I imagine that is part of the agreement or understanding between the parties involved.  I will check that.  We are not doing well enough at the moment.  I do not know the reasons or what action might be taken.  In the normal course of events, there would be a commitment to do it within a certain timeframe, so I imagine there is a service level agreement or target.  Whether that is explicitly written down or understood, I am sure it exists.  I will come back to the Deputy with an update.</p></speech>

A number of Deputies and Senators have concerns about it.  There is emotional trauma when people try to register a parent's death, have to go in again and again, and are unable to do so each time.  There is also a practical impact.  My concern is especially about early years and the registration for child benefit.  The Department needs to examine it.  It needs to make sure the HSE's difficulties are resolved.  If private companies are able to offer a service where they can get a birth certificate in another HSE office elsewhere in the country, then the HSE should be able to link those two things together and ensure people can avail of the additional resources that seem to be available within the current system, whether online or in person.  I appreciate Mr. Watt does not have the information in front of him.  I would appreciate a written response on it.</p></speech>

One is that we are about 60% of the way through the project's financial costs.  Some &euro;873 million will have been drawn down by the end of the year by the contractor.  Mr. Watt mentioned the &euro;1.43 billion that was budgeted and that we are now at a figure of &euro;1.7 billion as time has moved on, with increased costs due to construction cost inflation.  In the figures that Mr. Watt gave, the hospital is to be completed at the end of 2024.  That is in three years.  At a rate of 4.5% inflation in construction, which is probably conservative, it will cost approximately &euro;250 million extra due to inflation alone.</p><p>Then there are the claims on top of that.  Regarding the total claims between now and completion of the contract, Mr. Watt is obviously going to say this is commercially sensitive, but is the figure in the region of hundreds of millions or tens of millions of euro?  </p></speech>

I ask Mr. Watt to come back to us with clarification on that because it is very important.</p> <p>  We visited the site back in June, which was informative.  We learned about the number of claims and what they were for, as well as about changes, some of which were very last minute.  I know that everything cannot be foreseen, particularly on a big project but there were a huge number of claims, some of which were for very small things such as moving a window or changing a partition, for example.  I asked the person from the board and the contractor to show me examples of what the claims were about.  I was struck by the claims.  Another issue that struck me was related to energy usage.  I asked what provision was made to harvest any energy generated on site and whether there would be solar panels.  I was told there was no room for solar panels.  We were standing on top of the building, looking across the area at this point.  We were looking down on terraces of houses that have gable ends of about 6 m or 7 m by 5 or 6 m across.  We were looking at two-up, two-down and three-bedroom semi-detached houses, an awful lot of which were covered in solar panels but we were standing on a new building and were told that there would be no solar panels on it and no energy harvested from such panels.  Again, I know Mr. Watt came in after the contract was signed and the work commenced but am I correct that none of this was built into the contract?  </p> <p>  I am sure the hospital will be put into a very glossy portfolio by the architects involved in its design.  It is one of those "wow" projects, for want of a better word.  This is an amazing design of an amazing building and there is nothing like it anywhere in the State.  However, in terms of maintenance, it will take an army of window cleaners alone to keep the windows clean.  What is the annual estimated cost for maintenance and what is the situation regarding energy usage?  I hope that some thought was given to this before it was signed off by the Department and the Minister.  Can Mr. Watt give me an answer on the issues of energy usage and overall maintenance on an annual basis?</p></speech>

The Chairman has asked three questions about the claims <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the design changes.  There are disputes, as there tends to be in contracts, around whether claims are due to the fact that the design may have changed.</p><p>Of course, that will be disputed and there will be issues around that.</p><p> The second issue mentioned was energy usage.  I am sure it is an energy-efficient building that is built to the highest possible specifications.  The footprint is massive.  It is four times the size of Tallaght Hospital, so I am sure there will be significant maintenance costs involved.  I will come back to you, Chairman, on the specific questions on energy usage and maintenance.</p></speech>

In relation to pharma companies, is there any funding, benefit-in-kind, sponsorship or money for research for any particular projects that may transfer to healthcare professionals, healthcare facilities, hospitals or any entity working in the public system?  We spend in the region of &euro;2.3 billion a year on drugs.  It is a substantial amount of money.  A number of other European countries and the USA have regulations in place to govern the situation.  Mr. Watt will be aware that a number of companies are buying up GP practices, so they could have ten or 20.  We do know that we have a high prescription rate of drugs.  I am not medically qualified to say whether that is right or wrong but, apparently, compared to other countries we do dish them out fairly plentifully.  We do not have any way of tracking that.  I wish to raise the concern that people may be receiving more medication than they need or more expensive medication than is necessary.  I acknowledge that we have made progress over the years.  It is not that long ago that a standard antibiotic was approximately &euro;28 and now we can get it for &euro;8 or &euro;9.  I acknowledge the work that has been done by the Department in that regard.  Has Mr. Watt discussed with his colleagues or with the Minister the need to bring in regulations to ensure transparency so that if anyone working in the public system or entities attached to the public system or working within it are receiving any benefit, financial or otherwise, or benefit-in-kind from a pharma company, that the information is put on a register.</p></speech>

First, based on prescription patterns, an awful lot of drugs are prescribed.  I have the number of 60 million prescriptions a year in the GMS system in this country in my head.  I do not know if that encompasses drugs under the refund scheme as well, but the figure may encompass both.  There is a very significant level of prescription and it is a worry if it is inappropriate prescribing.  The overall cost now is very expensive at &euro;2.5 billion and it is increasing by 5.5% a year, which is not sustainable.  The cost is not sustainable and the level of drugs being taken is an issue as well.  We negotiated a deal with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, which the Government will sign off soon for an enhanced scheme to reduce the price, but we need to push ahead with more prescribing of generic, off-patent drugs, biosimilars and so on.  There is a big job of work to do in that regard.</p> <p>  You also raise an interesting question, Chair.  Public health officials who work in the public system cannot receive any hospitality or supports from anybody beyond a certain level covered by the ethics legislation.  GPs are not public servants, even though a lot of their income is funded by the public system.  I do not know whether the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, or other bodies have ethics guidelines to ensure that people are not unduly influenced when it comes to their prescribing patterns, but I imagine it is not an issue.  It is a good point.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Watt aware of whether there has been a discussion in that regard &ndash; "Yes" or "No" &ndash; on the public registration of that?</p></speech>

I have not had a discussion with the Minister and neither have colleagues.  The point I make is that public servants are not allowed to receive benefit-in-kind or gifts above a certain level under existing ethics legislation.  It they do, they have to disclose it.  I think the limit is &euro;350.  Any public servant receiving any benefit-in-kind from a pharmaceutical company would have to declare that anyway.  That would be declared and registered.  As I understand it, GPs are not public servants, even though they benefit significantly from the public purse.</p></speech>

If he is saying it is less than 60%, that would give a significant overrun.  If it was 55%, which is what I think he said, that would bring us up to &euro;1.6 billion.  Will Mr. Watt clarify what percentage of the project is complete?</p></speech>

The first is on the procurement and cost of the vaccination roll-out for 2020 and the spend to date for 2021.  If Mr. Watt has the figures and can furnish us with them, that would be great.</p> <p>  The second question concerns plans by the Department for the introduction of a Covid vaccine compensation scheme.  Has the Department made a decision on that?  The Government published the Meenan report in December 2020 and one recommendation of that report was that a compensation scheme be established.  I seek Mr. Watt's thoughts on that.</p></speech>

That might involve some carry costs into 2022.  The total cost for the three years is about &euro;500 million.  I will write to the committee with the exact numbers.  We pay some of it in advance but most is paid on delivery.  That includes the COVAX contribution.</p></speech>

It is not that expensive.  I will check and we will come back with the exact details.  We and other member states have pre-purchased them from Pfizer as part of the European Union deal.  We will come back on exactly what the vaccine spend is to date and prospectively.  It is evolving in terms of the uptake.  We will also come back on the antivirals.</p></speech>

I had the first dose in May and the second in July.  I queued for the booster dose on Sunday morning.  It was a long queue and I spent a few hours there but it shows there is a huge demand for it.  I acknowledge the tremendous work of the front-line staff.</p> <p>  There has been talk that there is not a great demand and we may have vaccines to spare.  I have two questions on that.  First, have any vaccines passed their best-before date?  Hopefully, those we cannot use or are surplus are sent to the developing countries that need them.  Second, is there a serious plan to ramp it up?  I think there is a huge demand for it.</p></speech>

It is not just the front-line workers but also the staff doing the negotiations, administrative staff and all the people in the Department of Health and the HSE, front-line and non-front-line, who are involved in this.  It has been an incredible public health endeavour, considering the amount of vaccine administered.</p> <p>  We are doing everything we can to ensure there is no wastage.  We are donating any doses we have which might be going out of date to other countries.  There is always some wastage at a local level.  It is always possible but is being kept to a minimum.  Everything is being done to ensure the supply we need is used and, if there is surplus, it is donated to other countries.  That is the policy but I do not think there has been significant wastage of deliveries received.</p><p>We have, however, diverted prospective deliveries that were due to come to Ireland to other countries, particularly in the lull after the end of the main second vaccination programme.</p><p> Deputy Dillon asked about vaccination compensation.  I have not yet addressed that question.  It is something the Department has committed to doing.  We will have to look at that.</p></speech>

Deputy Munster asked about the dental issue.  This week, we are again engaging with the Irish Dental Association in respect of changes to the dental treatment services scheme to reflect the challenges it currently faces.  I mentioned that we will engage early next year but, in fact, I understand engagement will take place this week.</p></speech>

I am conscious that the Department of Health has faced unprecedented challenges for the best part of two years.  We are probably facing into another difficult year.  It is to be hoped that we can get through it.  I acknowledge the work of the staff.  All members mentioned the front-line staff.  I also mentioned the administrative staff and everyone else behind that.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, and his staff for their attendance and assistance throughout the year.  This is the final meeting of the year and, on behalf of the committee, I thank the secretariat.  It is dangerous to mention names because I will leave some of them out, but I thank Sarah, Eoin, Pat, Sam and Shane for the service they have provided.  I also thank Martin, the clerk to the committee.  I wish the staff of the health service all the best for Christmas and the new year.</p> <p>  Is it agreed to request that the clerk seek any follow-up information and carry out any actions arising from today's meeting, of which there are a few?  The meeting was fairly robust and there were a lot of questions.  I know Mr. Watt does not have all the information to hand.  It is agreed that the clerk will follow up and, as always, the Department will supply that information to the committee.  That is agreed.  Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statement and the briefings provided to the committee for this meeting?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We will suspend until 1.30 p.m., when the committee will resume in public session to consider correspondence and other matters.</p></speech>

We will then go into private session before adjourning.  The first item is the minutes of our meeting of 9 December.  The minutes were circulated to members.  Do any members wish to raise any matters regarding the minutes?  No.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page.</p> <p>  The second item is accounts and financial statements.  Four financial statements and accounts were laid before the D&aacute;il between 6 and 10 December 2021.  They should be on the screen now.  I will ask Mr. McCarthy to address the accounts and financial statements before opening the floor to members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.535" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021121600002#Z00300"><p>As the Chairman said, there are four sets of financial statements to deal with.  The first relates to University College Cork.  Those are the 2019-20 financial statements.  I have given a qualified audit opinion for those statements.  The university recognises an asset in respect of deferred pension funding and that is standard practice for universities.  I do not normally qualify in such circumstances.  However, in this case, the amount of the asset that is recognised includes &euro;11.1 million in respect of liabilities relating to professional added years for transferred in service.  There is an agreement between the university and the Higher Education Authority that the expenses relating to the professional added years for transferred in service would be split on a 50:50 basis, but the university is over-recognising by &euro;3.8 million in respect of that.  In my view, that is not in accordance with the agreement and, therefore, I have qualified the audit opinion.</p> <p>  I also draw attention to significant non-compliance with procurement rules by the university.  More detail in that regard is given in the fees statement on internal control.  </p> <p>  The second set of financial statements relates to the Oberstown Children Detention Campus.  Those are the financial statements for 2020 and I have given a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The third relates to the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo.  These financial statements relate to the year of account 2017.  ReBo finished its restructuring operations in July 2017 and it was intended that the board would be dissolved at that stage.  However, the dissolution had to be done by way of new legislation and that Act was only passed in 2020.  I gave a clear audit opinion but there was a very significant delay in the finalisation of the 2017 financial statements.  The reason for that was that the board, in 2017, did not keep adequate accounting records.  It failed to correctly record and explain the transactions for the year and, therefore, we were unable to carry out an audit of the financial statements.  There was engagement with the Department of Finance, where the board is now housed.  In 2021, the board appointed external accounting expertise to investigate and rectify the accounting records.  Once that was done, we were able to complete the audit. </p> <p>  There are a number of further periods of account that we have now proceeded to audit with very few transactions.  I hope we will be able to do those fairly promptly.  As it stands, the board continues in existence until we have completed that process.</p> <p>  The accounts of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland for 2020 have been presented.  I gave those a clear audit opinion.</p></speech>

Otherwise we will move on to correspondence.</p></speech>

I presume it will be reported as an audit at that stage.  Until that happens, there is little we can surmise from what Mr. McCarthy has given us to date.  Am I right in that understanding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.538" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021121600002#Z00600"><p>The number of transactions after 2017 will be very small.  There was a total of fees for collection of approximately &euro;1.6 million.  That is the extent of the funds that are involved.  ReBo was using the credit union fund to carry out the restructuring so the expenses on this account are purely the administrative expenses of the restructuring board itself.  I hope we will get the 2018, 2019 and 2020 financial statements audited pretty quickly in the new year.  Each of those will come through as we do them.  It should be the case that 2021 and a few months of 2022 will be the final period of account.  The Deputy could certainly call the Department of Finance and the board members to discuss this matter if she wished.</p></speech>

The previous Committee of Public Accounts had a number of hearings with universities and third level institutions.  There were very high levels of non-compliance or unorthodox transactions and so on.  In actual fact, there was a "RT&Eacute; Investigates" report on the issue.  It is hugely disappointing to see that pattern still there among some of the universities.  That gives us an indication that this is an area we need to look at again next year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.540" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021121600002#AA00100"><p>Okay.  Is everyone else happy?  We will note the statements and accounts.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the list of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of our minutes.  I thank Mr. McCarthy.</p><p>We move on to the next item on our agenda, namely, correspondence.  As previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion at this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated and the decisions taken by the committee concerning the correspondence will be recorded in the minutes and published on the committee's web page.  Six items of correspondence have been flagged under category B, namely, correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the committee.  </p><p>No. 953B is correspondence from Ms Vivienne Flood, head of public affairs, RT&Eacute;, dated 3 December 2021, and is a response providing further information requested by the committee concerning the employment status of contractors who have worked with RT&Eacute;.  In that regard, the correspondence refers to the Eversheds review, stating that:</p> <blockquote> 	Contrary to claims that RT&Eacute; has been operating as a &quot;bogus employer&quot;, arising from this review, we have addressed the employment status of any individual deemed to have characteristics akin to employment.  We have therefore taken a proactive and comprehensive approach to dealing with residual issues due to practices which occurred in the past.  Since 2019, RT&Eacute; has implemented significant reform in this area, and has adopted an &quot;employment first&quot; principal. </blockquote> <p>The correspondence continues by stating that because the Department of Social Protection audit process is ongoing, RT&Eacute; cannot provide high-level data such as the numbers of personnel involved, categorisation of individuals, income levels etc.  As the Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection previously informed the committee, the audit could take well over another year and will assess the employment specifics of the contractual relationships of some 500 individuals with RT&Eacute;.  It is therefore a significant investigation.  The correspondence from RT&Eacute; concludes by stating that it &ldquo;cannot provide any further details as to these reviews, which are either ongoing or pending, either in correspondence, or in committee session, until their conclusion.&rdquo;  Is it agreed that we note and publish this item?  Agreed.  I have flagged this item for discussion, along with Deputies Catherine Murphy and Munster.  I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

That aspect is disappointing.  It is important that we know what is happening in this context because we want practical changes.  Representatives of RT&Eacute; are telling us that there have been changes, but other people are telling us that it is not happening in reality.  That is disappointing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.542" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021121600002#AA00300"><p>I do not think Deputy Munster is with us yet.  Regarding the inquiry taking more than a year, that is fair enough.  It is a substantial undertaking in that it is addressing the contractual relationship of approximately 500 contractors, as RT&Eacute; terms them.  The issue concerns what is happening regarding those people who have been reclassified and what their situation is now in respect of having proper PRSI credits paid for them for the years during which they were wrongly classified in that regard and any other benefits they would have been due if they had been categorised as PAYE workers during that time.  We will require an update on those aspects.  Representatives from RT&Eacute; are due in with us in our first sitting in January 2022, so we will look for that information then.  Is everybody else happy with that item?  Okay.</p> <p>  No. 957 is correspondence from Mr. Martin Whelan, head of public affairs and communications, National Treasury Management Agency, dated 6 December 2021, which provides further information as requested by the committee regarding the State Claims Agency, SCA.  It includes responses to requests for information in relation to the outstanding financial liability in respect of cell sanitation in the Irish Prison Service; the outstanding financial liability in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na active claims; and a progress update on open disclosure and any engagement the SCA is having with the legal profession to encourage mediated settlements, as opposed to court settlements.  Is it agreed that we note and publish this item?  Agreed.  The only comment I have regarding this correspondence is that there are a considerable number of claims in this context.  There are 2,399 active claims against the Prison Service and many of those probably concern cell sanitation.  We should keep an eye on this matter because it involves a significant number of people and a certain amount of money.  In addition, 150 staff members and 47 members of the public are also involved in those claims.</p> <p>  No. 959B is from Mr. Jim Breslin, Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, dated 6 December 2021, and provides information requested by the committee regarding capital funding being withheld from the University of Limerick, UL.  This arises from a matter we examined when we engaged with representatives of UL in June, namely the acquisition by the university of a site in Limerick city centre in 2019.  It will be recalled that this concerns the old Dunnes Stores site.  The Secretary General states that the funding has been withheld "pending assurances from [UL] in relation to capital management procedures".  Several questions regarding this matter remained unanswered when we raised it with the representatives of UL, who stated that the matter was the subject of a review by KPMG.  I propose that we note and publish this item and request a progress update from UL on the KPMG report.  Our last update from UL on the matter was on 21 October 2021, in correspondence referenced as R0842.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  This item was flagged for discussion by Deputy Carthy.</p></speech>

We might have got this before, but, if not, could we request KPMG's terms of reference for the conduct of that inquiry and the details of who drew them up.  The fourth paragraph down piqued my interest, which referred to the total grant amount calculated for UL for 2021-22 as being &euro;2.4 million.  Of that, some &euro;757,000 was approved for release in August to support time-sensitive payments relating to additional places and ICT supports for disadvantaged students, with a decision on the balance of those funds pending.  I wonder if one aspect relates to the other.  It does seem like the institution is on a short leash.  For that reason, I would put this matter in with what we have heard about the audit in University College Cork.  There is an issue with both these institutions.  The concern for us in this regard is when we will have representatives from both institutions in before the committee.  We will want to see that report from KPMG in advance of speaking to witnesses from the two universities, but it does seem to be the case that the Department is keeping a close eye on things in this regard.</p></speech>

It continued by stating that the governing authority of the university had confirmed that it will act to address any issues, findings or recommendations highlighted by the review in due course.  I suggest that we follow up this matter after today's meeting and that we seek a copy of that report from the Department as soon as it is finalised.</p></speech>

In total, the figure for 2019 and 2020 is over &euro;1.3 million, and that excludes legal costs.  Is it agreed that we note and publish this item and redact personal information?</p><p>Agreed.  It is proposed also to request a breakdown of the costs, which were provided at quite a high level.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Catherine Murphy has flagged this item.</p></speech>

We will not publish this item because the information has been provided on a confidential basis and because it concerns an industrial relations dispute.  The chief superintendent states that the matter is being progressed through all available dispute resolution processes, including the industrial relations machinery of the State.  I ask members to bear in mind this is an industrial relations issues and that they should respect the confidential nature of the information.

The length of time, at the best of times, that GSOC investigations take can be quite frustrating for those who are dealing with the system.

We will hold it until the January meeting.  It is detailed correspondence.  Waiting until January will give members time to examine it and raise any issues they have with it.</p> <p>  The next item is our work programme.  On 25 November, we agreed we would agree to the work programme for early in the new year.  The updated schedule has been circulated to members.  On 20 January, we will engage with RT&Eacute; and representatives of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media - that is some Department - which provides RT&Eacute; with State funding.  The secretariat will work to schedule an engagement with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, for 27 January, and on 3 February, we plan to engage with the National Transport Authority, NTA.  We will also invite representatives from the Department of Transport to attend those meetings.  Members have requested that those meetings would run one after the other because of the close relationship between the bodies.  On 10 November, we planned to engage with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and National Broadband Ireland to examine expenditure on the national broadband plan.  We will continue to revisit the work programme each week.  Do members wish to raise any matters relating to the work programme?</p></speech>

The timeframe for putting specific questions to each body will be very limited.  If it is the case we will deal with each body separately, I propose that we waive the correspondence meeting in the afternoon and have National Broadband Ireland for the full session, beginning at 9.30 a.m., and the Department for the full session in the afternoon, and hold any correspondence over until the following week.  It would be a short timeframe within which to deal with any organisation.  We had difficulties when we tried to hold meetings under two hours.  If we were to give ourselves even less time, I do not think we would get to the crux of what are a series of important issues that have come to light in recent weeks with regard to the national broadband plan.</p></speech>

I agree it is a substantial item, and it will be up to the committee to agree to how it wants to handle this.  Perhaps it cannot be done in that timeframe.  I am open to suggestions on that.  I will open the floor to other members.  It is one we are all interested in.</p></speech>

In previous discussions, there was particular interest in TII and a number of specific issues relating to it.  The same is true of the NTA, in the area of public transport and related matters, where there is rail, bus and a range of other areas.  I do not think we should rush it or try to compress it into one meeting to make way for a double-header with National Broadband Ireland and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.</p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned that we will probably invite the Department of Heath back in, and that might be sooner rather than later, given that today's meeting was dominated by the national children's hospital.</p></speech>

I think it will be more coherent if we do it that way, although I agree it should be done in two separate groups because there is an oversight aspect in respect of the Department, which we have to drill into.  As for TII and the NTA, they both operate in the area of public transport but have separate remits.</p><p>There was a significant overrun in respect of the Sallins bypass and there are deficiencies in what was produced.  The local authority is the ultimate body in that regard.  My concern is that we will not capture some of the projects where there are problems.  There will be no shortage of material for both of those.  We should be considering both of them.</p><p> As regards health and the national paediatric hospital, we absolutely have to put that back on the agenda for some point in the first half of next year.  Health representatives, whether from the HSE or the Department, would normally appear a few times a year before the committee.  We did not get into much of the Vote at all.  It was mainly the pent-up questions we had on the children's hospital.</p><p> A matter that is probably more for Mr. McCarthy is that of the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the site on Military Road in particular.  I continue to have serious concerns in respect of that site and the selection process for the site.  Are there any further insights?  Will it crop up in an audit?  If not, it may fall within our annual review of the OPW.</p></speech>

As I recall, the site was actually in the ownership of the OPW.  It is not that it identified and bought the site.  As such, the issue really relates to whether it is a good option for delivering the service that is required, rather than being a procurement issue.  The project is under way.  I am not 100% certain what stage it is at.  The Deputy raised questions previously in respect of whether it will provide the level of accommodation that is required by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda will have a view on the issue as well.  If An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appears before the committee, that might be a matter members wish to raise with it.</p></speech>

We had it in twice already.  I know the site on Military Road is an issue in terms of whether the accommodation is adequate but there are a range of other issues as well because the OPW has a wide remit.  We should add it to the agenda to have it appear in the new year, as well as the Department of Health.</p> <p>   I return to the issue of TII and the NTA.  Any member wishing to come in on this should raise his or her hand.  From what members have said, it would be a bit too compressed to try to do the whole lot in one 90-minute morning session.  There would be less than an hour and a half for the next one.  I propose that we take one organisation in the morning and the other in the afternoon.  We will send an invitation to them on that basis.  </p> <p>  That concludes our consideration of the work programme for today.  Are there any other matters members wish to raise before the committee goes into private session?  We will now go into private session before adjourning until Thursday, 20 January, when we will engage with Raidi&oacute; Teilif&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the report, Grounded - Unequal access for people with disabilities to personal transport schemes.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Peter Tyndall, Ombudsman, and Ms Sarah Cooney, principal officer at the Office of the Ombudsman.  I thank them for agreeing them to attend earlier than originally planned this morning.</p> <p>  I must remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically within the confines of Leinster House.  In this regard, if members are joining the meeting remotely, I ask them to confirm they are on the grounds of Leinster House before they make a contribution to the meeting.  For anybody who is watching the meeting online, the witnesses are joining us remotely, and due to the unprecedented circumstances, I ask everybody to bear with us should any technical issues arise.</p> <p>  Before we commence formal proceedings, witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts to note that constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before the committee may not extend to them.  Unfortunately, no clear guidance can be given on that issue and, of course, persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should be mindful of the domestic statutory regime.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they should respect the direction of the committee.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I now call Mr. Tyndall to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

I am very glad to have the invitation to come here today to discuss the recently published commentary report, which we called Grounded: unequal access for people with disabilities to personal transport schemes.</p> <p>  I had the opportunity of meeting the committee in June this year to discuss the Wasted Lives report about the inappropriate placement of people aged under 65 in nursing homes.  I was very pleased with the coverage that report received and particularly, as a consequence of the appearance before the committee, that progress is starting to be made on tackling that issue.  I thought at the time it would be my final appearance before the committee, but members are intent on keeping me working until the day of my retirement, so here I am.  I am very pleased to be here.</p> <p>  As members will know, the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, provided a legal basis for people with disabilities to have the right to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life.  Lack of access to transport is one of the key barriers to stopping the realisation of those fundamental rights and can lead to further economic, social, and personal isolation of people living with a disability.  The opposite is also true, and access to transport can for many people be an equaliser.  It can enable people to change their lives for the better.</p> <p>  Article 9 of the UNCRPD is focused on accessibility and puts an onus on signatories to provide equal access to transportation for people living with a disability.  This is to enable them to participate fully in daily life, for example, to access further education, work, be involved in their community, have contact with their families and friends, shop and participate in social activities and hobbies.</p> <p>  As members will know, in Ireland, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 sets the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.  Under the strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as it was then called, assumed responsibility for the continued development and availability of accessible public transport.  I noted that the new order of DART carriages, for example, will allow access from the platform by wheelchair, which is clearly a step in the right direction and an improvement on the current situation.  I warmly welcome all the work that is being done in this area.</p> <p>  For some people living with a disability, however, public transport is not the most appropriate mode.  It is often put that this especially affects people in rural settings, and that is entirely true.  If a person is living far away from public transport, then clearly it does not offer him or her the opportunity to engage in the life of his or her community.  It equally affects people living in a town and city context because not all of them will be able to access public transport.</p> <p>  It is worth saying that, at the moment, public transport accessibility continues to be an issue.  Not a day goes by without a long list of lifts being out of action in railway stations.  Similarly, it is completely inappropriate that somebody wanting to use a train or a DART has actually to arrange for somebody to be there to enable him or her to get onto it.  It is hoped these issues will be addressed in time, but the notion, as it is sometimes presented, that public transport will of itself solve the issue of access to transport for disabled people is quite false and will remain false.  People need access to personal transport for the reasons I have outlined - to be able to do the things the rest of us take for granted.  People cannot work without it.  They quite often find it difficult to get to hospital appointments or medical appointments without it.  This is a big and continuing issue.</p> <p>  When I started as Ombudsman, one thing I was embarrassed to discover at a meeting of ombudsmen in Europe was that we were one of only two countries present that had not actually signed up at that time to the United Nations convention.  The other very striking thing was that Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, my predecessor, had produced reports about the two schemes, namely, the mobility allowance and motorised transport schemes, on the grounds that those schemes were not compliant with equality requirements.  The Government decided at the time to close the schemes down and promised to provide replacements.</p> <p>  The reason I have spoken of this issue as unfinished business is that here we are at the end of my tenure and still those replacement schemes have not been put in place.  During that time, there has been no access to mobility allowance and no access to the motorised transport schemes for new applicants.  That clearly is entirely inappropriate and should have been addressed.</p> <p>  I pursued the matter in a number of occasions.  On each occasion, I was given reassurances that work was in hand to develop new schemes.  When it came down to it, however, it seemed to me that the resource issue always came in the way.  Each time a proposal was developed, it was not brought forward because of cost.  There reality is, however, the cost to our community of preventing access for so many people and preventing participation should have been taken into account when making decisions on resources.</p> <p>  The other scheme that did continue was that which enabled tax concessions for disabled people or people who were providing transport for them.  As many members will know, that scheme has some very restrictive criteria.  The criteria are about defined disabilities.  They are not about mobility.  The reason a person needs transport is because he or she is not mobile enough to access community facilities without it.  Having to fit into this narrow definition excludes many people who are just as much in need of access to support through the scheme as the people it admits.  I have consistently been highlighting that but, in fact, it was highlighted again before my time.  Ultimately, the courts determined that the criteria for the scheme were not consistent with the legislation, so rather than change the criteria, they wrote the deficient criteria into the primary legislation.  I was astonished, frankly, at how that matter was dealt with.</p> <p>  I know from my own contacts with the people who are charged with making the assessments that they are as frustrated by the criteria as my office is.  It is not their frustration or my office's frustration, however.  It is the enormous frustration of large numbers of disabled people who cannot understand why some people who are as disabled as them can access the scheme and they cannot.  That is an issue that urgently needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  The most striking thing about this and one of the very good aspects of the way the Ombudsman's office works in Ireland is the number of people who are supported in bringing complaints to the office by their local elected representatives.  There is scarcely an elected representative in the Oireachtas or in the Government, for that matter, who has not represented the cases of people to my office.</p><p>As I saw it, it was not maladministration but deficient legislation.  The solution lay with the people bringing the complaints.  This issue has run for a long time and, from my perspective, it is unfinished business.  I hope the committee will now make sure it does not last through the life of my successor, Mr. Ger Deering, to whom I offer many congratulations on his nomination to the post.  It is one of those things that we should be ashamed of and we need to do something about it.</p></speech>

I did not think I would be meeting him again.  I wish him a happy retirement again.  I thank him for the work he has done on bringing this forward as it is very important.  It is an issue the committee has discussed on a number of occasions.   The two grants that were suspended or finished in 2013 and not replaced are raised at any meeting I have with disabled people or carers.  It is totally unfair there are no new applicants for those schemes or that a better scheme has not been put in place.  This is unequal and makes it unfair to disabled people.</p> <p>  The criteria for the primary medical search are very strict.  Many people whom we think should qualify do not.  The scheme needs to be completely overhauled.  I thought something positive would come of it when it was brought to court but unfortunately it did not happen and, as Mr. Tyndall said, the wrong decision was taken.  Is Mr. Tyndall aware of any Government review of the scheme or any intention by the Government to introduce a new scheme to replace it?  It is almost nine years since it was suspended and the Government did undertake to replace it with something else.  If this does not happen will we be able to implement the UNCRPD with regard to transport?  Mr. Tyndall knows more that I do that the UNCRPD covers every aspect of a person's life.  Without addressing the issue of transport and the unavailability of suitable transport options for people, particularly in rural areas, we will not fulfil their rights.  Is Mr. Tyndall aware of any review?  Will we be able to ratify the UNCRPD?</p></speech>

On each occasion I have raised it, I was told reviews were under way and that proposals would be brought forward.  It reached the point where proposals were ready to be brought to Cabinet and then they were withdrawn at the last minute.  At that point I determined to produce this report because it was clear to me it was not a temporary halt.  It was at that point the issue was effectively off the table.  Now I believe further work may be under way and perhaps Ms Cooney will say something about this.</p></speech>

Our understanding of the matter is the disability capacity review undertaken by the Department of Health and the recent cost of disability exercise done by the Department of Social Protection will be utilised to develop proposals on the various schemes and that there will be a whole-of-government approach and a scheme developed to encompass all of this.  I am unsure of the details of the scheme or what it might look like.  The disability inclusion strategy has various working groups.  I understand there is a working group on transport and it will come before the committee and decisions will be made.  I understand from speaking to other Departments that work is ongoing on how mobility may be assessed and what schemes may look like.  Unfortunately there is no detail that I am aware of on what the scheme may look like at this stage.</p></speech>

This could drag out for many more years.  We hope it will not.  Yesterday there was a discussion when Deputy Wynne and I raised a Topical Issue on the Indecon report on the cost of disability.  We were informed by the Minister there was a meeting that encompassed all Departments undertaking this work.  I hope it will progress at a rapid pace.  Many disabled people tell me they find it very difficult to book an accessible taxi.  What seems to be happening is that the HSE is also contracting the accessible taxis.  Individuals in their own homes who want to visit someone or go to the shops cannot get out.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

I wish him the very best of luck and I also wish his successor the very best of luck.  I hope we will not need to have him before us to discuss another report on unmet needs.  I hope we will use all of the reports to make the changes necessary to ensure we have full access for all of our citizens, friends and family to the services we have in this country.</p> <p>  Mr. Tyndall knows as well as all of us there is such inequity and it is heartbreaking to hear the stories.  I see family members stopped in their tracks because of an inaccessible bus or train.  It is so common.  Deputy Tully asked what the Department is doing.  Everyone on the committee is impatient.  We were impatient with Ms Emily O'Reilly's report and we are still here waiting for the Department.  I do not know whether the Department is waiting for the Indecon report or the structures to implement the UNCRPD.  There is always procrastination as it waits for a next step to be done before taking a step that should have already been taken.</p> <p>  What does Mr. Tyndall think is the problem with this clear inability of the Department to push it down the road?  It recognises there is a problem and perhaps a small pilot programme is done.  What is the mindset in the Department that it does not see this as we see it, that it is unacceptable to block our family members, neighbours and communities from accessing what we take for granted?  I am so infuriated by this.  Mr. Tyndall's report is excellent and I learned a lot from it.  What is his opinion on why things are so bad and why the can is kicked down the road repeatedly?</p></speech>

The committee is keeping me working until the end and I am happy to do so.  The issue does not necessarily just lie with one Department.  Much of it lies with the interaction between people controlling resources and people developing proposals.  The only way the committee can be satisfied that progress is being made is to call people before it on a regular basis and have updates.</p><p>One issue I have with it is, if you want to kick something into the long grass then give it to yet another committee to look at.  This stuff is not rocket science.  People have developed proposals.  What actually needs to happen is not that it should go through another round of discussions in endless inter-departmental committees, but that proposals should be brought preferably to this committee to be scrutinised and that we can move forward and implement a scheme.  When you hear there will be discussions and that many Departments will be involved what I tend to hear is we do not intend doing anything about this in the near future but we will give an impression of activity in the hope that it will not continue to attract attention.  That would be my view.  It is necessary to hold people to account for delivery as opposed to holding people to account for having nice talks.  </p></speech>

We have taken on our previous engagement with him and we have been pressing in regard to the Wasted Lives report.  I have had the opportunity to meet the next Ombudsman through the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure Reform and Taoiseach.  At that committee I was glad to see there was a commitment to follow through on all the recommendations that Mr. Tyndall has made.  It will be important that all of the recommendations in his report as Ombudsman are followed through so that the sustained pressure that he describes as necessary is kept on.</p> <p>  A couple of points in this report struck me, as well as one that was not in the report but is an issue and I wonder has he thoughts on it.  My former colleague, John Dolan, when he was a Member of my Civil Engagement Group in the Seanad, highlighted the disability accessibility dimension of transport contracts when they were being awarded, particularly in rural Ireland.  In fact we had legislation on it.  It is a useful point to look at, not just in terms of this issue but the knock-on effect which is that public duty on equality and human rights that public bodies have, that they also need to follow that through when they are contracting or procuring services.  They need to make sure that any public service that the public receives is there on an equitable basis and is there for everybody.  Does the witness think there has been learning from that embarrassment in the past?  Have there been improvements in the practices?  What should be learned from that for other areas of public service delivery which tend to work with private contractors in the way that transport does?</p> <p>  I am also very struck by the point on age.  That point about you move to just being an older person and those additional supports you need become harder to access because the attitude is well, you have a bus pass that should do you.  Will the witness talk about the importance of making sure that age does not become a barrier or be allowed to become a barrier to these specific schemes even though there are also many other barriers to these schemes?  The idea of doing this audit of your hands, legs and arms must be quite distressing for people especially those who potentially may have rehabilitative aspirations in regard to their future mobility.  They may need this in order to stay active and stay in the world and do the things that are important to them, and who may well hope to have some improvement along the line.  They should not have this is a bar or threshold.  Will the witness comment on those issues?  </p> <p>  I think the same thing that Senator McGreehan touched on which is, why are these measures always incrementally rolled out, piloted, done to a small degree, rather than made to a large scale?  When we give a support to a business sector for example, we do not give it to five companies out of 50, we give it to a sector.  Yet, and this was in the Wasted Lives report, we have this incremental, slow roll-out of something we know is needed.  Will the witness just comment on those points please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.595" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Tyndall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021121600002#D00300"><p>There are many issues there.  The first one I will address is the issue of older people and disability.  When I did the Wasted Lives report one of the things that was pointed out is that there are quite a few older people in nursing homes who ought to be in the community as well, or who would want to be in the community.  We focused on a particular tranche of people but that did not mean we took the view that others were properly there.  I do not take that view.  Part of that is that, to remain in the community you have to be able to have access.  When Emily O'Reilly highlighted the fact that the schemes discriminated against older people, it was exactly that point.  The requirements for older and disabled people can be just the same as for younger and disabled people so the notion that the scheme should have been closed at a particular age made no sense whatsoever.  I endorse that point.</p> <p>  In regard to the point on transport in rural areas, I am not conscious of our having had many complaints about that, which makes it more difficult for me to comment on.  We have a particular role under the disability legislation, particularly around access to public buildings, and I encourage members in dealing with constituents but also the organisations working with disabled people to encourage more people to bring complaints to my office.  It is only when we have some evidence that we are in a position to move forward with issues.  I am well aware of the issue and the fact that we were embarrassed into improvements but people were not complaining particularly, to my knowledge, to this office.  In the future, if people are aware of it as an issue, help them to come.  Have I covered all the points the Senator raised?</p></speech>

I am impressed that they managed to produce another necessary and important report before Mr. Tyndall's retirement.  I wish him best wishes in his retirement.  Access to transport is an issue I have been raising since elected and one the committee has been exploring since it was formed.  For my constituency of County Clare which is very rural and public transport is patchy at best but even less practical for wheelchair users.  It is interesting to hear that the Ombudsman has not had many complaints on access from rural areas.  One Clare man in particular, P&aacute;draic Hayes, has done Trojan work to highlight the lack of access to transport.  He explains that for many transport is the key factor in accessing work, shopping for essentials and any kind of social and cultural life.  It is the keystone for all these aspects of life.  Without it a person is denied the right to participate.  Without transport in County Clare, at the very least, there is a negative knock-on effect.  Local Link, a regional route bus service in the county, only operates between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. which means it cannot assist anybody who is in full-time employment for a regular 9 to 5.  That is just one example, there is a massive gap.  Public transport is one thing, as the report shows, and having private means of transport is another.</p><p>The mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant were slashed in that cost-cutting austerity bust phase of governance.  It has further disabled people with disabilities by removing the pathways to participating fully and meaningfully in society with still no alternatives.  As Mr. Tyndall has reminded us, as Ombudsman, he has been flagging these issues since 2012.  His concerns seem to have fallen on deaf ears.</p><p> My first question is: what response did he get from the Department when he, for example, recommended a review six months after that discontinuance, or when he raised his concerns with them?  He has already mentioned the justifications, whereby they refer to lack of resources and the plan being withdrawn at the last minute.  As he said, the cost for community and rights is so acute.</p><p> Second, it has been suggested that the previous schemes had their own disadvantages, including that they potentially breached the Equal Status Acts.  What should we as a committee be advocating for moving forward?  What does Mr. Tyndall see as the most effective and inclusive model for a private transport scheme, knowing, as he does, the inner workings of the previous ones?  I would love to hear his thoughts.  I would love to hear his opinions on how to move away from a medical model assessment based on impairment towards a human rights or social model-aligned assessment.</p></speech>

There was a lot in that.  I have always said that it is the proud boast of the Office of the Ombudsman that no recommendation has not been accepted.  There are many ombudsman offices in countries that are less democratic, or that are newer to democracy than Ireland is, which struggle to get recommendations accepted.  Generally, once the recommendations are accepted, they are implemented.  However, this recommendation is a glaring example of a set of recommendations that were accepted but then were not implemented.  I never got a refusal to engage.  The Department was always able to give me an update on progress.  Somebody in a newspaper article quoted me as saying, and I was in turn quoting a member of staff about something else, that it was the slowest slow bicycle race on record.  It is not usually the case that people say, "No, we are not going to do that".  However, it did reach a point where proposals, which had taken a very long time to draw up, were finally about to be brought forward to Cabinet and the plug was pulled because of resource issues.  That was the turning point in all of this.  Now we hear that the issue is being moved forward to a much broader process of developing proposals across the spectrum for disabled people.  That is not enough.  There needs to be more definitive proposals.</p> <p>  The deficiency in the previous schemes that was identified was principally the lack of access for older people.  From an equality perspective, as I said in answer to an earlier question, there should not be, and cannot be, an upper age limit on the scheme.  If people need to have transport to access the communities, that need will be there regardless of their age.  That is an important point.  We are always going to have to have some set of criteria as to who should access the scheme.  However, it should be about people needing it because their mobility is in some way affected.  It could equally be that they might not have a physical disability that affects movement, but, for instance, that they might have a severe condition that affects their stamina, their ability to walk or they may have a degenerative illness.  That is a set of reasons people's mobility might be impaired.  The issue is that this scheme has to be for people who cannot otherwise get around.  The measure has to be their mobility.  I think the Deputy can envisage quite a number of models.  The tax breaks, for instance, within the current scheme are quite comprehensive.  That is not a bad model.  It is just the access issues that are the problem.  Then you-----</p></speech>

I apologise that I was thrown out of the meeting for a moment.  I love technology.  It was so much better when we could all sit in a room and talk to each other, was it not?</p> <p>  Just coming back to the point, we are going to have some issues around adaptations, such as capital funding to enable people to have vehicles adapted.  There are also other issues around the additional costs that people experience as a consequence of being disabled.  The scheme must be able to reflect those issues.  Between the two schemes, one helped people to get access to their own transport while the other helped them with the daily cost of transport.  Any new scheme would have to retain those characteristics.  Clearly, there has to be some measure of affordability.  When rights are concerned, priorities come into it.  Regarding access to resources, there needs to be prioritisation given to the rights of people with disabilities.  That is what has troubled me.  That priority has not been evident.</p></speech>

It sets out what the issues have been.  The biggest message is that there is inequality.  Some disabled people had the benefit of the schemes to help them.  Then, because they were suspended, nothing else was put in place.  Those who came after have been left without any support.  That in itself is an inequality.  Mr. Tyndall and Ms Cooney have fairly well set that out in the report.  I thank them for that.</p> <p>  I believe that the logjam is in the fact that officials within the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance are looking at the cost of such schemes.  I live in a rural constituency in Galway and I know of people who are inside their homes seven days a week.  They cannot get out, unless somebody such as a member of the family, comes and brings them some place, maybe to do the shopping or just to get out of the house.  It is like a jail sentence.  This is for the simple reason that they cannot drive.  However, if they had a car, it could be adapted.  If they were given money for mobility systems, they would be able to get a taxi more often and that type of thing.</p> <p>  Since I came into the D&aacute;il I have served in a ministerial position.  I understand from when I was in the previous Government how tricky it can be to convince officials to do what sometimes might be the right thing.  The former Minister of State, Finian McGrath, tried his best to get a scheme in place when he was in office.  I am sure that the current Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will do her best to do something here as well.  The difficulty is that we need to, like Mr. Tyndall and Ms Cooney have done in their report, set out what that is as clearly as possible.</p> <p>  On 1 December, I was working on a case for a constituent who had applied for the primary medical certificate.  It had been refused.  Last June, it went to appeal to the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  Staff wrote in June to say that they had the application.  They wrote again in October to say that because of everything that happened and being unable to hold their appeals, that there was delay.  I contacted the chair of the appeals board to get a reply back on 1 December.  The secretary of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal who confirmed that the current members of the board had resigned in recent weeks.</p><p>However, the Departments of Health and Finance are working together to find members of a new board as quickly as possible.  As soon as the new board is in place and operational, I will be contacting the constituent when we have a date for his appeal.  I am very concerned about this.  I do not know whether the  was aware that the members of the board had resigned.  Why they resigned is one thing, but if they were resigning because their term of office was done, one would imagine that a new board would have been ready to take over in order to ensure a seamless transition.</p><p> At present, there is no appeals mechanism and people are waiting more than a year to make appeals.  To compound the problem even more, virtually all the appeals are being heard in D&uacute;n Laoghaire in Dublin and some are being heard in Cork.  However, no appears are being heard anywhere else.  A number of years ago, appeals were held in County Roscommon over a few days.  We really and truly are only paying lip service to all of this.  That is why I welcome the report.  Was the  aware that the members of the board of appeal had resigned?  Does he know why, or what is going on there?  The report, entitled Grounded: Unequal access for people with disabilities to personal transport schemes, is aptly named.  I am seriously concerned.  The report has shone a light that will perhaps be of help to the committee.  We will need to get full political pull on this issue in order to ensure that we can put something in place that is meaningful and effective and will help the disabled person, rather than categorising them and requiring them to have a severe disability to access the scheme.  I know many people who cannot access it.  A person needs to be an amputee or a wheelchair user to access it.  Even with that, I know one person who is a wheelchair user and has been refused it.  I am annoyed and frustrated about it.  While the  and I feel frustrated, the people with disabilities must feel demoralised when they are refused it.  Perhaps the  can comment on the resignations of the members of the board.</p></speech>

I was aware that the members of the committee were very unhappy about people having to administer a scheme with the characteristics we have been discussing.  The most diplomatic way of putting it is that I was not surprised to hear that they had resigned.  The Deputy's assumption is that as no measures were put in place, these people were not leaving because their term of office was over.  It is probably best to ask them directly, but my sense is that they were being asked to do a job and they were fully aware of how deficient the criteria they were being asked to implement were.  I think they, like the Deputy, would have found it frustrating at having to turn down people who clearly needed to access the scheme but who were not entitled to do so because of the narrowly drawn nature of the criteria.  The Deputy can draw his own conclusions as to why they resigned.</p> <p>  The criteria are clearly nonsensical.  They have almost a 19th century feel to them.  It is a very old-fashioned way of going about determining whether a person needs access to transport.  When the court properly found that they were not consistent with the legislation, rather than changing the criteria, the Government changed the legislation.  It is time now to change the criteria, and to change them urgently.  There were to sets of reasons for delays.  The first one, of course, was that when the decision of the court was made, it was no longer possible for the board to continue to make decisions because the criteria had been deemed to be inconsistent with the legislation.  There was a period during which no decisions were made until the legislation was changed.  Then, of course, we have the situation now that not long after the legislation was changed, the members of the board stepped down.  The delays just add to the frustration.</p></speech>

More importantly, I thank them for all the work they do on disability matters and for highlighting the failures of the Government and the State.  The discontinuation of the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant for new applicants in 2013 was disgraceful, but the fact that no adequate replacement has been developed in eight years is truly shocking.  The situation is just another clear violation of individuals' rights under the UNCRPD, including their right to equal access to transport under Article 9 and also the right to live independently under Article 19.  Disabled people who cannot drive depend on public transport or, more often, family to allow them to work, socialise and spend time outside of their home.  It is particularly acute in rural areas, where, for example, people who are visually impaired rely on families and taxis, which are expensive.  I was surprised to hear the  say in response to Senator Higgins that he does not hear much from people in those situations.  I will certainly encourage the many people who contact my office about that issue to get in touch with the 's office.</p><p>Schemes like the mobility allowance are targeted supports that involve relatively small amounts in the scale of national budgets, but they can make a massive difference to the lives of individuals.  As the  has pointed out, there an additional inequity because there are still people on the scheme, but new entrants are not allowed.  It has been within the remit of the Government and those which preceded it to resolve the situation.  I thank the  and his staff for all their diligent work on and candour expressed in the report.  I refer to a paragraph from the conclusion that I think is important to read out and highlight to the whole committee and anyone who is watching.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	The reports published by the  since 2012 highlight the same issues over and over again.  I am very concerned that the issues identified appear to have effectively been ignored and that nine years later, there is no evidence of any real progress that would serve to enhance the lives of those for whom these schemes were intended to assist with their daily lives.  This is of huge concern to me.  </blockquote> <p>It is really important to read that quotation out because it highlights the gravity of this report and the situation that we are in.  We have these meetings every week, and every week we feel the same despair.  I know I mention it often, but I must say that I always come back to the fact that Ireland has yet to ratify the optional protocol on the UNCRPD.  We heard from a public representative in Australia last week and a family who has had experiences of living in Australia and in Ireland, and the differences in the disability support services they have accessed.  It was truly shocking to hear.  It took us ten years to ratify the UN convention in the first place.  It is a disgrace that we still have not ratified the optional protocol.  It is unbelievable.  We have seen from other countries that that is how people realise their rights.</p><p>The report catalogues the various issues raised by the Ombudsman and his predecessors on this issue.  From the Ombudsman's engagement with the HSE and successive Ministers for Health, how seriously does the he think the Government takes the invaluable work he is doing?  I am interested in hearing how the State agencies and the Government respond to the Office of the Ombudsman.  To help frame how the Government and the HSE address - or do not address - failures to protect the rights of disabled people, I ask the Ombudsman to elaborate on what has happened in respect of the Wasted Lives report into the inappropriate placement of people under the age of 65 in nursing homes, which we discussed back in June.</p><p>The report notes that the Ombudsman and his predecessors: &quot;have highlighted the unfairness and inequity of these schemes, the response by Government has been to either discontinue the schemes without replacement, or in the case of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, to reinforce the inequitable eligibility criteria in primary legislation.&quot;  This example is another in a very long list that this committee has heard about concerning repeated Government failures.  What action on personal transport could the Government take to convince the Ombudsman that it is taking the rights of people with disabilities seriously?</p></speech>

We look across the work we do as an office and there are few areas where there are outstanding issues.  Sometimes we get frustrated at the speed at which things are done but they generally are done.</p> <p>  I will choose a different example in the health field.  We brought forward recommendations early on in my tenure about changes to the way complaints are handled within the HSE and the vast majority of those recommendations have been implemented.  There has been constant engagement with the office on that.  Action plans have been put in place and updated in how they have proceeded.  We did it in the context of acute hospitals, for example, and the HSE extended the work to the community.  There are good examples of engagement, although we do have areas of frustration in our work with the HSE.  I will not talk about the treatment abroad scheme because I might get cross and there are areas of frustration but Departments and State agencies generally respond well to recommendations.  This issue stands out in the sense of the length of time during which nothing has been done and that is why we highlighted it here.</p> <p>  Ms Cooney and I recently went to the National Rehabilitation Hospital to talk in the grand rounds about the Wasted Lives report.  I will get Ms Cooney to say a little about the response we got but it was reassuring.  Ms Cooney may also talk to the committee about some of the action that has been taken on Wasted Lives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.607" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarah Cooney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021121600002#G00200"><p>On the Wasted Lives report, as Mr. Tyndall said both the Department of Health and the HSE have accepted all of the recommendations in it.  On practical implementation, a steering group has been set up under the chief operations officer in the HSE, Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, which is a key example of how seriously it takes this issue.  The HSE has also got funding through the EU to develop the audit of services and people in the settings under 65 to set out their will and preference and to be able to develop and put in place the supports that are needed to allow them to move, if it is their will and preference, to a community setting.  We are waiting for the agreement of the national service plan, NSP, for 2022 to get an exact sense of how the pilot that was put in place and that helped to move 18 people out of such settings this year, will be scaled up next year.  Our hope is that it will be scaled up substantially in order to move this area on at the pace that is needed.  There is movement and we are happy to work with the HSE&rsquo;s steering group and the action plan it is developing to ensure it is monitored and to ensure that the recommendations are implemented as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  As Mr. Tyndall said, we were recently in the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  It was important for us to get a sense of the impact the report had for people working on the ground and to hear of some of the frustrations that those people would have.  The idea that this pilot might be scaled out and that there will be the supports put in place for people is important for people working in the field.</p></speech>

It was quite disappointing that 18 people were initially decongregated.  That was an incredibly low number given the incredibly high number of people who were inappropriately placed in those congregated settings.  I know from different people we were dealing with in my office that it was not just in old persons&rsquo; homes but that people were also placed into psychiatric wards, which could not be more inappropriate.  In many areas, particularly rural areas, there is an absence of any kind of independent supported living.  One of the things this committee requested when we started up in this D&aacute;il was that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage would come before the committee and explain to us how many houses there would be in any builds for providing independent supported living.  I have come to the conclusion that this must be considered in other policies.  How can the HSE address a lack of independent supported living if the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is not taking that into consideration from the outset when we are building houses?  How hopeful are the witnesses that this will be scaled up to the extent they are hoping for?  How can we get it from 18 up to over 1,500?</p></speech>

We would expect to see a substantial increase in the number of people being resettled next year.  If 18 was a pilot programme then a major increase is needed.  It will be past my time as Ombudsman but it is something that the office will be keeping a close eye on.  I am glad that colleagues were reassured by my successor.  I know he is determined to keep an eye on the recommendations that have been made, to make sure they are delivered upon and to highlight any failure to do so.  I do not doubt he will do that.  It is somewhat speculative at this stage.  The intention is there and the programme for Government includes a commitment to stop people going in and a commitment to resettle people.  The scale of that will become obvious when we see the NSP.</p></speech>

On the last point, the committee should write to the HSE and the Minister for Health in advance of the agreement of the NSP in order to put our weight behind the witnesses&rsquo; opinions, to ask for an urgent review of that and to ask that funding would be made available in the service plan.  We should do that as early as we possibly can with the team to get that into the system.</p> <p>  I wish Mr. Tyndall the best as he goes on to his next stage.  I thank him for the enormous contribution he has made in the Office of the Ombudsman and in previous roles.  In the last 12 months we have heard a pile of evidence from people, families and representative groups of people with disabilities advancing the cause of people with disabilities.  I will take the word &ldquo;grounding&rdquo; from Mr. Tyndall&rsquo;s report.  I reflected deeply on it and I reflect on it this morning as well.  There is almost a paralysis within Governments and within Departments when it comes to dealing with this issue as a glaring omission in terms of people with disabilities and them having access to mobility in any way, shape or form.  We could have 15 meetings with discussions on the primary medical certificates and the appeals board and the inadequacies in those, although I know they are not the subject of this morning&rsquo;s meeting.  I also mention the overall issue of people who are grounded because there is no proper system in place.  I thank Mr. Tyndall for his honesty on it and for singling out the inability of both Governments and Departments to deal with this as an issue that he and his office have been following for some time.  The committee needs to highlight that, be forceful behind the report, accept the report and demand answers from Departments and Government on what its plan is and on what is there to put an equitable, fair and easily accessible scheme in place for people with disabilities to ensure they have accessibility.  Our committee should accept the report.</p><p>Without mincing our words, we should write to the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Minister for Health to demand action on this.  Otherwise, we are going to be skirting around it.  It is very clear from the questions the frustration members have had over the years in trying to help.  Some mornings, we hear very moving evidence from people and families about their disabilities.  We are trying to bring a spotlight to the challenges that exist, but we are also trying to get results and movement, whether is on the optional protocol, access to funding or implementation.  This is one thing we need to single out and try to get a result on as quickly as possible, and that is what we should do from here.  If the witnesses have any comments, I would be happy to take them, but I believe that is what we should do as a committee.  I understand Mr. Tyndall had a technical issue but perhaps he wants to comment now.</p></speech>

Writing would also be helpful.  I would be inclined to suggest the committee may want to call people in front of it to speak about what they are doing.

We are anxious to get movement on this.  I wish Mr. Tyndall the very best in his onward journey.  I thank him for his contribution to the Office of the Ombudsman and in the various roles he has had.  No doubt, he will be an influencer in the various roles he has next because he has enormous capability and he has shown huge dedication to the job in hand up to now.  I wish him the best of luck.  I thank Ms Cooney for her contribution to the meeting.</p> <p>  As we draw to a close the 2021 season, I thank all members, both on and off the call this morning, for their contribution to the Committee on Disability Matters over the past 12 months.  The strength of the committee is only the sum of its parts.  All members have played an enormous role and have been extremely good at listening to very difficult evidence over the past while and in every way they can.  Deputy Tully spoke earlier of the Topical Issue matter she raised on the Indecon report, and other committee members do so in the Seanad or the D&aacute;il.  That was just the most recent example and I know other members have raised issues and have been advancing what we have been discussing here at the committee.  We will continue to do that in every forum we can because, collectively, I think we can make a change and, if it is just to the attitude alone, we can do that.  I thank the members for their courtesy and, overall, for the work ethic they have shown over the past 12 months.  We hope to start again in January 2022 and try to effect change for the people we are charged with representing.</p> <p>  I also thank our background team, in particular Mairead O&rsquo;Donovan, who heads the team, and all of the Oireachtas team who are with us.  They are excellent.  I know some days they are probably tearing their hair out when I have some other hare-brained idea we might try to do, but they are very good, they have come forward with an awful lot of stuff and they work extremely diligently.  It is great to have the team and the members.  I wish everyone a very nice Christmas and I offer every good wish for 2022.  Sl&aacute;n agus beannacht.</p></speech>

My script has been provided to the committee in advance.</p> <p>  Insurance reform is a priority for Government.  In the programme for Government there are 21 measures related to insurance reform.  The Action Plan for Insurance Reform, published in December 2020, is the Government&rsquo;s plan improve the insurance market and to bring down costs for consumers and business through 66 actions.  I am pleased to note substantial progress has been made in implementing the reform agenda.  New personal injuries guidelines have been introduced, the Government has made perjury a criminal offence, and we have created the Insurance Fraud Co-ordination Office within An Garda  S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the Department of Finance, I chair an office within government tasked with encouraging greater competition in the Irish insurance market.  The reforms are having a positive effect.  Motor insurance premiums dropped by 8% this year so far.  Early indications by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board&rsquo;s data showed an average reduction of 40% in personal injury awards covered by the new injury guidelines five months after their introduction.</p> <p>  The Government recognises the difficulty faced by some businesses with regard to the availability and cost of insurance.  This affects certain sectors of the economy, some of which are considered high-risk activities by some insurance companies.  Brexit may also have exacerbated supply issues for certain sectors in the economy which were covered by specialised insurance underwriters that previously passported into Ireland from the UK.  There are still important priority actions to be completed such as reform of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and the duty of care legislation.  As Minister of State with special responsibility for insurance, I continuing to support my colleagues on the Cabinet committee subgroup for insurance reform to get these key items over the line as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I would now like to provide a brief overview of the insurance (miscellaneous provisions) Bill and some important context for the main provisions set out in the general scheme, and then deal with any questions that members may have.</p><p>First and foremost, the Bill responds to an issue that came to light during the pandemic.  This relates to deductions of Covid-19-related State payments within some business interruption claims.  While such deductions may be lawful and in line with the principle of indemnity, Government was concerned that such behaviour could be seen as insurers in some way pocketing taxpayers' money.  The Department of Finance examined this issue closely and conducted a detailed scoping exercise of how insurers more generally treat State supports.  This revealed that in most other instances, this issue does not arise because measures already exist whereby State supports are either not provided if losses are already covered by insurance or are refunded to the State, such as in the case of personal injury claims within the Department of Social Protection recovery of benefits and assistance scheme, commonly known as the RBA scheme.  Notwithstanding this, it is important to have much greater oversight of State supports deducted from insurance claims settlements in order to identify any instances, now or in the future, where this might become an issue, especially in the case of any new State supports.  Accordingly, the Bill enables the Central Bank to collect and publish data about such deductions by insurers through the National Claims Information Database.  Members will know that this database is an important tool in holding insurers to account.  It can also be used to provide increased information on this issue and to enhance policymakers' understanding of this matter in order to facilitate targeted, evidence-based measures, if needed in the future.<br/><br/>It was also clear that the deduction of State supports from pandemic-related claims was causing confusion and uncertainty for consumers, especially small businesses.  We are, therefore, seeking to close this gap in head 8 of the general scheme by requiring insurers to inform consumers if they have reduced the level of an insurance pay-out due to any State supports received by the claimant.  These are appropriate and proportionate measures to deal with this issue, which will avoid unintended consequences and will not pre-empt any legal ruling on this matter which is currently before the courts.<br/><br/>Second, the Bill supplements the Government&rsquo;s intention to tackle the loyalty penalty by examining the Central Bank&rsquo;s review and taking any action deemed necessary in light of its findings.  There are currently 2.2 million private motor insurance and 1.3 million home insurance policyholders in the country.  The Central Bank review found those who stayed with the same insurer for nine years or more pay, on average, 14% more on private car insurance and 32% more on home insurance than the equivalent customer renewing for the first time.  As the committee will be aware, the bank's report concluded that price-walking, a form of differential pricing, is causing unfair outcomes for some consumers who remain with the same insurance provider over several years.  The bank has, therefore, proposed to ban this practice for personal home and motor insurance customers from mid-2022.  This targeted and significant measure will eliminate the practice, but allow insurance companies to continue to offer promotions and discounts for new customers.  This is a positive outcome for the consumer.  As Deputies and Senators are aware, this was a commitment in the programme for Government and we have always insisted that the bank be given sufficient time to allow it to complete its work. Committee members will be aware that I have offered the bank any assistance it may need in legislating for its proposals, through this Bill.  The bank has confirmed that it can introduce measures for this through its existing powers.  That said, the Government is keen to ensure that any measures taken are effective and, therefore, the Bill will require the bank to report to the Minister for Finance six months after the first anniversary of its commencement about the impact of any action it takes.  I will also write to the bank asking it to provide interim data on progress to the Department at the earliest date.  This will allow us to identify, in a timely manner, whether more needs to be done and ensure that Government can then move swiftly so that consumers are properly protected.<br/><br/><b></b>Third, the Bill will resolve certain technical issues that have been identified in the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019.  Post-enactment, two technical drafting issues were brought to the Department's attention, which this Bill seeks to address.  First, there is an amendment to clarify that legal privilege is protected in the disclosure of information requirements.  Second, head 9 contains an amendment to section 18, which addresses exclusions for property damage in certain circumstances and the agreement of this amendment will allow for this final subsection of the Act to be commenced.  This is the only Part not yet commenced.<br/><br/>Finally, the Bill will make important technical amendments to the legislation underpinning the temporary run-off regime, TRR, for UK and Gibraltar-based insurers.  Members will recall that the TRR was established to enable insurers and intermediaries to continue servicing their existing contracts in the State after the UK's departure from the EU.  This was an important consumer protection mechanism to ensure that Irish policyholders would continue to receive protection.  The Central Bank has identified a number of technical issues regarding some firms that are seeking to run-off their existing business within this framework but, legally, are not allowed to do so because they also provide reinsurance business or are in liquidation.  It has been brought to my attention that this has the potential to impact negatively their policyholders here in Ireland.  I agree with the bank that these are vital amendments in order to ensure that Irish policyholders continue to have their policies fully serviced and do not suffer any unintended disruption.  Part 5 of the Bill aims to address these issues so that these firms can complete their application to run-off their existing business within the TRR.<br/><br/>I hope that this overview of the general scheme has offered some useful context which will assist the committee.  I am hopeful that the Government would be in a position to publish the Bill early in the New Year.  This will, of course, depend on the work of this committee in scrutinising the Bill.  Insurance reform remains a priority issue for everybody in the country.  Therefore, I believe it is vital that this Bill be advanced promptly.  I thank the committee for its attention.  I would welcome any questions about the detail and nature of the provisions of the Bill, but I would sincerely hope the committee will conclude this pre-legislative scrutiny process today so that we can publish the legislation to help all consumers in Ireland as early as possible in the New Year.</p></speech>

I share his objective in that I am hopeful that the committee can complete pre-legislative scrutiny of this important legislation today and that we can get the legislation onto the floor of both Houses of the Oireachtas early in the New Year.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions in regard to heads 3 and 8.  As outlined by the Minister of State in his opening comments, both of these heads deal with deduction of State supports by insurers.  For the benefit of people listening to this debate, it might be beneficial if I gave an overview of how this operates in an insurance context.  The Minister of State will be aware that very many businesses have what is known as "business interruption cover".  They pay a premium to insurance companies to ensure that if their business is interrupted in accordance with one of the provisions of the policy they will be covered for the losses they have sustained.  This has become particularly relevant in the past 19 months because of the Covid-19 pandemic, as a result of which very many businesses have been closed and there have been consequential claims on business interruption policies.  There are disputes as to whether or not a business interruption policy arises and that is not something I am going to ask the Minister of State about. </p> <p>  However, let us take a standard example.  Where a business closes as a result of an interruption to its business, in respect of which its insurance policy covers it up to a figure of &euro;100,000, then if it is the case that that business has lost profits of up to &euro;100,000 the insurance company should, under that policy, cover the business for that &euro;100,000.  However, the State may have provided generous supports to that business through the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, or the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, to the value of &euro;25,000.  In that context, the insurance company is saying that the business's loss is &euro;75,000 and not &euro;100,000.  I would state that the loss is &euro;100,000 and the fact the State has paid the business &euro;25,000 should not bail out the insurance company.  That is the background to it.</p> <p>  I note that in head 3, it is proposed that data in respect of any such deductions that are taken into account by insurance companies will be made available to the Central Bank.</p><p>Under head 8, the Minister of State says it will be a requirement for the insurance company to inform the business of how much the State reduction has been relied upon by the insurer.</p><p> I agree with both of those and commend the Minister of State.  Why do we not go one further, as we do in respect of recovery of benefits and assistance in the Department of Social Protection and personal injuries claims?  Why is the State not trying to ensure that moneys the State pays to the business cannot be taken into account by insurance companies?  The insurance companies should pay the full amount and the &euro;25,000, in my example, should be paid back to the State by the business.  I apologise for the elongated question but it is an important point and people may wonder why we are not going that extra step. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.628" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021121600002#C00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  That is a perfect question and the exact question I raised when this issue came to light.  What the Deputy has just said explains the current situation concisely and accurately.  In practice, where a business had a loss of the order of &euro;100,000, to use the example the Deputy gave, and there is State support through TWSS, CRSS or rates not being levied on that business for the period, there may only be a net loss of &euro;75,000.  The insurance company policies in many cases only require them to cover the net loss, rather than the gross loss.</p> <p>  When I came into this office last year, I spotted there was an issue here.  I was conscious of the measures the Deputy mentioned in the Department of Social Protection that apply when somebody has a car accident, ends up being awarded the equivalent of &euro;100,000 as a result of his or her injuries and, during the two-year period that is going through, receives State support through disability or other payments of the order of &euro;20,000.  In that situation, the insurance pays the net loss of &euro;80,000 to the person and pays the &euro;20,000 directly to the State.  That works solely in that situation because there is legislation in place to deal with it prior to the event occurring.  We have a scheme in place there but there is no such scheme available to cover this type of issue.  Those recoupment measures were not envisaged for business interruption policies before Covid came along.  Nobody envisaged that the State would support business interruption losses in the normal course of events but Covid changed that.</p> <p>  We would have liked if it was possible to backdate the effect of this so that we could get the benefits of the State supports refunded to us by the insurance companies.  Unfortunately, the policies may have been issued a year or two in advance.  That was a legally binding contract.  There was no legal requirement as part of the schemes where the State made the payments to have a recoupment measure in place.  We could not have made the legislation retrospective. </p> <p>  This is a lesson from Covid for the State.  We are learning the lesson and want to implement it as early as possible.  We will gather information on this for any future scheme.  It could be any issue in the construction or agriculture industries or the environment or health areas.  We will gather the information to know the extent of the issue and to build this recoupment measure into future legislation and schemes.  However, it does not exist at the moment and we cannot make it retrospective.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right that, effectively, the taxpayer has subsidised parts of the insurance industry, which have not had to pay out the full gross loss and are using the State subsidy.  We need to correct that.  Many companies had themselves covered so that did not arise but one or two companies were in a position to use that situation.  In head 3, we are gathering the information we do not have to be able to use it in future and lead to greater transparency.  It will be published by the Central Bank as part of its regular reports.  We will have that.</p> <p>  The second element of head 8 is that insurance companies will notify customers of the amount of deductions.  We are introducing this as a new requirement immediately once the legislation commences.  I have seen cases, for example, where there was a loss of &euro;100,000 and the insurance company specified in the cheque they sent out that certain losses were made good by the State under various schemes and they listed those.  In other situations, as happens in some personal injury cases, there is an all-in figure agreed of &euro;100,000 as an overall settlement without breaking down the components of how that figure was arrived at.  This legislation will ensure that information is separately shown and identified so the Central Bank can report to us and the customer will be aware in the beginning.  </p> <p>  This is a lesson from Covid that we are learning for the future but, unfortunately, it cannot be backdated.  I hope I am answering the question as best I can.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting that the legislation should apply retrospectively but consideration should be given to introducing legislation that will apply prospectively.  All we are doing in the legislation is requiring the data to be collected by the Central Bank and for the consumer to be informed of the deduction.  The Minister of State could introduce a scheme similar to the RBA scheme that operates in respect of social welfare payments made by the State.  Insurers have to pay for those payments under that scheme.  EWSS is, at present, going on until the end of March.  Who knows but that business interruption claims this time next year may seek to recoup money in respect of State payments made throughout the coming year?  Consideration should be given to putting in place a scheme that will operate prospectively.  At present we get the data but we are still, to use the Minister of State's words, in a situation where insurers can be seen as pocketing taxpayers' money.  That is not something that I or the Minister of State wants to see.</p></speech>

That mechanism can work in the future immediately, prospectively and in relation to any new scheme introduced across any Department, like in social protection.  That measure should be included in the scheme being brought forward through legislation.  If there was a new scheme introduced in an environment, agriculture or construction area, we in the Department of Finance would insist that there be a requirement in the detail of each new scheme to cover this area, like we have with social protection.  It has to be done through legislation, through the Department that is paying out the money, that we have this mechanism in place.  This can be done for new schemes in the future.</p></speech>

Head 7 is an interesting provision.  It deletes section 16(10) of the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019 and puts in a new section, section 16A.  Under it, there is a requirement on the insurer and consumer to disclose any document to the other side after a claim is made.  That could be of benefit or of disadvantage to that claim.  A similar provision was included in section 16(10) but it has been changed here to ensure the document must be disclosed by either side within 60 days of its receipt.  Is the Government trying to ensure under that provision that reports such as private investigators' reports will be disclosed promptly or what type of documents is it considering?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.632" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021121600002#C00600"><p>We are deleting the section in the existing Act and bringing in a new section to give legal privilege to certain documents.  We were concerned that, the way the 2019 legislation was drafted, any new information would be required to be shared.  That might have compromised the important principle of legal privilege so we are bringing forward measures to ensure such documents have to be shared providing they do not breach legal privilege.  Documents which have legal privilege will not have to be shared but those that do not require legal privilege can be shared.  The existing regime was unclear on that and that is why there was a situation where no documents could possibly have been shared because of the legal privilege issue.  We are separating documents that require privilege from those that do not.</p></speech>

Previously insurers or the insured would only disclose documents that they intended to rely on in court proceedings but here there is a requirement to disclose documents even if they are not going to rely on them and, more important, if they are of disadvantage to the claim they are making.</p></speech>

We have seen a lot of each other over the recent weeks and months.  I hope everyone has a good one.</p> <p>  I want to raise the issue of price walking.  On 21 October on "The Claire Byrne Show" on RT&Eacute; Radio 1, the Minister of State repeatedly said that this legislation would ban price walking.  However, that was not the case.  On 16 November on "Morning Ireland" on RT&Eacute; Radio 1, the Minister of State said that he was introducing legislation to eliminate the loyalty penalty in motor and home insurance and said again "we are going to eliminate it entirely".  He was referring to this legislation.  However, that was not true either.  Head 4 of the general scheme relates to dual pricing or price walking.  It will require the Central Bank to hand a report to the Minister.  It will not ban the loyalty penalty.  Am I correct?  The Central Bank has the regulatory powers to end the loyalty penalty.  This is what it is doing.  Its representatives confirmed that to the committee last week.  However the legislation itself will not end the loyalty penalty.  It will produce a report.  I am trying to understand why the Minister of State has gone to such great lengths to say that the legislation will ban dual pricing, as he has said publicly on national radio, when all the Bill will do is put a report on his desk.  Does he accept that he has made a number of misleading statements on the legislation and the loyalty penalty?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.635" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021121600002#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for her good wishes for Christmas.  I utterly reject that I have misled anyone except those who chose to misinterpret what I said.  The situation is very clear.  In the programme for Government we said that we would deal with dual pricing.  It is in the programme for Government and the national plan for insurance and we are following through on that.  It is important that the committee get a quick pen picture on this.  It is why we have a whole-of-government approach to dealing with insurance reform.  It is not just the Department of Finance, because it is an industry regulated by the Central Bank, but also the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Justice and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Much of what is happening in the action plan is not being done by the Department of Finance specifically.  My job, as I see it, is to make sure that everybody else plays their part in the area.  We can talk about a duty of care.  It is nothing to do with the Department of Finance.  It is part of the overall measures being taken.</p> <p>  We are doing exactly what we did with the judicial guidelines.  The judges were dealing with their issue and we just imposed a timetable in the legislation along which they would have to produce a report which they did.  That ensured that the job was done.  We had a legislative insurance policy in place to ensure that the work that could be done was done according to a specified timeline.  We are doing exactly the same here.  We are giving a timeline for the production of a report.  A report can only be produced if the Central Bank has taken these measures.  A fair question would be around the Central Bank having had the powers to do this all along.  It does not require any new powers.  It is a valid question.  The report highlights motor and house insurance policyholders who are suffering a loyalty penalty for being with a company beyond nine years.  The question is why was this not dealt with long before now given that the powers to deal with it did exist?  Our only role is to assert that yes, the powers are there and the Central Bank is going to do it and we will ensure that a report must be produced.  It is about ensuring that the job will actually be done.  That is the principal thing that we are doing.  We are ensuring that all the agencies involved in the area step up and do what is in their powers.  Sometimes they need new powers.  We just want to ensure that it will done.  The job will be done by the Central Bank using existing powers.  The legislation ensures that there is a timeframe and a deadline to ensure that it is done. </p></speech>

I have the direct quote from "Morning Ireland", where to me, it is clear to me that he was saying that this legislation would deal with it.  It is good that he has clarified that it is not and that the Central Bank will do so and that a report will be done.  This is something that my colleague, Deputy Doherty, has raised consistently.  He even made a complaint in 2019 on this, which played a significant role in this.</p> <p>  As this meeting is only scheduled for an hour, I will move on to another issue.  The personal injury guidelines came into effect on 24 April with a view to significantly reducing the cost of claims.  The latest information from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, shows that since it came into effect, the average value of personal injury awards has fallen by 40%.  As soon as the guidelines came into effect the insurance industry warned that premiums would not fall immediately.  Consumer surveys conducted by Sinn F&eacute;in and the Alliance for Insurance Reform found that these reductions are not being passed on to policyholders in the form of lower premiums.  Deputy Doherty introduced the Judicial Council (Amendment) Bill in April, which has been delayed by this Government for nine months.  The legislation would have required insurers to inform the Central Bank of whether a reduction in claims costs as a consequence of the person injury guidelines have been passed on to consumers and if so by how much.  The Government justified its opposition to the legislation saying that the national claims information database, NCID, would provide this information.  However, yesterday, several insurers were before the committee and when I asked about this they replied that the NCID could not provide this information.  The Central Bank said the same last week.  Will the Minister of State accept that the Bill is a good tool to apply pressure on insurers to ensure that cost reductions arising from the guidelines are passed on euro for euro to consumers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.637" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021121600002#D00400"><p>That will certainly happen.  People get confused in this debate.  Some talk about differential pricing and others about dual pricing, which is a subset of that, price walking while others refer to loyalty bonuses or loyalty penalties.  They are all quite different.  I can understand that sometimes people use these terms interchangeably.  We gave a commitment in the programme for Government and the action plan on insurance that we would deal with the dual pricing issue, which is the most egregious aspect of this.  We did not want to do it in such a way as would have a negative impact on young drivers in particular who might not be able to get discounts as easily as they can up to now.  That could happen under the kind of strict regime that the Deputy and her colleagues have suggested.  We felt it would prevent new businesses from coming into the Irish market and offering reduced rates below the insurance base cost rate to build up market share and increase competition.  We want to avoid all those negative impacts from things suggested by others and stick to the good bit in the legislation, namely eliminating the loyalty penalty.  That is precisely what we are doing.</p> <p>  At the committee earlier this week, two companies said they had reduced prices by 10% this year and a third company said it had reduced prices by 5%.  Those reductions are a result of the improved insurance environment that is the result of the Government's action plan.  We made it clear that this was one key element.  Legal costs will come into it and another factor will be increasing competition.  To separate out one aspect of all the measures that will lead to cost reductions will leave out lots of other issues that will lead to cost reduction such as legal costs.  For example, increased competition can lead to reductions that would not be captured.  The instability around the costs of claims was one reason new insurance companies did not want to come to Ireland.  They wanted stability and predictability and that is what they will get through the personal injury guidelines when they are fully implemented.  Some companies have said that the price reductions they are giving this year is in anticipation of what PIAB will do.  That is 40% based on the preliminary figures.  Many people are not happy that they are not getting the same types of awards as they would have received last year and are challenging them in the courts.  </p> <p>  The good news is that when the awards are confirmed by the courts there will be further reductions in addition to the 10% that some of the companies have already applied next year.</p><p>I am aware that there are two more speakers but only 20 minutes left so I will leave it at that for now.  </p></speech>

It is a complex and diverse sector that needs a huge amount of reform.  Such reform will eventually pay dividends for everyone.  My colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, raised the issue of Covid payments.  I want to focus on that issue too.  The way in which the insurance industry behaved towards businesses was absolutely disgraceful and there is no doubt about that.  First they said that they did not cover business interruption in the context of a pandemic and businesses had to drag them through the courts before they agreed that they did have to cover business interruption.  As businesses progressed their claims, the next clanger was that insurers would deduct any Government supports given to businesses during that period.  I know of some businesses that are now being challenged with a claim that once they reopened their doors, despite the business being interrupted by Covid, they were no longer covered for business interruption.  The insurers are no longer accepting that period within the claim.  It seems to be all about insurance and the insurance industry.</p> <p>  As my party colleague mentioned, collecting data is fine but not being able to go after these companies into the future is a concern.  I would like to point out that no business will ever get insurance again for business interruption in the context of a global pandemic.  I wish those businesses trying to include such cover in their policies the best of luck in terms of the price they will pay.  My follow-on concern is whether the insurance industry will reflect the Government's support for businesses in the premiums they will be asking them to pay.  At the moment, insurance companies are calculating premiums on the basis of a full payment and not on a payment minus any Government support.  We are now almost two years into this pandemic.  Some businesses had cover for two years, some for one year and others for 18 months.  They are now coming out of the cover period and are facing huge premiums but those premiums are based on a 100% claim of exposure by insurance companies even though the State has covered a significant portion of the loss.  Another problem with insurance companies is that it takes so long to progress claims and businesses are paying premiums based on claims that have not been finally settled.  That is a concern going forward.  I appreciate that under head 8 some form of transparency in terms of what is happening will be available to businesses.  The level of transparency between insurers and clients is not up to standard.  </p> <p>  Again, I thank the Minister of State for taking on the challenge of reforming the insurance industry.  Insurance is a noose around the neck of businesses at the moment.  It is strangling them in terms of remaining operational.</p></speech>

We all hope that it will lead to a much better environment.  Insurance has been such a big issue in this country for a number of years.  That is why it features so prominently in the programme for Government and why a Cabinet sub-group across a number of Departments is dealing with it.</p> <p>  On the issue of Covid, the Central Bank's Covid-19 business interruption supervisory framework sets out the bank's expectations of insurance companies in their handling of Covid-related business interruption claims.  The bank has insisted that customers have an entitlement to claim under such a policy and it is the bank's expectation that such claims would be processed and paid promptly and in full.  The bank has stated that a number of insurers accepted and settled claims as a result of its supervisory interventions.  We are relying on the regulator to do the work about which we have just been speaking.  I welcome recent data indicating that to date more than &euro;130 million has been paid to 4,371 policy holders through both settled claims and interim payments.  Obviously, there is more to follow and the Central Bank has indicated that its examination team is continuing to actively monitor compliance with the guidelines that it, as regulator, has issued.  Claims have been paid, but I accept that there are issues with some companies which did pocket some taxpayer funds because legislation was not in place in advance to capture all that.  The Central Bank is actively following this up and it is important to put on record that &euro;130 million has been paid out under business interruption clauses to date.</p> <p>  A number of cases are currently before the courts which I will not get into now.  It should be noted that a number of insurance firms have made very significant settlements.</p></speech>

We will now discuss the general scheme of the Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill with representatives of the Alliance for Insurance Reform.  I welcome to the meeting Mr. Peter Boland and Ms Tracy Sheridan, directors of the Alliance for Insurance Reform.  I understand Mr. Boland intends to go first.  The normal procedure is for our guests to make a brief opening statement, followed by questions and answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.645" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Boland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021121600002#F00200"><p>I thank the Chair and the members for inviting us here today.  We very much appreciate the invitation.</p> <p>  When the Alliance for Insurance Reform first presented to this committee in May 2018, it consisted of 21 representative organisations highlighting the negative impact of persistently high premiums and calling for real reforms that will quickly reduce liability and motor insurance premiums to affordable levels and keep them that way.  A measure of the scale and scope of the crisis facing us on insurance is that the alliance now consists of 46 civic and business organisations from across Ireland, representing over 55,000 members, 700,000 employees, 622,000 volunteers and 374,000 students, as outlined in appendix 1 to the presentation that committee members have in front of them.</p><p> Since we last presented to the committee, in April 2019, the insurance crisis for our members has worsened considerably, albeit in a way that has been masked by the impact of the pandemic.  In particular, liability insurance premiums continue to increase, despite recent reforms and a collapse in economic and social activity, neither of which are being reflected in renewals.  Increasing numbers of sectors and sub-sectors cannot get cover or are reduced to one underwriter, which inevitably results in large increases in premiums.  A current list of 44 such sectors and sub-sectors is included in appendix 2.</p><p> The crisis is existential in many of these sectors.  On this point, I strongly contest the characterisation the Minister of State made in his presentation of some of these sectors as being high risk.  Some of them may be characterised by the insurance industry as high risk but, inevitably, when that is examined, they are not truly high risk.  They manage their risk exceptionally well.  In fact, they are subject to a high level of claims, which is completely different, and to necessary ongoing reform.  To characterise them as high risk runs the risk of having them dismissed as in some way uninsurable.  If that kind of characterisation is applied to areas such as childcare, home care, nursing homes, the night-time economy or road haulage, it will be a very depressing day for the economy and society.  That is just a brief tangent from my presentation.</p><p> Following some positive progress on issues such as judicial guidelines, the establishment of the Garda insurance fraud co-ordination office, IFCO, and the commencement of the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021, there is increasing alarm among our members regarding the slow pace of other key reforms, such as rebalancing the duty of care, reforming PIAB and the establishment of a State-controlled claims database.  Furthermore, resistance to meaningful reforms is increasing, with a large number of legal challenges to the new judicial guidelines lined up.  Ultimately, it is clear neither the economy nor the fabric of society will fully recover from Covid-19 unless insurance is sorted out.</p><p> With regard to the Bill, while we welcome the emphasis on greater transparency, more robust enforcement of elements of the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019 and more clarity regarding the temporary run-off regime necessitated by Brexit, the Bill will merely tweak existing arrangements, and we do not believe any of the measures included will increase the availability, or bring down the cost, of insurance.  As for what will, the answer is competition.  While it will not be at a level that will bring us in line with England and Wales, never mind other European jurisdictions, the judicial guidelines that were implemented on 24 April are expected to deliver significant reductions in premiums.  That process has begun in the motor insurance sector, as the Minister of State mentioned, where there is meaningful competition, with respondents to our ongoing policyholder survey reporting a 10% reduction on average in motor premiums on renewals since 24 April, a percentage that tallies with the CSO data he cited.</p><p> In the liability sector, however, where there is markedly less, and often no, competition, policyholders are experiencing average increases of 16%.  It is clear to members of the alliance that additional underwriting capacity and competition are urgently needed in the liability insurance market.  While the Cabinet committee sub-group on insurance reform has acknowledged this by establishing the office for insurance competition in December 2020, the work of this office has not yet had any impact on the affected sectors.  That office has a positive story to tell the international insurance markets in terms of the judicial guidelines, the Garda IFCO and the perjury Act, but these gains must not be undermined by incumbent insurers settling above the new judicial guidelines.  The State must not allow the reform process to be derailed by the multiple legal challenges to the judicial guidelines launched by that sector.  With this in mind, the latest statistics I am hearing from members suggest a logjam of claims is beginning to appear in litigation because some feuds are being settled in anticipation of some clarity from the court challenges.  We urgently need to resolve those challenges, but we fear the public interest is being undermined by a rush to protect legal fees in the personal injury area.  The challenges, in our view, are clearly motivated by greed on the part of the legal profession and not by any genuine concern for plaintiffs' interests.  This has been backed up by multiple NCID reports.</p><p> The sales pitch to attract additional insurers to the Irish liability market must also include the rebalancing of the duty of care, reform of PIAB and the establishment of a State-controlled fraud database freely accessible to all insurers.  The attractiveness of the Irish market to insurers must be protected and further developed through holding firm on the new judicial guidelines in settling claims, by protecting the guidelines from multiple legal challenges and by pursuing other key reforms, one of which relates to the duty of care.  In essence, when injuries or alleged injuries occur on a premises, occupiers such as SMEs, charities, sports organisations or event organisers are now regularly assumed to have an absolute duty of care when it comes to visitors such as customers, clients or others, whereas the concept of personal responsibility has been significantly diminished in the courts and in the interpretations of insurers in recent years.</p><p> The Cabinet committee subgroup on insurance reform published its most recent implementation report in July 2021.  In it, the subgroup reported that the Department of Justice was working on a general scheme to give effect to the proposals on the duty of care and expected to bring these to the Government in September 2021 for approval.  However, the general scheme has not yet been published and no revised timeline for its publication has been given, other than a worrying reassurance from some Ministers that the proposals are at an advanced stage.  My colleague, Ms Sheridan, will gladly share her specific experiences with the committee in respect of the duty of care.  The duty of care must be urgently rebalanced in a manner that is fair, reasonable, practical, proportionate and in the public interest. </p><p> Turning to PIAB, which is overlooked by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the alliance believes the board is a sound concept rooted in the common good that has been fundamentally undermined by numerous and ongoing challenges by the legal profession.  As such, we welcomed the public consultation on enhancing and reforming the board carried out in April of this year by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and we believe radical reform is necessary to give PIAB the meaningful status it deserves.  The Cabinet committee subgroup on insurance reform, in its July report, stated it was intended to publish in July a general scheme of a Bill to reform PIAB, but we have still not seen that general scheme.  Radical reform of PIAB must be pursued as a matter of urgency.</p><p> In conclusion, the Government acknowledged the seriousness of the insurance crisis in establishing the Cabinet committee subgroup for insurance reform in September 2020, chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and including many of the key Ministers and Ministers of State involved in this issue.  After some initial progress on issues such as the judicial guidelines, the subgroup appears to have regressed to a box-ticking exercise, recently focusing on the number of actions that have been carried out among the 66 that were initially targeted, when what is needed is an intense focus on key reforms relating to the duty of care, PIAB and the claims database.  Regrettably, the Bill being scrutinised today will not provide those key reforms.</p><p>If we continue to lose momentum on the key issues, we fear the war against unsustainable insurance costs will be lost.</p><p> This concludes our formal presentation.  As an alliance, we are intensely aware of how urgent this issue is for our members and their employees and volunteers.  We hope the committee will help us in getting meaningful action on this.  We are now happy to take questions.</p></speech>

We were very hopeful when the Cabinet subgroup on insurance reform was established.  As I said, it has most of the relevant Ministers and Ministers of State on it.  We were quite positive about it at the time.  We welcomed the list of actions in its action plan, with a certain number of caveats.  We have experience of its predecessor - the cost of insurance working group - which was an intensely frustrating box-ticking exercise that regressed into administrative changes rather than genuine reform.  The early moves, which already had some momentum before the establishment of the subgroup, have been very positive.  The judicial guidelines, in particular, those implemented by the Judicial Council in April this year, are a big step subject to all the challenges thrown against it at present.  The big concern is that, since then, the momentum seems to have dissipated.  We have outlined the two most important by far of these issues.  There were deadlines in place, which we welcomed, and both those deadlines have been missed.  We are very concerned at this stage about whether we are making any real progress.<br/><br/>To be honest, this is not an <i>&agrave; la carte</i>process.  The progress we have made to date will have some impact, but unless the reforms in the round are implemented, we will be looking at this issue in another ten years and another ten years beyond that.  There have been several half-hearted attempts to reform the insurance market in previous decades.  If this is done right, it has a chance to get it right and get it off the agenda.  We are laughed at when we talk to our European colleagues and we tell them that insurance is an existential issue in the country.  For most of them, it is like suggesting the electricity bill will put them out of business.  It is unprecedented and it will continue to be unprecedented unless we get it all right.  Right now, we are concerned that we are not.  I will ask my colleague, Ms Sheridan, to give her insight into that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.651" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tracy Sheridan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021121600002#H00500"><p>Clearly, from a business owner's point of view, the two areas that are a big concern and about which change is not happening quickly enough are duty of care and PIAB.  On duty of care, I would like to give an example of an incident that happened recently in our play centre.  It demonstrates very clearly the difficulty businesses have with duty of care.  A couple came into the play centre with their four-year-old son.  The parents went to get a coffee and the child went off to play.  A while later, the parents called the manager over and said that their son had injured himself and that he may have broken his arm.  They said they would head straight to Tallaght hospital and that they would let us know how they get on.<br/><br/>We got an email the next day that stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The x-ray confirms the arm is fractured.  Suffice it to say at the very least he will be spending Christmas in a full arm cast.  How could this happen?  Did I put my child in danger by bringing him to your facility, which we love by the way, or is there something wrong that would allow this to happen?  Is that slide really age appropriate to a four-year-old?  I mean you expect your kids to be safe when you go to play centres.  So I really don't understand what happened.  The large frame says it is for three- to ten-year-olds so he should have been safe to use the facilities. </blockquote> <p>I picked up the phone and I spoke to the dad and I explained that our frame was custom built, it is health and safety approved for children over three years old, it is annually inspected by an external inspector, and we inspect the entire frame every morning before opening, so there is no fault in the frame or the slide.  I had a cursory look over the CCTV and all I could see was that lots of children had used that slide without injury or incident that day or any other day.  That slide has been in place for a couple of years.  Hundreds of children have used it thousands of times.  The dad seemed happy enough with this.<br/><br/>A week later, we received another email which states:</p> <blockquote> 	The hospital today confirmed that the haematoma at his elbow was not in fact hiding a fracture and thus they were able to remove the cast.  So other than being stiff from being immobilised, he is fine.  We are delighted, as I am sure you are, that there are no long-term impacts for him.  I do think you should strongly consider doing something about the black slide.  The experts that are certifying your slide as safe are simply wrong.  How do I know this?  Well, because my son went down your slide and ended up in hospital.  I think some modification is appropriate to improve visibility and safety.  Granted, the kids won't like me for suggesting that you remove the thrill factor but safety has to come first. </blockquote> <p>I rang again and said that we would look into it and I offered him some passes, but they came back and said:</p> <blockquote> 	I don't think we would be willing to take a chance to go back.  I have no way to stop the kids from using that particular slide and I would not be comfortable with them using it for obvious reasons.  I do think it is a great amenity to have in the area and I hope it does not take more kids getting injured before it becomes pertinent enough to take action. </blockquote> <p>We are starting to reap what we have sowed.  Any incident or injury is now considered by the public to be proof of either something being unsafe or someone being negligent.  There is no such thing as an accident anymore.  We have to report the likes of that to our insurance company that will not doubt put a reserve in place.  We will pay for that ultimately in our renewal.  More important, these people could make a claim up to the point at which that child turns 18 years old plus two years, so it is a guillotine hanging over our heads all the time.  Most important, that could be the claim that closes us.  It is that simple.  The point I want to get across is that this is not something that is getting better.  Incidents like this that are clearly potential claims by the language being used are happening more and more often.  This is something that is not getting slowly better but is rapidly getting worse.  Something has to be done on duty of care immediately.<br/><br/>Another area I have great concern about is insurance settlement strategy.  We had an incident a couple of years ago where a lady came up to reception with a piece of glass in her hand.  She said that it went into her foot out of our ball pool.  We were shocked and said we would do an incident report immediately.  While the manager was doing the incident report, another customer called me over and said that they saw that person take that glass out of their pocket.  Regardless, we reported it to our insurance company and heard no more.  When I rang to get our renewal, my insurance company said it was perfectly entitled to refuse me insurance because I did not report a claim.  I said that we did not have any claims.  The company said that there was a payout of &euro;12,000 to a person who got glass in their foot.  That claim managed to bypass us entirely.  It does not take a genius to figure out who our insurer is; we only have the one.  The solicitor went around us and directly to the insurance company, which proceeded to settle it without giving us any opportunity to defend a claim on our policy.  I felt we were just a means to an end where everyone got paid and our renewal went up.<br/><br/>It cannot be like that because what will happen is that the whole system will be unworkable for policyholders.  It is a constant fear.  It is a weekly fear.  Every incident you are imagining what might happen.  Most important, one by one we are closing.  Play centres are closing, cr&egrave;ches are closing, and preschools are closing: one, because of the stress, two, because of the cost, and three, because we are being told we are high risk.  We are not high risk.  We are a soft touch for claims and the reason for this is because of how duty of care is being applied.  That ultimately needs to change and the insurance companies need to get on our side and not use us for fees harvesting or claims harvesting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.652" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021121600002#H00600"><p>That was really powerful.  I thank Ms Sheridan for that.  When people work in different sectors, it is very good to hear the real-life experience of the stress and concern they naturally feel.  It is a very powerful tool to be able to give those examples.  I thank her for sharing that.</p><p>It was powerful.  I have a question about the personal injury guidelines.  We were discussing it with the Minister earlier and with insurance firms yesterday.  It was about a reduction in claims costs arising from personal injury guidelines and those being passed on to customers in the form of lower premiums.  Will the witnesses give their views on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.654" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Boland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021121600002#J00200"><p>The logic is that insurance premiums are calculated on the basis of future risk.  From 24 April, the future risk applicable to every policy in the country was reduced because the judicial guidelines were implemented.  The first port of call for the majority of claims is PIAB.  Where PIAB has managed to settle claims, it has usually settled using the new guidelines.  That further reinforces the argument that all premiums, whether motor or liability, should have been coming down from 24 April.  A couple of caveats must be applied.  The vast majority of claims are not assessed by PIAB; they go on to litigation.  The vast majority of claims are not settled by the courts either, but in the grey area in between, where private deals are done between insurers and the plaintiff's solicitors.  They account for over 80% of all settlements, by value, in the country every year.  Those are the key matters.</p> <p>  Ms Sheridan outlined a powerful example of what we as policyholders have found over the years, where it came as something of a surprise to her.  It is that insurers will settle as a financial expedient and cost it as part of the policy.  If it looks as if it will cost them to pursue a claim that is fraudulent, exaggerated, or just a try-on, then they will typically not do so.  They will settle it, close the file and move on, and the policyholder pays.  It is essential, if these guidelines are going to have any credibility, that the insurers hold firm on them.  We are hoping, in the report that the Department of Justice is scheduled to publish this month, which summarises the early impact of the guidelines, that there will be data from the insurance industry.  That is where the action is right now; it is not at PIAB, regrettably, because that is where the action should be.</p> <p>  The second caveat that has to be applied to the judicial guidelines is the lawyers queueing up to challenge the guidelines, the Judicial Council, and PIAB.  We are only at the case management element of that.  The Government, Judicial Council and the courts need to do everything in their power to speed up that process, select the test cases and get them heard as a matter of urgency.  We are seeing a long queue developing of cases where the settlement has already been offered by PIAB.  We know from Central Bank data that that is typically as much as the plaintiff is going to get.  Lawyers are determined to take them into litigation because it is only when it gets to litigation that they are paid big money.  That is precisely why they are holding all these up now and waiting for the courts to see what happens with the guidelines.  It is a matter of extreme urgency.  Our understanding is that the next mention of these cases in the High Court is on 19 January.  Every month that goes by heaps additional pressure on policyholders.  The likelihood is that we will not get any proper relief from these guidelines until they are bedded down and the challenges are dealt with.</p></speech>

That was quite interesting.  Another thing that we discussed was the Judicial Council (Amendment) Bill.  I asked whether the Bill would require insurers to provide audited reports to the Central Bank detailed whether these reduced claims costs arising from personal injuries guidelines have been passed on to consumers.  In the past two weeks, both insurers and the Central Bank have come in front of this committee and made it clear that the national claims information database cannot provide that information.  What are Mr. Boland's views on that Bill and whether its enactment would have helped?</p></speech>

As we have maintained from day one, any transparency in this industry is welcome.  It frustrates us that, typically, we only get transparency when legislation is put in place.  Insurers typically have to be dragged kicking and screaming into a position where they will actually provide data.  Any legislation that would provide additional transparency is welcome.  We understand that the Department of Justice's upcoming report on this area may have some data from insurers.  That would be timely.  We need data on the settlement strategy right now.  One concern that we have is, given the time that it takes for legislation to go through, is that there would be a time lag in getting the data.  That is not to say that we are dismissing the idea.  We think it is a terrific idea, if it copper-fastens the data that is hopefully being provided casually.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming before us.  The scenario that was presented was interesting, particularly that of Mr Sheridan.  Her description of her experiences was very illustrative in making the committee aware of the differences that exist.  I am aware of the comparisons with our European colleagues.  I am also aware that there are some differences in the extent to which cover exists for various incidents in Europe.  I know that the extent to which cover is available for the motor industry in some countries is not comparable to this country.  In other words, some people have very little or limited cover, or it is left between the parties.  That is not contradicting the reference to Europe.</p> <p>  We have all had experiences.  There is no doubt that the rapid settlement of cases is important.  The witnesses and many other people have referred to that.  The manner in which insurance companies encourage the settlements might contribute to many other things.  For example, saying to the person who reports an accident on the spot that he or she is liable or not liable, as the case may be, is very arbitrary for people who were not there.  It creates problems.  It is often unfair.  Perhaps the offending party has no responsibility or is given no responsibility with regard to the issue and gets clean away.  That is a problem.</p> <p>  The witnesses refer to repeat offenders, which are a serious issue.  I know that, in law, one cannot very well say that a person has a record and ask for it to be taken into account.  It is a dangerous thing to do.  However, some regard must be had to the fact that a person has had ten successful claims beforehand and appears innocuous enough.  Why is that not taken into account?  Can or should it be taken into account?  We have seen cases where judges refer to that.  We have seen other cases where people boast about how successfully they managed to circumnavigate the system.  That is another difficulty relating to providing a service that is fair, equitable, comprehensive, and sufficient to meet the needs of any growing country's economy.  Do any of the witnesses want to respond before we move to the next session?</p></speech>

From day one we have argued that if somebody is injured due to someone else's negligence, they must be compensated.  The basic structure we have in place is a good one.  Unfortunately, it has been undermined by a couple of pots of gold in the sense that when unsustainable amounts of money are added to the level of damages that can be achieved for minor soft tissue injuries, we then get much of the blackguardry the Vice Chairman mentioned, particularly where there are no meaningful consequences to making fraudulent exaggerated or vexatious claims.  We have a good system.  In ways it is better than in other places in Europe.  However, we do not have a system that is sustainable.  It is about getting the balance right.</p> <p>  Of course, the other pot of gold is the level of legal fees.  While this is not necessarily an issue over which this committee might have direct responsibility, it is a very important issue from a finance and economic point of view.  It has been acknowledged for some time, most notably by the troika, that legal costs in this country are unsustainable.  There have been no significant moves to get them under control since the troika came to town in 2010.  They are at the heart of the attempts to undermine the new judicial guidelines.  Until that nettle is grasped, we are concerned that the current issues will continue as they are.</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleagues, Jacqueline Thornton, director of regulation and policy development; Mike Curtin, manager of regulation and policy development; and Florian Wimber, director of advocacy, public affairs and communications.</p><p>I am joined by my colleagues Ms Jacqueline Thornton, director of regulation and policy development, Mr. Mike Curtin, manager of regulation and policy development, and Mr. Florian Wimber, director of advocacy, public affairs and communications.  </p><p> Ireland is a thriving global hub for insurance, reinsurance and emerging insurtech companies.  Ireland&rsquo;s insurance market is the fifth largest in the EU, and our reinsurance market is the second largest.  Our members represent around 95% of the companies operating in the Irish market, making Insurance Ireland a very strong leadership voice for the sector.</p><p> Insurance Ireland members are progressive, innovative, and inclusive, providing competitive and sustainable products and services to customers and businesses across the life and pensions, general, health, and reinsurance sectors in Ireland and across the globe.  In Ireland, our members pay more than &euro;13 billion in claims annually and safeguard the financial future of customers through managing &euro;112.3 billion in life and pensions savings.  In addition, our members contribute &euro;1.6 billion annually to the Exchequer, and the sector employs approximately 28,000 people in highly skilled careers.  </p><p> The primary role of Insurance Ireland is to advocate on behalf of our members with policymakers and regulators in Ireland, Europe and elsewhere to ensure a sustainable and stable market; to promote the value our members create for individuals, the economy and wider society; and to help customers understand insurance products and services available in the market so they can make informed choices.  Insurance Ireland represents over 130 members, serving 25 million customers in Ireland and globally across 110 countries, including 24 EU member states, providing protection and peace of mind to individuals, households and businesses and a firm foundation for the success of the Irish economy and wider society.  </p><p> When I joined Insurance Ireland as CEO in April 2020, it was made very clear to me by the board that it wanted me to lead the organisation to represent the interests of members and advocate for a sustainable and stable market that is attractive for new entrants and new products while retaining existing loyal providers.  The board also made it clear that it wanted me to have a strong consumer focus and to build this into the new five-year strategy for Insurance Ireland.</p><p> With regard to today's discussion on the Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, I am delighted to have been asked here today to share our thoughts.  Overall, our members support the general intention of the Bill as it can provide some clarity on certain aspects of the current legislation, such as the proposed technical amendments to section 18(4) of the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act.  </p><p> It is worth noting that, in respect of the proposed enhanced disclosures to policyholders, insurers continue to develop clearer and more explicit disclosures to policyholders while also bearing in mind the legal nature of insurance contracts, and the regulatory framework that insurers must operate within, such as complying with the consumer protection code, CPC, which provides comprehensive protection for consumers regarding how claims are accepted, processed and settled.  While our members are always working towards more streamlined, jargon-free information for policyholders, this is sometimes challenging considering the legal and regulatory framework we are subject to. </p><p> Other heads of the Bill enable the Central Bank to collect data from insurers where they deduct State supports from settlements paid in respect of insurance claims, in such instances where an insurer may be contractually entitled to make such deductions.  Under the proposed Bill, insurers will also provide enhanced disclosures regarding deductions of such State supports that are made in regard to the settlement of such policyholder claims.  </p><p> We note the requirement for the Central Bank to report on differential pricing, and we are very happy to have been given the opportunity to discuss this important issue with the committee.  It is important to discuss the Central Bank report in the context of the miscellaneous provisions Bill.  </p><p> We welcomed the final report and public consultation following the Central Bank review of the private car and home insurance markets.  In our view, the proposed reforms are balanced and proportionate.  Our members have proactively engaged with the Central Bank over the course of the review to ensure all market participants operate in a consistent and consumer-friendly manner, and we were pleased that the Central Bank acknowledged that to insurers last week and at this session.  The insurers reacted promptly to the &ldquo;Dear CEO&rdquo; letter.  Our members did not wait until the outcome of the review to implement changes.  </p><p> From the outset of the review, we have been proactive in providing feedback on the proposed legislation.  I assure the committee of the importance that our members attach to continuing to deliver fair consumer outcomes through the provision of a continued range of innovative products and services and the fact that we believe the proposed rules outlined in the Bill should support this objective.</p><p> The Central Bank report found that differential pricing benefits some consumers who are engaged and shop around for their insurance to obtain the best price for their needs.  It is important not to disincentivise this engagement.  </p><p> On foot of their initial report regarding differential pricing and the impact it could have on some consumers, Insurance Ireland and the members of the general insurance council undertook to implement a comprehensive and well-publicised shopping-around campaign throughout 2021.  We engaged with Age Friendly Ireland and Age Action to obtain more insight and target all cohorts to ensure the best outcomes and help secure the best deals for policyholders renewing insurance policies.  We plan to continue the awareness campaign in 2022.  Our latest consumer campaign is Insure Yourself Wisely, the essence of which involves being insurance savvy.</p><p> As part of our ongoing commitment to address the issues raised within the Central Bank&rsquo;s report, Insurance Ireland has commissioned a comprehensive consumer research exercise considering the experience and perspectives of Irish adults regarding insurance generally.  </p><p> Insurance Ireland welcomes the Central Bank&rsquo;s proposed reforms, which are balanced and proportionate.  We agree with the approach outlined by the Central Bank whereby &ldquo;price walking&rdquo; is banned for consumers who remain with an insurer beyond two years.  The pro-competitive option for new business discounts is retained, which will benefit consumers.  </p><p> The effect of the proposed measures is difficult to predict but it will be for each insurer to independently assess how it will implement them and determine the implications for it and its respective portfolios.  Ultimately, it is about how its customers will be protected.</p><p> Insurers are now providing five-year premium information on their policies, which brings enhanced visibility and transparency.  This, in itself, will help with making more informed decisions.</p><p> I would like to address the provision and development of the National Claims Information Database, NCID, under the Bill because it is important to point out the importance of the database.  It has been a key element in understanding the drivers of the costs of insurance and of underpinning policy measures to address those.  The establishment of the NCID has served to significantly improve data availability in the Irish insurance market and support policy analysis, which is contributing to addressing the issue of the high costs of insurance in several areas.  </p><p> The high-level trends we have seen in the reports published so far include the considerable legal costs and significant time period associated with settling injury claims through litigation.  We heard about this from the previous speaker, Mr. Peter Boland.  As acknowledged by the Central Bank, the data outline that the significant differences in legal costs greatly outweigh the differences in compensation outcomes.  The performance of the sector since 2009 and the profit- and loss-making periods over the intervening period demonstrate great volatility.  </p><p> As with any business, insurers cannot sustain indefinite losses and have to take steps to return to stability.  A loss-making and volatile market is not in the interest of policyholders.  Our members wish to operate in an environment that is less volatile and that delivers more consistent outcomes for consumers.</p><p>Insurance Ireland sees the analysis provided by the NCID as an important and valuable tool for legislators and the regulator in understanding practices in the insurance market in Ireland, thus allowing for more informed decisions to be made on how to address the issues driving the cost of insurance.  </p><p> The proposed measures in the Bill amount to a significant change for the market and how insurance has been traditionally managed.  We expect significant IT system changes, and that will probably be the biggest challenge to implementation.  We do not want there to be any negative impact for our ongoing projects, in particular our motor third-party liability database, which is an important initiative that want to be delivered in 2023 as a priority.  Therefore, we consider it important that appropriate implementation time is given and we will propose that 18 months be the timeframe to implement all measures.  I thank the Vice Chairman for the opportunity to contribute to the pre-legislative scrutiny process and look forward to engagement with the members on any questions they may have.</p></speech>

I want to take this opportunity to address the situation around mortgage life protection insurance for people with eating disorders, in particular cases where people are availing of counselling on a monthly basis, which is being used as a reason to refuse them insurance.  Is Ms Murdock aware of the difficulty faced by people with eating disorders in getting mortgage policy protection?  How do insurance companies in Ireland measure and access recovery?  What kind of oversight is there to ensure that firms are not discriminating against people with eating disorders?</p></speech>

We have been made aware of the cases and issue in question and are tracking that.  My colleague, Ms Thornton, is a director in this area and I will ask her to comment because we can provide some clarity on that for the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.674" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jacqueline Thornton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021121600002#M00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  The first thing we need to be clear about is that regardless of the condition, be it an historic eating disorder or something completely different, there is no one cohort of customers suffering from a condition who would be automatically declined for mortgage protection life cover.  Each applicant who submits an application will be assessed individually on his or her individual circumstances to understand the risk posed to an insurance firm.  The insurance firm then applies underwriting standards based on the information it needs, including very sound medical data and up-to-date information not just on medical matters and conditions but also on the latest medical technology and treatment options available.  A decision is then taken as to whether the level of risk is in line with the risk appetite of the insurer and current book the insurer has.  In some instances, that risk will be deemed to be too high and beyond the appetite of the insurer.  In those cases, the explanations and reasons for the decline will be set out to a customer in the response he or she receives.</p> <p>  As we understand it, and as has been confirmed by the Central Bank to the committee, there are, in effect, very low levels of decline in mortgage protection in Ireland.  For those who are declined, there is a major impact because they need to get mortgage protection to secure a mortgage.  A provision in the Consumer Credit Act 1995 makes it very clear that if an individual cannot obtain life cover, such as the constituent to which the Deputy referred, or can only do so at a cost that is unreasonably high, an exemption from the requirement can be granted.  That is something that can be discussed with a lender.  I note a recent statement regarding some Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, data, which stated that only 0.05% of mortgage application approvals do not proceed because of a lack of mortgage protection.  This indicates that the level of decline is very low.</p></speech>

We have to consider this in the context of the significant premiums charged.  It is not a case of refusing someone on a particular basis.  I am concerned because it may act as a deterrent for people accessing the help and support they need for fear of not being able to at some stage in their life own their own home.  I ask the witnesses to acknowledge that it is not about just one case, and to examine the situation and put insurance firms on notice that while there is flexibility, it is not being used and there needs to be fairness in their approach to people undergoing counselling.  I see it as a very positive thing when people take charge of their health, be it their mental or physical health, and get the support and treatment they need and are then able to have a home of their own.  It should not be a case of one or the other.  I ask the witnesses to do everything they can to make sure that this situation is addressed for people across the board so that they know they will not be penalised later on in life.</p></speech>

We work very closely with our members on the life side in respect of the underwriting criteria and issues that tend to come up, whether that is, as the Deputy mentioned, historic eating disorders or anything else.  It is important to note that even if there are issues, conditions or risks that have an impact on a person's ability to obtain life cover, the exemption exists.  It is to be hoped that we are not in a position whereby people are afraid to look after their mental health because it may have an impact on their ability to own their own home.  That is why the exemption exists.  If there is a condition, treatment, etc. that may exceed the risk acceptance level of any insurer, that is why the exemption exists.  It is there to try to ensure that individuals who are affected will still have the opportunity to own his or her home at a later date.</p></speech>

If somebody has had no issues arise for many years that should be recognised.  If a person is getting counselling and has everything in place, he or she should be rewarded rather than punished in terms of insurance.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I will start with questions on the personal injuries guidelines.</p> <p>  We have had a number of sessions on insurance, and this feels slightly like Groundhog Day because I am teasing out the same kind of questions.  It is important because we need to get everyone's view.  The personal injuries guidelines came into effect on 24 April and significantly reduced the cost of claims.  From the latest information we have since the guidelines came into effect, the average value of personal injury awards has fallen by 40%.  We know the insurance industry warned that premiums would not fall immediately, and that is what I want to tease out with the witnesses.  What percentage of the total cost for the insurance industry is absorbed by gross claims incurred for personal injuries?  I can ask a few questions or the witnesses can come back in on that one.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.680" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Curtin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021121600002#M01100"><p>I will take that question.  In terms of the personal injuries guidelines, as Deputy said we have heard a lot over the past couple of days about the position of individual insurers and different stakeholders.  We welcome the guidelines wholeheartedly.  Since they were adopted on 24 April, insurers have stated that there have been material decreases in premiums in conjunction with the guidelines.  The NCID report from Central Bank suggested that between quarter 4 of 2017 and the end of 2020 there was a 16% decrease in the cost of motor premiums.</p><p>CSO figures for the period suggest that there was a significant decrease of 8% over 2021 so, thankfully, they are having a material impact on consumers and it is good to see.  The one concern from an industry perspective is that there is a high level of claimant rejections of the awards being made directly from insurers and PIAB.  One thing we advocate is for them to be swiftly settled and adjudicated on.  The benchmark for all these awards will be set by the courts in the land and the sooner these cases are heard and if we get more certainty regarding pricing in the future, the better from an insurer perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.682" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021121600002#N00200"><p>If claims under a certain category have fallen by 40%, what does Mr. Curtin expect the percentage fall to be in terms of the costs even on a euro-to-euro basis?  When people hear that costs have fallen by 40%, they expect to see something quite significant in their own costs.  Could Mr. Curtin tease that out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.683" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Curtin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021121600002#N00300"><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, we cannot really get into future pricing arrangements.  From an insurer's perspective, it concerns them acting upon the adoption of the guidelines so far.  Some categories of injury have seen a fall of 40% while others have seen differences regarding different injuries.  The insurers will factor in their claims experience and the history across a number of injury categories.  They will also take stock of how these settlements go through over the next 12 months once they are heard in the courts.  It is hard to predict what is going to happen.  With any transformative change like the adoption of the guidelines, there is a transition period where there is uncertainty.  That seems to be the situation so far.</p></speech>

Mr. Curtin may be aware of the Judicial Council (Amendment) Bill, which would have required insurers to provide audited reports to the Central Bank detailing whether these reduced claims costs have been passed on to consumers.  What are his views regarding the national information claims database?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.685" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moyagh Murdock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021121600002#N00500"><p>I can answer that question.  The national information claims database is an excellent tool.  It has been evolving over the past three years.  We have had two years of motor reports and the first year of employers' and public liability and property.  The miscellaneous provisions Bill will introduce further enhancements to it.  The trends coming out of insurance portray the trajectory of motor insurance but it also provides a lot of clarity on profit and loss making, as was pointed by the Central Bank.  It is a very informative tool and does what the Deputy refers to, namely, providing clarity.  The consumer will feel that in his or her pocket.  Consumers are feeling in their pockets with motor insurance.  Employers' and public liability remains a very challenging market, as was presented in the most recent report in July, which showed a loss of 3%.  When one takes account of the investment income out of that, it is an actual loss of 6%.  Mr. Boland outlined the other measures we need to deliver on to ensure that the whole package of reform produces the actual desired outcome from the reform agenda.  We would concur with everything the Deputy said.</p></speech>

We could all say that we would have been very much impacted by her real-life story.  It concerns the topic of insurance fraud.  The insurance industry has repeatedly claimed that 20% of all claims are fraudulent with Insurance Ireland and Allianz claiming that insurance fraud costs the industry &euro;200 million per year.  In response to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Justice confirmed that 63 fraudulent claims were reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019 and that 48 were reported in 2020.  In 2019, 177,000 claims were made in the area of motor insurance while 26,000 claims were made across employer's and public liability and commercial property insurance.  This means that 0.003% of claims across motor insurance and employer's and public liability were reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the grounds of fraud in 2019.  Either misinformation is being put out or the insurance industry is acting contrary to its obligations under section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011.  Does Ms Murdock recognise that the actions insurers have taken regarding insurance fraud do not correspond to the message being fed to the public?</p> <p>  My second question relates to the point made by Ms Sheridan.  Under section 16(4) of the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act introduced by Deputy Pearse Doherty that was signed into law in 2019, insurers are required to notify a consumer of a claim made against his or her own policy, give him or her an opportunity to submit relevant evidence and inform him or her if a settlement has been made.  Can Ms Murdock confirm whether she believes these insurance companies are now operating each of these requirements?</p></speech>

I am not familiar with the figure of 20% quoted by the Deputy.  I wish to convey to the committee that we signed up to a new memorandum of understanding with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau in September.  It is a much more streamlined and clear agreement where we all know what we need to report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which can either follow it up centrally or divert it to the local office depending on the category of insurance fraud it falls into.  This is the first thing we must point out is that it is all criminal.  Probably one of the challenges we face is the threshold we must meet with evidence.  Something we can see is clearly fraudulent does not always meet that threshold with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of its ability to investigate it.  We can see cases in very recent days that would clearly be fraudulent but we must come up with the evidence to say they can be investigated.  That said, in the first three months of that new memorandum of understanding, the feedback has been very positive from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which intends producing a report on what it is delivering, the quality of information coming through from the insurers is good and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be reporting to the Department of Justice in the first quarter of 2022.  It is very important that we have the right guidelines and evidence that we can pursue fraud.  There are certainly attempts at fraud in terms of application fraud and not providing the insurer with the correct information at the outset.  The new legislation makes it important that insurers ask the right questions.  The onus is now on the insurers to ask those questions and we have bought into that fully.</p> <p>  One of the things I would point out regarding the numbers quoted by the Deputy is that many of those cases have multiple applicants within one case.  A Ford Zafira with seven seats could involve seven individuals in the same case.  These all have legs and there are a lot of other parties involved in individual claims.</p></speech>

What is the percentage according to Insurance Ireland?</p><p>Surely if it is such a big issue, Insurance Ireland is aware of the percentage of claims that are fraudulent.  For 2019, we have the figure of 0.003%.  What is Insurance Ireland's figure?</p></speech>

It is important to get the first period of execution of the new memorandum of understanding to see how that is panning out.  The Garda will receive reports of fraud from multiple sources, whether they come from the insurer or members of the public.  There are different sources.  The members of Insurance Ireland will report fraud to the Garda.  They will also deal with it themselves.  There are other sources for the reporting of insurance fraud, so it would be difficult to give the Deputy a comparative figure.</p></speech>

It was that issue I was referring to.  I could be wrong and am happy to be corrected but it is my understanding that under section 16(4) of the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act, sponsored by my colleague Deputy Pearse Doherty and signed into law in 2019, insurers are required to notify consumers of a claim made against their policy, give them an opportunity to submit relevant evidence and inform a consumer if a settlement has been made.

One part of the new miscellaneous provisions Bill is to clarify that section because there was a concern around legal professional privilege.  Insurers have an obligation to disclose under section 7 of the consumer protection code on claim handling.  Insurers are bound by that obligation.</p> <p>  We would suggest that the section to which the Deputy referred applies to policyholders.  Obviously, we cannot go into any individual circumstances and I am not sure of the facts of the situation mentioned earlier by Ms Sheridan.</p></speech>

The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precinct is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given.  They should respect directions given by the Chairman and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to that person's or entity's good name.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Clancy to make his opening statement, followed by Mr. O'Kane.</p></speech>

I am chief executive of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce and I am joined by Mr. Aidan O'Kane, president of the chamber.  We will share a brief update on the key issues and priorities facing the north-west business community and will be happy to answer any follow-up questions members may have.</p> <p>  The chamber represents more than 350 businesses throughout the north-west city region, providing support and advocacy at a local, regional and national level.  As the largest business network in the region, the chamber promotes strong business engagement to support the development, growth and sustained economic viability of our members and the wider north-west business community.  With our unique position on the Derry-Donegal border, Brexit has posed significant challenges to north-western businesses in the past five years.  Amid continued uncertainty over the status of the protocol, the Brexit withdrawal agreement and Covid-19, it is imperative local businesses have the stability, certainty and support they require to meet current challenges head on.</p> <p>  Recent surveys, including the chamber's membership surveys, have shown the desire among business owners here to make the protocol work.  In fact, 80% of our members urge the Executive to take advantage of the unique trading position Northern Ireland now has.  We also have a strong relationship with Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce, with which we have signed a memorandum of understanding.  It is a partnership that reflects the shared goals and objectives we hope to achieve through cross-Border collaboration.</p> <p>  A strong, prosperous all-Ireland economy is a key priority for our chamber members.  The growth in cross-Border trade since the start of the year reflects the shared economic prosperity and opportunities we can achieve under the current trading arrangements.  It is imperative that, through the likes of the shared island unit and fund, much-needed investment be granted to Border regions to support the growth of our island economy.  While regional infrastructure and connectivity continue to improve, the pace of change is slow, with several projects needed to be prioritised to support Derry's links with other economic hubs in Northern Ireland and beyond.</p> <p>  The City of Derry Airport ensures air connectivity between the north west, the UK and Europe, a road and rail network ensures links with Belfast, Dublin and the rest of the island, and the A6 dualling project, expected to be completed in spring 2022, is estimated to cut journeys to Belfast to about one hour.  Other projects such as the A5 and the north-west transport hub must continue to be supported as part of our property-funded investment programme to bolster transport connectivity for the north west.  I congratulate the Northern Ireland Minister for Infrastructure, Ms Nichola Mallon, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on their all-Ireland strategic rail review and the co-operation and leadership they are showing in that regard.</p> <p>  The city deal, which was launched in February 2021, is an historic and exciting intervention that will contribute to building a stronger, more competitive, resilient and inclusive economy, deliver higher paid jobs and contribute to creating a more regionally balanced economy over the coming years.  In all, the capital investment package will total about &pound;250 million, making it one of the most generous city deals in the UK.</p> <p>  Succeed North West, an event we ran in Belfast on 4 November at the Merchant Hotel in conjunction with our city partners, sought to encourage business leaders to invest in the north west.  Through this approach, we have sought to market the Border region to employers that may not have thought about investing in it.  We seek to work with the Government and bodies such as the shared island unit to further market often overlooked Border regions and to unlock the true potential of the north west.</p> <p>  The chamber advocates for a joint, all-Ireland approach to working together on environmental issues facing employers on both sides of the Border.  In light of COP26 and the challenges we face, a co-operative and cross-Border approach is needed, and we are keen to see the climate resolutions we need on a regional level.</p><p>As a chamber, we are committed to working with employers to support them in the movement towards net-zero emissions and to realise the business opportunities accompanying this transition. </p><p> On current issues, the Covid-19 pandemic is one.  In addition, energy costs and inflation are rising, and our members are facing unsustainable increases in production and material costs, which pose significant challenges for their finances.  Nearly half of all respondents to a recent chamber survey cited a lack of access to a skilled workforce as one of their dominant concerns, as well as the continued expansion of Magee campus at Ulster University, as agreed in the New Decade, New Approach Agreement, which must be implemented.</p><p> In conclusion, this is an exciting and optimistic time for the north-west city region. Our continually-growing economic offering, coupled with our strong connectivity and infrastructure, promises to bring sustained prosperity to local businesses.  Our regional economy continues to grow in strength, and while pressing challenges remain, there is a strong feeling of optimism among our local traders.</p><p> Given our proximity to the Border, it is imperative that tax regulations North and South are fair and harmonised and that cross-Border workers have the flexibility they need to meet the demands of the local economy.  On that topic, I hand over to the president of the chamber, Mr. Aidan O'Kane.  </p></speech>

As Mr. Clancy said, being in the Border region presents nuances and challenges, as well as great opportunities.  I am a director of one of the largest foreign direct investment, FDI, enterprises that came into Northern Ireland as a result of the Good Friday Agreement.  Allstate in Northern Ireland employs 2,400 people, of whom 900 are in the Derry and Strabane area of the north west.  More than a decade ago, Allstate realised that there was a challenge in implementing some of our HR policies on remote working.  This was due to tax legislation governing the Revenue in the Republic of Ireland.  It prohibited any work carried out for a foreign employer being done in the State.  All those duties had to be undertaken within Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  This was an issue that many members of our chamber faced and dealt with over the last decade, after it became apparent that this situation was an issue and whenever employees had greater expectations about remote working and work-life balance.  This issue really came to the fore, though, when the pandemic started.  In March 2020, a group of individuals dotted around several companies in the north west decided that it was a prime time to try to tackle this issue once and for all in respect of allowing our employees to work from home.  When directives from the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive asked everybody to work from home, if they could, we were left with a dilemma concerning some of our employees.  Thankfully, a waiver was in place during 2020 for employees and employers.  The waiver for employers ran out at the end of 2020, while that for employees has continued to operate throughout this year.  We were facing an issue coming near the end of this year, because that waiver could have run out.  </p> <p>  I would like to go over some of the Cross-Border Workers Coalition's engagements on this issue.  We met with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, on three occasions this year, in June, September and October.  The June meeting was concerned with laying out an awareness of the foundations of this issue and the impact it was having on employers and employees in the north-west region, and right across the Border necklace.  The issue was presented to the Minister and his team, and there was a clear recognition of its importance and the impact of the situation on people and businesses.  The Minister committed to having the tax strategy group, TSG, produce a paper on this issue.  We met with the Minister after that was produced.  We had drafted our own respectful rebuttal of the contents of the TSG's findings, two of which were of chief concern to the Minister.  In conjunction with tax experts from Grant Thornton and following engagement with Rose Tierney, we produced a rebuttal of both of those aspects.  </p> <p>  One point concerned equity in respect of residents in the Republic of Ireland potentially being encompassed within two different tax systems, if they were to work from home full time.  The other point involved competitiveness, and whether a change in the relevant legislation would leave employers and businesses in the State at a competitive disadvantage.  In our rebuttal paper that we submitted and presented to the Minister and his team in October, ahead of the budget, we respectfully challenged some of the findings and contents of the TSG's paper as being one-dimensional.  For example, regarding the equity, and the potential for residents in the State to be in two tax systems, we produced figures that showed those being employed by businesses in Northern Ireland would be no better off.  Those with incomes up to &pound;60,000 would experience no benefit at all.  On competitiveness, after again having consulted with Grant Thornton, there is much more data to be considered and more work to be done before arriving at a conclusion that any competitive disadvantage would result for businesses domiciled in this State.  </p> <p>  To make change in this regard possible, and as easy as possible, we recognise that we must bring in some controls in respect of any legislative changes on remote working.  For that reason, we brought some pragmatic suggestions to the Minister and his team.  Those were intended to ensure that there would be exposure for the Revenue in respect of the introduction of changes in the legislation governing this area.  Some of these controls include limiting the number of days during which employees can work from home for companies based in Northern Ireland.  We recognise the international standard of 183 days per year as a maximum.  We sought a measure within those limits, which would not set a global precedent.  The other control we suggested was having salary caps.  Employees who could avail of working from home would need to be under a specific salary threshold.  Again, this is a control that we suggested to limit the potential exposure of the Revenue in respect of any changes in the tax system.  The third control we suggested was to have specific roles categorised as being able to avail of remote working.  That provision would mean we would not be opening this possibility of working from home to those proprietary directors or senior executives who make corporate and strategic decisions from the State, thus inducing a corporate tax presence.  Therefore, we have presented pragmatic controls in this regard to the Minister for Finance and his team for consideration.</p> <p>  In the context of all those controls, we have also suggested that any changes could be made and rolled out as a scheme that is time-boxed and trialled to ensure that the concerns highlighted by the tax strategy group could be monitored, controlled and, if need be, revised or, in a worst-case scenario, retracted.</p><p>There are ways of changing the rules to allow and not disadvantage those who work for Northern Ireland-based companies.</p><p> Within the last couple of weeks we have heard of a further extension into 2022.  We have asked for clarification on the associated timescales.  At the moment it seems a little open-ended, so a bit more certainty around that is required.</p><p> I will finish by giving practical examples of what is happening at present.  Employees or prospective employees of businesses like Allstate, Seagate and many other companies around the Border regions are now asking what are the remote working opportunities.  To be perfectly honest, we must be straight down the middle and say that while the waiver is in place that is permitted but if there is no certainty going forward then we must be clear that it is quite possible that they will have to be office-based permanently in the absence of something more certain going forward.  We are now also seeing businesses north of the Border put out job postings and advertisements for roles, and highly-paid roles in some cases, that state remote working is available to UK residents only.  This brings a huge concern in terms of the free movement of people, skills and talent across the Border region, which is absolutely essential to feed businesses in Derry, for example.  If that trajectory goes forward with prospective employees making a decision to work for companies that are based in the Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland-based companies making decisions to employ Northern Ireland-based employees, then suddenly we are on a path where there is going to be a people border in terms of the economy around the Border regions.</p></speech>

We have written to the Minister as part of my role.  Obviously this matter is really important to members of the chamber.  I also hold a position within the Cross-Border Workers Coalition.

All that Mr. O'Kane knows is that it will continue but he does not have any potential date whatsoever so if one is employing or is about to employ somebody, then that person has no certainty.  Therefore, effectively an employer cannot offer the job because the employee and the employer do not know what will happen.</p></speech>

As someone who is from the north west I am very much in favour of their proposals and a lot of what they said.</p> <p>  First, I completely concur with what Mr. Clancy said about the cross-Border issues concerning Brexit.  I am very much aware that his organisation has a strong relationship with the Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce.  That relationship is also quite beneficial to the Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce.</p> <p>  Mr. Clancy made a strong point about the all-Ireland rail review.  It is one of the most exciting things to happen in recent decades in terms of the possibilities that exist.  Has his chamber done anything, in terms of its own membership, to make submissions to the review?  Can it up the ante?  I ask because there is great potential for Derry in a scenario where there is speedy rail connectivity between Derry, Belfast and Dublin, and maybe beyond.  It is a very exciting time for the north west because we have been cut off, on both sides of the Border, for far too long.</p></speech>

I agree with what was said by the Chairman.  I am very much aware of individuals on both sides of the Border who work on both sides of the Border.  As some of them are in an awful position taxwise and are really crippled, I very much favour the proposals made by Mr. O'Kane.  I suggest to the Chairman that we write to the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, and send a copy to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste.  In this era of a shared island, and I know that we are very much in our infancy as a shared island, it is issues like that which need to be dealt with.  It is the everyday issues for the people on the ground that are really important in a shared future and this is one of them.  While this issue is complex, we need to bang heads together and find answers.  I do not think that we have reached the stage where we are focused on this yet but maybe this is the start.  Any help that we can be or if the witnesses feel the need to contact us offline at any stage then please feel free to do so, particularly from my perspective and the same applies to my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues.</p> <p>  My colleagues, Deputy Brendan Smith and Senator McGreehan, also want to ask a few questions.</p></speech>

I endorse the comments made by my colleague, Senator Blaney.</p> <p>  Some years ago this committee visited Derry and Letterkenny, where we met different interest groups, local authorities, the mayor of Derry, the chair of Donegal County Council and the chief executives of the councils along with the president of the Letterkenny Institute of Technology and senior personnel of the University of Ulster.  The one message that I got that day was the powerful influence for good generated by the third level education colleges in the north west, including Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Magee College and the University of Ulster.  I come from a part of Ulster where, unfortunately, where we do not have as good a level of co-operation or as good an education infrastructure.  The message was driven home to us that day how powerful a catalyst the education provision was in attracting investment to the region, as well as a very strong selling in strength to potential investors and people with particular knowledge and skills to come to live in the area, which I sincerely hope can be built on.</p><p>Recently, the Government announced that for the first time, the provision is being made under the new PEACE PLUS programme to deliver certain skills and initiatives on a cross-Border basis.  That is a welcome development and it ties in with what Senator Blaney said about the shared island initiative, which is about promoting both third level and further education on a cross-Border and all-Ireland basis.</p><p> We hear of plenty of job vacancies at present.  Do the witnesses see any particular skills issues in the north west that need to be addressed at present?  I am a great believer in the further education sector.  We should be delivering that sector and it should be more structured on an all-Ireland basis as well.  Progress has been made at third level in terms of colleges, universities and institutes of technology co-operating with one another on an all-Ireland basis, and substantial funding is committed under the shared island initiative for research on that basis, between the different colleges in our State and in Northern Ireland.</p><p> Are there any issues the witnesses believe we should be pursuing at that time with regard to upskilling and equipping people for jobs the witnesses see emerging in the new green economy and the different economy we will have post Covid?  If we are to tackle the many challenges we, as an island, will face post Covid, we need to be doing as much as possible on a cross-Border and all-Ireland basis.</p></speech>

I have been working with Dundalk Chamber of Commerce on that tax issue.  It is a huge problem and it is not only for Ireland to deal with.  We have to push that at European level because harmonisation is needed for all cross-border workers.  I lend my support to that and Dundalk Chamber of Commerce is working hard on it.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  It was very interesting to learn more about the north west as an east coast dweller, and I appreciate it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.729" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Clancy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021121600002#F00300"><p>I will take Senator Blaney's question about the rail review.  That is something we will do.  We will work with Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce and will put a joint survey out and get feedback from a cross-Border perspective on that with our members.  We have found a very strong voice when we get the two memberships and do a collation of the report back from that.  We certainly will do that.</p> <p>  I will let Mr. O'Kane answer on tax, but I will cover Deputy Smith's question on third level education.  A masters student starting in Letterkenny Institute of Technology, LYIT, who is working with it and Magee University on behalf of both chambers.  The student started in September on a two-year programme to look at cross-Border fintech clusters.  The student will gather these data over the next two years to see how that looks from a cluster perspective, copy and paste that cluster and use that knowledge we have to look at and investigate other clusters from a cross-Border perspective.  We sometimes find the data finish at the Border, so there is a cross-Border approach to this project.  It is a two-year funded masters programme with a potential PhD afterwards.  That is an example of the two chambers and institutions working together again, which is very positive.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Kane can also answer the question on the jobs shortage.  However, the Deputy hit it right on the nail there in that we find, from a North West Regional College perspective, we are not on the trajectory of investigating what opportunities there are in the new skills bases that will be required in the future.  If you are talking about passive houses, air source heat pumps, electric vehicles and things like that, there is a huge opportunity to get ahead of the curve from a north-west perspective.</p> <p>  We have a fabulous institution in the North West Regional College which, along with the other institutions, is doing tremendous work, for example, in providing welding courses.  There is a shortage of welders.  Academies are also feeding into the fintech businesses, within North West Regional College and Ulster University.  We have a great ground base of educational establishments to provide those skills we need.  However, we need to plan ahead of the game to get ahead of the curve in order that we have the right skills in place when those technologies are needed.  We have youth, experience and manufacturing background to capture some of those things.</p></speech>

We see engagements between our business community with LYIT, for example, in the development of fintech-related courses, which is helping build out that higher level pipeline of skills, which many of fintech, insure-tech and regtech companies are crying out for.</p> <p>  Skills is the number one item on our agenda in terms of concern about sustainability of our business and future investment, but we are very joined up.  We see indigenous companies such as Alchemy and FinTrU leveraging the university and college to build out bespoke courses to fulfil their needs in terms of creation of that talent pipeline.  That is working very successfully.</p> <p>  With regard to the skills shortages in the north west, fintech is a growing cluster.  A centre of gravity is certainly forming in the north west between the likes of Allstate, Alchemy, FinTrU, Tata Consultancy Services and Optum.  There is a groundswell there and a demand for those skills going into the future.  I know, looking into the future, the skills around big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence and automation and robotics will all be essential skills to sustain future businesses.  The roles that do not exist today but will exist in ten to 15 years' time are the ones we need to be developing and thinking about now.</p> <p>  Senator McGreehan mentioned the tax issue on a European basis and I thought it was quite interesting to take a look at some other countries around Europe.  For example, the tolerance threshold agreements between Germany, Belgium and France were for in or around 19 days going up to a maximum of 34 days for border countries without triggering any tax obligations.  That has changed as a result of Covid and all of those countries have substantially increased the number of days working, which demonstrates that, despite taxing rights and obligations under EU and OECD models, there is an appetite to permit higher thresholds.  The current Irish legislation allows for zero.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

We had Malachy &Oacute; N&eacute;ill and the LYIT president in at the start of last year and we had a very good presentation on collaboration from both of them.  I met Mr. Clancy two weeks ago.  There is further engagement and projects in the pipeline, and that collaboration is great.  At some stage, I would hope to get the heads of Letterkenny University Hospital and Altnagelvin Area Hospital before the committee, because a bit more takes place on a cross-Border basis, health-wise, as well.  I will not ask any more questions.  I thank the witnesses for the collaboration they are doing and if we can be of any help, they should be sure to get in touch, especially from a north-west perspective.</p></speech>

The figure I was given, if I am correct, is that 40% of the people working in Derry are from Donegal.  Is that an accurate figure?  It is a huge number of people, and I presume the same number would be working on the other side of the Border as well.  It is a significant issue.  The more Covid gets a grip on our society, the more we realise how important it is to have the option of working from home.  That is why we can, hopefully, strengthen and support your arguments objectively.  Does the opposite apply if one is employing in the South?  The witnesses might not have the answer; I certainly do not.  Is it the same problem?  What happens if one is working from home in Derry, but one is employed in Letterkenny, for example?</p></speech>

Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, HMRC, is more flexible than the Revenue Commissioners, so there is a degree of flexibility in respect of a Northern Ireland resident working for a company such as Tata Consultancy Services in Letterkenny.  I believe that is permitted for up to approximately 60 days.</p></speech>

It is fantastic to hear about the fintech opportunities that are developing.  It is a great body of employment to be developed.  It is what is needed.  I have two questions.  Will Mr. Clancy outline the different experience, sector by sector, of the protocol over the last 12 months?  When the committee was in the North the members met different political colleagues from Northern Ireland and they gave us quite a mixed picture, sector by sector, of how people were experiencing it.  Some had no difficulty and some had great difficulty.  Perhaps we could get a sense of that from Mr. Clancy on behalf of his members.  That would be very helpful for the committee.</p> <p>  Second, will Mr. O'Kane outline the experience business leaders and business owners have had in respect of the quality of the communication of the British Government directly with business on some of the complex issues that are emerging both in legislation and with the protocol and how that is going?  Yesterday, there was a significant decision that affects Irish exporters with the change to the 1 January rules.  That came on 14 December and, while welcome, it was not particularly timely.  I am interested in how that direct communication is going.  I will give the reason.  One of the things we hear a great deal is how difficult everything is and would be for business in Northern Ireland as a consequence of the difficulties in the protocol, but I am not hearing anything or enough from the British Government about the opportunities created by the particular situation given to business in Northern Ireland.  I wonder if, privately, there has been more communication on that to businesses in Northern Ireland than there has been publicly.</p></speech>

With regard to the surveys we have conducted with our membership, the overwhelming majority say that the protocol is working for them.  From a business perspective, they know there are some challenges in terms of additional paperwork, costs and the like, but that would be the broad brush on it.  In terms of the individual-----</p></speech>

They say there are some issues with paperwork and additional costs, but they are working through those and they see the opportunity as a bigger opportunity for them than a hindrance.  I will put it that way.  It is not that they would have liked to have been in that position, but they are now and they are saying they want to make it work in its current form.  That is the overwhelming message we are getting from our members across all the sectors.  In fact, it would be fair to say that when I met with other membership organisations as well, and we met the T&aacute;naiste in Belfast six or seven months ago, the overwhelming feeling from all those other membership organisations was that stability was needed and it was necessary to make it work.  I believe that is the general consensus within membership organisations from a business perspective.</p></speech>

There are two perspectives the business community in Northern Ireland deals with - directly with the Executive and for whatever other aspects in terms of communications directly with the British Government.  First and foremost, the quality of communications with the Executive and access to our elected representatives and Ministers is relatively easy.  It is good, direct and accessible from the Northern Ireland Executive perspective.  As a larger business, in the all-state context, we have doors opened a lot more freely than perhaps some of the smaller businesses.  We are not hearing any challenges.  This is where the chamber plays a fabulous role in representing small, medium and large businesses in regard to access to government.  With regard to access to the British Government and the communications there, I agree that accessibility is just not there to the degree that we would hope for and seek.  I believe there are other priorities, as it were, with regard to what is going on either in England, Scotland or Wales rather than what is happening in Northern Ireland.  That is our view.</p></speech>

First, they know that I support the cross-Border workers' campaign and I am glad the Minister has agreed to meet with the witnesses again in the new year with regard to giving some clarity about that timescale.  However, that is a temporary position and what we need is a permanent solution or something that we can trial and give us hope for the future.  What is interesting about the tax strategy position on it is that it is firmly about tax and revenue and does not necessarily involve the bigger picture.  Do the witnesses agree with that?  For example, the North now has dual market access and, hopefully, that will remain.  Looking at the north-west region, is there the opportunity for the South there as well and for the entire region growing together?  The labour market has to be set up to do that.  Is it beneficial to address this so the entire region can grow and take the opportunities from dual market access?  The tax strategy document does not take that into consideration.</p> <p>  With regard to equity, I wish to take up some points the witnesses made and ask them to elaborate on them further.  On the equity piece, paying a higher rate of income tax could mean that two people in the one household are paying different levels of income tax because one has Northern Ireland based employment and the other has Republic of Ireland based employment.  What is that in reality?  The tax might be different but there are salary differences.  What other factors contribute to the witness saying that his figures show that it does not make much of a discrepancy?  I wish to understand that more.  Again, there is the tax strategy paper's point about making it more attractive for employees to work and pay tax in the North and needing a lot more data on that.  What kind of data are being referred to?  The witness is absolutely right about producing pragmatic solutions here.  The North has allowed 60 days.  Could we look at a greater number of days, such as up to 180 days that people can work from home?  The two other issues were salary caps and the roles.  That is definitely the place where the witness is giving solutions and I hope the Minister can make those work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.745" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Kane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021121600002#G01400"><p>I can respond to Senator Currie.</p><p>There is quite a bit to unpack but they are great questions and comments.  Regarding the question about the opportunity for the north west to access the dual markets, the essential piece of that is the ability to staff and resource those opportunities with the people residing in the north west.  Derry is the fourth largest city on the island and the second largest in Northern Ireland but it does not even have the footfall to attract major FDI by itself.  Regarding the talent pool in the Donegal-Tyrone hinterland, I agree there are opportunities there if we get this right and harmonise in some sort of way to allow access on both sides of the Border to the resources, skills and talent to sustain and attract FDI and help to build the start-up community, which is really important for our economy in the north west.  FDI companies do their homework before investing.  There is no doubt about that.  Companies like Seagate do not accidentally set up in Derry without taking a look at where its talent will come from and how it accesses the skills.  There is opportunity there.  The Senator is right that the tax strategy group does not take any of those matters into consideration.  In many ways, it is very one-dimensional regarding what it concluded.<br/><br/>In and around the equity piece raised by Senator Currie, there are findings and we worked with Grant Thornton on this.  We have discovered that a worker earning &pound;30,000 and subject to UK tax actually has less net income than a worker subject to Irish tax.  It demonstrates that a wider investigation into the tax impact needs to be considered prior to arriving at any conclusion that workers with UK employers are subject to a more advantageous tax system.  It is just not correct.  It is not complete.  It is not sufficient to conclude that a more beneficial tax system is the only factor as well that will impact a worker resident and working in the State for a UK employer and make him or her better off financially.  Studies have been done.  A study was carried by Seamus McGuinness and Adele Bergin entitled &quot;Who is Better off?  Measuring Cross-border Differences in Living Standards, Opportunities and Quality of Life on the Island of Ireland&quot;.  There is really no threat to the State or Revenue regarding the matters raised relating to equity.<br/><br/>Regarding competition, it is a bit more difficult to really get to the nub of what the tax strategy group is referring to with regard to any solid evidence that this would be an issue.  It is more protectionist regarding how any changes may or may not impact.  The tax strategy paper briefly discussed the impact on employers in the State of a more favourable UK tax system available to residents working in the State and concluded that extending the concession puts employers in the State at a competitive disadvantage.  We do not agree with that based on the evidence available to us.  The north-west city region is a prime example where we have really strong collaboration, which has been alluded to.  We have the likes of Catalyst, which is a Northern Ireland entity, setting up conversations about establishing in Letterkenny.  These are the things we want to encourage.  A prosperous Donegal is a prosperous Derry and <i>vice versa</i>.  It is about the north west region.</p></speech>

I agree with him that the tax strategy group paper is one-dimensional.  I have said previously in the Chamber that I am uncomfortable with using language like the North and South being in competition with each other and competitive advantage.  Everything should be about collaboration and harmonisation to grow the region and that should be the starting point.</p></speech>

I note the comments on the city deal, which, from what the witnesses are saying, is really top class for the region between Derry and Strabane.  Is there a joint approach - even to do with the relationship between Londonderry Chamber of Commerce and Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce?  Is there room to go after a project that will benefit the north west?  Is that an option or is it pie in the sky?</p></speech>

We are just looking for the right project and should have that discussion.  It is a very good suggestion.  We have been part of the shared island unit discussions.  We would love to get a project that would show how it can work from a co-operative cross-Border point of view in the region.  It is just about finding that project.  We have not done the work on it yet so we need to do that and see if we can identify something that will work for us.</p></speech>

As a representative for the north-west region, it has been a very exciting time, particularly in terms of the city deal and the inclusive future fund.  It has provided huge opportunities for the region.  I had the privilege of representing the Strabane district, which comes under the north west.  We will really see the fruits of that in terms of the regeneration of Strabane town but it will be transformative for the entire north-west region.  I know the chamber has done a lot of work behind the scenes and participated in a lot of collaboration with the different partners to achieve and secure that funding.  I commend Mr. Clancy because I know he has put many hours into securing that funding for the north west.</p> <p>  In terms of challenges for the north west, while it is great to see that investment, there are still a lot of challenges and much delivery is still needed for the region.  Reference was made to the expansion of the Magee campus.  While there has been progress on that, more work needs to be done.  I have been harping on in this committee about connectivity and the need for the A5.  We have seen progress on the A6 and, hopefully, the all-island rail review will reap rewards for the north-west region.  There is a lot of work to be done but I know there is great collaboration in the north west.  It is great to see the progress that has occurred to date.  It is a really good example of how we can see the rewards of North-South co-operation between Donegal and the Derry-Strabane district.</p> <p>  I want to pick up on Mr. Clancy's point about the protocol.  I know he said that a lot of members of Londonderry Chamber of Commerce have not really experienced too much difficulty in terms of the implementation of the protocol as a whole.  I was in contact with some of the chamber's members from the Strabane area and Invest Northern Ireland about trying to profile the north-west region in terms of attracting investment and the benefits the protocol can bring.  We have already seen that some businesses have relocated to the Strabane area as a result of the protocol and the benefits it offers in terms of access to the British and EU markets.  Have the witnesses seen any growth in businesses locating to the north west as a result of the protocol?  Do they see any potential for that in the time ahead?</p><p>Do the witnesses see any potential for that in the time ahead?  The chamber has been working on the Succeed North West campaign.  That is so welcome.  I hope it will attract investment to the area.  Well done to the chamber on all the work it is continuing to do.  I congratulate Mr. O'Kane on the cross-Border workers' coalition.  I am sure we would not be at the point we are at today in respect of the short-term measures had it not been for the campaigning.  I hope there will be a long-term solution.  I fully support the sending of correspondence to the Minister to highlight this issue once again for cross-Border workers because a significant number of people are affected by the double tax.</p><p> Perhaps Mr. Clancy would like to answer my question on investment since the advent of the protocol.</p></speech>

We are planning to have an event in Strabane on 4 or 5 February next year.  The campaign is about considering inward investment and encouraging people from all over Ireland, but particularly those in the Belfast region who went to the gig in Belfast, to come to Strabane to see what is happening, with a view to encouraging them to invest and grow.  We are working very closely with the Strabane BID team, chaired by Mr. Kieran Kennedy, to sell what is going on in Strabane, particularly regarding the city deal, and to generate an air of optimism and opportunity for business.</p> <p>  On the specific question on the protocol, our feeling, which we hear from certain investors, is that, because of the uncertainty that exists, many businesses seeking to invest in the region are holding back a little until they have clarity regarding the protocol.  They want more stability and to know exactly what the future outlook will be.  That seems to be the main issue.  I have heard of one or two companies in Strabane - but one in particular - that did move, but there are one or two others whose representatives I have spoken to that would also like to do so but that are a little uncertain.  The sooner we can have a stable approach on a way forward from an executive point of view, the sooner we will see much more opportunity.</p> <p>  From speaking to people in Dublin, I note that they are also looking north to see the opportunities and the marketing plan we have for the region.  There may be a unique opportunity for southern businesses to gain access.  It is very difficult for people to have these conversations until they have clarity on the future.  There is a great opportunity not only to look into this but also to make a business case for it.  The shared island unit and the associated co-operation can help us to pull that business case together.</p></speech>

Has Mr. Clancy had much engagement with the shared island unit, mainly in respect of investment?  The likes of the A5 would be included in that.  With regard to looking forward to projects, we had said it is early days and that people need to come together to produce something to bring to the table.  I am just wondering what engagement Mr. Clancy has had.</p></speech>

We have not brought our own projects and thoughts to the table yet.  We have been working with the universities.  Ulster University Magee Campus has a potential research project working with the chamber.  From memory, I understand that Cork Chamber might also be involved.  Therefore, we are working on the matter.  Our chamber and the board would love to have some projects that we can say come from the shared island initiative but we have not got that far yet.  We understand, however, that good ideas are always welcome.  We are involved in the regular communications with the shared island unit on what is happening.  As late as last week, the Taoiseach gave an update on what was actually happening.  There is more to be done.</p></speech>

The good work they do on collaboration is widely known across the island and internationally.  Many other areas have a lot to learn from them.  I commend everybody involved on the great work they are doing, the North West Strategic Growth Partnership and the positive cross-border collaboration that exists.  The benefits can been seen in every area.  The witnesses outlined many of them in their answers and presentation.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  Coming from Mayo, I do not buy into focusing solely on the Derry, Belfast and Dublin circuits.  We are considering the western economic corridor and what can be developed along it.  We are very enthusiastic about the possibilities and opportunities related to the Atlantic Technological University.  My first question is on that.  I note everything the witnesses said about the opportunities associated with the market of 500 million people in the EU and access to the British market, but the real challenge will be having a skilled labour force.  It is a matter of how we can work on that.  What are the opportunities, and what can we do from this end regarding the Atlantic Technological University?  What are the opportunities associated with the green agenda, including the opportunities for investment in, and the growth of, renewable energies in the north west and west?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.757" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Clancy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021121600002#J00700"><p>Mr. O'Kane will take the question on the western economic corridor and the Atlantic Technological University, and I will take the one on green energy.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy very much for her questions.  I absolutely agree with her on the economic corridor.  I had a meeting with the Dublin&ndash;Belfast economic corridor folk this week.  What is happening in that regard is very exciting.  The cross-Border element features really heavily in making the whole thing work.  On the western corridor, we can see the green shoots.  The Atlantic Technological University is a really welcome asset for the region.  Letterkenny has worked very hard to get to that stage, including by engaging with businesses to help develop the courses and research projects.  The magic ingredient in all this is the tying together of three strands that need to work: the business community; academia; and government, whether it involves councils or the regional or national governments, such as the Irish Government, or the Assembly.  If those three strands are tied together, the magic happens.</p> <p>  What is happening gives us a great opportunity.  In Donegal, there is certainly ambition.  Things are changing.  We are hearing more inquiries about Derry.  We are seeing a levelling up from a Northern Ireland perspective in the sense that there should and will be more investment in the north west.  We are hearing the same sort of narrative from the Irish Government, which is talking about levelling up, with Donegal, from a regional perspective.  When it all comes together, we will have a really good recipe for success in respect of economic growth.</p> <p>  To address the Deputy's point on having a skilled labour force, that is the number-one priority.  It is what we have to get right, and that is why academia is so important.</p></speech>

We had an energy conference not so long ago in City Hotel Derry.  It was very interesting to hear from manufacturers, transport organisations and waste management companies on the challenges they face.  Representatives of SONI, which is the distributor of electricity in Northern Ireland, gave a presentation.  The Deputy is right that there is a great opportunity to develop wind energy in the north west and in her region.  If we are producing energy there, however, we should use it locally rather than lose it through transporting it somewhere else.  There is a great opportunity to change the way we consider how and where we produce energy.  If we have a strategic plan, we should be encouraging manufacturers to be as close as possible to where the energy is produced.  We should change the whole mindset.</p> <p>  There is a business opportunity that we are certainly wrapping businesses around.  What we are doing is starting a conversation on where the opportunities exist from a business perspective.  On foot of the medical school coming to Magee, some businesses have emerged already.  The medical masks operation has started.  One of our members has started a new business in parallel to its own business.  Once the discussion is started and people are made aware of it, people look at the region in a different way and have a different mindset.  With hybrid working and the energy aspect, there can be a great joined-up approach to putting the business case together for the north-west region.  Energy plays a huge part in the overall solution.  It could bring new types of jobs to the region.  Again, it is a matter of tapping into education to ensure we will have the right skills to be ready to embrace the technologies when they come on board and when we make the transition.</p></speech>

There is GMIT and the Mayo campus and the collaboration between Mayo University Hospital and Magee.  We have successes and successful programmes which Mr. Clancy knows, some of which he was involved in, some of them across the island.  How concerned is Mr. Clancy about student mobility across the island, whether North-South, South-North?  There are so few students.  I know they do more in the north-west region but overall, what can we do more to encourage North-South student mobility at undergraduate and postgraduate levels?</p></speech>

An example is the medical school.  There have been some announcements on that.  When there is a course that people want to do, they will travel and live in the location and some actually stay there and continue to live with their families afterwards, or if they do leave, they come back.  It is about creating those courses.  I do not doubt that if we created a bunch of courses in the north west around green energy people would come to those because they are the jobs of the future and the skills that we are going to need.  It is having an overall strategic plan that skills gaps can be filled and making sure that the colleges, further education institutes and universities, are providing the courses that the businesses need in order to develop and grow.  If one creates the courses the students will follow.</p></speech>

It has 50-50 North-South students.  It has developed a niche course.  I do think of green energy and the courses that can be done there, specifically to attract people in.  I hope that the Cassells report will address the funding model we have for third level and the issues that are there that prevent some of the third level institutions from being as creative and innovative as they might be, were the core funding to be looked at, so that we are not always looking at international students as cash cows and that we look right across the island for the opportunities that are there.</p> <p>  I am pleased that Mr. Clancy has such an interest in the all-island strategic rail review.  The western rail corridor and the developments there will be hugely important for us in the west in giving us the connectivity. </p> <p>  Our 15 minutes is up.

It has been a really interesting conversation.  It is good that they are so technically engaged in all those issues, particularly the cross-Border tax.  Colum Eastwood and I met with the group before.  It is important generally to guard against borderism, wherever it comes from, and barriers to trade and life on the island, and to realise the big opportunity of people changing how they want to work and live after the pandemic.  There are real regeneration opportunities from the north west as a result of people being able to work remotely and live there.  I agree entirely on that.  I also agree about the importance of the rail review.  Nothing more nakedly lays out the impact of partition and under-investment in the west and north west generally than looking at the rail map.  It is crucial for connectivity and the economy of the future.  It is a really important piece of work by the two Ministers, so I am really glad that the witnesses are on to it.</p> <p>   I do not want to go over what colleagues have already raised.  Two specific questions flow from the Brexit outworkings.  We do not anticipate that the grace periods will end any time soon.  We hope that the level of checking is as unobtrusive as it can be into the future but we know that there will have to be some checks.  Are the witnesses still operating with temporary infrastructure in its checking capacity?  Are there issues around that and the installation and provision of more permanent infrastructure in relation to any protocol and post-Brexit checks that have to be made?  </p> <p>  We were discussing how workforce and access to people is so critical to businesses and the dynamism of the region.  I do not know the whole ETA issue and EU nationals and other non-British and Irish citizens requiring electronic certification to cross the Border.  That has a potential to be absolutely devastating to many.  It creates a border for different categories of citizens.  One can see many ways by which it would impede businesses in the movement of their own human resources and have huge impacts for tourism with all the visitors who go north but arrive in through Dublin.  Is that something that is on the witnesses' radar or have they any thoughts on this?  </p> <p>  There are different views on the potential free port concept.  What are the witnesses views?  How would it work for the region?</p></speech>

The free port is not something that I have a lot of expertise on.  I do not have a lot of detail on it.  Does Mr. O'Kane have anything to say around Foyle Port?</p></speech>

I would not like to contaminate the discussion with any information that is not coming from an area of expertise.  Ms Hanna's point about EU citizens is very much on our radar.  It is less an issue than our Republic of Ireland colleagues who are working from home but it still has the potential to have an impact.  We have companies such as Seagate in Derry which have very niche skills requirements.  They look well beyond the island of Ireland for those skills.  They go to Europe, to France, Italy and Spain, for very specific skills around physics, material science and so on.  That is one of our members which would certainly be concerned from the skills perspective and having people able to continue to work for them.  It could very well be that their staff work on either side of the Border.  Because Seagate is in Derry it does not mean they are all living in Derry.</p></speech>

Anything that stops or is a barrier, whether visible or invisible, to movement from the hinterland, if we call it that, is not good.  We want freedom of movement on both sides of the Border for all nationalities because we need everybody to make this place work.  We do not want any obstacles like certification.  It has come on the radar.  We have not done anything as a chamber yet.  We have not made an official response but it is in the ether and being discussed.  We are watching it closely as a watching brief.</p> <p>  I do not have a lot of information on the Brexit outworkings and the checking and temporary arrangements.  The SPS checks have been reduced.  I hope that from the perspective of our members we get a resolution as soon as we possibly can to give the stability that we so badly need to get the investment that we spoke of earlier where businesses want to invest in the region.  They will not do so until they have that certainty.</p></speech>

What are the reflections of our guests in respect of the service economy in particular?  Are there particular challenges of note in that regard?  Building on the labour point, is there anything further they wish to say in respect of the new UK immigration policy and how difficult it will be to source labour from the European Union or elsewhere, given that Allstate in particular, as well as Seagate Technology and FinTrU, have a very diverse workforce?</p> <p>  My second question is also on the labour market, but entirely at the other end of the spectrum.  Derry in the north west has by far the worst economic activity levels in the entire United Kingdom.  From memory, close to half of the 16 to 64 age group population are not part of the labour market.  How big a challenge is that in the context of developing the economy in Derry and the north west?  How can that particular issue be addressed in order to ensure that we are providing opportunities for people, but also fully utilising everyone's potential for the local economy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.773" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Clancy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021121600002#L00300"><p>On the issue of economic inactivity, Dr. Farry is absolutely right.  Unfortunately, it is one of those statistics in respect of which one does not wish to be on the leaderboard.  It is approximately 30% here and it is 9% less in the UK on average.  It is a major issue.  Mr. O'Kane and I have discussed this.  One of our ambitions for his presidency relates to how we can encourage people back into the workforce.  We do that by providing the right training courses, giving them hope and being active and saying there are jobs and businesses out there.  There are many manufacturing jobs out there, such as for welders and painters and things like that, that are really struggling to be filled.  If people are encouraged to come out from being economically inactive, there are jobs available for them in those skill areas.  For example, there are courses available at the North West Regional College that are paid.  The students get an allowance and will have a guaranteed job at the end of the course because they are working in cooperation with local businesses.  It is actually creating that sense of opportunity.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Kane and I are really going to try to push this year to raise awareness that there are opportunities out there and that we do not want people to leave the area or be economically inactive.  There are jobs out there.  People need to put their head above the parapet.  There is support available and we, as a chamber, wish to work with our members to encourage them to get on board to offer opportunities to people who are economically inactive and to try to target those regions, areas or schools or whatever we wish to do with career guidance and so on to try to create that discussion.  We are currently very much at the embryonic stage in that regard but it is certainly one of Mr. O'Kane's key objectives.  He may wish to jump in because I know he is passionate about this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.774" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Kane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021121600002#L00400"><p>Outside of cross-Border tax, this is my passion.  As Mr. Clancy stated, we do not wish to be on the leaderboard in this context.  There are other leaderboards on which we wish to be represented.  Intervention at earlier ages in terms of career advice, businesses getting into schools, offering support to teachers and parents, providing guidance and identifying what are the jobs for the future is absolutely essential in terms of getting to the people who will be in the economically inactive category in five or ten years' time and putting them on the right path.  There is a role the chamber can play in helping the business community to make that intervention.  The businesses will help themselves in the meantime as well.  They will help to carve out a skills pipeline that will match their needs going forward.  It is a slow burner but it is absolutely essential.</p> <p>  Not every child should go to university to do a law degree or become a doctor or a nurse or whatever it is.  There are many really great and well-paying jobs that do not require the standard path through university where one comes out with significant debt and may not even get a job.  There are other roles that we, as a business community, can put in front of parents and teachers and say that wee Johnny or Mary will have a great career and a great life on this particular journey.  I refer to academies and things like that.  FinTrU and Alchemy Technology Services are prime examples of taking individuals who do not have science, computer science or engineering degrees and training them, putting them in particular roles and giving them all the support and skills needed to do the job.  Those people are building fabulous careers.  There is a different way.  There is no doubt that intervention is needed in the north west.</p></speech>

I offer my congratulations to Mr. O'Kane on his elevation.  We knew him before he was famous.  He has done great work on the cross-Border coalition.  That issue has been extremely worrying for us all.  The conversation has moved.  Our guests referred to economic inactivity.  Back in the days before the Tories got into power, when the economy was doing really well but we did not fully appreciate just how well it was doing, in my constituency, and particularly in the south Tyrone end of the constituency where there is a very strong engineering base, economic inactivity was zero.  Anybody who was able to work was working but we still could not get enough staff.  Since then, we have had Brexit and all the challenges that has thrown up.  From the moment the decision was taken to go ahead and have the referendum, people voted with their feet and went home to Poland or Lithuania for Christmas and did not come back.  We have lost a significant chunk of economically active people who wanted to live and work here and make this their home.  Brexit has been extremely difficult in my constituency, especially in the Dungannon area.  Manufacturing, meat processing and all of that have been really badly hit.  There is no firm that is not now recruiting on an ongoing full-time basis.</p> <p>  There are issues relating to the cost of keeping businesses running.  I received a letter today from a very high-profile company in Fermanagh in respect of issues around CO2 availability, the cost of energy and all the other issues with which it is dealing and the difficulty it has keeping the lights on.  We have a worrying time ahead of us.  I appreciate what Mr. Clancy and Mr. O'Kane have said on the protocol.</p> <p>  I refer to my constituency and the range of issues affecting it.  Like Deputy Conway-Walsh and others, I am not fixated on the Belfast-Derry-Dublin axis.  It is very important that every boat rises with an economic tide.  We in the Border community feel every challenge and difficulty first and we are the last to recover from them.  There have been things that have given us great hope.  We started the conversation by speaking about the medical school in the north west.  It has the ability to be transformative in terms of delivering primary, secondary and tertiary care in my area.  There is much for us to be hopeful about, but there are still significant challenges.  There are infrastructural challenges, such as the fact that there is no motorway in County Fermanagh.  The county does not have even five miles of dual carriageway.</p><p>It is a county that does not have any rail connectivity.  We have issues with the high cost of energy and how far away we are from economic hubs.</p><p> We face extremely challenging times and I would like to draw from the witnesses how important they see the protocol in this with everything else that is going on.  Is it still as essential as it was?  I noted with disappointment that John Kyle resigned today.  He had an alternative view of the protocol from most unionist politicians.  I would love to hear the witnesses' point of view on the necessity for maintaining the protocol and ensuring those issues we have do not become insurmountable.</p></speech>

Nobody wanted Brexit in the region, for starters.  It is the journey we are on together.  It is not where we would have started from but it is the situation we are in.</p> <p>  The feedback from members is that the protocol is an obstacle for many reasons related to paperwork and cost.  It is hard to identify that because other things have been going on in the global economy because of Covid.  There is a challenge in understanding what is and is not a contributor to the additional cost.  We have issues regarding HGVs, transport, fuel costs and there is a global issue there.  It is hard to pinpoint if the protocol is the issue or not.</p> <p>  The feedback from our members is that having this unfettered access is a golden opportunity that should not be missed.  Many people are prepared to say it privately but maybe not publicly because they want to carry on with their business and work through it.  They see the opportunity and are taking conversations with people they may never have worked with before because they need new supply chains and things like that as a consequence of many GB businesses not being prepared properly.  That created a vacuum and they had to look for alternative supplies.  Now they are working with different people and have created relationships.  That falls out into the Central Statistics Office and the flow of goods north and south of the Border.</p> <p>  There are many benefits but it is challenging.  I do not know if there is an alternative solution.  When you speak to everybody they say this is the only thing we have and we need to make it work.  From members' perspective, we are looking at the day-to-day running of business and they are getting on with it, dealing with the issues and working through them.  In the main it has been positive for them so far in terms of being able to access both markets unfettered.  It is a good place we are going to, we hope, if we can get stability.</p></speech>

We have to pose the question, "What if it wasn't there?"  It is the best of a bad deal, if you like.  We have got something we can work with.  It is not perfect.  Can we iron out the kinks?  That is where our energy should be spent.  We should iron out the kinks and try to make it work the way it is intended to work.  Then we can take stock of what the future holds.  We cannot just decide right now that it is bad and we need to scrap it.  That would not be good for our businesses.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Clancy and Mr. O'Kane for their contributions and the insights they have given us into the economic situation and the improvements and supports needed, particularly in relation to the Cross-Border Workers Coalition and the important issues raised in that regard.</p> <p>  We are delighted to interact with the witnesses and with the community in their area.  We hope to visit there, as I think the clerk will confirm to the witnesses separately.  We hope to visit the region in the springtime.  I say "the region" carefully because we are not forgetting Donegal.  The witnesses should feel free to communicate with us on how we might be able to help in cross-Border initiatives in relation to the Good Friday Agreement and how it might improve economic life and prosperity in the region.</p> <p>  We will go into private session for a moment to allow our next guests in.

However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within those precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given.  They should respect directions given by the Chairman and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to a person's or entity's good name.</p> <p>  We have to read that for all our witnesses.

I am pleased to join the committee today.  Foyle Port has a strategic location at the mouth of Lough Foyle.  We are the primary marine gateway for the north west of Ireland for commerce and tourism and the largest bulk port operating in this region, and we handle around 2 million tonnes of cargo.  We are a key economic driver for the region on both sides of the Border, where we handle around &euro;1 billion of commodities each year, supporting around 1,000 direct and indirect jobs and 20,000 regional farms.  In addition to our cargo operations, we are a major marine tourism asset for the region.  Until the demise of the cruise industry through Covid, we had an increasing presence in that market for the international cruise industry.</p> <p>  Our jurisdiction covers about 180 sq.km, extending over the entirety of Lough Foyle on both sides, making us unique in the UK and Ireland in that sense.  Our jurisdiction stretches from the Craigavon Bridge in Derry north to the line between Greencastle in County Donegal and Magilligan Point on the northern side.  We have infrastructure and operations on both sides of the Border and are a truly cross-Border entity in that sense.  We are a trust port operating independently of government.  All our operations are self-financing, our profits are all reinvested for the benefit of the region and our stakeholders, and we have no shareholders.</p> <p>  In that context, I am delighted to meet the committee and explore how Foyle Port might play our part in that intergovernmental regional piece for the north west.</p></speech>

I would rather see him in person, but this is the way things are presently.  Foyle Port has quite an impressive portfolio.  There is certainly much activity going there and it does an awful lot of good work for the north west.</p> <p>  I also live on a lough, although it is the next one over, Lough Swilly, so I recognise how much potential the port in Derry could have as we develop as a region now with city status.  I believe, however, the port is underutilised.</p> <p>  I am particularly interested regarding what was said about cruise liners, and Mr. McGrath mentioned Greencastle.  What is the position there?  I have not heard of this before.  Are there plans afoot, and if there are, who is involved?  Is the council involved?  There is a harbour group there as well.  Will Mr. McGrath give an update on that?</p> <p>  The way the port operates is quite impressive, as is the fact its profits are reinvested.  Mr. McGrath is to be commended on that.  If there are ways we can try to help develop the port through the Taoiseach's office and the shared island fund, I would very be happy to work with Mr. McGrath on doing that.  As we saw in the previous presentation from Derry-Londonderry Chamber of Commerce on the development of the north west, it is an area that works very well on a cross-Border and intercounty basis.  We are all big enough to say there is not one part that should develop ahead of the rest.  By helping each other, we are helping ourselves.  What are Mr. McGrath's views on that?  I thank him for his presentation.</p></speech>

It was not that we were trying to do something without agreement.  It was something we had very close contact with.</p> <p>  Brexit and, in particular, Covid put those plans on hold.  We had identified that Greencastle is a natural deepwater harbour.  It lends itself very naturally to exploiting our tourist products on both sides of the Border.  Consistent with Government and executive policy, we were looking to plug the gap that exists in the north west.  The cruise industry in Ireland goes from Cork to Dublin to Belfast, and then there is a lack of infrastructure in the Foyle, where we currently have around 12 or 13 cruise ships, notwithstanding Covid, and tender people to either side, either to Magilligan or Greencastle.  We do not have a physical asset big enough to bring the ships alongside.  The idea was that we would look to develop an asset that would not only deal with the cruise potential that is being lost at the minute but also develop links with Killybegs as well.  Rather than being in some kind of competition with other areas around Ireland, it would be very complementary.</p> <p>  The upshot of it was that we were in close contact with Donegal County Council, and just around the time when lockdown came, we were keen to develop the detailed design for this project.  It is fair to say these things were pretty much put on hold at that point, through no one's fault.  We should be looking not only at cruise tourism but also at offshore renewables and other innovative ways in which we could use an asset in Greencastle.  We should look at how we could develop innovative ownership and operational models with the council and the Government and see how we can really use this as a flagship project for regional development.</p> <p>  On the other side of the water, we are also taking ownership of the Magilligan terminal, which is currently owned by Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council.  We see a way in which Foyle Port can link up the Wild Atlantic Way with the Causeway Coast side of things as well.  This gives opportunities to come into Ireland, to go to Glenveagh, the developments around the Republic, the north Antrim coast or to come into the city of Derry as well.  It is a very joined-up approach, but it needs an Anglo-Irish approach and a partnering approach in terms of funding for this.  In truth, this would be beyond the harbour commissioners, but we are very keen to participate to the full extent we can.  That is where the idea is.  I would like to see it being reinvigorated, as we come out of these Covid arrangements, in a way that would really hit the ground running.  There is no doubt the cruise tourism market will come back.  I would like to re-engage on that with the Irish stakeholders as a matter of some urgency.</p></speech>

It will probably cost more now than it would have if we had done it before when we could have.  In relation to bang for your buck, you get a lot of return on this.  While there is a need for some inherent infrastructure improvements around Greencastle on the land side, it naturally lends itself to putting a terminal, quay or whatever adjacent to the natural hinterland there.  We previously estimated that this probably could be done in the order of between &euro;30 and &euro;50 million.  While I hesitate to call it a modest amount of money against regional development budgets or the budget in the shared island fund, because it is a huge amount of money, it could invigorate an essentially underdeveloped - from both sides - asset and could do something significant in the eastern part of Inishowen.  It would greatly enhance products in Derry and Northern Ireland as well.</p></speech>

It is something I and others have advocated for many times before.  The Antrim coast into Derry and Donegal is certainly some of the most spectacular scenery in the world.  However, the areas are completely virgin to the type of infrastructure we need to attract and keep people here.  The proposal is a very good one.  Certainly, I will talk to the council in relation to the plans on its side and see where it is at.  I thank Mr. McGrath for his presentation.</p></speech>

As an east coast dweller, it is good to hear about what is going on in one of the most beautiful parts of the country that has been underdeveloped.  It is an untapped resource waiting to be used, appreciated and valued.  The work Mr. McGrath is doing is absolutely fantastic.  Senator Blaney and I will do anything we can to help him get the funding this project needs and deserves for the entire region of the north west.</p><p>The work that is planned and ongoing is very exciting.  Well done. </p></speech>

The integration of business and people in everything is such a cross-Border enterprise.  When we made a number of submissions in 2019 and 2020 to the draft national maritime framework - we also made other submissions to the Northern and Western Regional Assembly - we were presenting to the Irish Government our intention to be seen as part of its national infrastructure, which is something that we do not get credited with.  Foyle Port is a national asset.  The fact that we are a UK trust port on the one hand and an Irish port on the other is a simultaneous and unique feature that should be embraced by both Governments in a way that it has not been hitherto.  We have made our own ground on that.  We could take it to another level completely with policy support.</p></speech>

How far have the representatives progressed that project with the shared island unit or Departments in the South?  Have they presented a business case on it and so on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.797" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021121600002#O00400"><p>What we have done in terms of policy is to respond to the draft national marine planning framework and to the Northern and Western Regional Assembly on the spatial and economic strategies.  We were working closely with Donegal County Council on the details around the cruise terminal.  Before the hiatus, if we want to call it that, I offered that we would put the design through planning.  That is pretty much where it got to.  There needs to be an agreement in respect of ownership and operation, in addition to a cocktail of funding around this with the various partners, stakeholders, councils, governments and so on.</p></speech>

As he said, it is about building up the economy in the whole of the north west.  What steps could we help the Foyle Port representatives with and specifically chase up for them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.799" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1648" speakername="Emer Currie" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021121600002#O00600"><p>The Chairman has just asked my question.  There is a lot in this.  The potential of Foyle Port is significant and the breadth of what it does is mind-boggling.  It has the bulk side of business as well as the tourism side.  It would also be useful to hear about energy and what the port does in the sustainable energy space.  There is definitely an opportunity to develop the port for more tourism, which is a no-brainer, but as we know these things can take years.  It would be good for us to have bullet points on how the witnesses want us to help them to progress that.  That has to take in the wider picture, which the Chairman mentioned earlier, of shared island projects in the area that do not just relate to the port but to tourism as well.  It is about how we continue to develop a north-west tourism proposition that will straddle F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland and how it will work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.800" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021121600002#O00700"><p>I will add to the point around energy.  We need to try to remember that Foyle Port is a multisite and multiterminal operation.  When we talk about cargo operations at Lisahally, for instance, which is close to Derry, or the tourism product that could use Greencastle as a base, we also have a hinterland.  One thing we have at the port that is unique within the British Isles is access to a land bank of approximately 1,000 acres.  Ironically, this is because of the industrial demise of Derry over the past 40-odd years.  We have now acquired close to 200 acres at the port and, on the land side of the cargo operations, we have a renewable energy power station that is fuelled by biomass.  That is where the centre of our decarbonisation activities will take place.  Industrial growth and things such as data centres are in planning at present.</p> <p>  We need to respond very quickly to the climate emergency because the predominant cargoes we have brought in over the years are coal and, to a lesser extent, oil.  Many agriproducts that will be affected by fertilisers and so on will be impacted by methane, nitrates and all the rest of it.  We have to be very mindful that we need to change our business model over the next few years in readiness for a paradigm shift.  We cannot stay the same.  That is why we are looking at tourism development, renewable energy development and innovation projects, which will move away from and decentralise the kind of activity that is largely based on coal.</p> <p>  We already have a 17 MW biomass power station in the harbour complex.  We are hoping to do a couple of deals with contractors which will come on site and be part of the land bank in respect of renewables before Christmas.  That is also going extremely well.  It is about how we link up in policy terms on both sides of the lough to look at where these main themes are regarding cargo, tourism and renewables.  That is where our master-planning thinking is at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.801" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris Hazzard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021121600002#O00800"><p>I thank Mr. McGrath for his presentation.  It is good to see him again.  I was reading Foyle Port's accounts in the annual report that was put up online.  They are very impressive, given the very challenging situation that the port has had to come through this year, similar to other ports, with Brexit, Covid-19 and all the rest of it.  I would like to get an idea of the master plan Mr. McGrath touched on.  Is it in the pipeline?  I see that the port's strategic plan up to 2020 is complete.  What do the next ten years look like?  I am also thinking about modernisation of the port.  Warrenpoint is in my part of the world and I am familiar enough with the challenges for the port to be able to modernise to meet the needs of the global industry and not just our local industry.  Will Mr. McGrath give us a flavour of that?</p> <p>  How do the representatives envisage that master plan fitting in with the wider economic and strategic aims of the north-west region?  For example, I have a criticism of our local port in that a master plan was developed almost in a silo without speaking to the local community or local council.  It was more to do with the port itself and did not take into account that the port is an economic engine for the local area.  I would like to think that will be part of the conversations in future.  I commend the witnesses on the fact that the social responsibility fund profits go into mental health charities, etc., in the local areas.  That is very good to see and, hopefully, that will do well in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.802" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021121600002#O00900"><p>I will pick that up from a master planning perspective.  We completed the third of three strategic plans.  There has been a 15-year period where we have transformed the port in terms of its diversification and everything.  We just delivered the most recent plan as the Covid-19 lockdown pretty much hit.  We had already written what is the outline of a 30-year master plan for the port.  We are just about to work on the next five-year plan as a subset of that 30-year master planning.</p><p>What we did instead was that we put a strategy bridge in which would take us to 2023, because we recognised that there was no point in moving forward into a long-term strategic plan in view of the fact that there were so many variables in the emergency situation.  In addition to Covid, there are the matters of COP26 and the climate emergency.  The latter are to the fore in terms of our concerns about the need to shift from carbon-based products to different things.  Our master plan is sitting there ready to go.  We have planned for an extensive community engagement in that master plan and that will include community engagement in the Republic with the community in Greencastle and our other stakeholders around the Derry area and beyond.</p><p> I take Mr. Hazzard's point about silos.  We have learned the lesson that we need to align our strategy and master planning with programmes for government and policies.  We were complaining to our Department for Infrastructure asking why it was not using the ports as a major leverage for regional economic development because it sometimes works in silos too.  We are now saying that we need to look at where the policy vehicles are that we can attach to and that we can use for our benefit so that we are in concert with Government policy.  We also need to make the arguments from the bottom up as to why we should be a good partner for Government in these enterprises.  That is where we are with it and we are making good progress on that but perhaps we sat back too long and thought that other people would recognise that it might be worthwhile to use us.  Then we were put out a bit when nobody called us.  We need to be proactive on that, and we are keen to do that in both jurisdictions.</p></speech>

A lot of the questions have already been covered.  It is welcome and good news to hear of the potential in tourism opportunities that may flow from the port.  What engagement has the port had with the local council on that?  Could that be further developed through the council, perhaps with the council as a partner?</p> <p>  I note Mr. McGrath&rsquo;s extremely positive comments on the protocol.  He said that his experience of it has been largely positive and seamless.  How does he see the bigger picture around what protections the protocol has offered?  Has Mr. McGrath seen an increase in North-South trade as opposed to trade going to Great Britain?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-16a.805" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021121600002#P00300"><p>On the protocol, we put in an awful lot of effort and energy from 2016 right through, promoting our case.  If there had been a no-deal Brexit, Foyle Port would have potentially lost 40% of its trade overnight.  That is why we are so pleased to see how the protocol was drafted and how it was written.  Had we written it ourselves we could not have done a much better job.  The reason for that is the majority of trade we bring in comes either from Europe or the rest of the world.  Only about 20% of what we bring in comes from the UK.  It is in that area that we have the bureaucracy and friction.  Given the scale of it, and compared with the rest of our imports, it is not too big a problem for us.  That is not to say that we underestimate the challenges for people involved in industry with east-west transactions.  The North-South transactions we experience are seamless at the minute so we are delighted about that.</p> <p>  On council involvement, three councillors from Derry City and Strabane District Council are board members of ours.  The councils we look to engage with are Donegal County Council, Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council and then Derry City and Strabane District Council, which is the one we have most engagement with.  We recognise that the port cannot just look at Derry the way it might traditionally have done.  We are a regional player and we need to make sure we fully engage with the other stakeholders.  We have a good relationship with Donegal County Council and with the people working as executive officers there.  As we prepare to come out of the lockdown arrangements next year, we need to rekindle some of those contacts.  It would definitely help if we had political buy-in regarding some of the ideas we have that would give a steer to officials and encourage them to engage as fully as possible.  I cannot complain about any of the contacts we have; we have a good network and we are as outward looking as we can possibly be.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. McGrath for his comprehensive presentation.  I would like to ask about the opportunities there are for tidal and renewable energy.  Can Mr. McGrath talk more about the renewable energy opportunities that Foyle Port is looking at?  Has the port collaborated with South West College?  I know it has done great things in bringing training to local companies and in blue-sky thinking on renewable energy and the possibilities that are out there.  I ask Mr. McGrath to elaborate on that a wee bit.</p></speech>

The other areas we have looked at are hydrogen and offshore renewable energy.  The problem with tidal energy in Lough Foyle is the location of shipping channels and so on.  The Foyle is a fast-flowing river and could potentially have some tidal energy application but it is not an area we have looked at in particular detail.  However, we are open to it.  Our sense of Greencastle as an asset base is more to support offshore renewable energy as a support and logistical base rather than necessarily locating some of those renewable devices within Lough Foyle.  That is something I am open to looking at but we have not done much on it yet.</p></speech>

Having been to Foyle Port and having had a look around I was impressed with the enterprise, initiative and drive that were evident and with the way the port has won its business.  I was also impressed with what Mr. McGrath said about how it unusually and exceptionally operates in two jurisdictions.  If we can help with the interaction with the shared island unit and if that is a key area for the port I invite Mr. McGrath to identify to the clerk to the committee how we might assist with ideas or proposals that he might have to further the economic prosperity of the port and the whole region.  Would Mr. McGrath like to make a final statement?</p></speech>

I will look to collate a summary document for the committee and for the shared island unit.  We have looked with anticipation towards the development of the all-island budgets and I know that ports are mentioned therein.  I would urge that Foyle Port is seen as an Irish port the same as Shannon Foynes Port, Dublin Port and Killybegs Harbour in a way that opens up its potential.  For years we might have been overly parochial about it.</p><p>The economies need to get some sort of stimulus.  We would like to table our ideas in that regard, and if the committee is prepared to be a conduit for that, then I will appreciate it very much.  I thank the committee for allowing me the time to come here and make a pitch.  </p></speech>
