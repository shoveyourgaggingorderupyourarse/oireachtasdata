We are delighted to be here.  On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, I thank the committee for providing the time for us to debate the Bill.  The Bill is an important step on the journey of strengthening of the Government's framework for the HSE.  It is a priority for Sl&aacute;intecare and this Government.  </p><p>The public appointments process has taken place and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane and eight other members of the new board including deputy chair, Professor Deirdre Madden, have been selected.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019022000002#B00700"><p>I will speak to amendments Nos. 1, 8 to 15, inclusive, Nos. 18 to 20, inclusive, Nos. 22 to 24, inclusive and 26 to 28, inclusive together.  The substantive amendments are amendments Nos. 8 and 18 and are concerned with strengthening the roles and responsibilities of the board and CEO.  The other amendments are consequential amendments.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 8 which gives new functions to the board.  First, the board must be satisfied that appropriate systems, procedures and practices  are in place to further the HSE's object.  This is critical as, under the Health Act 2004, the HSE's object is to use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p> <p>  Second, the board must ensure that appropriate systems, procedures and practices are in place for internal performance management and accountability.  These systems must cover how the HSE performs its functions under the Health Act 2004, how the HSE achieves its objectives in accordance with the its corporate plan and how the HSE delivers health and personal social services in accordance with the Health Act 2004.  These will also cover how the executive enables compliance with Government or ministerial policies, whether set out in codes, guidelines or other documents. </p> <p>  Amendment No. 18 provides for the CEO's role.  The CEO must ensure that these appropriate systems, procedures and practices are in place.  The board's requirement to satisfy itself that appropriate systems are in place is therefore mirrored by the requirement on the CEO to ensure that the systems are put in place.  The intention under these amendments is in this way to situate roles and responsibilities appropriately.  In addition to the provisions I have outlined, amendment No. 8 will also place a responsibility on the board to ensure the establishment and implementation of appropriate arrangements to manage the CEO&rsquo;s  performance. </p> <p>  Amendments Nos.  9 to 15, inclusive, and Nos. 26 to 28 are technical amendments to the Bill arising out of amendments proposed to the functions of the board.  They amend section references.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 1 and  22 to 24, inclusive, are also consequential to the substantive amendments.  Where referring to Government or ministerial policies, the language in the amendments refers to policies whether set out in codes, guidelines or other documents.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 22 to 24, inclusive, are consequential amendments from the wording in amendments Nos. 8 and 18.  The aim of these amendments is to ensure consistency of language throughout the Health Act 2004 where reference is made to ministerial or Government policies.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019022000002#B00800"><p>I refer to amendment No. 18 and proposed subsection (b)(ii)(III), which inserts the words "delivery of health and personal social services in accordance with this Act".  I am open to correction but that strikes me as something of a shift in responsibility.  It seems to shift a great deal of responsibility from the shoulders of the Minister and onto the CEO or director general.  I am concerned about that as it conflicts with Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare seeks to maintain or shift much more responsibility towards the Minister.  I am concerned about this and will oppose amendment No. 18 purely and simply because of that line.  The Minister of State should correct me if I have misread it.</p> <p>  Will she go into more detail to explain why amendments Nos. 22 to 24, inclusive, are necessary?  There seems to be some duplication.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019022000002#B00900"><p>The HSE is responsible for operational issues and the Minister is responsible for policies.</p> <p>  The CEO must ensure that appropriate systems are in place and the board must satisfy itself that the systems are in place.  Strategically from a policy perspective, the legislation will now require the CEO to put in place systems and procedures for internal performance management and accountability for the HSE.  </p> <p>  This is a new legislative requirement, which will ensure that the HSE puts in place not just the performance management framework that monitors the implementation and delivery of the corporate plan and services, but also set out what accountability system it will put in place to ensure senior management answerability regarding the achievement of these plans.  </p> <p>  The aim of some of the amendments is to ensure consistency of language throughout the Health Act 2004 when referring to Government or ministerial policies.  Policies are polices whether set out in codes, guidelines or any other documents or combination of documents.  </p> <p>  The need for these technical changes arise in section 7 of the Health Act 2004 in respect of the object and functions of the HSE, section 29 of the Act in respect of the corporate plan, and section 31 of the Act in respect of the service plan.  </p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 22 and 24 are drafting amendments to the corporate plan and services.  They add text to the description of how the policy can be examined, for example, documents or codes.</p><p>I have nothing further to add on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019022000002#C00200"><p>If I could go back to amendment No. 18, I am not trying to be awkward but it seems to be in conflict with the stated aim of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The amendment refers to ensuring "appropriate systems, procedures and practices are in place" for the "internal performance management and accountability of the Executive".  This appears to shift some responsibility from the Minister, where it should lie, and place much more responsibility on staff who do not set ministerial objectives but are left holding the can if they are not achieved.  Much of this is resource dependent.  The amendment strikes me as unnecessary and runs counter to what we are trying to do with Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

This is an unusual use of language.  Does that mean with the prior approval of the Minister or with the approval of the Minister post the decision?</p></speech>

I thank the committee for facilitating discussion on these amendments.  Health systems across the world are faced with rising demands for health care, increasing inequalities in health and limited resources to address these needs.  If, as envisioned in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, we are to improve population health planning and deliver more effective and integrated care, we will need to premise the design and delivery of new models of care on best national and international evidence and make appropriate use of all of the available data sources which can inform service planning and provision.</p><p>A health needs assessment is a systematic method of identifying unmet health and healthcare needs of a population and identifying the changes required to meet those unmet needs.  The intention of the health needs assessment amendments is to provide for a more strategically targeted, beneficial and ambitious approach to such studies than is currently the case.  Their use will ensure that the health system becomes more responsive to the dynamic and changing nature of our population's healthcare needs and ensure, as proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, that addressing the social determinants of health becomes a guiding principle in the design of our healthcare system.</p><p>The amendments provide for ministerial directions to be issued to the HSE which will require it to conduct evidence based scientific, statistical or other systematic analysis with a view to bringing about change beneficial to the health of the population.  The scope and timeframe for conducting any such assessment will be included as part of the direction.  Provision is also made for the development of guidelines which will inform how assessments are to be conducted and for supplementary directions to be issued in circumstances where the content of an assessment report may need to be improved prior to publication.  The findings of assessment reports will be published by the HSE on its website.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 2 is to include provision for the issuing of ministerial directions for the conduct of health needs assessments within the ambit of section 10 of the Health Act 2004, which covers ministerial directions more generally.</p><p>Amendment No. 4 provides for a new section to be included in the Bill, which inserts a new section 10AA in the Health Act 2004, addressing the details of how the ministerial directions relating to health needs assessments will operate in practice, the implementation of such directions and related matters.  Subsection (1) provides that a direction relating to health needs assessments that is issued by the Minister must include details as to the specific requirements to be taken into consideration by the HSE when conducting the assessments that is the subject of the direction.  Subsection (2) provides details as to the types of requirements that might be taken into consideration for inclusion in a direction.  Subsection (3) provides for consultation by the Minister with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and any other person, as appropriate, prior to issuing a direction.  Subsection (4) provides for the submission of a report on the findings of a health needs assessment by the HSE within such timeframe as the Minister may specify within the direction.  Subsection (5) provides for the approval of any such report within a period of one month after its receipt or for the issue of a supplementary direction to address any defects in the content of the report after it has been submitted.  Subsection (6) provides for publication of the report on the Internet.  Subsection (7) provides for the development of guidelines by the Minister with a view to facilitating the conduct of health needs assessments by the HSE.  Subsection (8) defines the term &quot;health needs assessment&quot; for the purposes of the new section.</p></speech>

If I understand the Minister of State correctly, the amendment provides that the Minister will issue a directive to the HSE to conduct an annual health needs assessment - which sounds sensible - and these are some matters which the Minister may decide to include in that directive.  If that is a correct understanding, then subsection (2) seems redundant.  It goes without saying that the Minister may include whatever he or she wishes to include.  If it is not advisory, should the word "may" be replaced by "shall"?  I would not support that change, but I do not understand the point of the subsection otherwise.  I would include consideration of issues around gender and equality of access, for example.</p></speech>

It is almost a by-the-way suggestion that these are some things which the Minister may consider.  Primary legislation is not the place for that.</p> <p>  The idea of an annual health needs assessment is welcome.  However, it is not currently carried out by the HSE and, therefore, it will require very significant new capabilities.  The HSE will need healthcare econometricians and a significant amount of new data that do not currently exist, are not collected very well or are not comparable between regions.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that when the Bill is passed, the HSE will be able to comply with it and will have the resources, personnel and training to do so?  When is it expected that the HSE will start crunching the numbers on this issue?</p></speech>

Has the HSE identified how many people it needs to hire or what kind of skill sets will be required?  If we pass this into law, the HSE will be obliged to do it.  It is not a simple desktop exercise.  It is very complex for any healthcare system to begin doing this and to do it right.  Have any staff been hired thus far?  What total complement will be required?  Is a new team being set up?  What resources will it have?  Has it been budgeted for?  Is it in the healthcare budget for this year?</p></speech>

Let us assume it will not happen properly this year.  I acknowledge the Minister of State is reading out the answers with which she is provided, but her answer would not fill anyone with confidence that the process will be in place this year.  If the HSE is not sufficiently resourced to do it this year - and it does not seem that it will be - and we pass the Bill into law, thus requiring the HSE to do something for which it is not equipped, what will happen if it does not complete it properly?  What penalties would the HSE face for not being legally compliant once the Bill is passed into law?</p></speech>

I took on the health brief this time last year.  It was shocked when I looked at the executive team of the HSE, and, as it had been for the previous few years, only recently had a clinical lead been added to the senior team, which is extraordinary for a healthcare system.  Just as worrying, there was no patient advocate at all at a senior or junior level.  If there is anything to be learned from what has gone on in healthcare over the past while, it is there must be strong patient representation and advocacy at the highest levels throughout the organisation.  There must also be senior clinical representation, as one of the major failings of our healthcare system is that there are not enough clinical leads or clinicians' voices for doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals across the board.  They are rendered largely silent.  It is interesting that at joint committee meetings there may be eight or nine people in front of us from the HSE and one might be a doctor.  We hear almost nothing from the level of senior management representing nurses and midwifery, allied health professionals and so forth.  That error is being replicated in this Bill putting the board back in place.</p> <p>  The amendment is important, as it would mandate that one of the board members would be a patient advocate.  This does not mean that as well as other duties in a job, that person would happen to do some patient advocacy on the side but rather that the person would be a patient advocate or the voice of the patient on the board.  I would like there to be two clinical experts on the board.  I considered having one from the specialist register as a consultant and another representing nurses and midwifery but that is probably too specific for the legislation.  I have provided for two clinical experts in order that the clinical community would be represented and not just doctors.  Doctors need to be represented but there is a useful opportunity here, for example, to appoint somebody who represents nurses and midwives to the board.  The final board position I would like inserted into the legislation relates to financial expertise for all the obvious reasons.  We need serious financial oversight.</p> <p>  I looked at the Minister's appointments to the board but I will not comment on individuals.  They are pretty mixed, however, and I took a look at the background and expertise of everybody that will be on the board.  Some of the people have relevant expertise for the board of the HSE but some, to be frank, do not and I have no idea what they would be doing on the board.  It is not a well-balanced board and it does not have the requisite financial expertise or clinical representation, including that of doctors, nurses and midwives.  It does not have sufficient provision for patient advocacy, as one of the board members would have patient advocacy as one of a long list of responsibilities.  The person in question is not there solely to represent the voice of patients and the advocacy is just one descriptor in a long list.</p> <p>  We need to mandate the membership.  We cannot leave it to the Government, because we have done so and we can see the board that will be put in place.  I am sure they are all fine people and they will do their best on behalf of the HSE but it is not a balanced board.  Regarding some of the appointments, one would have to wonder what was driving their placement on the board other than politics.  Some nominees are extraordinary.  It is important to mandate clinical representation, financial expertise and, critically, patient advocacy on the board.  I would be very much obliged if the Minister of State accepted the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019022000002#E01400"><p>The Bill provides for a ten-person board, specifically the chairperson, the deputy chairperson and eight ordinary members.  The amendment would require the eight ordinary members to include a patient advocate, a financial expert and two clinical experts.  I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s thinking on this amendment but the view of the Minister is that the best approach is as set out in the Bill as it stands.  Members appointed by the Minister to the HSE board must be people who, in his or her opinion, have sufficient experience and expertise relating to matters connected with the HSE's functions to enable them to make a substantial contribution to the effective and efficient performance of those functions.  The Bill provides for patient advocacy experience or expertise on the board.  This meets the recommendation made by Dr. Gabriel Scally in his scoping review.</p> <p>  In line with the 2014 guidelines on appointments to State boards, vacancies on the board are advertised through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  The particular requirements required for membership of the board are set out in the PAS campaign.</p><p>The recent campaign for membership of the board sought candidates with experience and expertise in a number of areas including corporate governance, clinical governance, quality assurance and patient safety, strategic planning and change management or business management skills, financial planning and management, patient advocacy, strategic human resource management and public communications. </p><p> A key role of the chair of a State board is to identify the needs of the board for new skills, competencies or experience to ensure that it can effectively perform its role.  It is desirable that board members have a mix of competencies rather than specific competencies.</p><p>The amendment proposed is, therefore, to the Minister's mind, not required as there is a process to ensure the required skill set and competencies for the board of the HSE.</p></speech>

The board does not currently have the correct skill mix.  Members have been appointed to the board who have zero experience in healthcare.  It is beyond me what they are doing on that board.  There is no mandated position for a patient advocate.  One member has patient advocacy listed as one of his or her responsibilities.  There is a bunch of scientists.  One and, perhaps two scientists, is fine but the clinical expertise is not there.</p> <p>  The board has been appointed.  We know what will happen without this clause because a board has been appointed.  Which member or members of the board represent the clinical community, that is, doctors, consultants, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals?</p></speech>

The board is the governing body for the HSE and we should not be too prescriptive in this legislation.  I do not intend to get into the details of individuals and the board members.  Board members do not represent groups.  They are brought to the board because of their skills.</p> <p>  The Seanad amended the Bill to specifically provide for patient advocacy.  There is no requirement on the board to have one individual who will just represent patients.  Other people on the board also have skills in that area.</p></speech>

In his opinion, some of these people are unqualified to be on the board.  The Minister has appointed these people and I am assured by him and the Department that these people have adequate skills to deal with all the issues that will be presented to the board into the future.</p> <p>  Board members do not represent any particular group.  They are individuals with specific skills who have been appointed by the Minister.  They do not have one individual skill.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 6 provides for a nomination from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, which is a broad representative group, while the HSE is the largest employer of the state.  It will be no surprise that I propose this given my background.  Deputy Donnelly's amendment and mine, taken together, are not intended to comment on the board - I do not want to put words in anyone's mouth - but the intention is to ensure the board is the best it can be.  With the greatest respect to the Minister of State, we believe that the more guidance that is inserted in the legislation to assist the Minister, the better the board will be.  The board has an important function and Sinn F&eacute;in sees a clear role for a representative of workers generally, but specifically from within the HSE.  We were clear to ensure that the amendment provides for that person to have sufficient experience and expertise relating to matters connected with the function of the executive to enable him or her to make a substantial contribution.  It is not somebody who would be there keeping a seat warm, but who, in the Minister's view, by virtue of their nomination by ICTU would make a substantial contribution to the board.  We do not seek to point fingers at anyone who might be on the board but to ensure that the Minister, and his successors, have sufficient guidance to ensure that the board is representative.  I will support Deputy Donnelly's amendment for that reason but I also believe that the ICTU, as a broad and representative body, has, and should have, a role in ensuring that workers are represented on the board of the HSE, which is the largest employer in the State.  Too often in this State we have seen the consequence of ignoring workers when they try to bring issues of concern to the fore.</p></speech>

The Minister appreciates that the amendment states that the nominee should have sufficient experience an expertise to allow him or her to make a substantial contribution to the performance of the HSE's functions.  However, in establishing the board, we need to move away from the concept of nominations by a stakeholder group, however well suited to the role the nominee may be.  In the case of the HSE board, the Minister's view is that nominees by individual organisations would not be good practice and would lead to calls from other bodies to make nominees.  I do not, therefore, intend to accept either amendment.</p></speech>

My views on the composition of the board have been on the record for a long time.  This is not criticism of the Minister or any members of the board or my colleagues.  However, I strongly believe that for a board to work, its composition should be drawn from the country at large.</p><p>Individually, they should have the required capacity and direct experience in the delivery of the services at local level.  The problem the HSE has faced for as long as it has been in existence is its inability to connect with the troops on the ground and to connect them to management.  Individual service providers would tell one that.  They feel isolated.  General practitioners, nurses and consultants would say the same.</p><p> Clinicians, as a group, should not have all that much influence.  We need to examine where they are coming from as opposed to who they are and how much influence they exert at board level.  The approach could well be very dangerous.  During my previous incarnation, there used to be long battles between members of the health boards and the consultants, for example, at one level or another.  The question was who dominated whom.  There should be no domination.  There has to be an agreed push forward in the delivery of the health services.  As long as there is friction and competition between the two demands, there will always be unease, controversy and gaps in the system that cannot be bridged.</p><p> It was alleged by clinicians that politicians should be removed completely from anything to do with the delivery of the health services.  That was achieved but it did not create a better system.  As a matter of fact, the reverse is the case.  By the same token, I have long believed we need a regionalised system and a national board &mdash; this board we are talking about now &mdash; drawn from the three or four regions.  Everything else has been tried but this has not.</p><p> My belief, based on what I have seen over more than a few years looking at the attempt to deliver a comprehensive health service that enjoys the confidence of the general public and practitioners within the system, be they doctors, consultants, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists or others, is that we have gone away completely from what is desired and tend to rely on expertise.  This is not a criticism of the amendment before us.  There is a need for expertise and provision has to be made for it but we are missing the crucial point, which concerns the representational value of the individuals on the board, where they are coming from and who they represent.  General practitioners on such a board have to represent their clients, and they should.  They have first-hand experience of this.  If this is not the case, there is second-hand experience.  We see headlines all the time about diminishing numbers of personnel in various areas, including rural areas.  The general practitioners have direct knowledge and experience of delivering to their clients.  My hope and belief is that, within five to seven years, there will be a change.  There will need to be a return to the old system.  I do not believe the system we have now will work, and I do not believe the revised system will work either.  This is my view but it is not a criticism of anybody.  We need a wholly committed health service.  That commitment requires the inclusion of those who are delivering the services on the ground at board level in one form or another.</p></speech>

Let me refer to one of the documents I have been given by the Minister's office.  Potential board appointees come through the Public Appointments Service process.  The competencies sought in respect of board appointments are advertised, which allows candidates to be put forward for appointment based on the skills and experience they bring.  The Minister does not intend to accept these amendments.</p> <p>  I know one board member.  I do not know him personally but through an organisation, Barnardos, with which he worked.  I am not sure whether I can comment on the individual expertise of the board members.  Although they do not represent one particular group, they have expertise in other fields as well.  I am not in a position to accept amendments from either Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019022000002#G00500"><p>We have made the argument.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State has been asked to step in at the last minute and perhaps did not know she was coming in today, so my remarks are no reflection on her.  She has been asked to come in by the Minister.  However, I believe that, in a discussion on legislation to reinstate the board of the HSE, it is pretty extraordinary that the Minister did not turn up.  This is an important conversation.  The Minister of State does not have the briefing and even if she did she would not be in a position to make any decisions because she is not the line Minister and not a member of Cabinet.  It is extraordinary that the Minister is not here to debate the issues about the reinstatement of the HSE board.  Deputies O'Reilly, Durkan and Murphy O'Mahony and I were talking about whether anyone on the board of the HSE should have a medical background.  That is a pretty important conversation to have.</p> <p>  I have considered the board membership and am open to being wrong but my understanding is that not one member has a medical background.  If that is correct, it is pretty extraordinary.  The Minister should be present to explain why, in his opinion, he is comfortable that no one on the new board of the HSE has a medical background.  That is pretty astonishing.</p> <p>  We have rehearsed all the arguments.  I will be pressing this amendment because I have heard nothing that gives me any confidence that, without these amendments, the HSE will have the requisite experience it needs.  How any Government could try to tell the Parliament that the board of its health system has the correct blend of skills and experience when not one of its members has a medical background is absolutely extraordinary, yet that is what we are hearing today.  I will leave it at that.  I will be pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

As the guy said to someone looking for directions, "If I were going there, I would not start from here."  By the same token, I am just a little worried about one of the points made by Deputy Donnelly.  One member of the board could have a medical background but it could be tilted in the direction of one particular profession, which might not necessarily be of any great advantage to the board at all.</p><p>It could skew the authority of the board in a particular direction.  I would be worried about that.  It would not be truly representative, which would not be good.  One might be as well off to have persons who do not have a particular bias.</p><p> My own strongly held view is that members of the board should represent those who are delivering the services on the ground directly.  That would not necessarily enlarge the board to any great extent.  I spoke about this during the Sl&aacute;intecare hearings and on many occasions.  Nobody agrees with me, the Chairman will be glad to know, and not for the first time.  My view is based on long experience of listening to various boards associated with the health services over the years.  We can never achieve a seamless delivery of health services unless we have such mixed representation from all of the staff - the nurses, the GPs, the consultants and pharmacists - who are involved in delivering the health services.  It achieves the following aim.  It creates an equilibrium within the deliverers of the service that one cannot get otherwise.  Otherwise, one has a "them and us" situation where staff resent what they are being asked to do on the basis that those who are asking them do not have the necessary experience.  It often happens that way.</p><p> I reiterate that my views are not the same as my colleague, Deputy Donnelly, but I hear what he is saying.  If we were delivering a service to some executive, that would be a different story.  We are not; we are delivering a service to the people.  The people's practitioners on the ground need to have some access to that board, be represented on that board or have a representative on the ground from the board to keep the dialogue going in both directions.  I have said it all before.  I do not expect anybody to agree with me and I will not cry all the way home if nobody agrees with me.</p></speech>

We could debate all day how every one of us wants the right people to end up on the board.  We are all as one on that, albeit we may have different views about how the right person will end up on the board.</p><p>Recently, we saw the appointment and reappointment of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  We have had many discussions on that and what constitutes a competency-based board.  When an issue arises with the board and with the HSE, we tend to have to raise that with the Minister, but there is a role for the Oireachtas in hearing from persons who are proposed by the Minister so that Deputies can discuss the approach they would take in their role and help us understand how they intend to approach their role on the board.  We would like to have some involvement in that engagement.  One might say that I would say this, but this is a sensible proposal.  In the interests of transparency I hope that the Minister of State, notwithstanding what was previously indicated, is in a position to accept the amendment.  If she is not able to accept it, perhaps she might recommend that the Minister give it consideration.</p></speech>

There is no requirement in the code of practice for other members to appear.  The amendment proposed places this requirement in legislation on the chairperson and on the other members of the board - the deputy chairperson and ordinary members.  The Minister's view is that it is part of the role of the chair to lead the board and it would not be advisable to bestow the same function on all members.  In addition, the Minister does not believe that matters of this nature need to be provided for in the Bill.  The system for proposed chairpersons to come before committees works well in practice and these provisions are not normally in legislation.  The Minister does not therefore propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

We have already discussed the fact that the Minister of State is not in a position to accept any amendments so I could make the most persuasive argument of my life and it is not going to be accepted by her.  I do not suggest I was about to do that.  I might have been but it does not make any difference because the amendment is not going to be accepted by the Minister of State.  I do not mean this disrespectfully, but it is a pity that the person who could accept the amendments did not see fit to attend this meeting.

The board does not have a role.  However, given that the CEO is appointed by the board and the board will be managing the CEO's performance, the Minister has given this further consideration and proposes that the board should determine terms and conditions for the CEO.  The board will need the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is the process in many other Acts.</p></speech>

I want to see whether the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is still included.  If I understand it correctly, section 21A(3) of the principal Act would read that the CEO shall hold office upon and subject to such terms and conditions as may be determined by the board with the approval of the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Is that right?</p></speech>

It appears that it is.  The Bill states that the CEO shall hold office subject to terms and conditions determined by the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is what it currently states but it is being changed to read that the terms and conditions will be determined by the board as opposed to the Minister for Health.  This is a policy change.  What is the rationale behind it?</p></speech>

In practice, the board would work on appropriate terms and conditions for the CEO, determine the terms and conditions and put these to the Minister for the Minister&rsquo;s approval.  The consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would be needed before approving the terms and conditions.  This arrangement is found in other Acts such as, for example, in the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.</p></speech>

Will it give the board more latitude regarding the terms and conditions than the Minister might have?</p></speech>

It is rather unusual use of the English language.  I have not seen it before.  What does it mean?  Does it mean the prior approval of the Minister?</p><p>Does it mean the prior approval of two Ministers?  Is it Minister or Ministers?  It could be worded as "given the approval of the Minister" but "the approval of the Minister given" is something I have never seen before.  I do not know why it has been drafted in that fashion or in parliamentary draughtsman's language.  Perhaps my education has been greatly neglected along the way.  I just want to know if it means something of which we are not aware.  The phrase is used twice and I do not know what it means.  If necessary, will the Minister of State examine the wording and clarify it on Report Stage?  That would be fine.</p></speech>

It seeks to ensure that the chief executive officer of the HSE should not hold any additional office.  We saw that the previous director general had a role in another company.  Running the HSE is a big job and it should take up all of the time of the post holder.  We should be absolutely sure there is no scope for any conflict of interest or any suggestion of a conflict of interest.  It is not appropriate for the CEO to have another job or to sit on boards.  His or her focus should solely and entirely be on running the HSE.  There should be no division.  This amendment proposes to leave the wording, &quot;The chief executive officer shall not hold any other office employment or carry on any business&quot;, and delete the subsequent words, &quot;without the consent of the Board and the Board shall inform the Minister in writing of any such consent given.&quot;  The previous holder of the position informed the Minister he had an additional role outside the HSE.  I am not suggesting there was anything untoward about that but it is not a good idea.  This latitude was available and given previously.  We need to remove it and ensure the person in charge of the HSE is focused solely and entirely on that job.</p></speech>

The Minister must be informed of any such decision by the board.  The proposed amendment would prevent the CEO from holding any other office, under any circumstances.  This issue arose during debate in the Seanad and the Minister&rsquo;s view was that it was not possible to foresee all circumstances and that there may be situations where holding other offices may be justified.  The legislation as it stands allows for this, while giving the safeguard that the board&rsquo;s consent is needed.  The board will be the decision maker.  If it believes it is not appropriate, the CEO cannot undertake the work in question.  It is not, therefore, proposed to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

I cannot think of any such roles.  I appreciate the Minister of State's response and note the debate in the Seanad in which the Minister said it is not possible to envisage all circumstances and such a scenario might arise.  The person in charge of the HSE should be focused solely on that role and I cannot think of any scenario where that person's membership of another board or employment by another company would be appropriate or beneficial to the running of the HSE.  The Minister may have had in mind a specific scenario that could be beneficial or at least have a neutral effect on or cause no harm to the role of the CEO in running the HSE.  I cannot envisage such a circumstance.  The CEO of the HSE is a big job and incredibly time consuming.  I do not know where he or she would find time for other roles.  It would not be appropriate for him or her to have to find the time to carry on other work or business.</p></speech>

The issue is that it not possible to predict all situations and there may be a valid reason for the CEO to hold some other office.

I have a difficulty with the person who is the head of the health service having other jobs or calls on their time.  My amendment seeks to ensure that the focus is solely and entirely on the role as the chief executive or director general of the HSE.  We saw previously where additional roles were approved by the Minister but that does not make it right.  It means that it happened.</p></speech>

The paragraph relates to the chief executive coming before the Oireachtas, so mainly to this committee, I imagine, and probably the Committee of Public Accounts.  There is a get-out clause, which says that the chief executive officer &quot;shall not be required to give an account before a Committee of any matter relating to the general administration of the Executive which is, or has been, or may at any future time be, the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal in the State&rdquo;.  That provision pretty much gives carte blanche for the chief executive officer to just never appear.  Deputy O'Reilly's amendment is spot on and does not try to delete the paragraph.</p><p>One cannot have a situation where the head of the health service says, &quot;I am not coming in because at some point in the future somebody may take a case over&quot; whatever.  Almost everything that this committee has discussed in the past year could lead to legal cases in the future.  The amendment is very good and I am inclined to support it.  Perhaps the Minister of State has a solid legal reason the provision must be included.  In the absence of a solid argument by the Minister of State, I do not see why one would give that sort of <i>carte blanche</i>to any executive officer.</p></speech>

It gives the chief executive officer of the health system the ability not to appear before any Oireachtas committee to discuss any issue which may at some stage be before the courts.  That rules out pretty much everything in the healthcare system.  I can understand the committee not bringing in a chief executive to discuss a matter before the courts which I think is covered by Standing Order 50 which is specifically about court sittings in which there is a jury and where it might be influenced by a conversation in the Oireachtas.  It is not that the Oireachtas cannot discuss matters that are before the courts; we can and do all the time.  The matter of CervicalCheck is before the courts, but we still discuss it here.  This is an extraordinary level of protection for the chief executive because any matter this committee, or the Committee of Public Accounts, may decide to address can be deemed to be before the courts.  I still do not have an answer to the question as to why such an extraordinary level of protection is being granted.  The Minister of State said it was to protect future court cases, but I do not understand how discussing things here would jeopardise them.  If that rule was applied, it would shut down Parliament.  Maybe the Minister of State might expand on the matter.</p></speech>

The question is a direct one.  Extraordinary protection against parliamentary accountability is being afforded in the paragraph to the chief executive officer of the HSE.  The rationale the Minister of State has given is that it is to avoid jeopardising future court cases.  I do not understand how discussion at this committee will jeopardise future court cases and I am worried that, if we accept that logic, we will have to ask if we are allowed to discuss anything at this committee.</p></speech>

Effectively, we will be neutered and precluded.  Like Deputy Donnelly, I cannot understand how this will work in practice because all the chief executive officer or the director general will have to do, if asked to come before the committee, is respond to the effect that the matter could be the subject of a court case.  He or she would be right in saying so, as anything could be the subject of a court case.  This will give the person in charge a veto.</p> <p>  I have withdrawn my amendment on the basis that I will re-table it, but in the intervening time it would be helpful to have a note on this issue.  We say the Minister of State is giving the director general a veto in deciding if he or she should ever come before the committee, but she is saying she is not doing so.  The reasons this provision does, effectively, amount to a veto were very well outlined, but the Minister of State insists that she is not giving one.  Perhaps she might ask the Minister to outline for us, in some detail, why he believes this will not operate in such a way.  The Minister of State says she will not accept amendments.  While I will do my very best to accept her explanation, she should not be surprised if I do not accept it.  I ask for a note to be provided well in advance of Report Stage with an explanation of how this provision will not act as a veto.  To my mind, it clearly will.</p></speech>

I support Deputy O'Reilly in the matter.

It states the chief executive officer shall cease to be qualified for office and shall cease to hold office if he or she is convicted of any indictable offence.  Could very minor offences such as speeding offences be included in that regard?  Such offences could be committed, but they may not mean that a person should be fired.  I am looking for clarification on what is an indictable offence.  Is it a serious offence or could it refer to something unrelated to the role of being a good chief executive officer?</p></speech>

I am not condoning speeding, but it would be good if the Minister of State could give us a note on what is included as an indictable offence.  Paragraph (4) states such a person shall cease to be qualified for office.  This is black and white.  It is not that an issue could be raised by the board and considered in the round.  Once it happens, the chief executive officer will be gone.</p> <p>  At the start of the section 21A, it states the board shall, as soon as practicable, appoint a person recruited in accordance with the Public Service Management</p> <p>(Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 as CEO.</p><p>Will the Minister of State run through what that means in practice?  Does it mean that the PAS, the top level appointments committee, TLAC, or some other group will come up with a shortlist and the board will choose?  Will the board be offered the chance to say "Yea" or "Nay" to one person?  How will it work? </p></speech>

This section makes amendments to section 40H to take account of the move to a board governance structure, for example, providing that the audit committee is appointed by the board rather than by the director.  The Bill currently provides that audit committee membership is to comprise the board members and no fewer than four external members.  However, the Minister has considered this further and believes that some amendments should be made.</p><p>As the HSE is now to have an independent board, it is important in terms of good corporate governance that board members are now further represented on an audit committee as part of the audit planning and insurance process.</p><p> Amendment No. 25 therefore changes the composition of the audit committee.  The amendment provides that not fewer than three members of the new HSE board will be on the audit committee.  The audit committee will continue to have not fewer than four external members.  In summary, this will mean that moving forward the audit committee will consist of not fewer than three board members and not fewer than four external members, with the relevant skills and experience.</p></speech>

Perhaps I am misunderstanding the amendment, but the essential function of the audit committee is to be independent and external auditors.  Maybe I am wrong, but if that is the case, does it give the board too much say on a body that might be looking at the activities of the board?  Maybe I misunderstand the role of the audit committee, but that is my concern.</p></speech>

This seems peculiar.  One of the core functions of the audit committee is to provide financial advice to the board, including on activities of the board.  If three of the seven members of the audit committee are drawn from the board, is there not a conflict of interest or at least a lack of independent oversight given that it would only require one of the other four members to side with the board members on an issue?  It does not feel sufficiently independent and removed.  Is the Minister of State saying that the audit committees of other State bodies, for example, the National Transport Authority, would also have three members drawn from the board of the body in question?  Is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guideline?</p></speech>

If half the members of the audit committee are on the board of the HSE, the board is advising itself.  The Bill provides that the board may at any time remove a member of the audit committee.

I am confused as to why the Deputy would have a problem with three of the members from the main board sitting on the audit committee because there will not be an imbalance, if that is the point he is trying to make.  My understanding is that four external members and maybe more as well as an independent chairman would outnumber any members who are also on the HSE board.  I am not sure why the Deputy is pursuing this avenue around the board members.  The amendments provide that not fewer than three members of the HSE board will be on the committee.  It could be less.  If there could be more external people on the board, I do not understand the Deputy's point.</p></speech>

The board members are there, but it is a sub-committee of the board which can bring on additional expertise.  Let us say it wants to avail of the services of actuaries or corporate lawyers, that is okay.  We already have a board and the board is talking to the chief executive all the time.  Essentially, the board's job is to hold the chief executive to account and to set the strategy for an organisation.  Those are two of the big issues.  Separate to that, one has an audit committee, which is giving financial advice on the functions of the board.  It is giving governance advice on the structures and it is giving financial advice to the chief executive.  If the objective is for that to be essentially independent of the board, and providing a second pair of eyes, if it is full of board members then that does not happen.  It is essentially the board reporting to itself about its own functions.</p></speech>

We are joined by Dr. Conor O'Mahony, senior lecturer in constitutional law and child law at University College Cork; from the Children's Rights Alliance, Ms Saoirse Brady, legal and policy director, and Ms Julie Ahern, access to justice manager; from the Law Society of Ireland, Mr. Keith Walsh, chairman of the family and child law committee, and Ms Helen Coughlan, also a member of that committee; and from the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar, executive director, and Ms Caroline Counihan BL, legal director.  They are very welcome and I will shortly invite them to make their opening statements.  I propose to invite them to contribute in the order in which I have introduced them.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the joint committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Dr. O'Mahony to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

My statement will focus on two of the issues which were suggested for discussion, namely, the obligation to ascertain the views of children and the structure of the court system.  As I will explain, I consider these two issues closely connected.  As a question of policy, the obligation to ascertain the views of children during family law proceedings has been settled.  It is a matter of international human rights law to which Ireland has subscribed and a matter of Irish constitutional law.</p><p>Article 42A of the Constitution requires that in family law cases the views of all children who are capable of forming views shall be ascertained and given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child.  That initial question has been settled.  However, Article 42A is not self-executing; its implementation is dependent on legislation.  Unfortunately, since Article 42A came into effect in 2015, the legislative response of the Oireachtas has been rather timid.  Article 42A is mandatory.  It requires that every child who is capable of forming views shall have his or her views ascertained in family law proceedings.  However, when we look at the family law legislation which implements it, we have an uneven and patchwork approach to the question of whether children get to participate in family law proceedings.  Different rules are applicable in different family law cases and they often afford significant discretion to courts in deciding whether to ascertain the views of children.  Essentially, whether a child is afforded the opportunity to be heard depends on what the case is about, where it is being heard, which judge is hearing it and who is paying the costs.  That is a far cry from what the Constitution states should happen.  In my written submission I itemise the form that this difficulty takes in various areas, including child protection cases, private family law cases, international child abduction cases and adoption cases.  The issues revolve around the question of how much discretion courts have to decide whether they should hear from children, as well as the question of who pays the cost in appointing a guardian <i>ad litem</i>or expert to convey the views of the child.<br/><br/>It is clear that we need to engage in significant legislative reform across the wide spectrum of family law cases to ensure the legislative provisions match the constitutional obligation in Article 42A.  While legislative reform is a necessary step, alone it is not sufficient.  Another significant obstacle to effective child participation is the lack of child-friendliness in the courts.  We have significant evidence, some of which I cite in my written submission, that the environment in the courts is not child friendly and acts as a significant barrier to child participation.  Legislative reform on the mechanisms used to hear children is likely to encounter an implementation gap, unless we also address the structure of the courts.  There have been multiple calls for the establishment of specialist family courts in Ireland for a long time now, dating back to a detailed Law Reform Commission report in 1996.  The commission identified multiple problems related to inadequate physical facilities, the absence of specially trained judges, the inconsistency between courts in decision-making and excessive caseloads.  The commission made a series of recommendations which, in their totality, moved in the direction of establishing specialist family courts.  The recommendations have not been implemented and in the years since there have been multiple calls for their implementation, including by the Law Society of Ireland, the Government's special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, Dr. Carol Coulter and the Child Care Law Reporting Project and the UCC child care proceedings research group, of which I was a member.<br/><br/>More broadly, the trend in Europe is towards specialisation in the area of family law among judges and courts.  Separation is not so much the key; rather, specialisation is.  Having a separate court does not work, unless there is also specialisation among judges and staff within that court.  We have evidence from Australia which illustrates that if family courts are staffed by judges who are not specially trained in child and family law, their effectiveness is limited.  Conversely, however, there does need to be separation in that the scope of what can be achieved within the general court system is somewhat limited.  Judges who also deal with other kinds of case are not incentivised to significantly up-skill in the area of child and family law.  In many jurisdictions child and family law has a history of being the poor relation when it comes to resource allocation in respect of court time, physical facilities and so on.  Separation is also important in that respect.  Some issues would need to be considered in achieving this outside major population centres.  It is easier to do it in Dublin or Cork than in rural areas.  There are models from other jurisdictions such as Queensland where a mix of regional centres has been established and there are travelling judges.  There are references to it in my written submission.  <br/><br/>The final point I wish to make is that the establishment of a specialist family court does not require a constitutional amendment, as has been suggested on various occasions.  The designation of the District Court as the Children Court for dealing with juvenile justice matters under the Children Act 2001, as well as other examples, make it clear that it is possible to do this by way of ordinary legislation which could specify the characteristics of a specialist court.  <br/><br/>There is more detail on all of these points in my written submission.  I will be very happy to take questions later.</p></speech>

The Law Society of Ireland welcomes the opportunity to add its voice to the calls for reform and to contribute positively towards it.  Everybody is more or less agreed that the current family law system is broken and not working properly and that we need to reform it immediately.  There seems to be a great degree of unanimity about having a specialist, not separate, cadre or division of the courts to deal with family law cases.  The Law Society of Ireland set out what we believe should happen in our detailed 2014 paper and our submission today.  None of this is news to anybody here or anyone involved in family law.  All of the groups represented here have been calling for action for almost 20 years, since the Law Reform Commission published its report on the family law courts.</p> <p>  The first thing we want to raise is the issue arising from the problems with security on 20 December in the Dublin Circuit Family Law court.  Somebody was able to compromise the security of a courtroom and there were issues arising.  That highlighted the complete inadequacy of the Dublin Circuit Family Law Court.  There is also a significant issue with the childcare courts in the old Bridewell, our Victorian criminal courts.  Parents and children who are attending public law cases, where Tusla is bringing an application to have a child taken into care, have to go to a Victorian prison where the acoustics make it very difficult to hear and the environment and atmosphere are completely unsuitable for adults and, even more so, children, should they be present.  The physical premises of the courts need to change, as does the structure of the courts.  The Law Society of Ireland agrees that if the specialist court system proposed was taken up, it would not require a constitutional referendum to be held.  </p> <p>  The other issue the Law Society of Ireland has is with the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 which gave effect to the change to Article 42A of the Constitution.  It was greatly welcomed by the Law Society of Ireland and is being implemented by our members in the District Court and the Circuit Court throughout the country.  The difficulty is that no resources were allocated to give effect to hearing the voice of the child.  We have Rolls Royce legislation with no resources attached to it.  District Court judges are attempting to hear the voice of the child without the assistance of any expert and without any great funding from the Courts Service.  A recent regulation, about which the Law Society of Ireland has a concern, fixes the cost of an expert report on hearing the voice and welfare of the child under section 32 of the 2015 Act at &euro;250 or &euro;300.  That will mean that experts will not produce these reports.  They typically involve at least four visits to the family and the parents to determined what will happen.  As the person who produces a report will be cross-examined in court, there may also be attendance at court and, in addition, the expert will have to produce the report, into which at least 20 hours will have to go.  People will not do that.  The current system is that judges in the District Court may hear the voice of the child in person.</p><p>The facilities for that are completely inadequate.  The training is on a patchwork basis.  It also means that the judges are taken from their normal work.  From a resource point of view, therefore, it is not efficient at all.</p><p> The Law Society states that a specialist division of family law courts and judges would greatly assist in dealing with family law cases more efficiently as it would be likely that the same judges would be available to deal with cases which appear regularly before the courts and a greater degree of consistency would be established.  It has been noted elsewhere that judges should not be confined to this speciality but should be general judges who could be assigned to family law but would not necessarily spend all their judicial career in family law.  However, they would have to be trained and spend sufficient time there as well.</p><p> More focus should be placed on settling cases earlier in the process.  Obviously, an exception is domestic violence where cases may not able to be settled or may not be suitable for alternative dispute resolution, ADR.  Active intervention in family law cases by judges, not by county registrars who are currently the court officials who deal with it or other officials, with an emphasis on resolution in ADR could result in significant savings of time resources for all concerned.  ADR obviously happens before people get to court as well because of the new Mediation Act and the provisions in the Family Law (Divorce) Act.</p><p> The Legal Aid Board appears to be chronically underfunded.  It is not economically possible for solicitors to make a living from the private practitioner scheme relating to the Legal Aid Board.  That has led to a flight of solicitors from the District Court where it currently operates.</p><p> One of the questions we were asked was about a dedicated court system and whether it would remedy the issues.  A dedicated family law court structure throughout the country would fix many of the problems at present, but only if it was properly resourced.  The family law court system must be integrated with ADR and the Legal Aid Board would have to be involved, with the courthouses providing facilities not only for courts but also for ADR and the Legal Aid Board.  Proper premises would have to be provided in the family law courts.  If it was simply a case of creating a family law division within existing structures, a referendum would not be required.  Equally, changes to the District Court and Circuit Court would require some consideration.  We have proposed alternatives to this model but from a practical point of view and to move this forward, given the consensus regarding the specialist courts, we fully support the calls for a specialist court and would like to see that implemented sooner rather than later.</p><p> The issue of costs also arises and we have set out our views in that regard.  The best way to deal with the issue of costs and whether cost orders could be used to punish bad behaviour is to encourage settlement at every opportunity, increase the case management and to have a cost order potentially as a punishment for those who insist on going ahead with their cases when a very fair offer has been made by the other side and they are unlikely to do better in court.  However, where people persist in proceeding, which uses up valuable court time and increases costs on both sides, there should be some sanction available to the court.  There is something called a Calderbank letter which effectively means that one sets out one's position in writing, and that can be used subsequently for an order for costs.  That should be considered but it should be done on a case-by-case basis.</p><p> We again call for consistent judicial supervision of cases to ensure that alternative dispute resolution is considered before one goes to court and, when one goes to court, at the start of the court process and at every stage along the court process so it is dealt with by a judge and there is more active case management.  We believe that would be a far more efficient use of resources and would also lead to cases being resolved much earlier for the parties in the majority of cases.  Some cases are simply too acute to settle, but very active judicial case management would work.</p><p> Legal aid has not kept abreast of developments in the complexity of the law, the needs of the clients or what is involved to defend and represent a client.  The resourcing of legal aid is very important.</p><p> My final point on behalf of the Law Society relates to the rights of fathers.  The Law Society family and child law committee is composed of people who do this work every day of the week and are in a variety of courts.  We represent the solicitors who act for parents whose children may be taken into care, people who act for the health board and people who deal with divorce and separation every day in the District Court.  We have a wide variety of people who are in the courts.  We have seen that the current access model does not necessarily work, particularly for fathers and definitely not for children.  We probably need to do some research on how access currently works in the court.  The model of every second weekend with an overnight on a Wednesday is perhaps the standard default access for fathers in many cases.  Where there are accommodation problems, particularly in Dublin, access is a genuine issue and real hardship is caused for children and families as a result.</p><p> In summary, there should be action on this.  There has been plenty of discussion up to now, but a change is needed.  The change can be introduced by legislation, but legislation alone is no good.  There must be resources to back up whatever changes are made.  Ms Coughlan will deal with some practical examples of the problems.</p></speech>

I work as a family law solicitor in Kildare.  If somebody comes to see me today seeking maintenance or access, I will submit an application to the court.  It will be four months before that application will first come before the court.  It goes before the court for mention only so unless it has been resolved it will then be put into a further list a further four months down the road.  For the person who comes to see me today, it could conceivably be October before that matter is adjudicated in court.  That is the situation in Kildare.  There are similar delays elsewhere.  According to the Courts Service, in Letterkenny one would be waiting 13 weeks, in Carlow it would be 12 weeks, six to eight weeks in Wexford and four weeks in Dundalk.  Those figures are from 2017 and I have not seen more up-to-date figures.</p> <p>  That is the case if one has the resources to go to a private practitioner.  If one is going to the Legal Aid Board, before one can get one's application off the ground one will face delays in even seeing a solicitor for the first consultation.  For example, in Blanchardstown there is currently a 44-week delay before one will see a solicitor.  If one is in Ennis, the delay is 21 weeks, it is eight weeks in Wexford and 17 weeks in Wicklow.  That is before one even gets one's application into court.  It is to see a solicitor initially to get advice.</p> <p>  There is a very serious issue in terms of access to justice.  In practical terms those delays mean that parents may not be seeing their children and they might not be getting suitable financial resources for their children.  Mr. Walsh mentioned childcare and the facilities in Chancery Street.  Childcare cases are heard in Chancery Street at present.  This was the old Bridewell.  Hearings where the most vulnerable people are before the court, where their children will be taken into care by the State, are downstairs in what is equivalent to what the dungeons were.  That is where the family law childcare cases are heard at present.  We are not serving the most vulnerable in society with the facilities we have.</p></speech>

We will probably echo much of what our other colleagues have already stated.</p> <p>  The Children's Rights Alliance unites over 100 members who work together to make Ireland one of the best places in the world in which to be a child.  We change the lives of all children by ensuring that their rights are respected and protected in our laws, policies and services.  We also provide legal information and advice to children, young people and their families through our newly established legal information line.  We offer legal advice outreach clinics nationwide.  That will inform some of what we have to say today.</p> <p>  Like Dr. O'Mahony, we will focus on two key aspects.</p><p>These are the role of children in family law proceedings, particularly with regard to the voice of the child, and the need to reform the family law court structures to meet, in particular, the needs of children and young people.  The family law courts have not been designed to meet the needs of children and families, who are often embroiled in difficult family law disputes.  The physical environment does not provide them with the necessary space and privacy to deal with very sensitive private family matters.  Judges are making decisions in courts about intimate family law issues in the same rooms in which they hear cases relating to, for example, driving offences.  Despite the fact that most proceedings involving children are subject to the <i>in camera </i>rule, we have heard from lawyers about the lack of privacy in court settings.  They are giving legal advice in stairwells and corridors and not in private consultation rooms, never mind child-friendly consultation rooms.  Children who are present in the courts often witness disturbing, upsetting or even violent behaviour.  That needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>Guidance is available on how we can adapt our structures to make them more child-friendly.  The Council of Europe has issued child-friendly justice guidelines.  These provide that states should ensure that any proceedings involving children are dealt with in &quot;non-intimidating and child-sensitive settings&quot;.  They call for interviewing and waiting rooms for children &quot;in a child-friendly environment&quot; be provided in court settings.  They say that children should be familiarised with the court setting, the layout and the roles and identities of officials ahead of the actual proceedings so that they know what is going on and understand what is happening.  They also advise that court sessions involving children should be adapted to the child&rsquo;s pace and attention span, with planned regular breaks and hearings that are limited in duration so that children can properly participate.<br/><br/>As a priority, we recommend the development of suitable accommodation for children and young people in the courts.  A key aspect of this will be progressing Hammond Lane and the dedicated children and family courts that we have been promised for so long.  All stakeholders should be consulted in developing and designing the new family courts, including legal professionals, families and those who work to support them.  Most importantly, children and young people should also be consulted.  This has happened previously in the context of the development of the children&rsquo;s court in Smithfield.  Other experts should be brought in.  For example, Barnardos was invited to help to design the child-friendly spaces in the Criminal Courts of Justice.  We recommend that this be done in this instance as well.<br/><br/>As Dr. O'Mahony stated, most child and family law cases are heard by generalist judges in the general courts system.  However, specialised family or children&rsquo;s court systems are commonplace across Europe and in other common-law jurisdictions where in which there are specially designed court facilities and the member of the judiciary and lawyers have specialised training.  We have also seen good examples elsewhere.  In the UK, Mr. Justice Peter Jackson wrote a letter in accessible language to a 14-year-old in a custody case.  It was so unique that it made news headlines.  He also wrote a judgment in emojis to help very young children understand what was going to happen to them in a way they found accessible.  We think we could look to some of these examples and try to adapt them here.  In the context of any family law reform, we recommend specialised training for all professionals working in the family law courts.  This should reflect child-friendly justice principles.  We need to train judges, lawyers and everybody involved in family law proceedings in order that they will know how to communicate effectively with children and young people.  I invite my colleague, Ms Ahern, to talk about the role of children in proceedings a bit further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Julie Ahern" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#F00200"><p>In addressing the role of children in proceedings, I will focus on two key issues.  First, I will talk about the voice of the child in family law proceedings and, second, I am comment on the provision of information to children and families.</p> <p>  The right the child to be heard is one of the fundamental values of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The child-friendly justice guidelines Ms Brady mentioned also provide that judges should respect the views of children and their right to be heard in all matters affecting them.  Importantly, they also recommend that children should be consulted about the manner in which they would like to be heard.  It should not just be assumed that children should be heard in one particular manner.  Rather, children should be asked how they would like to have their voices heard.  The guidelines also provide that children should not be presumed to be unable to give their views based solely on their age.  In fact, we should look at children's level of maturity and understanding.  Everyone in the room will know two 12 year-olds who would be very different in their understanding of what is going on in life and in any particular situation.  It is important that we look at the individual child and not make a blanket assumption of someone's capacity based on their age.</p> <p>  Dr. O'Mahony has very kindly outlined the legal position on hearing the voices of children.  We want to highlight the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  For the first time, this Act placed an obligation on judges to hear the views of children when determining the best interests of the child.  It is very important to remember that the Act is not prescriptive about the way in which children's voices are to be heard.  There are a variety of ways in which children's voices are currently heard and can be heard.  This can include judges hearing them in chambers, hearing them in open court if appropriate, and if needs be bringing in an expert to help the court elicit children's views.  We note that in his recent report as special rapporteur on child protection Professor Geoffrey Shannon recommended the development of guidelines on how judges can interact with children and young people in family law cases.</p> <p>  On our legal information line, I hear directly from children, young people and their families who feel their views are not being adequately heard in the family law system.  I get calls from children and from mothers and fathers who feel the courts are not listening to what children have to say when they come into court.  Similar to the Law Society of Ireland, the Children's Rights Alliance is very concerned about some of the provisions of the regulations on child's views experts.  In particular, we are very concerned that the regulations place a burden on families to pay for the experts to hear the views of children.  As this plays out, families who can afford to employ a child's views expert will have their voices heard.  Children whose families cannot afford it will not.  The right of the child will be dependent on their parents' ability to pay.  We echo the view of the Law Society to the effect that the cap placed on the number of child's views experts is incredibly low.  In very complex cases, no experts are willing to take on the role.  We are extremely concerned about this because children in the most vulnerable situations may not have their right to be heard vindicated.</p> <p>  The second point I wish to make relates to information provided to children and families.  I hear every day from children and families that they do not understand the nature of the process in family law courts.  They do not know what to expect or what is going on.  They want information about their rights, how to go into the court and how to navigate the process.  They want basic information to assist them in going into what is a really unfamiliar and scary environment, particularly for a child or a young person who has never walked into a courtroom before.  The Council of Europe&rsquo;s guidelines on child-friendly justice have been very helpful in setting out what information should be provided to children.  This should include information on their rights, the system and how it works, what their role will be and the available support mechanisms.  The last point in particular is very important.  If children, young people and families are supported, they will hopefully find the process a lot easier to navigate and much less traumatic. </p> <p>  Consideration could be given to providing information to children and families in a format that is child-friendly and adapted to the needs of the families and the age and maturity of the child.  Consideration should also be given to employing digital technology and making the information widely accessible.  While there is some very good information out there, I find that families and particularly children want to get information from someone they know and trust.  Alternatively, they look online.  A quick Google search for information about how the family law process works produces results that are very difficult to understand.  As someone working in the area even I wonder what it is meant to mean.  It is very important that it is very accessible and that people can find it in their own right.  It must also be there for people who work with families to guide them through the process.</p> <p>  Another method of providing support is the employment of specialist child court liaison officers.  This person would be an official who children and families could go to for information.  He or she would be there to support them in the really difficult process of going through the family law courts.  We recommend considering this as part of any proposed change to the family law system.  We recommend in particular the prioritisation of information for children and young people.</p></speech>

I invite Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar to make an opening statement on behalf of Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI.  If Ms Counihan wishes to contribute at any point I will leave it to her.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.372" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#F00400"><p>I thank the committee for the information to speak on the reform of the family law system.  RCNI recognises the expert and detailed consideration given to the issues of interest to this committee by our peers today and in the last 12 months.  I refer in particular to the Garda Inspectorate report, the Child Care Law Reporting Project, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the special rapporteur on child protection.</p><p>Rather than repeat them, I will focus on RCNI&rsquo;s particular area of expertise and specialist concern, sexual violence and in this context, the child victims of familial sexual violence and incest.  We have three priorities, the first of which is the establishment of a specialist family court, as our peers have also advocated.  Our second priority is transparency and accountability of our child protection system including the family law system, while the third is the development of a national strategy on child sexual violence.<br/><br/>Child sexual violence is a crime, not just a civil matter.  However, in cases of child sexual violence and incest, the criminal justice system often fails and the protection of these children can become the subject of the family law courts, both publicly and privately.  Tusla receives approximately 3,000 child sexual violence referrals  per annum, although the number of children concerned will be fewer.  I invite the committee to consider what happens to these 3,000 reports.  International in-depth studies of disclosures, from whatever source, of sexual violence committed against children allow us to state that we can expect some false allegations at a rate of approximately 2% to 8%, with the lowest rate of false allegations being detected for the child who discloses themselves.  In accordance with the law and protocols, all cases are notified to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Difficulties with these protocols are detailed in the specialist reports cited in the footnotes and are part of the implementation plan arising, in particular, from the Garda Inspectorate report but I do not propose to dwell on those matters here.<br/><br/>According to the Garda Inspectorate, for these cases there is a 4% prosecution rate, with less than 2% resulting in criminal convictions.  Therefore, our criminal justice failure rate in reported and true child sexual violence is between 90% and 96%.  For these children, risk needs to be managed and they need protection regardless of the absence of a criminal conviction.  The protection of these children is one of the complex tasks we expect families and communities to undertake informally and which the legislature has mandated Tusla to undertake formally on all our behalf.  In the course of this work, Tusla relies on the family law courts for some of its actions such as applications for care orders.  In addition, these cases arise in private family law because for many child victims, the family is not a safe place and is the location of harm.<br/><br/>The inspectorate's report, published in December 2017, shows that in 44% of child sexual violence cases the alleged perpetrator was a family member.  When we look at different age cohorts within childhood, which the RCNI did in our national statistics report of 2015, we see that in 62% of all cases of child sexual violence against children younger than 13, they were reported as perpetrated by family members.  Where a child discloses incest, some but not all cases will result in the family breaking up.  This can be expected to be a highly acrimonious situation<b></b>which is likely to escalate into the private family courts.  This means that we can expect that a significant proportion of family separation and child custody cases going through our family courts involve the rape and sexual abuse of children by family members in the absence of a parallel criminal conviction.<br/><br/>The family court service processes on average 11,600 cases involving guardianship, custody and access matters.  The Child Care Law Reporting Project and the Legal Aid Board have tried to estimate how many of these involve child sexual violence.  RCNI believes this figure should not be a matter of a guesstimate.  It  should be possible, if novel, for our court services to gather and release statistics on how many private family law cases involve allegations of child sexual violence. <b></b>We recommend that the Courts Service gathers and publishes this information regularly as an imperative matter of justice and public interest.  Our family courts are handling highly criminal matters of the most sensitive and urgent child protection nature in unknown numbers, without criminal authority, without the appropriate tools and in the absence of appropriate specialisation.  RCNI advocates strongly for a special family law court which addresses these concerns.  Such a court was recommended in 1996 by the Law Reform Commission, and since then by the child rapporteur and the Child Care Law Reporting Project among others.  It is long overdue.<br/><br/>As noted by the committee, family court hearings are held <i>in camera</i>.  This means that apart from the very welcome Child Care Law Reporting Project and the work of the rapporteur, there is little by way of gathering and collating of data to allow for accountability and reassurance.  A thorough review of how the <i>in camera</i>rule impacts on transparency and accountability should be considered.  In addition to the <i>in camera</i>rule, confidentiality and non-disclosure clauses imposed on parties in the family courts do sometimes occur, whereby the court rules, among other things, that a child&rsquo;s disclosures of rape and sexual violence must not be reported directly to the State&rsquo;s investigative authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but must be mediated through appointed individuals or Tusla who will decide when a child&rsquo;s voice can be heard by our mandated criminal justice investigative authorities.  There is no data or analysis generated by the courts services or Tusla to make publicly transparent how many children and their guardians are bound by civil court ordered, non-disclosure clauses.  While we recognise the complexity of the cases we would recommend that achieving greater transparency on these matters through Courts Service data is a minimum for the discharge of oversight when such grave matters are at issue.<br/><br/>Finally, we recommend that this committee adds its voice to the call for an urgent child sexual violence national strategy<b></b>that would ensure that the child victim of rape and most particularly of incest, does not continue to be at risk of falling through the cracks.  Until we increase our family courts and allied child protection structures transparency and accountability and specialisation, children and their voice will remain disturbingly silent.</p></speech>

Before I invite members to ask questions, I wish to point out that we have made this the substantive issue for address in the first session of this year's D&aacute;il sittings.  We have scheduled three hearings on the issue, of which this is the first.  Having listened to the contributions of our guests, it is without question that our knowledge of and exposure to the issue that influenced our making this decision did not fully appreciate how absolutely awful the situation is currently.  Our guests have underscored that very well indeed.  The following members have indicated that they wish to speak: Deputies O'Callaghan and Wallace and Senator Black.  Deputy O'Callaghan is first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#G00300"><p>I thank all of our guests for attending.  I wish to make them aware of the process involved here.  We are going to produce a report but, obviously, this is an area of some complexity, which is why we need outside expertise to assist us in preparing that report.  There is a lot of agreement between the witnesses here on some fundamental areas.  However, it is also worth pointing out that family law is legitimately regarded as different to the determination and resolution of other disputes.  Other disputes which are before the courts can affect one part of a person's rights or life but family law disputes seem to involve orders being made by the courts which fundamentally affect the personal relationships that somebody has in their lives.  It is of unique importance in terms of the consequences that a family law proceeding will have on people and on the family involved.</p> <p>  I will begin by asking a few questions about article 42A of the Constitution and its implementation through the Child and Family Relationships Act.  Dr. O'Mahony stated that everyone agrees that we must try to ascertain the views of the child.  Perhaps Mr. Walsh or Ms Coughlan, as practitioners can assist here, but in practical terms, has that increased the amount of work in a family law case because now one must ascertain the views of every child?  How is it done, practically?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.376" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Keith Walsh" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#G00400"><p>It really depends and it varies greatly from district to district.  The structure of the District Court is that every county has its own district, so we have approximately 26 districts.  Each District Court judge is not really answerable to the President of the District Court; he or she is completely a law unto himself or herself.  A specialist court system would allow more of a whip in terms of that, to some degree, or certainly a degree of consistency.  How the voice of the child is heard differs from case to case.  In Dolphin House, there are three judges presiding today who are dealing with access and custody issues.  Depending on which judge, there might be three different views on how the voice of the child can be heard.  One way that the voice of the child can be heard is through the evidence of the parents.  Another way is an expert report and yet another way is the judge speaking to the child in chambers.  The latter is the least used method, in my experience, because of the time involved and the lack of training.  District Court judges are far more likely than Circuit Court judges to hear children in chambers.  Circuit Court judges really do not get involved in that, whereas District Court judges would.  The referendum and Article 42A is about hearing the voice of the child but the most important thing is that the welfare of the child is to be paramount in any proceedings involving custody, access or guardianship and also adoption matters.</p><p>If there is a dispute about what is in the best interest of the child's welfare, and if the parents' evidence will be very different, one needs to bring in an expert.  It is quite difficult to hear the voice of the child without an expert.  In the District Court, what has happened is that there are many constitutional, legislative imperatives on the judge without any resources.  The experts are simply not available to do the reports.</p></speech>

Is it done through affidavits signed by the children, or by giving oral evidence, or by expert reports?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.379" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Keith Walsh" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#H00300"><p>It should be expert reports.  If one wanted to get an expert report, as we stated in our submission, what happened prior to the 2015 Act was that one would go into court and probably be dealt with on the first date unless there was a for-mention-type situation.  Currently, in a Dublin court, one would have to apply for the report on the first day, return another day to get the report and return yet another day to figure out how long the report will take and whether it can be agreed.  Before one gets anywhere, therefore, one will have had four court dates and appeared on the list four times but one will not even have received a hearing date.  At the hearing date, the expert will probably give evidence if there is a conflict, which there will have to be because if there are two parents, the expert will not necessarily solve the problem.  We read the 2015 Act as providing that the voice of the child must be heard and that is generally done by providing an expert report.</p></speech>

If a family can afford an expert report, they will get it.  Such reports cost in the region of &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000, in my experience.  The latest legislation allows for &euro;250 for the preparation of that report but I cannot see any expert doing it for &euro;250.  In practical terms, it depends on the judge of the day and whether he or she wants to hear the child.  In general, if the judge has the facility to have an expert elicit the child's view, in my experience he or she will use it.</p></speech>

The Act is silent on how to ascertain the views of the child where there is no expert, which leaves open the possibility that the views of the child simply are not heard.<br/><br/>By contrast, there are better approaches to the issue.  The Brussels IIa regulation on international child abduction cases, for example, requires the court to certify either that the child's views have been heard or the reasons that has not occurred, while the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2018, which is working its way through the Oireachtas, contains a provision which states that if a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is not to be appointed, the court must state in open court why not and, more importantly, how the views of the child will be alternatively ascertained.  That is missing, however, from the 2015 Act, which leaves open the possibility that it simply does not happen.<br/><br/>On the question of lengthening the proceedings and making them more expensive, that is inescapable but we have committed to it.  We either follow through on the commitment or hold a referendum to repeal Article 42A and withdraw from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p></speech>

On the costs, sometimes there is an option in respect of litigation but in family law one does not really have an option.</p> <p>  Ms. Coughlan spoke about the delay that exists for people who simply cannot afford lawyers.  How does she regard the quality of legal representation litigants receive when availing of legal aid?  How do they cope with the delay in getting representation or legal advice?  I presume that most people will find it difficult to pay for solicitors and barristers in family law proceedings.  How do they cope with that and the delay in the Legal Aid Board appointing them a solicitor?</p></speech>

There was a private practitioner scheme for dealing with matters in the District Court in respect of custody access and maintenance.  From our experience, however, due to the fee structure that was put in place, most private practitioners no longer do it because it is not cost effective for them.  That feeds back into the delays with the solicitors employed by the Legal Aid Board to deal with cases</p></speech>

A pilot project for mediators, which has been running in Dolphin House in Dublin for a couple of years, deals with some of the cases and is successful.  The mediators are on the premises of Dolphin House and it seems to have worked.  A similar project has been rolled out in Ennis, County Clare.  Mediation and alternative dispute resolution are the kinds of features that everyone would like to have available in courthouses.  The solicitors who work in the Legal Aid Board are utterly overworked due to the volume of cases and there is a constant pressure on them to service people.  Perhaps outsourcing services or providing more resources would help but the waiting lists are unacceptably long.</p></speech>

For example, they know that something has happened in the family and that they will have to go to court.  They know that the parents are going to court on the Friday, which happens, and they think that the matter will be resolved but it is not.  They do not know what is happening.  Families are going through turmoil because of the delay.  I have received calls from parents who have taken a day off work without realising they would have to return.  They think that they are going to go in for one day and have the case heard and sorted to allow them to move on with their lives.  The delay has an impact on families and, in particular, children and the relationships they have with their parents.  Sometimes, children might not be able to see one parent during the period, or they might have limited contact, or there might be arguments about when the contact can be.  The impact of delays on children, therefore, is particularly significant.</p> <p>  The overall issue is that the system was not created with families and children in mind.  It is again a matter of hearing the views of children.  While it is true that the 2015 Act is silent on how the views of children are heard, the system we have created has not made a provision that the court must be a child-friendly place with child-friendly proceedings in which children can have an active position and take part if they wish.  I have heard from children who have been heard through an expert but who do not feel that their voices have been heard, and they themselves sometimes want to speak with the judge.  While there is no consistency, the looseness exists for a reason because every child, family and situation is different.  The system needs to catch up with that reality and become more friendly for families.</p></speech>

Sometimes there is a mix of both.  We certainly brought this to the Department of Justice and Equality and it is in talks with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs about how this could potentially be done.  I know it is a longer-term objective but it is really practical.  We should not create inequalities between different children, depending on the type of court proceedings they come across.</p></speech>

Many of these people end up relying on services in the community and welfare.  We are not adding all that up.  The domestic violence bodies and services are really looking at how homelessness and domestic violence are interlinked.  Currently, with homelessness, we are not really talking about domestic violence; we separate and silo those.  There is a fair amount of work to be done on how this has an impact on poverty and homelessness.</p></speech>

Could we insert into our report a recommendation that would try to make parties in family law recognise they would be in a much better position if they could try to resolve disputes through mediation and get agreement on access to children that way?  That is in preference to the cut and thrust of a court case, where generally there is a winner and a loser.  Is there anything we could do to encourage that in our report?</p></speech>

A solicitor must now swear a statutory declaration that mediation has been discussed.  That has been far more effective than the old system of certificates.  That is in place.  If matters can be resolved outside the courts, that is the best way and it is certainly in the family law guidance that we give to solicitors.  When it gets to court, we need the active case management intervention of a judge immediately.  Currently, one goes to the county registrar for case progression within the system but while the county registrar does not have the same "teeth" as a judge, people really only see a judge at the end of a case.  What we are considering now is perhaps introducing the judge at the beginning to say that although parties are in court, they can still consider all this alternative dispute resolution, with the judge leading an examination of how far the case would need to go.  The judge would do two things.  Currently, the county registrar does case progression or management but we could certainly look at having a judge look at case management and stating that although such action could be taken, parties might consider alternative courses of action.  That probably would not be the judge who ultimately would hear the case but if a judge could be put into the process quickly, it might help to resolve cases that currently take a lot longer and which could be done much more quickly.  The process could be front-loaded.  This involves a commitment of resources from the Judiciary and from the practitioners and parties involved.</p></speech>

I have been an advocate of that for years on the criminal side whether children or family matters are involved or not.  The principle of mediation and alternative dispute resolution has certain limitations and one should be wary of advocating it or using it in any situation where there is an indication of sexual or domestic violence or an abusive situation of some kind or another.  There is much potential for the abusive party to manipulate the process completely to the detriment of the other people or family members involved.  My fear is there is a risk, if it is not done properly, that in the early stages a party who had witnessed sexual or domestic violence in a domestic setting would feel he or she had no choice, would be constrained or would feel that it would be very hard to avoid mediation, although everything else would scream against such a process with good cause.</p></speech>

Is it the case that in family law proceedings, if it was disclosed on affidavit or in evidence that there was sexual abuse or an allegation of sexual abuse against a child, it is possible this could be subject to some form of a non-disclosure agreement whereby it might not go to the authorities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.402" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#J00900"><p>This is part of the data we are seeking.  When we speak about transparency, we would like much more data as we do not have anything but anecdotes on this because of the nature of family law and how it is conducted.  We have anecdotes that raise the question of how many such cases there are.  This begins to intersect with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  We must examine how Tusla engages on the question.  As I have said, if there is a 96% failure rate for child sexual abuse that is disclosed and is probably true, if some of the cases end up in family courts, how are they being handled?  Tusla has a system of categorising the 3,000 referrals in terms of risk management as "founded" and "unfounded".  It does not disclose and there is no public data on what percentage of these cases it deems to be founded and unfounded.  Therefore, what it sends to family courts, how it behaves with respect to the courts and the information it gives would depend on how the cases are categorised as either founded or unfounded.  Tusla's policy around how it treats an unfounded case varies.  There is not a standard way of handling the risk assessment and such cases naturally would always need to be individualised.  There would need to be an individual response to such cases.</p> <p>  On the question of whether we can end up with a situation where there is child sexual abuse in a private family case, we would say "yes" for all the reasons we have mapped out here.  What is critical for us to know is whether we can begin to log this, put a number on it or count it.  We think there is much that is hidden.  As Ms Counihan said with respect to alternative dispute resolution, we do not know how many such processes involve people in cases of coercive control and domestic violence who make a calculation that it is easier to compromise.  We do not know to what extent the cases that are long and protracted, where people will not agree, are because there is domestic and sexual violence.  We are not counting these allegations that are parts of these cases.  That is not to say they are true but that they are part of the case.</p></speech>

I am sure after listening to the witnesses and the other groups coming in, we will have much food for thought.  It looks like it will be very difficult to make things as good as we would like them to be.  The witnesses seem to agree that resources will be a big challenge and it will cost much money to make this fit for purpose.  We are up against the wall then of whether those resources will come on stream.</p> <p>  The witnesses have indicated no additional resources have been allocated to pay for the required experts to complete the voice of the child report.  The Law Society has called for cases to be resolved earlier in the process, with a focus on alternative dispute resolution.  Ms Counihan raised concerns about the use of such processes in cases regarding child sexual violence and domestic violence.  How does the Law Society feel about the use of alternative dispute resolution in these complex cases?</p></speech>

We have a policy against it.  It may be worth dividing up family law into two or three areas.  The Circuit Court deals primarily with legal separation and divorce cases, while the District Court deals with public law cases, namely, childcare, taking children into care, as well as access, custody and guardianship cases which are primarily non-marital.  There is already a division within the court system in that the Circuit Court deals with people who are married and all of their problems as a bundle in divorce or judicial separation proceedings, while the District Court deals with people who are unmarried in the context of guardianship and, separately, maintenance cases and, separately again, custody issues.  There are also public law childcare cases which involve taking children into care.  There are a variety of others, but they are the headline areas.  If there are no allegations of sexual violence or other such issues, an ADR mechanism could be trialled in divorce and judicial separation proceedings.  The primary issues in judicial separation and divorce cases are money and children.  This can be done, either before going to court or afterwards but ideally as soon as possible.  </p><p> As I said, the District Court deals with custody and guardianship cases.  Again, an ADR mechanism would be suitable for use in the majority of these cases and should be tried.  We might not solve everything via an ADR mechanism, but we might have a number of issues netted or resolved.  An ADR mechanism would not necessarily be suitable for use in public law cases because the decisions are binary.  In other words, either the child will be taken into care or he or she will not.  There may be a voluntary element.  An ADR mechanism works on a case by case basis.  Generally, where possible, it reduces the resources required by the courts system, but it does require the provision of alternative resources.  It would not be possible to operate it without an additional judge or two, but if it was resourced properly in the longer term, it will definitely pay dividends.  Most importantly, it would reduce the legal costs involved for the parties and speed up the timeframe required to resolve all of the issues involved.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Callaghan has made the point that it will be very difficult to bring it about.  It is a huge challenge.  Under the 2015 Act, the appointment of a child's view expert is entirely at the discretion of the court.  There is no guidance in the Act on what should happen in cases in which the court decides not to appoint an expert, be it for financial reasons or in the case in which the child is deemed to be able to speak for himself or herself.  Given that the courts can be an intimidating place for children and that many judges and lawyers are not trained or equipped to speak to children in that setting, should the appointment of an expert be the default position in law rather than discretionary?</p></speech>

Ideally, there should be a menu of options.  If one is dealing with a 16 year old, he or she may very well be able to speak for himself or herself and it may be a better vindication of that child's rights to have him or her participate directly, rather than doing so through the medium of an expert.  If one is dealing with much younger children, the communication barrier is more significant.  My personal view is that it is more important to have a flexible menu of options than to have a default position into which every child is shoehorned.  As I mentioned, because the 2015 Act speaks about the expert but not about the other options, it raises the question as to what those options are and how would they work in cases in which experts are not appointed.  We know that there will be cases in which experts will not be appointed.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh has made the point that in a lot of cases this amount would not cover the cost of a report, but for many families, it is too high.  Am I correct that the delegates are recommending that the State put in place a mechanism to foot the bill?  If so, how would it be managed and how would costs be controlled?</p></speech>

Some will not be able to afford it.  We recommend a scheme akin to the legal aid scheme.  A scheme was piloted, but the fees for child abuse experts were set very low.  The regulations published in December came into force on 1 January.  They were a long time in the making, given that the Act was passed in 2015.  We did make submissions on the issue of fees, as did the national advisory council on children and young people.  We engaged with Barnardos which operates the guardian <i>ad litem</i>scheme on how many hours it would take it to carry out this work.  It told us that it would take about 30 hours because the person would have to establish a relationship of trust with the child and ensure he or she was not being coached by one or both parents.  There is a responsibility on the State to provide resources to do this work.  It is provided for in legislation and to enforce it, we need to ensure the regulations are fit for purpose.<br/><br/>On the issue of who can be appointed as an expert, the regulations set our four professions, one of which is a psychologist who comes under CORU, the body for health and social professionals.  One of the issues arising is, if one has a complaint, to whom can one make it.  That is not clear from the regulations.  Some of our members have asked for the regulations on the professionals who can be appointed as a child abuse expert to be fleshed out further, lest we lose some really valuable expertise.  Ultimately, the fees are far too low.  That will not help to solve the problem and we need to find a way forward.  The national executive office in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, when established and up and running, could look at how this issue could be addressed.</p></speech>

It was apparently given the green light, but the project is now stalled somewhere between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Law Society of Ireland and I am sure the other groups represented here have been in constant touch with the Department about moving the project on.  If it was enacted in Dublin, it would be the flagship for the integrated system of specialist family justice, with the mediation services of the Legal Aid Board and alternative dispute resolution, ADR, service providers.  It would house the Children Court which is where criminal issues involving children go, public law cases, private law cases, the Circuit Court and the High Court.  It would be the ideal way to deal with it.  We went very far into the detail of its format and lay-out.  We say the specialist division of the family court cannot wait and that we must make the best of what we have in the Courts Service.  We will have to identify the regional centres and see whether this can be rolled out.  We are talking to the Courts Service about this, but we really cannot wait for the buildings to be built.  We have to do the best with what we have got.  Family law has always been the poor sister or relation in the allocation of resources, but we need to see this specialist court being set up as soon as it can be.  It may be that it has to move a little ahead of the premises, but if we are to wait for the buildings to be built, we will never have a specialist division of the family court.  We will have to do our best with what we have and perhaps think creatively with the Office of Public Works, the Courts Service and the Department of Justice and Equality and say that while they may not have the facilities required, we want to press ahead with this project.  Unfortunately, it will never be fully resourced.  The best may be the enemy of the good in that regard.</p></speech>

There was a great project for child contact centres in operation a couple of years ago which was run by Barnardos and One Family, both of which are members of the Children's Rights Alliance.  The issue of access for families and children has been brought up.  The centres were operated very effectively in providing a neutral space for children to meet the other parent.  Families found them really useful, but the funding for them was cut.  They ran for several years and funding was not reallocated.  We have been talking to some of our members which provide domestic violence services and they all advocate that we look again at that system.  It was cost effective, provided child-friendly spaces for children to access their other parent, particularly, as Mr. Walsh pointed out, single fathers who had particular problems in finding adequate accommodation, given the housing crisis.  They need that space to meet their children and access visits.</p></speech>

Some court buildings throughout the country are in fairly good shape and with some slight modifications, they could accommodate this service, but there are many that would not.  Certainly at District Court level, there are many very small Victorian style District Court buildings which are utterly unsuitable.  Reference has been made to the courthouse on Chancery Street in Dublin which is almost the last place where child protection cases should be heard.  It has razor wire on the top of the walls and bars on the windows of the consultation rooms and so on.  We could absolutely use other buildings.  In some ways, for this type of case, the less it looks like a traditional courthouse the better.  It would not be necessary to build shiny specialised court buildings in every town in Ireland.  There is a lot that could be done in using creatively other accommodation and then regional centres in having dedicated buildings.</p></speech>

I agree completely with the idea of having a menu of options.  What will make it easier for an individual child to participate in the process?  We should start with the children and the menu of what in the criminal courts would be called special measures and perhaps, in the wider context, criminal proceedings protective measures.  That leads me to the need for specialised training, the range of approaches which might be suitable in the case of an individual child and for everybody else, including Courts Service staff, judges and lawyers who appear regularly in the system.  Everybody has to have a basic understanding and accept that each individual child needs an individual approach.  From there spring ideas and imaginative solutions to the problem of the fabric not being adequate.  We could easily become creative and improvise for a period, while waiting for the beautiful new courtroom to be built in an area, just by considering what was essential.  It is essential that the place be friendly, safe and not intimidating; that the child have an opportunity to ask questions beforehand about the procedure; that the process in court be child friendly; that there be no bullying of the witness; and that there be no repetitive questions in convoluted legal language and so forth.  That is where we need to start.</p></speech>

We know that conviction rates are incredibly low in cases of child sexual violence.  I think I read that they are at a figure of 4%.  As well as the low rates, the courts are not gathering statistics for child sexual or domestic violence cases in the civil family law court.  How will Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar go about data collection and publication?  Has Rape Crisis Network Ireland thought it out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.423" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#L00700"><p>The prosecution rate found by the Garda Inspectorate was 4%, with a conviction rate of 2%.  That leaves everything else and accepting that some of them will simply not be true at a figure of between 2% and 8%.  Not every one of those cases will end up in the family law system, but many of them will in some way, shape or form.  As Mr. Walsh said, the family law system is broken.  Sexual violence cases disappear into a broken system in which we lose sight of them.  That is why it is critical that we figure out how to count them to keep track of them.  That is a matter for the Courts Service.  We are asking the servants of the courts to log cases going through them and to say, for example, if there is an allegation of sexual violence in a case, they make no judgment on whether it is true but simply that it is present.  We would then have an indication of the percentage of child sexual violence allegations present in the family law court, in public and private cases.  In public cases it will be straightforward; the blind spot is in private cases.  In a footnote to our submission we mention that some of these cases are interminable, something with which the practitioners will be familiar.  In the area of the criminal law there are cases that are <i>sub judice</i>, but there are others that are finished and we can talk about them.</p><p>When we venture into this space these cases seem interminable but the system does not track them as one case, so they pop up again and again.  The system does not know how long the same people remain in the system coming back over and over again.  Consequently, we could really fix that part as well in order that the system understands just how long and interminable some of these cases are because one continues to be brought back in, if one likes.  That is especially likely where there are situations of coercive control and domestic violence where the courts are essentially being used in that way.  This type of visibility where the Courts Service can begin to track these data would give us a handle on it and allow us to begin to have a conversation whereby we ask how we manage it in terms of the case management and the practices and specialisations we need.</p></speech>

Dr. O'Mahony said that we do not need a constitutional amendment for the establishment of a specialised family court.  What legislative changes does he envisage as being necessary?  The Law Society recommends establishing it within the Circuit Court system, whereas he suggests that family law divisions should be set up within the District, Circuit and High Courts.  In terms of practicality and costs, which does he think is the most realistic option?</p> <p>  Some fathers feel they do not get a fair deal.  I went through the system myself.  How does one address that?  Is a re-education process required for judges?</p></speech>

At present different aspects of family law are allocated to different courts.  Mr. Walsh alluded to that earlier.  Some decisions are made in the District Court, some in the Circuit Court and some in the High Court.  What could very easily be done is what happens in other areas, for example, in the Children's Court for criminal matters involving children.  For those family cases one would designate the courts when they are hearing those issues as the family District Court, the family Circuit Court or the family High Court.  The legislation would then set out what are the characteristics of the family District Court to differentiate it from the regular District Court, be that procedural, in terms of facilities or specialist training for judges or other staff members.  In that way, one would slot it into what we already have but one would then separate it out in terms of that level of specialisation around the staffing and facilities that make it a specialist court.</p></speech>

We would call for proper research to be done to ascertain the exact position.  Anecdotally, it seems to be that the perception is that fathers do not get a fair crack of the whip.  We need more research and data to see how they are treated.  Following on from that, it comes back to what we are also advocating, namely, that there is a need for specialist judges and for judges to be trained.  Society has changed.  The role a father would have had 20 or 30 years ago could be very different to the role a father has now.  We do not know whether that is being reflected in court orders in respect of maintenance and especially access so we need some research on it.</p></speech>

What this comes down to is data because right now we do not know what the situation is.  We have other pieces of data, for example, on the distribution of care in the raising of children.  As 70% of the time it is mothers who are doing the caring, the question is how that impacts when one goes to court.  We have income inequality between women and men as well, which also plays a part.  Until we have data on what is happening in the courts, we cannot even have the conversation.  This is another area where the Courts Service could begin to illuminate matters for us so that we could have a conversation based on evidence.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.433" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1408" speakername="Frances Black" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#M01000"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming in today and for the great work they are all doing.  My head is spinning a little, given what has been said.  The presentations indicate the situation is a minefield.  If in Ireland we cannot make our vulnerable children a number one priority, then I do not know what kind of country we are.  There is no doubt it should be a number one priority.  The image of the Bridewell and children going into that family law scenario is so traumatic.  I cannot imagine what it must be like for the children.</p> <p>  There are a couple of areas I want to touch on, which Deputy O'Callaghan touched on a little in terms of prevention and how the witnesses see that.  I will give an example to explain what I mean by that.  I work in family therapy, specifically in the area of addiction.  I wish to refer to addiction a little bit because I am sure it plays a significant role across the board in family law and court cases.  A family I might work with could involve one parent in addiction and the other parent being so preoccupied, stressed, worried and anxious because of the chaos it brings into the home that the children can often be left neglected, as the parent who is not in addiction cannot function.  As a result, the older child can be taking care of the younger children and they are looking after themselves.  All of the chaos is going on and then there is a court case.  I advocate that there should be some way of preventing all of that through the provision of resources for addiction services or by having the services working together.  For example, Tusla could work with the addiction services to see if there was some way of preventing people from getting to the last stage of a court case to avoid children being obliged to go through all of that.  What is the view of the witnesses in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.434" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor O'Mahony" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#M01100"><p>As a general matter, Tusla as an organisation is under-resourced.  Senator Black focused specifically on addiction in her comments.  There is a very distinct link between addiction and the child protection issues that come to the attention of Tusla.  Tusla's social workers are so overburdened in trying to address the critical cases that this keeps them from doing the kind of work on early intervention that they might like to do and that might catch things further upstream and prevent them becoming more acute, as Senator Black suggests.  As a general matter, when we talk about child protection, if we want early intervention to work then we need to resource Tusla to be able to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.435" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Saoirse Brady" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#M01200"><p>Prevention and early intervention are important.  To follow on from Dr. O'Mahony's point, the area-based childhood programmes have now been taken into Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and they specialise in prevention and early intervention.  That will form part of Tusla's wider work, which is welcome.  Senator Black is correct that there needs to be a more joined-up approach and that needs to happen well before there is any crisis.  It is evident from Carol Coulter's childcare law reporting project that parental addiction and alcohol abuse plays a part in many of the cases she has seen come before the courts.  A number of helpful measures have been put in place.  I am so used to talking about the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill that I forget it is now an Act but measures such as that will hopefully help address some of the addiction issues.  We now have an early years strategy, First 5, and that is built in there as well, so in addition to the affordable childcare scheme we will see provision for vulnerable families.  A number of agencies will be tasked with identifying those families and providing them with quality full-time childcare to help with the family support piece and prevention and early intervention because if one can get children into a good quality service such as that, where there are wraparound services, it can identify those problems earlier, signal them to Tusla and try to put in place the family support and parental support programmes that are needed in order to address them.</p><p>There is some work happening.  We can send the committee further information on it.  We will be launching our report card next week, which will deal with some of those issues.  The committee will see how we can join up some of the existing work, which might be useful for its own report.</p></speech>

Regarding legal aid, Mr. Walsh mentioned that many legal aid lawyers are completely overburdened and overworked.  What would he recommend?  I do not understand how it all works.  What attracts somebody to legal aid work?  How can their lives be made easier?  Do they need more resources?  What is the major problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.438" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Keith Walsh" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#N00300"><p>The major problem is the volume of people who need to seek legal aid.  It is means-assessed so one has to be earning less than a certain amount of money to qualify.  The number of people who fall into that bracket and who are involved in family law proceedings is quite large.  The Legal Aid Board is involved in roughly one third of all Circuit Court cases and a slightly smaller portion of District Court cases.  The Legal Aid Board is a huge player in this area.  From my experience, the type of person who is attracted to work with the Legal Aid Board is somebody who wants to make a difference and who is not necessarily motivated by money, because it is not hugely well-paid work.  They are people who genuinely want to help people resolve problems.</p> <p>  Resourcing is a massive issue.  More resources should be given to the Legal Aid Board so that it could hire more solicitors and set up private practitioner schemes that would work to take some of the burden off the board.  We are not talking about hugely well-paid schemes but about adequately funded schemes.  This would mean, for example, that instead of a Legal Aid Board solicitor spending a full day in District Court doing one case, that work could be hived off to private practitioners.  A restructuring of how the Legal Aid Board does business is certainly required.  The board constantly looks at that.  We meet its chief executive, Mr. John McDaid, and other members of the board regularly and they say they require more resources due to the volume of people applying for legal aid.  </p> <p>  Delays in respect of legal aid usually affect the other person involved.  That person may also be on legal aid, which may result in a delay to his or her case, but if he or she is not the court considers equality of arms and fairness.  If one of two parties is on legal aid it slows the case down for both people.  If somebody applies for legal aid, it slows down proceedings.  The Law Society believes more resources are necessary.</p></speech>

They are quite entitled to do that but very often it is not done by choice but because they cannot wait.  That raises questions in respect of access to justice, delays and training for judges in dealing with personal litigants.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.440" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor O'Mahony" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#N00500"><p>It should be said that the issues dealt with by the Legal Aid Board are disproportionately on the side of custody and access.  The board prioritises child protection cases in which the State seeks to take a child into care because of their nature.  If the State comes in with its legal representatives and seeks an application for a care order, the judge will not want to proceed unless there is a solicitor for the parent.  Because these cases often involve neglect or abuse, those applications cannot wait.  The Legal Aid Board's resources tend to be sucked up in ensuring that people in cases involving applications for care orders have representation.  The private cases end up having to wait.  The impact on private cases, as has already been mentioned, may also result in parents not seeing their children.</p></speech>

Is that how he sees it?</p></speech>

It is not a very sexy area of practice and is not treated particularly well in the hierarchy of the courts.  From our perspective, we view it as something that has traditionally had difficulty getting funding allocated to it.  It requires a lot of funding but it does not necessarily get it.  There is a perception there.  One of the difficulties relates to the <i>in camera</i>rule.  People do not realise what is going on behind closed doors in respect of delays and so on.  The <i>in camera</i>rule effectively prevents things about the courts being reported on a daily basis.  If something happens in any of the other courts it is reported.  There is very little reporting of the family law courts.  The 2004 Act does allow for certain journalists to go in and report on the courts but the reality is that, because of resource issues in the media, the media does not want to devote resources to people going in to sit at the back of courtrooms.<br/><br/>We need some sort of change to the <i>in camera</i>rule to allow people to see into courts.  It should not allow anyone's identity to be revealed, but should allow people to see how fathers, mothers and children are treated in the District Court with regard to guardianship, access and custody and how people are treated in respect of separation of divorce.  People should be allowed to see how child abduction cases are handled in the High Court.  Most people are not even aware that such cases happen.  Transparency and further relaxation of the rules would assist the whole system but this is a hugely divisive issue.  The people who are going to court do not necessarily want anything reported by the time they get there.  It is a really tricky issue for the users or litigants in person and for the lawyers.  This is an area on which no two people agree.  More transparency is essential, however, otherwise family law will remain the poor relation.  We have to acknowledge that this is one of the reasons for it.</p></speech>

Going into court and not being heard is probably one of the worst traumas that a child can experience.  Perhaps this was said, I hope the witnesses will forgive me if I missed it, but would they recommend that a therapist or somebody else be there to support children, particularly in cases in which there has been any kind of sexual violence?  Should that happen all of the time?  What are the witnesses' thoughts in that area?</p></speech>

This can happen in a variety of circumstances.  It could be the case that they wanted to talk to the judge but that the judge did not want to talk to them or did not hear their voice directly.  It could be the case that they feel what they have said has been misrepresented in some way.  Judges and people working in the courts need to be more aware of what child-friendly justice is and of how they can listen to and hear the views of children and communicate back to them.  Ms Brady raised the example of a judge doing a judgment in emojis and explaining to the children that he had heard what they said, the reasons why he did not agree with them, and what was going to happen.  When I am talking to children and young people about any area, I find that if one explains to them that one has heard them and then explains why one has come to a particular decision, they are more likely to accept it and it is likely to be easier for parents.  On the other side of it, I get calls from mothers and fathers who say their 12 year old or 15 year old is screaming and does not want to get into the car to go to access.  If an effort is made by judges, in the first instance, to explain to children why they have come to a particular decision and the reasons for that decision in a way that will not damage or traumatise them further and that is child-friendly, it could have a really big impact.</p> <p>  The Senator is right.  Support services are key.  One of the big issues I find arising on the information line I run is that people are not aware of what is there in the community.  There are actually an awful lot of supports in the community for children and young people.  Some of them have longer waiting lists than others and can be difficult to access.  That is another issue, but people are not actually aware.  They do not know that they can contact different people and get different supports.  Work on information is needed in that respect.  People need to be linked to the right places at the right time.</p></speech>

She is absolutely right.  Information about what services are available is very important for everybody who is involved in the justice system to have, if not in their heads then at least readily available to them.  They must also ensure, as far as possible, that what they are talking about is appropriate to the situation.  In the context of the criminal justice system, the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act refers to specialist support services.  It refers to information about the appropriate kind of service, if not a single service.  It is very important that those who work in the Courts Service and lawyers who regularly deal with family law cases at least have an idea of where to go to find out information or who to go to for a decent referral for a particular therapist, for example.</p> <p>  On the question of therapists being in court on the day, I am not sure if that is necessary.  It is much more important that all of the professionals have an understanding that every child is an individual and may need individually tailored supports in order to have his or her voice heard and to have a menu of options available.</p></speech>

Our waiting lists are enormous.  There are almost no services for teenagers in this circumstance.  That must be taken into account if we are looking at a joined up process the whole way through the care system for the child.  In order to ensure a child centred response, we must look at funding the resources in the community also.</p></speech>

Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh go leir as bheith anseo.  I thank our guests for attending.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said earlier, all of these issues might not be front and centre of the news very often but they have huge implications for people's right to relationships and to safety.  These are fundamental rights and it is important that we get this right.  Some of the difficulty with the <i>in camera</i>rule is that cases are dealt with away from the public eye but the rights involved are fundamental.</p><p>I am pleased to note that UCC is very well represented.  My first question is straightforward.  Our guests will have to forgive my ignorance on this matter.  There has been a lot of reference to experts.  Am I right in assuming that in the vast majority of cases, the expert being referred to is a child psychologist?  Are there examples of other experts who might be involved?</p></speech>

Are there instances in which a child might have a child protection social worker from Tusla, a guardian <i>ad litem</i>and legal representation?  How well does that work?  Does it work seamlessly?  Am I misunderstanding the process?  Is it difficult for a child to have to deal with three professionals, all of whom have slightly different responsibilities and possibly a different perspective or philosophy or does it work seamlessly?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.458" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor O'Mahony" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#O01300"><p>I would echo Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's comments in respect of the strong UCC representation.<br/><br/>To answer his question, the Child Care Act is very specific on this.  It provides for the appointment of a guardian<i>ad litem </i>or a solicitor for the child.  It is an either, or situation, so a child would not have both in a single case.  The evidence is that the mechanism in the Child Care Act whereby a solicitor can be appointed for a child is used very infrequently.  In recent years, it appears that there was only one judge in the country who was inclined to make use of that particular mechanism.  The guardian <i>ad litem</i>is the primary vehicle in a set of proceedings through which the views of the child would be communicated to the court.  There would always be a social worker involved on the Tusla side and there would be a solicitor representing Tusla in the proceedings.  A social worker would invariably be involved in presenting the evidence to the court on behalf of Tusla as to why the child should be taken into care or why there should be a supervision order put in place.  It is important to say that the social worker is not impartial.  While social workers may characterise themselves as being in the court in order to represent the child's best interests and they may have spoken to the child and may communicate that to the court, they are in court seeking a particular outcome.  It is almost equivalent to asking the mother or father in a private case what are the views of the child.  That is why the guardian <i>ad litem</i>becomes so important because he or she provides independence in terms of an analysis of the child's best interests and communicating the views of the child.  The social worker has a stake in the outcome, as it were, whereas the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is independent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.459" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Saoirse Brady" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#O01400"><p>To add to that, the new Child Care (Amendment) Bill, the most recent version of which we should see quite soon, makes provision for a child to have both a guardian ad litem and a solicitor if he or she is party to the proceedings, which is welcome.  As Dr. O'Mahony said, under section 25 a child can be joined as a party to the proceedings but that has not really happened.  That is something that we would call for because if we really want to ensure that a child is participating in proceedings, we have to assess whether he or she should be party to the proceedings.  There has been a paternalistic view of this, which holds that we should protect a child by not letting him or her be a party but the child should be involved.  Ultimately, the decision is about the child so that is something that must be addressed.  The guardian <i>ad litem</i>Bill is in preparation and that is one area that could be looked at again.<br/><br/>Child abuse experts really need to have the space and time to represent the views of the child.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides guidance in Article 12 on the views of the child.  The representative is there to say what the child thinks and not to interpret what the child thinks.  A guardian <i>ad litem</i>will talk about the best interests of the child but he or she is meant to actually relate the child's view and not to sugar coat it for the court.</p></speech>

The first arises where an expert is not appointed and there is not a lot of clarity around what should happen.  Second, there is not a lot of clarity around determining whether the child has the capacity to have his or her voice heard.  The third difficulty arises where an expert is to be appointed but the parties cannot pay for it.  Would greater clarity on the first matter, in terms of what happens if an expert is not appointed, be the most crucial issue?  Obviously, all of the difficulties have to be addressed but would the first be the most important?  Would clarity in that aspect provide for greater consistency across the board?  Does the Child Care (Amendment) Bill address any of the issues that they have identified in the context of to clarity?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.461" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor O'Mahony" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#O01600"><p>It does on that last point because it requires the court, if it is not to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, which would be the public law equivalent of the expert in the private law cases, that is, the person acting on behalf of the child and representing his or her views, it must first explain why in open court.  It must also stipulate what it is doing instead.</p><p>That is crucial because if the court is obliged to state, in open court, how it is going to ascertain the views of the child, it becomes quite difficult for the court to simply not do it.  The 2015 Act leaves the door open for that to fall by the wayside if the expert cannot be paid for.  There is nothing in the Act about what happens next and it could simply not happen.  If the court has to explain those reasons in open court, it becomes much more difficult for a court to let it slip in the manner I am describing.  That is important.</p><p> The question of how the court assesses whether the child is capable of forming the views is extremely important because that is the gateway to the obligation to hear the child kicking in.  All children who are capable of forming views must be heard.  Children who are not capable of forming views do not have to be heard.  How do we distinguish between those two groups and who distinguishes between them?  One judge might take the view that he will bring in the expert to make that assessment in the first instance.  Another judge might attempt to make that judgment himself or herself and may or may not have the skills to properly make that assessment.  Another judge might simply decide to speak to every child over a certain age and not to speak to children under that age.  That is a recipe for inconsistency.  It would be good to have some clarity on that assessment.  We have this crucial gateway concept of children being capable of forming their own views without clarity as to how we establish which children meet that criteria and which do not.</p></speech>

The voice of the child is falling by the wayside and it is difficult for cases to be dealt with because of the pressure on District Court judges and on court listings.</p> <p>  To take up what Dr. O'Mahony said, this could be dealt with in a real way if private law proceedings mirror what is happening in public law proceedings.  The court should state how it proposes to facilitate or hear the voice of the child in court at the beginning.  The court should also state why it is not going to appoint an expert to hear the child's views.  Legislative change to the 2015 Act or the 1964 Act is all that is required.  Judges obviously have to follow the law.  It is not a hugely difficult for this committee to make a recommendation for change in its report.  That could be done and would result in the kind of situation where rights that are slipping by the wayside would be put front and centre.</p> <p>  The difficulty and opposition that might be encountered from the Government is that there is no doubt that change would impose real resource obligations on District Court judges which the Government may not wish to resource.  Without that type of provision in the 2015 Act, it is only really paying lip service to the voice of the child.</p></speech>

Something like guidelines for judges on how to carry out this function could be introduced.  All the other professionals involved, including lawyers, should be trained how to communicate and work with children.  It is something we are already doing within the court system.  It is worth pointing out that the children's court talks and listens to children all day, every day.  Children go in and give evidence within that specially designed system.  We could learn a lot from how the professionals and the judges in that system engage with children.  Talking to a child is not an alien concept we have never encountered before within the legal system.  We do not need to work on something brand new.  We need to look at what is already in place here and in other jurisdictions, as Dr. O'Mahony set out earlier.  There is a lot out there and it could be done quite easily with a legislative amendment and some other supporting pieces of work such as training and guidance.</p></speech>

We have talked about the failures of the criminal justice system.  Tusla and HIQA made some urgent recommendations around specialisation last summer.  HIQA was clear that the specialisation was not there for the people doing the assessments and talking to these children and HIQA needed to work on that urgently.  It was training specialist interviewers, the most recent tranche of whom came out in January.  If Tusla does not catch that, these cases are not going to turn up in public family law.  The next net for them to fall into is private family law.  There is then a situation whereby experts are publicly funded when we have not got the regulation right yet as to specialisation and provision and the cost will be &euro;2,000 to &euro;4,000.  There is not another safety net if one does not have that money.  That is the last safety net and that child falls through another crack.</p></speech>

People can respond if they wish.  I want to make an observation on the issue of access and that kind of stuff.  Ms Brady picked up this, and it is a point I have previously raised about contact centres.  For a time, I was on the board of management of a family centre in Togher in Cork that had a top-class, excellent contact facility.  An issue was raised locally by Judge Con O'Leary.  At one stage, it was in a position to facilitate contact from Tusla referrals and referrals from Judge Con O'Leary and, more generally, from family cases.  The only contact it currently provides is where there is a child protection issue and that reduces the scope and the options available to family law judges.  It has really excellent facilities and huge potential and I would very much advocate and support greater investment in it.</p> <p>  On access and maintaining relationships, as far as I can see, an awful lot of local authorities do not properly take into account where an applicant to the housing list has access rights.  They are very often treated as single applicants and that is an issue that needs to be addressed.  I frequently come across that issue.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh touched on another issue I frequently come across.  Maintenance is a significant issue for an awful lot of parents.  In the overwhelming number of cases, mothers have difficulty getting maintenance to which they are entitled.  They often do not want to go down the formal route and accessing maintenance can be difficult.  There is a child maintenance service in Britain, although I am not very familiar with the mechanism involved.  I do not know if any of our guests are familiar with it or if they have any views on whether it is good, bad or something we should consider.</p></speech>

For example, one family advocated, and continues to advocate, for a child maintenance agency like the one in Britain because there are difficulties in getting the maintenance.  The issue of money can exacerbate an already tense situation and the fallout usually lands on the children in the withholding of access visits.  There is something in looking at that idea.</p> <p>  Maintenance is also sometimes used in terms of social welfare access and social welfare payments and there were measures in the 2019 budget to address that.  We will hopefully start to see a streamlining of that.  An agency that could be put in place to address the real issues in family issues should be explored.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.468" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Keith Walsh" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#P00700"><p>I agree with the agency concept.  A simplification of maintenance or more transparency so people have a better idea of what they are entitled to would be welcome.  Maintenance is something that helps people out of poverty, particularly if they are trying to cope with children on their own.  We should have a more streamlined system for maintenance.  It is really a kind of means tested exercise, to a great degree, involving children.  There must be a more efficient way than the way we are currently dealing with it.  There would certainly be an argument for maintenance to be dealt with in a more streamlined way and any reform of the court structure should look at that.  We should look at the enforcement of payment, but also how do we get there and is there a way to do it quicker.</p></speech>

They are slightly different.  The first is really an observation.</p><p> On the evidence from RCNI, I was generally aware of the low charge and conviction rates for sexual crimes but I had no idea it was as low for sexual violence against children.  I am just shocked at that low level.  I echo the witnesses' call for greater research and information on this because the rate is appallingly low.</p><p> I will make two final points.  I am interested in the point about facilities.  It seems to me that there may potentially be a need for significant capital investment to bring our courts of State up to scratch.  I do not necessarily expect this to be outlined on the floor of the committee, but if anyone is aware of any detailed document outlining the level of capital expenditure that would be required, I am sure it be useful to provide it to the committee.  I am also interested in the point made by Dr. O'Mahony and a few others, I think, that there may be scope for more flexible approaches in respect of other buildings.  That is very interesting.</p><p> I will ask a final question.  We may consider this at a later date, but it would be remiss of me not to pose the question.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is bringing forward a referendum on divorce which would remove the matter from the Constitution.  We have not seen the detail of the proposition, but the indication is that legislation would accompany it providing for a reduction in the period of separation required, I think, from four in five years in the Constitution to two out of three years in legislation.  Will the witnesses outline even a brief initial view on the legislative end of this, whether it is the right approach, whether it is too restrictive or whether it is not restrictive enough?</p></speech>

We have a two-tier system at present whereby one can apply for judicial separation and then one applies for divorce.  This is doing the same thing twice, so there are delays and also cost involved.  I would certainly welcome the referendum.  I think it will bring about huge improvements in family law if it is remitted to legislation in order that the period is reduced to one or two years.  It will be hugely beneficial.</p></speech>

Regarding the rate of conviction, by and large this committee is used to Rape Crisis Network Ireland coming before it on criminal matters.  We do not necessarily come here very often to discuss civil matters.  We are here because of the failure rate in respect of criminal matters.  It is very important we get that part right.  We are also very conscious that there is a whole set of other things that happen before a case ever gets into civil law matters.  This is why we are abdicating on the national strategy on child sexual violence.  While this part can be fixed, attention also needs to be paid to all the others across the whole of Government and the entire system.</p></speech>

I have just a couple of comments and questions I do not think have been discussed.  There is mention of creation of a specialist courts structure, and it is mentioned that a constitutional amendment would not be required in this regard.  Could this be performed by the president of the District Court in any event, without necessarily having to engage with the Oireachtas?  Could it involve Government regarding funding in the Courts Service?  Do we need to have it mandated or structured by the Oireachtas?  What I would like to know is how many more judges we would require.  Would existing District Court judges be siloed into a specific family law structure?  How many more do they reckon we would need?  The practical requirements for structuring are kind of a separate place.  Would it be a regional system or would it mirror our existing District Court model?  Those are just some of my questions.  I will try to bank them together.</p> <p>  Regarding the regulations that were introduced and how the capping of the fees has made things worse, how can this be changed?  Just so I can understand, is the &euro;250 the whole fee?  What is the fee structure?  Perhaps our guests could provide more detail on that.  Is it capped at &euro;250 per specialist or is the fee for each general consultation?  Would a number of people be involved?  Will our guests answer those questions first.</p></speech>

If one qualifies for legal aid, the Legal Aid Board will pay for the assessor in one's case, so that is slightly different.  The difficulty with the regulation is that it caps the total amount payable on a particular section 32-type report, which means that if one charges more than that, one is in breach of the law.  This is the real difficulty, that one will be doing something unlawful if one charges for a section 32-type report specified in the regulations.  This has a fairly chilling effect on experts.</p> <p>  Regarding the courts structure, the difficulty at present in the courts is that the president of the District Court has no great coercive power over other judges.  If one were to get into this, one would probably be straying into constitutional territory as well, but my understanding is that the Department of Justice and Equality has examined this.  It is at quite an advanced stage in that there may be potentially a draft Bill on specialist courts.  I am sure this committee could liaise with the Department on where it is with this.  The Law Society would see it as perhaps between ten and 14 hubs, if you like, where there would be a Circuit Court and a District Court sitting.  We are looking at a family law division, whereby a president of the family law division or a judge would be assigned as - the title probably would not have to be "president", but something else.  That person would be in charge of the division in the Circuit Court and the District Court.</p></speech>

The Law Society held a number of conferences and seminars on this about five or six years ago and four years ago at which we discussed the advisability of limiting judges to family law.  There was a concern among practitioners that if judges were to remain in family law for the entirety of their careers and were not switched around, it generally would not be a good thing, that it is advisable to get a mix of practice such that one comes into family law and stays there for a number of years and then may do it.  We want a general judge.  There are a number of judges who were appointed as specialist judges in the Circuit Court for insolvency arrangements and cases having regard to the capacity Act, which only recently came in.  Some of those judges are not sitting at all because they are specialist judges in the Circuit Court and there are no cases for them and because if one is appointed as a specialist judge, one cannot do other, more general work.  Those judges could be released immediately if they could be changed from specialists.  We are therefore not generally in favour of the appointment of specialist judges.  We are in favour of judges being properly trained and getting specialist experience.  We want a wide breadth of talent.  There are particular skills one picks up in other areas, particularly in criminal law, such that one is familiar with a variety of disciplines before one sits on the bench and when one is on the bench.  That is the Law Society's viewpoint.  We think one should be appointed as a general judge but one is assigned to this division.  Again, that can be done administratively and legislatively.</p></speech>

If legislation is passed to deal with an issue, resources may be allocated to that as a consequence.  The court rules are amended by statutory instruments, which have a different function.  To make this work would require a specific and detailed family law courts Act.  The publication of such a Bill would get all the stakeholders involved and substantially progress the issue.  The fact that the committee is looking at this area has substantially progressed things.  A significant number of new facts that have come to everybody's attention in the context of this hearing, which is very useful.</p></speech>

However, that has only had application in the Dublin metropolitan district and, to an extent, to travelling judges.  As alluded to by Dr. Walsh, the President of the District Court is limited in what he or she can do in respect of a District Court hearing in Letterkenny, Cork or elsewhere.  A relatively limited amount can be achieved using that approach.  If one wants this dealt with on a more consistent and unified basis across the system, one must go down the legislative route to bring in rules that will apply in the same way in each venue.  We have a system with a very strong concept of judicial independence.  To a certain extent, judges operate in independent kingdoms and that, broadly speaking, is one of the reasons for the level of inconsistency in family law.  It is also evident in the inconsistency in judicial training: some judges are very keen to take up judicial training, but others are not.  Under the current structure, it is very difficult to insist that judges undergo such training.  However, if the issue were tackled on a legislative basis, one could set out the characteristics of a family court in a more structured way, which may address some of those issues.</p></speech>

I studied family law.  From an academic perspective it is very difficult to access case law, particularly given the anonymisation of parties.  How can that issue be dealt with even from an academic point of view?  Dr. Walsh mentioned the media perspective and the difficulties involved in getting an allocation and reporting family law cases.  From an academic perspective, what could the State do to facilitate more collaboration on an ongoing basis in order to drive consistency from the academic pillar and allow a higher degree of case reporting?  That would promote consistency across the Judiciary.</p></speech>

I participated in a study in involving a qualitative study of District Court childcare proceedings and looking at child protection in particular.  We ran into many difficulties with the in camera rule in the study.  At the time, we wrote to the Minister for Justice and Equality expressing our view that the in camera rule was having a chilling effect on that kind of research.  To put it simply, we were able to speak to professionals such as judges, solicitors, barristers, social workers and guardians <i>ad litem</i>, but could not speak to parents or children involved in the proceedings.  Obviously, that is a very significant gap in the research we were able to produce.  However, if we had gone down the road of trying to speak to parties, we would have immediately risked being in violation of the in camera rule.  An exception to the rule in regard to courtroom observation has enabled Dr. Carol Coulter to engage in the childcare reporting project whereby she may sit at the back of the court and observe and report on proceedings.  There is a similar exception for journalists but it is not being utilised to any great degree, as was mentioned.  However, research comes in many shapes and sizes.  Research involving he qualitative process of speaking to people who have been involved in proceedings or reviewing case files, for example, is currently very difficult to conduct because of the nature of the in camera rule.  It would be fantastic if there were some flexibility in that regard to accommodate a broader variety of research that would help to inform some of the decisions we need to make in the future.  I would love to see a recommendation in that respect in the report of the committee.</p></speech>

I have been impressed by their answers.  There are no winners in the family courts.  Whether it is the mother, the father or the children, somebody loses out.  I am no expert on family law.  The facilities in family law courts are ridiculous.  A child could walk in the door of the court with one parent and, a couple of hours later, leave with the other parent.  To me, there are no winners.  My main concerns are the heavy caseload of judges and whether judges make the right decisions.  Not a week passes without a mother or a father coming to my constituency office and stating that a certain judge usually sides with women or men or does not have sufficient expertise to hear the case.  What is our guests' impression of family law judges?  Certain judges may know more about particular topics.  In general, are judges making the right decisions?</p></speech>

For example, in Kildare there are family law sittings on the first and third Mondays of each month, with 80 to 100 cases listed on those days.  It is impossible for a judge to hear the voice of the child in each of those cases.  A judge will do his or her best to deal with the cases in the best possible way but that inevitably means that cases will be adjourned and put back to the next list.  Every list is full.  Judges are in a very difficult position.  There probably is a need for more judges.  There are certainly more cases in the system.  Judges should have enough time to deal with the issues properly.</p></speech>

In the absence of data and research, one gets myths, some of which are very mistaken.  However, we cannot show that until we have data.  We very much endorse Dr. O'Mahony's proposal regarding the capacity to carry out qualitative research and speak to the service users, namely, parents and children, to ask them their experience is crucially important.  Quantitative data is also critically important because in its absence there are myths that we cannot prove right or wrong.  Much time and energy is spent trying to understand whether what is happening in the courts is right but we simply do not have the data to make that judgment.</p></speech>

However, we have evidence that judicial personality and preferences play a significant role.  For example, the project in which I was involved identified that some judges almost always appoint guardians <i>ad litem</i>, others do so in certain circumstances and others who are very slow to do so.  Judges seem to have set preferences that come through very strongly.  One of the most interesting things a judge stated during the compilation of the study was &quot;I don't know what my colleagues are doing&quot;.  In other words, judges are operating in silos and not necessarily looking at other examples of practice in order to try to gain consistency but, rather, doing their own thing in their own areas.</p></speech>

I want to go back to my busy constituency office in Dundalk.  Three fathers came into me this week alone and the reason they came in this week is because they realised that this was coming up in the Committee on Justice and Equality and that all of the witnesses would be here today.  They are saying to me that their voices are being muted, they feel as though they are being undervalued and they feel that as society is changing, fathers should play a bigger role in this.  One of the fathers said to me that fathers feel as though they are being under-represented and being actively excluded from the decision-making process and all matters pertaining to family law.  Do the witnesses feel as though these stakeholders have been omitted from the process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.511" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Keith Walsh" time="09:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#S00400"><p>We have flagged anecdotally that there is a problem with fathers because of the change in society.  I have been doing this work for about 20 years and there is a much greater involvement from fathers now than at the start of that period and there is also a great change in the role of both parents in terms of how involved they are with their children.  One of the real difficulties for fathers in Dublin, where I practise, is accommodation.  The result of a judicial separation or the end of a relationship is that one of the two people is not living with the other one and it is usually the father who is living in different accommodation.  The challenge is to get accommodation that is child friendly or even capable of having an overnight with the child.  At the minute in Dublin, unless one is on a significant salary, that challenge is huge.  If one is not living near one's children, the reality is that one does not see them as much and does not have as much contact with them.<br/><br/>The judges are trying to work with that and to some degree, our system of justice is an adversarial one.  It is up to the lawyers to put it up to the judges as well.  It is not inquisitorial justice where the judge intervenes.  An awful lot of family law cases are resolved by settlement, particularly judicial separation and divorce, which is where marital couples deal with custody and access issues.  Non-marital couples deal with it in the District Court, which is a lot more summary justice.  There is an unfair distinction between marital cases and non-marital cases because of the venue for the proceedings, how they are dealt with and the amount of time given to them.  Cases in the High Court will get the most time, the Circuit Court would get a bit less time and cases in the District Court get an awful lot less time.  That is reflected in the costs of the cases as well.<br/><br/>The <i>in camera</i>rule is unhelpful as well.  The difficulty is that there is a perception that fathers should perhaps be happy with every second weekend and one overnight during the week and some fathers will be happy with that but for fathers who are not happy with that kind of traditional model of access, it means that they probably have to go and get an expert report which will support their contention that they should have more access.  They can do that and they can dig their heels in but they have to dig their heels in a bit and it is not automatic.  One gets the report and one advocates for access but it can be done.  Most solicitors would push that for their clients but it does require a push and if one is fighting on a number of fronts in a case to do with finances, maintenance, a house and negotiating a mortgage, the children, who may be the most important part of it, sometimes get a bit lost in the mix.  The father is trying to juggle a full-time job, deal with his life, deal with access and deal with the breakdown of a relationship so it is understandable why people might not push it.  Ms Coughlan mentioned that we require some fairly serious quantitative research on the type of access orders that are being made and to lift the <i>in camera</i>rule and allow people who have been through the process to speak to someone such as Dr. Carol Coulter or other independent academics about their experience.  The family law courts need to reflect this and there is probably a need for training in this area as well to move it on.  As practitioners, without any objective evidence, based on our own cases and meetings, we believe that there are problems for fathers and that it is harder for fathers to get the access they want than it should be.  If it was a fair system that it the way it would work.</p></speech>

I would expect that the decisions in courts would somewhat reflect that.  They would not necessarily absolutely mirror that because we can see that once a family breaks up there might be a change in that pattern in terms of who is doing the primary caring.  To echo what Dr. O'Mahony said, is it the case that there are voices being muted?  What we are hearing is that all parties are being muted here.  We are not hearing from all parties.  To build a case and an argument on anecdotes may not be very helpful.  What we really need is the quantitative data that will allow us to actually say what we are looking at and have a conversation because we probably need a conversation about this but until we have the data in front of us, we cannot have that conversation.</p></speech>

What I mean by that is that I believe that one can represent oneself if one makes an application but one cannot take anyone else in unless they are either a solicitor or a barrister.  I spoke to a young lad from Dundalk recently who went to the family court and wanted to take in a friend of his to represent him but he was not allowed to take his friend in.  Is it true that one has to be either a solicitor or a barrister to represent a client?</p></speech>

Those are the current rules.  I said earlier that a person is quite entitled to represent themselves in court and they often do so because of the delays in getting legal aid.  There are many reasons people represent themselves in court but the<i>in camera</i>rule is to preserve the sanctity and the importance of family law proceedings.  The alternative might very well be that everybody would be walking in and sitting in on family law proceedings and that would not be optimum either.</p></speech>

There is a provision for that and a potential for that but the difficulty is around what the effect on the other person is if one is bringing in friends or relations.  There is a balance that a judge would have to strike in those types of proceedings as to how they can deal with the <i>in camera</i>rule and how they will enforce it.</p></speech>

It is the right thing to do because many people would go in and could be very nervous with a solicitor or barrister and they would feel a wee bit safer if they had someone beside them who they actually know.  The other half would not have a problem with that because it normally would not be a family member, it would be someone who might have similar experience who is trying to help the person to get the issue sorted out.  As I said earlier on, the most important thing is for the child to be sorted out.  I know it is in a closed room but I just cannot understand how someone cannot take someone else in with them to help them along the way because there are a lot of nervous individuals who like to have someone accompanying them to help them along.  To me, it does not seem fair.</p></speech>

However, if the <i>in camera</i>rule is interpreted strictly, which we tend to do in family law cases in this country, then that person is not a party to the proceedings, nor are they a legal representative and therefore the<i>in camera</i>rule essentially kicks in.</p><p>I have encountered the situation described, where somebody had a person to accompany him or her who was asked to leave by the judge.  That is the way the <i>in camera</i>rule is applied.</p></speech>

I cannot understand why it is means-tested.  A Deputy was recently able to get legal aid and, in fairness, Deputies are pretty well paid.  I cannot understand how a mum or dad who cannot afford to get a solicitor or barrister cannot go in and get legal aid.  There seem to be two different approaches to family courts and other courts.  Can the witnesses explain that?</p></speech>

It is based on one's income but it is also weighted such that a person might get some credit if he or she has a mortgage, if he or she is the primary carer of the children.  It does not just depend on how much a person earns but also on the outgoings and what they are for.  Most legal aid is means-tested but it depends on the urgency of it.  It is a very bureaucratic system, with hoops to get through of submitting one's financial documentation and being put on a waiting list.  I do not think anybody could disagree that more people should be eligible for free legal aid from the Legal Aid Board.  It is rigorous because it has been judicially reviewed a number of times about how it conducts its mean-testing.  In my dealing with it on behalf of clients, I witnessed it in practice and I worked for the Legal Aid Board for a while.  Inside the system, it seems very difficult to get through the hoops of getting legal aid.</p></speech>

I can easily envisage a situation where the other person might be unrepresented or might be particularly vulnerable and might find this quite intimidating, especially if the McKenzie friend seems to be dominating the proceedings by taking an inordinately long time to whisper instructions, advice or such in the other person's ear.  One wonders about equality of arms and such.  A McKenzie friend in a family law setting is a tricky situation.  I would be happier with everybody being represented by a competent lawyer who, after all, has professional responsibilities not just to the client but to the court and his or her own professional body.  If a lawyer misbehaves, there are sanctions.  With great respect to McKenzie friends, since I am sure many are very responsible, good people, I would rather know that anybody there who is representing or assisting somebody in court has some training and some professional structure.</p></speech>

The severity of the <i>in camera</i>rule in Ireland means that Deputy Fitzpatrick is right that one will not be able to get somebody into court unless that person is a lawyer or a party to the case.</p></speech>

I believe that solicitors are obliged, at the time, to provide their clients with the cost of the procedure in writing.  My question for the Law Society is whether that is actually happening.  When solicitors meet their clients, are they sending them information on the breakdown of the cost?</p> <p>  The Law Society states that fees must be reasonable for the work undertaken and if a person is not happy, he or she can complain to the Law Society of Ireland.  Are there many complaints to the Law Society of Ireland about the costs for solicitors or barristers?</p></speech>

That does not state exactly what they are but sets out the rough basis for their costs.  It could be an hourly charge.  The solicitor could say that he or she normally charges a certain amount but that it may be something else if a certain thing happens.  It is not a precise estimate, simply the basis for the cost.  This will change radically in the coming months when section 150 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 comes into effect because a much more detailed estimate of solicitors' and barristers' costs will be required at the beginning of the case.  The system is currently more general but will get much more precise when the Legal Services Regulatory Authority brings in its complaint aspect.  The Legal Services Regulatory Authority is an independent body separate from the Law Society and solicitors, which was set up by the Government to deal with this.  There is currently a reasonably broad range of ways to satisfy the cost requirement and estimate.  It will get much more precise for solicitors and much better for consumers when section 150 comes in.</p> <p>  The Deputy's second question related to complaints.  The level of complaints to the Law Society is at an all-time low.  There are some complaints about costs but they are at one of the lowest historical levels with regard to both costs and other issues.  Costs are just one of the issues that people may complain about with regard to solicitors.</p></speech>

If a solicitor has to go to court on one day, that will cost a certain amount, but if there are constant adjournments, that will inevitably add to the cost.  If the system could be improved, I firmly believe that the cost will come down.  If a solicitor is in for just one day instead of four days, that would make a significant difference.</p></speech>

The committee has met representatives of several Departments, agencies, representative bodies and other bodies on the theme of sustaining small rural and community business and we are delighted to have representatives of Enterprise Ireland and Offaly County Council's local enterprise office, LEO, with us today.  The committee has also considered the implications of Brexit for communities in rural and urban Ireland.  We would be interested to hear how we might mitigate the effects of Brexit.  Investment in rural broadband and digital technologies opens up opportunities for rural Ireland.  At the last meeting of the committee on 6 February we discussed smart communities and remote working with the Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development, Deputy Canney, and representatives of Grow Remote.</p><p>Today we welcome representatives of Abodoo, which has worked with Wexford County Council in preparing a talent heat map for County Wexford.  Abodoo is also involved in local hubs, Enterprise Ireland, local authorities and LEOs in encouraging local employment.  Representatives from HQ Tralee are also present and there is an interesting story about its successes with co-working hubs in Tralee and Listowel in County Kerry.  I welcome the following witnesses to the meeting: Mr. Mark Christal, Mr. Michael Brougham and Ms Rowena Dwyer from Enterprise Ireland; Ms Anna Marie Delaney, Ms Orla Martin and Ms Geraldine Beirne from Offaly County Council LEO; Ms Vanessa Tierney and Ms Louise O'Conor from Abodoo; and Mr. Ken Tobin of HQ Tralee and Tralee Chamber Alliance.</p><p>I remind members, staff, witnesses and people in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile telephones as they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult to report on the meeting.  Please check that your mobile telephones are switched off.  In addition, members and witnesses should ensure that nothing is obstructing the microphones in front of them.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Michael Brougham, regional director for the midlands and mid-east, and Ms Rowena Dwyer, manager of our policy, planning and corporate relations department.  I intend to use my statement as a brief, not to go through it in full but to select the key points.<br/><br/>Enterprise Ireland's primary remit is to support indigenous companies engaged in manufacturing and internationally traded services.  The agency also has a responsibility for foreign direct investment in the food and natural resources area.  The majority of the companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  Through a national network of ten offices the agency works with these companies to assist them to start, innovate, grow their business, target and secure export sales in international markets and strengthen their competitiveness.  These companies cross a wide range of sectors and are located in every county throughout the country.<br/><br/>Enterprise Ireland works in partnership with a wide range of enterprise development partners to support a regional enterprise development agenda.  These include the local enterprise offices, the business incubation centres and the Design &amp;amp; Crafts Council of Ireland, whose funding comes through Enterprise Ireland.  In addition, upon direction from the Government, the agency administers funding schemes to non-agency clients, such as the online retail scheme launched by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in late 2018 to support eligible SMEs in the retail sector to develop a more competitive online offer.<br/><br/><b><i></i></b>Reflecting the strength of the Irish economy and of global markets in 2018, Enterprise Ireland companies reported strong employment performance.  In 2018 the employment survey reported the highest employment in the history of the agency with 215,207 people employed in Enterprise Ireland-supported companies, 9,119 new jobs created after losses are taken into account and employment growth across all regions.  Our clients play an important role in the regional economy.  For example, in 2018 some 64% of employment was in client companies located outside Dublin and 61% of new jobs reported were created in companies located outside Dublin.  Enterprise Ireland-supported companies sustain over 375,000 direct and indirect jobs nationwide.  The total spend in the economy from Enterprise Ireland clients across payroll and goods and services purchased reached &euro;26.79 billion in 2017.</p><p>Through our network of 33 international offices, Enterprise Ireland has assisted client companies to increase their exports to a record &euro;22.7 billion in 2017, a growth of 7% compared to 2016's exporting results.  Importantly, Enterprise Ireland's clients are increasingly diversifying their global footprint beyond the UK.</p><p> We work with client companies under a number of key pillars.  First is our work with start-up companies.  We have provided full details of that work in the written submission provided to the committee.  Worth noting is Enterprise Ireland's new frontiers development programme, the national entrepreneur development programme for early-stage startups, which is run in partnership with 14 institutes of technology throughout the country.  Between 2016 and 2018, Enterprise Ireland supported 496 entrepreneurs across the country on this programme.  Innovation is essential for companies to be competitive internationally and to win market share.  Enterprise Ireland is working with its clients to drive innovation activity via a number of supports  In terms of market diversification, Enterprise Ireland is actively working with companies with global ambition to internationalise, and in doing so, diversify their global footprint.  Competitiveness is critical for companies to scale, internationalise and assist client companies to stay ahead of competition.  In 2018, Enterprise Ireland launched an operational excellence offer.  This offer supports established SMEs to target a whole of company transformation, including capital investment, business innovation and training.</p><p> There are some challenges of which we are, obviously, very mindful.  The outcome of the Brexit negotiations remains uncertain.  Brexit will result in increased costs and trade disruptions for both exporting and importing companies.  To support client companies navigate potential challenges, Enterprise Ireland has engaged in a programme of building resilience in Irish exporting companies, focused on innovation, market diversification and competitiveness, and addressing the awareness and preparedness of companies to Brexit.  Being prepared for Brexit is critical for companies as long-term, structural and disruptive change will emerge.  To promote awareness and supported by a national Prepare for Brexit campaign, Enterprise Ireland has developed and launched a Brexit SME scorecard, an interactive online platform which can be used by all companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.  To date over 4,435 companies have utilised this scorecard.  The agency has also launched a Be Prepared grant to support the costs of SME clients up to &euro;5,000 in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise the opportunities arising from Brexit.  To date, 156 companies have been approved for support under this initiative.  Enterprise Ireland client companies are taking action to prepare for Brexit.  A September 2017 survey reported that 38% of clients surveyed had taken Brexit actions.  In May 2018 this figure increased to 85% of client companies surveyed.  The survey reported that client companies are taking action in areas such as market diversification, developing strategic partnerships, improving operational competitiveness, improving financial management and strengthening business in the UK.</p><p> Skills remain a key focus of the agency.  Investment in skills and human capital is critical to driving innovation, competitiveness and diversification in Irish businesses.  As the economy approaches full employment, the challenges of matching enterprise skills needs with available labour supply comes into greater focus.  In partnership with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the agency is supporting client companies to identify and address their critical skills needs.</p><p> I turn to support for enterprise development in the regions.  Enterprise Ireland is seeking to ensure that all regions throughout the country are growing optimally based on their innate and unique strengths and capabilities.  In this way, jobs will be sustained, created and future proofed and the reach of the agency's client base will be expanded.  Within an Enterprise Ireland context, there are three critical components of this.  First, we support client companies to grow in all regions.  Second, we are building a regional infrastructure that can support enterprise activity including co-working.  Third, we are harnessing the enterprise potential of regions and the entrepreneurial assets within them.  Enterprise Ireland has made a significant investment in supporting the establishment of infrastructure that can house enterprise activity in regions throughout the country.  Details are presented in the table included in our written submission and include the national network of business innovation centres and specialist bio-incubation facilities, community enterprise centres, regional accelerators and business innovation centres.  I note also the community enterprise initiative under which 32 projects received funding to support public and private community enterprises.  The investment detailed has increased the capacity of regions to offer co-working spaces.  Co-working facilities have an important role to play in the rebalancing of regional growth nationally.  These facilities can help regions to retain skills and talent and assist companies with skills retention.  Giving workers the ability to remain in their localities daily has a positive economic and social impact locally.</p><p> Under its regional enterprise development fund, Enterprise Ireland has approved &euro;60 million in investment for 42 projects located throughout the country.  This competitive fund, provided by Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation through Enterprise Ireland, is a key action to support the Regional Action Plan for Jobs, regional enterprise plans and the Action Plan for Rural Development.  In line with its investment in regions to date, corporate strategy and national enterprise and regional development policy, the agency will undertake initiatives that will foster an environment where jobs will be created and sustained in regions allowing people to live and work in their local areas.  Such initiatives will include fostering increased resilience and productivity within client companies throughout all regions to enhance productivity and agility to respond to economic shocks, such as those emerging from any kind of Brexit; balancing regional development in rural, urban and regional city locations by maximising the investment in regional infrastructure, such as that in co-working facilities, to retain mobile talent in the regions, and making second sites in regional locations a feasible strategy for agency clients with growth plans.  We are also seeking to secure food FDI projects in regions and to address the skills challenge facing clients.</p><p> Enterprise Ireland is aware that further efforts are needed to ensure that companies are resilient to the challenges they face as they start and scale in regions throughout the country.  The agency understands the important positive and social impact these companies play in their local areas.  To this end, the agency will continue to work with client companies to support their efforts on innovation, competitiveness and diversification, which are the key attributes of internationally competitive companies.  Second sites, skills needs and co-working spaces in regions that build on the agency's investment will also be a key focus.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to work with Government and non-governmental stakeholders to support rural, urban and regional city development so that client companies can build on their ambitious strategies to sustain and create jobs throughout the country.  I welcome any questions on these activities and thank the committee for the opportunity to talk with its members this morning.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Ms Anna Marie Delaney, chief executive of Offaly County Council and Ms Geraldine Beirne, business adviser with our local enterprise office.  For the purposes of this statement, I intend to address four areas, namely local enterprise office, or LEO, involvement; the local authority contribution; the wider context, future development and policy suggestions.  <br/><br/>There are 31 LEOs across the local authority network.  A LEO is the first stop shop for anyone wishing to start a business in Ireland.  LEOs also promote entrepreneurship and act as advocates and catalysts for the establishment of a best-practice enterprise culture.  Across the network of 31 LEO offices, staff are actively involved in supporting co-working hubs.  Some do this through local authority hubs and some do it through their involvement with publicly supported designated activity companies, DACs, or companies limited by guarantee, CLGs.<br/><br/>The primary focus of LEOs is to encourage entrepreneurship and start-ups.  In this context, managed co-working hubs are a valuable addition to the ecosystem of enterprise supports.  They provide much more than a physical centre for start-ups and expanding enterprises.  The interactions between early stage entrepreneurs, remote workers, more experienced business owners and LEO staff and supports contribute strongly to the enterprise culture of a town or village.  Tenants may or may not be directly supported, depending on the nature of the relevant business, but a wide cohort is supported through LEO entrepreneurial development programmes, networking and other business supports.<i></i>I refer in particular to sector-specific hubs.  Managed co-working hubs with sectoral themes provide new opportunities to develop clusters of expertise and innovation.  Sector-specific hubs include food hubs and other hubs with a defined theme.  For example, we established The Junction business innovation centre in Offaly in 2015.  This centre has a special focus on design, software and renewable energies.  We are building on this with funding of almost &euro;500,000 from Enterprise Ireland's regional development fund to develop the STREAM creative suite in Birr.  This new co-working hub will leverage the big data generated from the Irish low frequency array, I-LOFAR, radio telescope and connect researchers and businesses in areas using big data.</p><p>The theme is STREAM, an acronym for science, technology, research, engineering, arts and mathematics.  The businesses include everything from animation to astronomy to robotics to telecoms to software.  A dedicated hub such as this can create a very compelling proposition for IDA Ireland to attract related foreign direct investment to the area.  Furthermore, sector specific hubs can be a beacon for members of the diaspora looking to return or invest in their home counties.</p><p> The Local Government Reform Act 2014 provided for the strengthening of the role of the local authorities in economic, social and community development.  Over recent years, local authorities have been contributing to the delivery of the physical infrastructure of co-working hubs and, in many cases, have been providing support for operational costs.  Some hubs have been undertaken directly by local authorities and others have been delivered with support funding through LEADER, the town and village renewal scheme, urban and rural regeneration and Enterprise Ireland regional development funds.  Furthermore, local authorities have been providing supports for the development of smart communities via the local authority network of broadband officers.  They also prioritise needs through the network of 296 broadband communication points throughout Ireland and collaborate with providers and funders to provide fibre and Wi-Fi solutions for businesses, communities and tourist areas.  Library services provide meeting rooms and space for informal hot-desking and for pre-start-ups researching business ideas.  The local community and development committees assist community groups to incorporate co-working spaces into community centres.  With regard to skills audits and commuter surveys, local authorities, in conjunction with the LEOs and business support units, are commissioning research data to stimulate economic investment.  These data will also highlight opportunities for remote working and cluster development.</p><p> In a wider context, remote working in all of its forms can be very beneficial to individuals, businesses, communities and the environment.  Volunteer groups such as Grow Remote are playing an important role in communicating the benefits of remote working.  Individuals can benefit from reduced commutes and increased work-life balance.  By introducing remote working, businesses can retain staff and grow staff numbers by accessing a wider talent pool.  Communities benefit as busy co-working hubs contribute to vibrant towns and villages.  This, in turn, leads to increased spend in the locality.  The environment benefits from a reduction in carbon emissions.  A reduction of commuters benefits Dublin and allows it thrive as an international business and visitor destination.  The inclusion of remote working and co-working hubs as strategic objectives or supporting actions in a number of the regional enterprise plans demonstrates the importance of the concept and commitment to further development.</p><p> With regard to future development and policy suggestions, leveraging the opportunities of co-working hubs requires skilled managers.  At present, the funding supports for managers are for three years' salary.  We suggest funding support for five years would be more appropriate to allow the centres the required timescale to become viable and self-sustaining.</p><p> The next phase is enhanced connectivity between hubs and will involve exploring ways to support a formal network of co-working hubs so as to leverage economies of scale in research, collaboration, training and funding opportunities, include landing spaces for foreign direct investment and explore ways to facilitate IDA Ireland companies to establish an initial footprint in a town or region via the use of co-working hubs.  The promotion of co-working hubs and other forms of remote working could benefit from legislation on developing a national policy on remote working.  This could include appropriate legislation on employment law and could enable remote working to become the norm.  We reference the UK flexible working regulations of 2014.  Employers could be incentivised through consideration of an enhanced Revenue scheme or allowance for remote workers.  There could also be public sector pilots that explore opportunities for public sector employees.  This could include enhanced opportunities for remote working, either from home or through the use of dedicated co-working hubs in local authority buildings on a reciprocal basis.</p><p> I thank committee members for their time.  The document pack we have provided includes details of some initiatives taking place throughout the country.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Louise O'Connor.  We launched Abodoo in Gorey in north County Wexford.  We were a LEO client and have moved on to Enterprise Ireland.  We launched a year and a quarter ago from a co-working space, so we have a personal story about the impact of co-working on our business.</p> <p>  I have been involved in recruitment and talent acquisition for more than 15 years.  Seven or eight years ago I was restricted from working because of illness and I could not commute.  It was then I began to realise that around the globe many professionals could be working but for whatever reason, such as family commitments or childcare, they are restricted from doing so.  The reason we are here today is to speak about a successful pilot we ran in Wexford with the support of Wexford LEO and the local authority.  We had a real opportunity to identify the skills in County Wexford and present them to companies considering locations throughout the country.  If we look at Ireland, our unemployment rate is very low, which is brilliant, but we still have 79 unemployment blackspots throughout the country.  Mirroring these with co-working capacity provides a real opportunity to position rural Ireland as an opportunity for companies.</p> <p>  There are three key pillars for inward investment in rural Ireland.  The first is office space and capacity, and the Abodoo platform now lists more than 200 co-working spaces, which means there is at least one in every county.  The second pillar is connectivity, and this is improving.  From a remote working perspective, there are no connectivity challenges to working in rural Ireland at present because every county has connectivity and every co-working space has the best connectivity.  I moved back from England four years ago to 3 Mb broadband in the house.  We now have 140 Mb, so there is a real opportunity for companies.  The third pillar required by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland is the missing ingredient, and this is skills and talents.  We must question why Facebook and Salesforce make announcements to employ people in Dublin when 700,000 skilled people from throughout the country could be employed.  What is missing is the ability to provide data on them.</p> <p>  Until our pilot, information provided on the skills available was through the census and alumni information from various colleges.  The way we have built Abodoo means we capture a lot of data on what people are looking for with regard to skills, salary expectations and connectivity.  We were requested to produce a talent heat map of the available skills, initially just in technology, to present to some companies looking at the co-working space in Gorey.  We ran the pilot over six weeks.  We ran marketing campaigns above and below the line.  We had advertisements on the back of buses showing a mother and son and a phrase suggesting spending more time with the real boss, and we had signs suggesting the train will miss you.</p> <p>  Over a few weeks, hundreds of people registered.  We assumed they would be the tired exhausted commuters from Wexford to Dublin, but they have been a range of people, including those outside the country who want to come home but for whom house prices in Dublin are too expensive.  They stated that if they could go to Wexford, they would return in a flash.  We had people with mobility issues who cannot get to Dublin.  There were also very skilled parents in their mid to late 30s who could not justify going to Dublin when the cost of childcare was added in.  There were also older people who were not ready to retire.  An array of people registered.  We captured all of this, mined it for data and produced a talent heat map that gives granular information not only on technology skills but on exactly how many Python or Java developers there are.</p> <p>  One of the surprising facts that came out of the talent heat map was that salary expectations were 10% to 20% lower than in cities.  I raise this as a very big point for employers.</p><p>Many employers think that they will have to make a significant investment to embrace smart working.  However, they save on expectations alone because house prices can be lower by one third or a half.  The other thing which surprised us was that only half the people were in Wexford.  The other half were in Dublin or elsewhere and said that they wanted to return.  We ran the case study this time last year.  We provided it to the LEO, Enterprise Ireland, the county council and IDA Ireland.  In September, IDA Ireland successfully landed the first company into the hatch lab.  It intends to employ hundreds of people in the next three years.  Significantly, it wants to embrace what we call smart working.</p><p> I will say something bold.  I do not think Ireland is ready for remote working as people assume that means working from home.  We are ready for smart working and more flexibility in our working model.  Companies such as the one that has landed in Gorey intend to let people work two to three days in the co-working capacity and the other days at home.  That means that even though the building has only seating for 300, 500 staff can be employed because of the use of hot-desking.</p><p> We have worked and collaborated with LEOs, county councils, IDA Ireland, and Enterprise Ireland, and we are undertaking a roadshow with the Small Firms Association to educate people locally.  We are partnered with Grow Remote which is doing a great job at a community level.  We have a national partnership with Vodafone, educating people around smart working and educating businesses about its benefits and value.  We are looking to support Vodafone in opening up more gigabit hubs.  The gigabit hubs initiative was launched in 2017.  Since then, 29 new companies have moved their business to the hubs with an additional 80 people, with future plans for an extra 200 jobs over the next three years.</p><p> I will outline some of the benefits of smart working from a company's perspective.  As a small country, 1.9 million people commute to work daily.  People who sit in traffic are quite tired by the time they get to the office, particularly when children are thrown into the mix.  It has been proven globally that attrition improves by 40% when employers embrace flexible working.  Productivity increases by 15% and the overall saving to the company on average is &euro;10,000 and to the individual is &euro;7,000 annually.  That is &euro;7,000 that the individual can save.  If such people are staying in their local community, we can ask where they are likely to spend this.</p><p> The LEOs have invited Abodoo to make a presentation to all their 31 offices in April about our work in Wexford with a view to where we can extend it.  We are looking forward to this.  We are building technology not only to pull talent to heat maps but in future to do things such as connecting people in co-working places at a local level so that people with similar skills can come together, as has been done in Offaly.  We are launching smart working retreats - a lovely way to build on tourism - and leveraging the amazing co-working spaces that are coming up around the country, such as converted banks, to allow people to holiday and work here for a month.  We are plugging in e-learning.  The beauty of smart working, working from home, connectivity and co-working is that it is possible to learn from anywhere and upskill.  That will be the future.</p><p> If we can work out a national plan for remote or smart working, it will have some key benefits.  One is that it improves air quality by reducing carbon emissions.  Spending in the local economy will increase.  We can reduce unemployment in blackspots.  We can give people back time that they can spend with their families.  We are asking the Government's assistance on a number of areas in the coming years.  First is help in introductions that would help us to fast-track the conversations that we are having county to county.  Second, we seek support around talent mapping skills, extending what we have done in Wexford to the whole country.  That would be data that we could provide to companies in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere as well as companies that are in talks with IDA Ireland about locating in Ireland.  Finally, we seek support from the disruptive technology fund to mobilise the app that we are using, which is on the web, and localise it so that it is key to each county.</p><p> With 42% of the population living in rural Ireland compared with 27% living in rural areas across Europe, we have a real opportunity to become the smart working leader of the European Union.  We can reverse the brain drain and bring back some of the half million people who have left our country in the past ten years.</p><p> We have provided the Wexford talent heat map to members for their information.  I will conclude with our motto: life is a journey, not a commute.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.544" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Tobin" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019022000002#E00300"><p>In 2016, my business partner, Tom O&rsquo;Leary, and I set about funding and developing the first co-working hub in County Kerry, which is also one of the first in Ireland.  As others noted, there are now more than 200 such hubs around the country.  Privately funded and operated, HQ Tralee grew from one building in Tralee town centre in 2016, a property which had sat idle for more than nine years, to a second building in Tralee the following year, and in October 2018 we opened a third building, this time in Listowel, a small town about ten miles from Tralee.</p> <p>  Today our hubs provide a home for almost 200 people in County Kerry.  We recognised the essential need for these spaces within Tralee and Listowel, like many other towns around Ireland.  In total we have provided in excess of 15,000 cu. ft of shared office, co-working, meeting and community space within our hubs at a fraction of the cost of a space in a larger city.  Our hubs all offer 1 Gb broadband connection using a combination of local Internet service providers and the SIRO-Vodafone&rsquo;s gigabit hub initiative.  We house a wide range of individuals and companies which are outlined in my submission.</p> <p>  I want to highlight some key factors that we have learned through our involvement with this industry, as one of the first groups to operate in Ireland.  The committee will have heard from previous speakers, not only today, but also in recent sittings, that remote working, enabling broadband connectivity, and supporting hubs are critical to reviving and sustaining rural and regional towns.  I will not reiterate the same things but rather demonstrate what has actually happened.</p> <p>  One of the key things we have learned over recent years is that the importance of these hubs is not solely on the service that it provides for companies and remote workers, but in their economic and social benefit to a town.  In the past three years we have seen every day examples of how a hub and supporting people to return to a town can actually benefit the local economy.  This is not just on a financial level, but it is worth noting that our hubs have an average salary of more than twice that of the local economy, which means double the spend per person in the locality.</p> <p>  On a human level, we have seen business owners and newly returned remote workers getting involved in supporting local Tidy Town groups, chambers of commerce, sports clubs, charities and volunteer organisations.  One of the main benefits of working from a regional town, with low commute times and a better quality of life, is that these people have more time to get involved in organisations and causes that matters to them.  As these individuals typically have been used to a city commute and a longer working week, they have more time on their hands to get involved.  Nor is it just the town in which the hub is based that benefits.  Returning remote workers and SME business owners are also opting to live in quieter villages or townlands near, but not in, the main town.  Typically, the people we see returning are at the age that they are considering starting, or have recently started, a family.  To a degree the companies and remote workers we have supported in returning to Tralee and Listowel have returned because they had a connection with the location.  We have found it tough to attract back the younger generation in their mid-20s and graduates.</p> <p>  On a business level, there are two critical elements to providing this opportunity for regional and rural towns.  The hubs support the growth not only of the businesses based within the hubs, but also the businesses in that town.  This is not anecdotal, this is real.  We see it every day ourselves.  The support to businesses is very wide and varied.  In view of time constraints, I will focus on a couple of key items.  One area is staff retention.  If any employer of an SME in Dublin or Cork in specific technical sectors is asked, he or she will respond that staff retention is the one thing that is killing their business.  This issue of not being able to hang on to good staff is being compounded by a number of key factors over which this Government has an element of control.  Quality staff are being hoovered up by the large multinationals, and invariably they are being lured from our indigenous companies at an alarming rate.  We all welcome each announcement of the next Facebook, Google or Salesforce entering the Dublin market, but behind that is a real concern that smaller companies will not be able to retain their skilled staff.  Each big announcement also adds even more pressure onto an already overheated housing market in our large cities, forcing even more people to seek housing farther out of the city, adding hours each day to their commute. </p> <p>  What the hubs in regional locations offer to these companies is an opportunity.  I cannot stress this enough.  We are selling ourselves short if we pitch these regional locations as a compromise.  These regional locations are an absolute godsend to many indigenous SMEs.  For example, a little over a year ago, one company joined us primarily because the larger companies in Dublin were poaching its staff.</p><p>Since coming down, this two-man operation has grown to seven people and by the end of 2019, will have grown to 20 people, purely because it is able to retain its staff based in a regional town.</p><p> To support staff retention, and to echo previous speakers, these hubs present a major opportunity for large organisations in Dublin to retain their staff by allowing them to work remotely, and have a better quality of life.  We have seen this ourselves, but larger companies need to be put under greater pressure to allow their staff have this choice.  As mentioned earlier, all bar one of our existing remote workers pay for themselves.  Their companies will not support them.  While they say they will support them, they will not financially support them to relocate to a regional location.</p><p> The second set of businesses that benefit from the hubs are actually not based in the hubs themselves.  Those business are the local ones, the shops, restaurants and pubs, around the town.  When we opened our first hub in 2016, we knew that the streets around our hub needed some support.  Our first building in Tralee was a large vacant property.  While a fantastic modern building, it had lain idle for over nine years and faced out onto a semi-derelict side street.  We developed a plan to promote the neighbouring shops, bars and restaurants and help them raise their footfall.  We formed a community of businesses that worked together which led to us taking on a privately funded regeneration project for the street around us in Tralee to such an extent that two new business opened up in that vacant street.</p><p> Listowel, where we opened our latest hub, did not need such support.  They are national Tidy Towns award winners from 2018.  Where they needed our support was on infrastructure.  We placed too much emphasis on the national broadband roll-out.  In the case of Listowel, we did not have access to high-speed fibre.  We were faced with a choice of operating off 70 Mb broadband or doing it ourselves.  Therefore, we engaged with a local Internet service provider and did it ourselves.  We invested in that company.  We supported that company to provide 1 Gb broadband to our building in Listowel, which is now available to the entire town.</p><p> I mentioned earlier that where we struggle is in attracting the younger generation to our hubs.  Through my work with Tralee Chamber Alliance, Tralee's chamber of commerce, and connecting with chambers all over the country, I know that Tralee and Listowel are not unlike many towns in regional Ireland.  There has been a drain of talent and younger people over the past number of years and a very visible cause and effect of this drain is the daytime vibrancy and nightlife in these towns.  Our high streets are struggling, rural bars and nightclubs are in free fall, our institutes of technology are fighting the larger universities to attract students and as the cities grow and expand, the younger generation are being lured and retained there.  Kerry, for example, now has the oldest average age in the country, and the statistics show that it has a dip in the mid-20s age bracket.  After the collapse of the Celtic tiger when so many of our young people left Ireland, everyone cried foul for a lost generation.  Today, the same thing is happening, only that they are emigrating from a rural to a city location.</p><p> When I started my submission, I said I would not focus on issues that others have looked at already.  I want to finish with what we in business call "the ask".  This is about connecting the dots and trying to see can we do this in an accelerated meaningful way.  We already mentioned that there are more than 200 hubs around the country.  More will be built but what we need to do is increase the demand for companies and remote workers to go to these regional locations.  Based on our experience, we see two quick-win items that could be done now.</p><p> First, we see an immediate need for a Government backed team - supported by Enterprise Ireland, the LEOs and the local chambers of commerce - the sole remit of which is to connect SMEs in Dublin and Cork with regional town hubs and remote work organisations.  Utilising the industry connections of Enterprise Ireland and the on-the-ground connections of the local chambers, this team should have the sole function of providing a funnel of companies and remote workers who want to escape the larger cities to set up in regional locations.  This team, as was mentioned earlier, should have the backing of a dedicated incentive programme to support these companies and remote workers in their relocation.  There are numerous examples, in the States and on the Continent, of successful incentive programmes where relocation assistance packages are provided to enable remote workers and SMEs to move to regional locations and these are done for a fraction of what is currently being spent on other avenues to create jobs.  Not only would this have the benefit of supporting these regional towns but it would take the pressure off the larger cities.</p><p> Second, we need support in the regional towns to attract back and retain the younger generation and families.  Without adequate funding to enhance the offering on the ground, younger workers will not consider these regional towns.  Specific investment must be made in towns to increase their vibrancy and support the retail and service sectors so that younger workers do not feel like that they are compromising on their experiences.  Locations must become more vibrant.  I would suggest utilising the document, A Framework for Town Centre Renewal.  My ask would be to legislate for the establishment of funded teams to support these regional towns.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak.</p></speech>

On this committee, our particular concern is regional and rural areas and how we can sustain livelihoods in those regions.</p> <p>  For the record, I acknowledge the work of Enterprise Ireland over the past number of years.  According to the recorded figures for 2018, there are now 2.23 million people working in Ireland.  It is the highest ever figure.  I am conscious of the work of the city and county LEOs as well, supporting entrepreneurs and new businesses.  Many such businesses started in the face of a harsh recession.  It was an bounce back by amazing people supported by the State agencies and the LEOs.  We should always acknowledge that when we can and I certainly want to do so here this morning.</p> <p>  There are new challenges now.  With the employment levels where they are, quality of life, smarter working and sustainability are the challenges for Ireland and we have a role in this committee to try to devise new policies to address the issues the delegations have raised here this morning.  I told some of them, on the way in, that often they are way ahead of the posse.  Often we are in a bubble here in Leinster House dealing with retrospective issues, which we have to do, but the real vision often comes from outside.  We are hearing it here today again and I want to acknowledge that, especially with the likes of Abodoo.  We have had Grow Remote in here as well.  These are people who have a vision for how our society should develop and where employment should go.  It certainly can fit with the needs of modern families and work-life patterns.</p> <p>  I was interested to hear that talent heat maps of Wexford have been produced.  Before we do anything in terms of policy, of course one needs to have evidence of where our assets and resources are and how we should best leverage those.  Often the easy answers are right in front of our noses.  Wexford has shown the way in terms of mapping out the talent that is available to it if a business wants to establish itself in Wexford, in smarter hubs or whatever.  It is a good starting point for anyone.  I take on board Ms Tierney's recommendation that we should have a national talent map.  Recently, I was in discussions with a company that is looking at establishing in the south east in the financial services area.  We met IDA Ireland representatives and the first thing they said was that they would have to do a skills analysis for the south east.  I had a bit of an argument with them.  I said that most of our graduates, unfortunately, have left the south east and are either in Dublin or elsewhere.  I stated that the skills analysis should not only be of the south east.  In fact, it should be of those all over the world because people want to move home.  I was delighted to hear Ms Tierney repeat it here this morning.  There is a mindset in officialdom.  I acknowledge the great work IDA Ireland is doing but it more or less boxes off regions and looks at where the talent in a region is presently, whereas I believe it must have a far more outward looking view.  I am only using the south east as an example because I am from the south east.  I am from Waterford, which is one of the employment black spots in the country.  It is one of the areas which has suffered the greatest brain drain.  Our graduates qualify in Waterford but, unfortunately, leave the region.  That happens right around the country.  Often I have compared Dublin with an economic vortex that is sucking in our best resources.</p> <p>  We need to think of new ways to try and get those brains and those graduates - as Mr. Tobin said, that life - back into the regions.  I certainly welcome the positive outlook that has been presented to us here this morning.  It is not merely an outlook.  There are real solutions being presented here.  I visited Boxworks, a co-working location in Waterford.  They have created a smart hub where hot desks or small offices are provided to any person, entity or body that wants to come in and work.  They are sharing ideas and resources and building out.  The good news is the second Boxworks office is opening in a few weeks in Waterford and it is doing exactly what the witnesses are talking about.</p> <p>  The evidence shows the entrepreneurs and the people are ahead of the policymakers.  We need to catch up.  How we do that, I believe, is the discussion we need to have here today.</p><p> Do we need to change our view on co-ordination overall?  While I acknowledged the work of Enterprise Ireland at the start, should it have a specific department to consider how to connect the hubs and new ways of supporting entrepreneurs?  I am aware it is doing this and its representatives will tell us it is but we need specific resources to attend to the new demands that exist.  These include demands for smarter living, smarter travel, smarter work, co-operation and joining resources.  There are examples.  The delegates stated there are 200 hubs around Ireland.  I mentioned two, in Waterford.  We need to co-ordinate all of these and secure policy support and incentives.  How do we do this better?  If the witnesses were in our shoes, as policymakers, where would they believe real change is needed to bring about the gear shift that is required?  Rather than looking at traditional ways of supporting employment, how can we engage with the employers to build their confidence?  We need to build their confidence to show this is a new way of working and that they can trust their staff, perhaps using a stepped process.  Reference was made to going to a co-working location first, perhaps on a part-time basis, and perhaps doing the rest from home.  There is work to be done on how to build confidence among employers to show them they need not spend a fortune building offices in Dublin, with staff crazed by the cost of living and cost of rent, and that they can proceed in a different way.  How can we package this concept and start selling it to employers?</p></speech>

Last week, representatives from Grow Remote were here to talk about the work they are doing on similar lines.  I represent Sligo-Leitrim and live in south Leitrim, which is quite rural.  It is probably one of the employment black spots mentioned.  Interestingly, somebody I was talking to some days ago was considering a job online &mdash; I believe it was with eBay &mdash; but it had to be done from home because some of the work was to be in the evening and some in the early morning.  The individual had no Internet so there was not a chance of getting the job.  That is a big problem for people who live in certain rural areas.  I accept that high-speed broadband is available in many regional towns, etc., but the problem arises when one goes out into the countryside a bit.  We need to address this.</p> <p>  There is great potential, however.  It was suggested there should be a Government-backed team to pull it all together  Is Grow Remote doing a bit of that?  Are other small groups doing part of what is being talked about?  Are the delegates saying we need to work in a proper, organised fashion and have the Government step in?  I agree this would be the way forward.  What can happen is that the process can become bitty rather than streamlined across the whole region.</p> <p>  Mr. Tobin spoke about making regional towns more attractive for people to live and work in.  Much of this concerns having the correct infrastructure in place.  A good few years ago, Peter Quinn Consultancy Services in Fermanagh carried out a study on foreign direct investment on where companies wanted to send their executives to live and work.  It was found that education was a big factor.  The companies wanted to know their managers would have good schools, in addition to recreation facilities and hospitals, and that healthcare would be adequately provided for.  The study found that executives also like to have nice restaurants and theatres to go to.  The companies like to be close to airports so executives can fly in, meet in company offices and get back on a plane and fly away quickly.  These infrastructural elements are key but we should not lose sight of the reality that it is not just about good roads and transport; it is also about having the services in place for people who want to live in the areas in question.  This will be key to getting people to come back to live in rural areas.</p> <p>  The delegates felt legislation to develop a national policy on remote working is required so it will become the norm.  Reference was made to flexible working regulations.  There is already legislation for people to have the option of part-time work.  An employer has to accept that an employee can request it.  We need to examine this in connection with remote working.  On the question of incentives for employers, revenue schemes and allowances for remote workers, most people are talking about the private sector whereby a lot of the work is done at home on a laptop, but the public sector also comes into play.  While we have had many rows about decentralisation in the past, it is really about getting it right and working out how we can do it properly.  I know staff in the public sector who work two days at home and three in the office.  Therefore, there is an element of working from home in the public sector.  The key task, as Mr. Tobin said, is making sure that we streamline the process and that the Government takes charge of it, organises it, structures it and drives it forward.</p> <p>  Working from home might suit individuals very well when they have children, for example, but as they get on a little and experience the empty nest, they might discover sitting at home in front of the laptop all day is not very sociable.  The hubs would be a better model for many.</p> <p>  Let me refer to the rights of the employee.  Everyone who works in this establishment is clearly a member of a trade union and has rights, which can be established and worked through.  An employee can do something about a problem if one arises.  If, however, an employee is working at home, or in a hub where there is only one other employee working for the same company, there needs to be some way to ensure his or her rights will be upheld.  Perhaps we could speak to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions about how it is organising in this regard.  It is a separate issue.</p> <p>  Co-ordinating this initiative is what we really need to drive.  I strongly believe we need to ensure a commitment by the Government to provide the correct infrastructure.  A major part of that infrastructure is broadband but there are also other aspects.</p> <p>  When people talk about rural Ireland, they talk about equality.  The difference between the equality and equity was explained to me once very well.  In rural areas, we need achieve equity.  Consider the circumstances when two people who want to look over a wall that is too high are each given a box of the same size on which to stand.  If the first can see over the wall and the second, being a little shorter, cannot, both will have been treated equally but equity will not have been established.  We need to see not only equal resources going into rural areas but extra resources to establish equity because they have long been left behind.  The area I come from was the last place to see the boom and the first to see the decline.  That is what always happens.  We need to try to reverse that.  I certainly welcome this effort to try to do so.  Those are the key points we need to deal with.  We need to ensure sufficient commitment.  This means some element of the Government needs to take charge.  We need to take charge of the infrastructure and consider the rights of the workers when established.</p></speech>

There were some very interesting presentations.  Much of this debate is based on connectivity.  If there is no connectivity, particularly broadband but also mobile phone coverage, it is very difficult to run any type of business.</p><p>It is a major issue in my constituency of Cork South-West.  Much of it has to do with getting funds from the Government and getting off the ground.  It is about making a start.  If people can receive support in getting broadband and the funding right, they can start to go places.  I see it in Skibbereen with the Ludgate Hub.  It is getting the funding it needs and its feet off the ground.  It is getting places.  However, there is a vacuum in the surrounds of my constituency.  I can only speak on its behalf.</p><p> Details of the rural regeneration and development fund were released last week.  There is nowhere more rural than south-west Cork, as anybody who has been there knows.  It is beautiful in the summer, but it must fight on rural matters.  There were 48 projects proposed by Cork County Council and we got zero.  Therefore, I am right to be very angered.  I met some of the community groups over the weekend and they are incensed because they ticked all of the boxes.  I looked at those that had received money and some of them were great.  I would not take anything from them.  However, I can pick out some that are not so great.  Coillte received &euro;10 million, but it has its own funds.  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht received &euro;3.5 million and it also has its own funds.  Why are we dipping into the rural generation and development fund to fund these bodies and Departments?  Is the overspend on the national children's hospital project the problem and is this a back-door method to top up funding?  The problem is that of the 48 projects, most of which are in my constituency but some are in the rest of Cork county, zero was approved.  I could name some of them.</p></speech>

In a rural community, if we do not receive that type of funding, we will not be able to get our feet off the ground.  I would love to be able to bring in groups of people like those involved in the Ludgate Hub in Skibbereen, but it cannot live on its own.  West Cork needs that energy.  Unfortunately, we do not have broadband.  Everybody knows the fact it has not been rolled out is a national matter, rather than one specific to west Cork.  It is very hard for us to equal any of the great opportunities on which the delegates have worked.  I praise them from a height and would not take anything away from a community or an area that has worked for it.  It is an important point and the committee needs to bring the Minister before it to discuss it.  He should first explain how the money is being spent and why it is not being spent in rural communities that want to achieve results like those described by the delegates.  I wish them the best and I am not taking anything away from what they have done.  Nonetheless I have made a valid point and will continue to do so.  The announcement of the rural regeneration and development fund was only made last Friday; there was &euro;62 million, but zero went to west Cork.  I need answers.</p></speech>

He will asked them by the Deputy.  Senator Coffey had a number of points and questions, as did Deputy Martin Kenny.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.561" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Vanessa Tierney" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019022000002#H01000"><p>There was a question about how we did it.  It is multifaceted, as has been highlighted.  There are many great groups on the ground, county to county.  I am not with a connectivity company, but I can see that a lot of them are making great efforts to connect places; perhaps they are not all homes but certainly they are co-working spaces.  A national framework for co-working is required.  We have highlighted that in most cases employees are paying their subscription or membership in co-working.  WeWork, a phenomenal global co-working company, announced last year that 35% of its members were employees of enterprise accounts.  They are attracting the likes of Facebook and Microsoft and can do so because once somebody takes out a subscription with WeWork, there is global access.  We suggest we can do the same with Abodoo because we have all 200 on our platform.  We need to advance the technology to facilitate subscriptions.  That conversation can be taken to the large enterprise and foreign direct investment companies.</p> <p>  There was reference to the national talent heat map.  We are ready to go.  We just need the green light for the provision of some funding.  We achieved what we did quite economically in Wexford and leveraged all of the local public relations and marketing channels available through the council.  It was affordable and we got a buy-in.  Members will have read that many commuter studies have been carried out and I have spoken to five or six local enterprise offices about their commuter studies.  They were great to help to create momentum, but they did not give the detailed and granular skills data that we needed for the finance companies who were seeking finance people in the south east, for example.  The beauty of Ireland Inc. becoming involved in national talent mapping is that we would be able to demonstrate the peak or clusters of skills available in finance, for example.  They could be available in Waterford or west Cork, when there is connectivity.  They could be available in County Offaly.  Companies could make decisions based on how they would land there.  It is ready to go and no policy is needed.  It is just a question of backing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.562" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Christal" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019022000002#H01100"><p>I absolutely agree with the point made about the collaboration needed.  With this initiative, there must be collaboration between the public sector organisations, including the local authorities, Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise offices, IDA Ireland and chambers of commerce.  That is really important.  Whatever we do, we must ensure we engage and develop approaches that will be meaningful from the perspective of a small and medium enterprise.  The typical Enterprise Ireland client has 20 or 30 people who are time-limited.  Companies have faced many challenges.  Whatever systems or policies we put in place need to be attractive and practical from their perspective.</p> <p>  The issue of skills has been mentioned by a number of people.  It is something on which we are very focused.  We have a programme, Spotlight on Skills, aimed at helping our clients to identify their skill needs and put them on a path towards engaging with training and education providers to get a response in meeting those skill needs.  We have approximately 160 companies throughout the country that have engaged in the programme and are working with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to facilitate these companies in engaging with education and training providers.  They have also engaged with private providers to procure responses.  A number of points mentioned could be built on.</p></speech>

Often in committees such as this we bring in representatives of agencies who, with the greatest of respect, often work in silos.  There is co-ordination but only to a certain degree.  Who leads the collaboration and steps up to say they will lead this and make it happen?  It should be the likes of Enterprise Ireland, but I am not saying it has a budget to do so.  We need to identify some agency that works on behalf of the State to co-ordinate all of what goes on.  Could Enterprise Ireland do it within current structures and if it cannot, could it make a pitch to the Department or the Minister?  If there are new work patterns, could Enterprise Ireland assist by devising a national strategy to co-ordinate co-working, smart hubs or whatever we might call it?  I know that Enterprise Ireland is doing this in individual spaces, but I am talking about taking the lead and bringing all of what we have heard today and in the past together.  Is it possible it could do that, for example?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.564" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Christal" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019022000002#H01300"><p>It is probably something that could be reflected on.  Irrespective of how it is led or who leads it, there is a wide range of stakeholders and enterprises involved and there must be collaboration.  We have mentioned local enterprise offices, foreign direct investment and IDA Ireland.  We have a client base.  I have also mentioned chambers of commerce and the Small Firms Association.  There are myriad enterprises and our enterprise base is so diverse that irrespective of who leads it or how it is driven, the collaboration is absolutely essential.  I take the point made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.565" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Tobin" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019022000002#H01400"><p>The question of who leads the process is key.</p><p>I echo the Senator's point and agree that if the funding and a team were put in place, Enterprise Ireland should be the body to lead it, but I also acknowledge that funding may not necessarily be available in the current structures.  It needs to be a dedicated team.  Myriad organisations are involved.  The committee has heard from Grow Remote and Abodoo and there are individual organisations representing hubs throughout the country.  It needs to be one co-ordinated approach and it should not be over-complicated.  It is actually quite simple and the issues are obvious.  For example, within the SME sector in Dublin there is a huge drain on staff and SMEs are in serious competition with larger organisations to retain them.  This would be a win-win.  It is very simple to organise once the funding is put in place.</p><p> I want to touch on a couple of the questions raised.  It is good to acknowledge that for policy makers there is an element of catch-up in this scenario, but it comes down to the key collaboration that needs to happen with those already in the space and policy makers.  It should be done without over-complicating things because it is very simple when we break it down.</p><p> Should a specific Department be involved?  The answer is definitely "Yes".  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation needs to be involved and take a lead role because it is already in contact with all of the organisations.</p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny mentioned connectivity and one of his constituents not being able to take up a role with eBay.  We had a similar issue in County Kerry where remote working opportunities with Amazon came our way.  Some 60 positions were advertised in the first round, but we could fill only 40 of them because of the problems with broadband in some parts of the county.  There are opportunities.  Again, these things could be fast-tracked using local Internet service providers who would fast-track the service using a wireless system.  In Listowel we have proved it can work in using the coverage provided by local Internet service providers.  It is demand-led, but it is further reaching and quicker to get off the ground than investing in the provision of long-term infrastructure.</p><p> In regard to regional towns, the framework document for town centre renewal was published a number of years back, but it has not yet gone far enough.  There is a collaborative town centre health check programme as part of it and 12 towns have completed the programme, which was step one.  Step two is to formulate funded town teams, but, unfortunately, most of the 12 towns have not yet got to that stage.  However, there is a framework document and we just need to go one step further.  As the Deputy said, it is not always about infrastructure but about vibrancy and sustaining local businesses.  It is about the pub, the shop and the restaurant.  That is what we need if we are to attract back the younger generation of workers when they graduate from colleges.  We do not want them to head off to Dublin.  We want to keep them in the regional towns where they went to college.  Senator Coffey mentioned this in the case of Waterford.  It is the same in the case of Tralee Institute of Technology which is in the battle to retain staff.  If we do not have a vibrant town for them to stay in, of course, they will head off to the city.  There is a framework in place.  We just need to go one step further.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Michael Collins.  As I married a Bantry woman, I empathise with those living in south-west Cork.  However, there is a lot more that could be done in such areas; it is not just about the regeneration fund.</p></speech>

There is a lot in them and I commend all of them on the good work being done.  We talk about some of it as if it was innovation.  I was working remotely in London almost 20 years ago without any help in terms of enterprise or anything else.  It was just the way it worked.  I travelled into the city one day a week and worked from home in Rayleigh the other days, with no fuss.  We have an awful lot of catching up to do.  It is certainly the way forward here and just needs to be hurried up.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  How much funding has been allocated to the LEOs since they were started in 2014, including to meet accumulated staffing and administration costs?</p></speech>

We can no longer afford to work in silos.  I know that there is a certain degree of collaboration, but this is vital.  This is the biggest thing to happen in the west for a long time and will mean that the highest speeds will be available.  Another cable is due to be brought through shortly, as well as another from Iceland.  Unless we take advantage of them and plan ahead and work closely on such developments, we will never maximise the potential available in the west and rural Ireland.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the connections of the various agencies with Eir.  I work remotely on the days I am not in Leinster House and never know in the morning if I will be able to send an email.  It is admirable that some of the delegates think there is a wonderful broadband picture, but I can tell them from personal experience that is not the way it is.  Another problem with Eir is that I do not know if I will be able to make a mobile phone call.  Perhaps five or six times during a conversation it will cut out and then I cannot get through to Eir.  Have the agencies represented sat down with Eir to discuss the problems with mobile phone coverage, for instance?  It is a fairly basic requirement of any business or operation in working from home.</p></speech>

I also want to ask about the Enterprise Ireland's interaction with the LEADER programme.  I concur with the audit skills report.  However, many of these reports were carried out in many counties and I would not want us to reinvent the wheel or waste resources.  Such audits were carried out when I worked with the enterprise companies.</p> <p>  Other natural resources are used in creating employment and developing enterprise.  Seaweed is one such natural resource, from which many good products are made.  What interaction does Enterprise Ireland have in licensing the use of some of these natural resources?  How much of the funding from the disruptive technologies innovation fund was allocated outside the main urban areas?</p><p>I am aware that 27 projects, involving &euro;70 million in funding, were approved.  How many of those went into the more rural areas outside Cork, Dublin and Galway?  When applications are being assessed, the criteria can be very narrow at times.  We need to weight them in favour of rural areas.  This is not to say that they would not meet the criteria but if, for example, we have a successful company in Belmullet, we need to ask how we can support it because 20 jobs in Belmullet or Erris can mean the same as 2,000 in Dublin.  When the innovation, technology and so on are in place, we need to harness, encourage and support that with resources provided directly to the people who are making a difference in these communities.</p><p> I would have the same concerns about centralisation and privatisation of services but centralisation in terms of hospitals and medical services will prevent people moving to and remaining in the more rural areas.  Education is connected to that as well, even in terms of school transport.  People may relocate to particular areas and set up their businesses only to discover that there are no places on the school bus for their children.  All of these matters are connected.</p><p> On the curriculum, how do our guests believe they have changed the curriculum in primary or secondary schools in terms of matching the skill sets with existing and future jobs, particularly in the context of technology?  Are the software and hardware available?  Has the curriculum been changed?  I have always found that the curriculum is slow to be changed.  Has it changed in terms of languages?  How many schools are teaching Mandarin?  I refer to some of the markets that were opened up heretofore.  Are schools still teaching the languages we did 20 years ago?  I have put many questions but I have to be in the Seanad for the Order of Business so I will not be asking any more.</p></speech>

I will address some of the points raised and some others not so specifically.  The key point she made relating to enabling infrastructure in terms of broadband and so on is critically important.  Everyone here recognises that.  One of Enterprise Ireland's roles is to sit on the National Competitiveness Council.  It is our role to identify and to hear from our clients the issues that are outside our direct mandate and control but that are impacting on their ability to develop and so on.  We influence and impact through that, and these are the type of issues that are very pertinent to our clients and to enterprises across the country.</p> <p>  On the disruptive technologies innovation fund, I do not have the exact breakdown but it is important to know that the criteria for that fund specifically required collaboration that included SMEs.  It is a criteria that can and will be mirrored in other collaborative funding programmes into the future.  That is critically important that what we see between large and small companies is the ability to maximise spillovers and allow SMEs to compete and be able to achieve growth in this area.</p> <p>  Regarding other areas, to go back to what was mentioned earlier about the skills needs and so on of enterprises, it is critically important that SMEs are supported, which is what we are doing through the Spotlight on Skills programme in identifying their skills needs and, following that, assisting them to engage and have a voice with education providers.  When the Senator talks about curriculum it is that our education providers know the needs of our SMEs, not just those of larger companies, and that education providers in regional locations are responding to skills needs in that area in particular sectoral clusters.</p></speech>

There are 31 broadband officers across the local authority network and they are playing a significant role between the providers and the funders.  They are identifying the different black spots both for broadband and mobile phone coverage.  They are involved in many different pilots and funding applications.  They are developing regional and local digital plans also.  They are accessing funding independently and feeding in to the national picture.  They are doing a good deal in that area.  For example, they are working with LEADER-funded community hubs as well as Enterprise Ireland and different agencies and providers around the region.  We work very closely with LEADER.</p> <p>  In terms of curriculum, from our point of view, the LEOs are heavily involved in the delivery of entrepreneurship programmes through the student enterprise programme.  It is the largest programme throughout the country in terms of involvement with students.  It is something we would like added to the curriculum.  We are in discussions with the Department of Education and Skills on that.</p> <p>  To refer to the questions and comments on collaboration, it must be remembered that a number of the newly launched regional enterprise plans contain strategic objectives and supporting actions regarding remote working.  The groups working on the regional action plans are completely collaborative across all areas and stakeholders, including enterprise, all the agencies and related bodies.  That is very useful.  Even in Offaly, in terms of being part of the midlands one, there are different initiatives to improve the remote working connectivity between the hubs and also to look at a campaign to approach companies in Dublin to encourage remote working and to determine the interest in coming back and setting up in the midlands.  What might be useful in terms of overall co-ordination is the sharing of information on best practice among the different plans across the country.</p> <p>  The promotion of remote working to the larger employers would be very useful.  We sent details on that.  In the LEO in Offaly we are organising a half-day conference during enterprise week on practical insights and guides for both employers and employees.  There is definitely a growing momentum for remote and smart working but it would be great to have additional education and learning around it.</p></speech>

Our guests are very welcome.  I managed to listen to some of the presentations when I was in my office.  The hubs are the key practical action that can be taken.  That needs to be done now because in five years time we may not have half the demand for them.  I had hoped we would have ubiquitous fibre broadband connected to every building in this country.  I have to put my cards on the table and say I will not rest easy until we have put fibre broadband into every building in this country.  If we were able to put in electricity, water and all those basic services, fibre broadband should be seen the same way.  I do not believe that fibre technology will date.  There will be better wireless technologies but they will never match fibre technology in fixed locations.  It is a tiny bit of a cable that provides the necessary in terms of television, business and so on.</p><p>My understanding of the co-working hubs is that they currently have two functions.  First, they provide broadband connection where none is available.  For example, where I live, 100 houses have a fibre broadband connection and 300 houses are without broadband.  Approximately 20 of us have a 60 Mbps or 70 Mbps service and the rest are on 5 Mbps or nothing.  The people who are outside that have a big problem.  I live in a very rural area with 100 houses.  If a business is directly linked, it will not use a hub.  It will use it <i>in situ</i>.</p><p>However, even if the national broadband plan contract is awarded next month, I would imagine that it would be three, four or five years before it is rolled out fully.  Eir has not stuck to its targets regarding the roll-out of the previous one.  It will be well into the middle of the year before the 300,000 houses are connected.  We are now getting into more difficult terrain involving a further 500,000 houses.  One can figure out the timescale.  The first need is what I have outlined.</p><p> There is a socialisation issue regarding the second need.  In other words, some people could work from home but they like to be able to go into work and interact with others.  What I imagine will happen is that if everybody had fibre broadband in the home - and every Deputy works from wherever he or she is located at any given moment - most people will not just work neat eight-hour days.  I imagine that they would sometimes go down and work in the hub while much of the time, they will work from home.  They will work from places such as airports at other times.  We need to look at the matter in that context.  Therefore, the need for the hubs will continue but it will change and it might not be for as many hours.</p><p> I compliment &Uacute;dar&aacute;s an Gaeltachta, which is missing from this particular feast, because it has many buildings around the Gaeltacht, it systematically looks at empty buildings and it puts in gcomms or hot desks.  This policy has proven very positive.  Listening to our guests from Enterprise Ireland, an issue I can never get my head around is that when IDA Ireland was split up into Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, all of the buildings in rural Ireland were left in the ownership of the latter.  So, from a foreign direct investment perspective, IDA Ireland owns properties in Roundstone in County Galway and all sorts of bizarre places.  It seems that there is no co-ordinated approach regarding the full portfolio of IDA Ireland properties.  How many buildings are there, how many of them are in full use and how many of them could be translated into gcomms just as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has done?  My question to the representatives from Enterprise Ireland concerns whether the agency has discussed this matter with IDA Ireland and asked the latter is willing to make its buildings, or parts of them, available.  A factory located in the area in which I live includes a self-contained unit that has a few rooms, a place for making tea and toilets.  A person can go in the front door and need not interfere with the rest of the factory building that, unfortunately, is empty at the moment but would still be available for letting.  If IDA Ireland has factories, most of them have suites of offices that could be used.  My simple question concerns whether there has been any joined-up thinking here between Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  I will extend the question.</p></speech>

I apologise for having to leave early.  I must meet the CEO of Vodafone so I will bring up many of the issues raised today.  More than 20,000 people have registered so it is not just a couple of hundred or 2,000 in Wexford.  In excess of 20,000 people and over 500 companies have registered.  The demand for smart working is there.  Obviously, regarding the 200 co-working, we are engaging with the 31 LEOs so we are slowly bringing it together.  I will mention one thing about skills because it is fundamental.  With the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning, what will become key for humans involves our soft skills - our cognitive learning and ability to connect.  We are building technology in the background to be able to match people because many of us will have multiple career paths.  If members have not already seen it, Abodoo and Vodafone carried out a national survey regarding the appetite for smart, or remote, working that is an interesting read.</p></speech>

On the wider question, has there been any discussion about transferring all of the rural properties that will never be used for classical foreign direct investment to Enterprise Ireland?  Most of the successful industries around rural Ireland are actually indigenous, not foreign.  Anybody who is big enough to come here is likely to want to be near a city.  There is enough talent in this country to create significant employment in rural Ireland.  A far more likely market consists of people who might have worked in the foreign direct investment sector in the past or who are just smart and have ideas.  There is a lot of employment near where I live that involves very smart local people who got the job done.  That is a question.</p> <p>  I am focusing big time on the physical aspect - the national roll-out of broadband and hubs - because my experience is that without any of the soft supports, an endless amount of people are looking for it tomorrow.  They were looking for it at the last election as we canvassed the houses one by one because there is a significant cohort of people who work in cities and commute who could reduce their commute to two days per week if they could work from home.  They could be at home at mid-term, do all the family-friendly things we want people to do and still keep the work going if they could work from home.  This is a significant market for facilitating rural living.  It might also solve some urban traffic problems.  Driving into Galway on Monday morning was fantastic.  I could not believe it.  I got there in jig time during rush hour.  It was only then that I suddenly realised that it was mid-term, half the parents in the country were off work and all the schools were closed.  This is multifaceted but, funnily enough, I do not think we have to do much to educate the people about this.  They are saying "Yeah, it's a great idea but I don't have broadband or a facility to access broadband in my village.  Will you just give it to us?"  We already have an awful lot of businesses and houses in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  Perhaps the rural broadband officer could answer my next question.  Have we any idea how many people in areas with broadband now work partially from home?  This would allow us to extrapolate how many people in the 600,000 houses that do not have commercial broadband would work from home without any further soft supports because the people already doing it in areas with broadband did so off their own bat.  It involves just getting the physical thing there.  It is great to have all the supports but we would be encouraging people to use something that does not exist.  As I often say, when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he had no marketing survey but once a good idea took hold, the rest was history.  That took a fair while but holding a constituency clinic always fascinated me after somebody invented the mobile phone.  When I first came up here, mobile phones were the size of bricks and as scarce as hen's teeth.  Once the smaller version came out and they became relatively cheap, everybody was coming in with them.  Some of my constituents who would come in would not be technologically savvy.  When I asked them for their phone number, they would pull the phone out of their pockets and it would be written on the back of it stuck on with a bit of sellotape but they still used the phone for every purpose for which they wanted it.  I find that very few people nowadays come in to see me without a smart phone and they have that because they are using apps.  People adopt a technology.  They are smart.  There is significant interaction involving people in this country.  This is small little country.  We are a very strange people.  The problem we have is the physical availability.</p></speech>

One of the key issues for any work environment is people being able to enhance their skills in their employment environment.  Are there challenges in respect of remote working because one will not have 50 people working together?</p><p>It comes back to the point that a person may be partially or fully isolated from his or her work colleagues.  What means exists to address that?</p><p> Second, regarding the issue of hubs, one of the most successful hubs I know is a food hub in Drumshanbo.  There is also a technology hub in Manorhamilton.  Key to the development of those hubs were individuals who had an idea and ran with it.  There is despondency about such development among people in many areas in that people do not have a broadband connection or they do not have this or that support.  There are too many elements that people do not have for people to have confidence to be able to run with such an idea.  I would like Mr. Christal to tease out what needs to be done to develop the capacity within communities to lift themselves out of all of that.</p></speech>

First, as he rightly identified, the responsibility for the property portfolio lies with IDA Ireland.  It is mandated to manage it and it is best placed to talk about the full range of properties that are available to support foreign direct investment.  However, I stress and reassure the Deputy there is ongoing collaboration between ourselves and IDA Ireland at national level and regional level on this and a number of other initiatives.</p> <p>  In terms of the development of co-working spaces we have supported, as I mentioned and as stated in our submission, &euro;64 million has been invested by ourselves in the community enterprise centres.  In addition, with respect to regional accelerators, for example, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, recently launched the enterprise development plan from the PorterShed in Galway, which is a good example of collaboration between ourselves and the IDA Ireland in those sorts of hubs and facilities and also the business innovation centres.  We have the remit for the development of high potential start-up companies and we collaborate with IDA Ireland on how we can develop those and to use the facilities that are in place.  Another area on which we collaborate with IDA Ireland and on which we are focused is our agenda around second sites, which relate to Enterprise Ireland companies that are establishing and expanding their presence in regional locations as opposed to city or urban locations.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, we have responsibility for the food direct investment, FDI, agenda.  While IDA Ireland has the agenda for the wider sectors, we have responsibility for food FDI and we collaborate very much with IDA Ireland on available properties and the appropriate properties to support that sector.</p></speech>

It considers all its properties because they are all in one portfolio and it can identify where there is space in properties.  We have a latent demand.  We are talking all the time about the person who is at the door but there is a latent demand there for g-tech or digital working hubs.  We have the buildings.  We just need to ensure there are tea making facilities, fibre connected to the properties, toilet facilities in operating order, security in the properties and a key access system to enter them.  As I have pointed out since I was elected to the D&aacute;il, there is only one Government in this country but all the agencies seem to operate as if there were 50 governments here.  I do not care whether it be Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland but would Enterprise Ireland consider examining what &uacute;dar&aacute;s is doing and for it and IDA Ireland to take a leaf out of its book and get on with the job?</p></speech>

That is happening and that training opportunity is open to tenants of a co-working hub who may be working there only one day a week and spend the other days working with a business in a larger city.  I referenced a new hub we will be establishing, STREAM Create Suite.  As it will deal with big data, we are linking in with courses on data analytics provided by Athlone Institute of Technology, Trinity College, some of the Skillnet courses and other groupings, including some in the private sector.  That will be a strong aspect of that new hub.  Other hubs are doing similar things.</p> <p>  Many of the libraries are working on developing e-platforms.  They have many new journals, reports and materials online.  I know from talking to the head of library services in Offaly that their usage has increased 70% in the past year.  That linked in with the open library systems feeds in very well with the area of remote working.</p> <p>  Regarding the difference between working in a co-working hub and working from home, even if broadband access was available at home, we have clients who tell us that their businesses have specified that they need to be working from a co-working hub and not from a converted room at home.  Plenty of people feel they need the discipline of working in a hub and there is also the social aspect.  Social interaction and engaging with people from different backgrounds at different levels of business have been very beneficial to people working in hubs.</p></speech>

I would need to talk to the broadband officers of the network.  I am not aware if research has taken place on that or the outcome of any such research.  I do not know if anybody else has that information.</p></speech>

I know many people get mad at me when I am honest enough to admit this, but I am going to say it again, during the last election, the main issue we heard when canvassing at the doors was not that of post offices but that of broadband connectivity.  Straight and simple, broadband was the main issue for people, and that was across the board.  It was not as age-specific as one might think but it peaked among the 30 to 45 age group, comprising working parents and so on.  What we need to find out is that where there is broadband connectivity how many people use it for their business, part time, full time or for whatever number of hours.  People could be asked if they use broadband for their business three hours or 20 hours a week, or full time.  We need to get that information.  I accept the point Ms Martin made about social interaction.</p></speech>

I am very familiar with the hubs.  However, I would express a note of caution.  I am aware of a number of community-led hubs that have been established through various funds which are still lying idle.  All investment into these hubs must be demand-led or at least have an avenue with respect to who will fill them.  There is no point in making commitments to local communities saying that we will put a hub in their region and provide broadband access but then no one goes to work in it and there is no economic benefit to that town.  This is an anecdotal example.  I am very aware of hubs that are vacant because either the infrastructure was not right or there was no demand for those hubs or there was not an avenue and a connection with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to provide this as a landing pad solution for companies that are interested in those locations.</p><p>It is not always about developing hubs.  In some cases remote working might be a better home working solution for those rural towns where we can enable people's homes so that they can work from home.  I accept the point about the isolation of working from home.  I did it for 18 months and it is what drove me to set up our hub.  Some 30% of the people in our three hubs are remote workers.  Some are there one or two days a week just to make that connection with other people.  Some of them would have come from large city offices, for example, where they were surrounded by hundreds of people and are now in their house that is 20 miles outside the nearest large town.  I get the point about isolation but urge caution with regard to the development of hubs because it is a waste of investment in those towns if there may be a better solution to provide employment to those towns.</p></speech>

We have been joined by Deputy Rabbitte who is very welcome.  I am aware that she is very much involved with a hub in Portumna.  The Deputy made a very valuable contribution at the last meeting of this committee.  The floor is hers.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to ask a few questions.  I shall direct one question to the witnesses from Offaly County Council and its local enterprise office, LEO.  I have looked at their Facebook and web pages which, as Mr. Tobin has said, is where a lot of business-led hubs would need to have the anchor tenant.  Enterprise Ireland might be interested to hear that I held a discovery day some weeks ago in Portumna where we had a number of employees from a particular large financial institution based in Limerick.  We learned that this company's employees make up 30 cars going across the bridge every single morning.  The company has a capacity issue: it wants to expand but does not have car parking facilities.  An ideal location would be the sort of idea that we are referring to, where one can expand from.  From there I went into the website to see where the local employment office gets right in behind it.  I thought the web page was fantastic and it gave me a good steer around Offaly and what it is about.  One of my questions at the last meeting was about the roll-out of the LEOs and the support role they play.  Do the LEOs meet bi-monthly or half yearly to share information from one LEO to another?  During the earlier contributions I heard that &euro;34 million is available to the LEOs to support businesses and so on, but the sharing of the information is also important so that every county council is on the same platform.</p> <p>  How do we get the idea of the change concept into the schools?  Reference was made to the library.  The library is absolutely a valuable tool, be it in second or third level education, when one needs to finish a project.  It is possibly not for the high end aspect of attracting business.  I do not agree with libraries in that context, but they are definitely valuable to the second and third level students who want to complete their projects.  Is there a plan with LEO or Enterprise Ireland to deliver that model and to educate children to use different units that are available, as opposed to them spending their weekends in Galway, for example, because they cannot get broadband in Ballinakill?  If, however, one was to go down the road to Abbey or Killimor there is a library available.  Would the witnesses agree that we need to train children how to plan their study patterns a little differently?</p> <p>  How will the representatives from Enterprise Ireland engage with the banks and businesses that have capacity issues around accommodation for their businesses and employees? They sometimes cannot get the accommodation because premiums for space are so high.  Are the representatives looking to the wider sphere such as the one hour commute? The Portumna region, for example, is one hour from Galway, one hour from Limerick and one hour from Athlone.  The Chairman's area is no different.  We need to look at these commuter towns.  When I speak about buildings I mean those places such as the Dowager House in Portumna - which is owned by the Office of Public Works, OPW and is completely kittled out.  As opposed to having the businesses buying why are we not re-using the properties that are available?  What engagements do the witnesses have with other Departments and agencies - such as the OPW - that have very good buildings that are not being used?  These premises may have car-parking spaces and other facilities, and their use could keep towns alive.</p></speech>

The heads of the local enterprise offices meet about six or eight times a year.  Other teams within the local enterprise offices meet a number of times a year also.  It is all about information sharing, the sharing of best practice, looking to see what works in some regions and what might be replicated.  We also meet on a regional basis to drive actions through the regional enterprise plans and so on.  That is happening.<br/><br/>With regard to the libraries, we find that people use the Work Matters library programmes where libraries have put in a lot of supports for people who are setting up their own businesses.  They aid in patent searches and searches on Vision-Net.  We link in with these businesses at what we term &quot;pre start-up&quot;.  We have also run schemes where students are working on student enterprise projects.  The LEO has offered opportunities for the students to meet with some of the design experts in some of the co-working spaces who have given some of their time <i>pro bono</i>to help the students on projects.  We have facilitated student groups working for European youth entrepreneurship competitions, one such being through The Junction Business Innovation Centre.  This sort of initiative is being replicated with other LEOs throughout the State.</p></speech>

I will add to what Ms Martin has said around the links to education, the schools and the structures the council has in that regard.  Through the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g system the council has a significant amount of projects and initiatives, a number of which are around entrepreneurship.  The Offaly Comhairle na n&Oacute;g has done a significant programme on entrepreneurship.  It links into the student schemes.  They have entered into national competitions and have performed well.  Our broadband officer - who also works with our IT department - made a successful application under the digital innovation fund for a robotics project with primary schools.  That innovative programme is kicking off currently with the first few schools in last week.  This is a new area where we are looking at new technologies and linking into the fabric of the county with the scientific aspect such as with the I-LOFAR radio telescope project in Birr and the STREAM Creative Suite.  We are also developing around new technologies and we have plans with regard to the funding streams available under the digital innovation fund.</p> <p>  On students utilising the libraries' service and new forms of study patterns and mechanisms, the open library system was piloted in Offaly and has now been rolled out around the State.  It has been very successful in utilising off-peak times for students.  It allows them access to Internet provision and provides resources for them.  A number of initiatives are held in libraries with the primary and second level schools at weekends and in the evenings for students around developing health mental skills such as Healthy Ireland and the Lego programme, among others, to try to encourage children to utilise the available services and resources for education and research. </p></speech>

With regard to the co-ordination of the LEOs, significant effort goes into ensuring shared learning across the local enterprise offices.  Enterprise Ireland has a dedicated team based in our Shannon office, which we call the LEO centre of excellence.  The team's job is to work with Ms Martin and the respective LEO managers, and to bring the 31 LEO heads together, to share information and best practice.  We are very much supported by the local authorities in that agenda.  We also have a national steering group, of which Ms Delaney and I are members.  This group shares ideas and best practice at a policy level.</p> <p>  On the issue of property, and hopefully I will not repeat some of the points I raised earlier, we work with IDA Ireland to collaborate as best we can around property needs.  The development of second sites is a key objective for Enterprise Ireland.  Second sites is when Enterprise Ireland companies are growing or expanding and we work with them to identify sites.  If they are based in Dublin or Cork, for example, we see if they would consider expanding their business into a rural location as opposed to expanding in their current location.</p><p>We have some really good examples of that including Abtran last year, as well as Carne.  They are really good companies which have developed second sites in regional locations and brought a lot to those regions.  The regional enterprise development fund, REDF, covers the 42 projects we funded.  Many of those projects were to develop existing facilities.  It did not focus on new builds or new entities.  It was to see what exists in rural locations and what we can do through the fund and the partners involved in those projects to develop those facilities in those locations. </p></speech>

There are the rural and urban funds, which are important and there is the disruptive technologies fund, all of which have been mentioned.  The REDF is a specific fund and the third call has not yet been rolled out.</p></speech>

There is a budget of over &euro;100 million to maintain some of the Office of Public Works, OPW, sites.  Garda stations have been closed down.  Huge sums of money have been invested in various houses down through the years and they are of a high standard in central locations.  Is Enterprise Ireland liaising with the Minister to access some of these buildings, which would need very little investment to bring them into use?</p></speech>

It is something we need to reflect on.  What drives our engagement on property and property development is the needs of our companies, the ones which are expanding and growing.  That is the key driver.  Where those properties come from or what they look like is influenced by the needs of the company in its sector.  We could consider and reflect on that.</p></speech>

A city with a third of the population in it would be a hell of a city.  There is one, Dublin.  We keep noticing that.  Rural Ireland is predominantly outside the towns and villages.  No matter how long, and how often, and how strong the feeling in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and planning and planning and planning is, Irish people are very attached to their non-nucleated villages.  I live in one of those places that is highly enterprising.  We get literature telling us we think better when we are in the city but I do not find I think any better up here than I do down below.  I did not find that when I migrated to the west I became less creative.  I actually became a lot more creative because necessity does that.  I do not find my local population any less creative and I defy anybody to say, given the suite of lack of infrastructure over the years, that they have not been incredibly creative in overcoming that.  We do not seem to understand that there is an Ireland out there that has been written out of the geography and most people expect that Ireland to travel.  What this does is allow that Ireland to stay at home and work from where it is.  It is a pity that all the documents we get seem to talk about towns as if that third did not exist.  We do exist.</p> <p>  I keep pointing to one interesting thing.  I know Killarney eventually got the better of Mullinalaghta but it was David and Goliath.  Pound for pound, however, they put up a hell of a battle for a population of 400 against the whole town of Killarney and its hinterland, as they call it.  St. Thomas's is still in the shake.  I think it is up against Ballyhale Shamrocks. </p></speech>

The other interesting point is that the final finalist is Corofin and there is not a town in sight.  Corofin is a tiny village.  I would say there would not be two players who come from the village.</p> <p>  This committee is a rural one.  Towns are part of rural Ireland but they are not rural Ireland.  We have to keep remembering that.  It is tiny.  There is not any geographic problem in servicing all of rural Ireland.  They had a dream in Australia that was a little bit ambitious of putting fibre into every house there but in some places in the outback it might be necessary to go 10, 20 or 30 miles to find a house.  I know of nowhere in Ireland that is impossible to service with water or electricity.  We have done it for the electricity.  One thing that does disturb me is that the State seems to have just grasped that fibre is like electricity.  It is just a case of sticking in and doing it without having to depend on private people or ingenious LEADER companies or whatever to create a basic resource.  Thanks be to God we did not do that with electricity.  Early in our history we decided that every house was to get electricity and to just do it, get it done, and that was it.  That is my view on this whole fibre thing, just get it done. </p></speech>

I thank the witnesses from Enterprise Ireland, the Offaly LEO and the chief executive of Offaly County Council, Ken Tobin from HQ Tralee, and Abodoo, which is a very progressive private company.</p> <p>  The committee is putting together a report on remote working and smart working.  There is a lot of work being done in this area.  There is a massive movement towards remote working using co-working places.  I compliment Offaly County Council and wish it well with its conference on 8 March.  I thank it for communicating with our committee and for taking this opportunity to come here today and for presenting so well.  </p> <p>  There is a need for co-ordination and collaboration as Deputy Martin Kenny has mentioned, and bringing everyone together on the one hymn sheet.  There are many different ways to draw down funding.  Mr. Tobin referred to the town and village renewal or the fund that was there in Enterprise Ireland, the rural regeneration programme.  There seems to be a need for a more co-ordinated approach, possibly that is what Senator Coffey said about a national plan for remote working.  That should involve different stakeholders such as a private company.  Grow Remote was fantastic when it was here, for the voluntary work it does encouraging communities to set up chapters.  I attended one in Clarecastle.  There is a meeting tomorrow night in Ennis and I compliment everyone involved there.  From that people can grow and develop a shared working space and address the issues Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has raised about congestion in Dublin, the need to rebalance our country and get away from commuting and congestion, and the stagnation in Dublin where there is a housing crisis, to areas where there is not such a demand.</p><p>Our researcher is here today and she has taken note.  We hope to be in a position to present a report.  We will be in touch with the witnesses and they should feel free to stay in touch with the committee.  I again thank them for attending.</p></speech>
