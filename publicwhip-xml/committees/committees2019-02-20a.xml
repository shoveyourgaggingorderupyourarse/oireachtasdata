    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019022000002#A00200"><p>I remind members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off.  Today we have an engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, on the work of the General Affairs Council, GAC.  I welcome her back to our committee.  We will discuss her work on the General Affairs Council, as well as Brexit preparedness and contingency plans and alliance building within the European Union.  It is important for us as the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to ensure that Ireland and the EU are as prepared as possible for what is about to happen.  At the same time as facing challenges that now look very immediate, we must also look beyond the immediate horizon and continue to work to strengthen the EU, and how it works.  I refer, in particular, to how we are going to work after the next month or so.</p> <p>  I would normally read out the usual reminder concerning the rules on privilege, but as the Minister of State is familiar with them, I just remind everybody of their application.  I call the Minister of State to make her opening statement and thank her, her staff and all the people who work with her for the Trojan efforts they are all making.  That is particularly the case in the last couple of months.  Much work has been done.  I know the Minister of State has undertaken much travel and that is very difficult at times.  On behalf of all the members of the committee, I appreciate the work she is doing at this stressful time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019022000002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chair.  I would not like my constituents to think I am travelling too much.  Travel, however, has definitely increased at the moment.  I am delighted to be here again to update the committee on developments.  As usual, it has been a very busy time since I was last with the committee in December, not least regarding Brexit.  I attended the General Affairs Council yesterday where our focus was primarily on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, preparations for the March European Council and the Commission proposal, Towards a Sustainable Europe by 2030.   Ministers also discussed the rule of law in Poland and values of the Union in Hungary.</p> <p>  With the Chair's permission, I propose to focus on four headline issues.  They are our preparedness and contingency plans for Brexit, the next multi-annual financial framework, an update on the other issues discussed during yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the General Affairs Council and, finally, I will give the committee an overview of the work Ireland is undertaking on building alliances across the EU.  I know that the committee is focused on and committed to that as well.  </p> <p>  I will first update the committee on Brexit.  A no-deal Brexit would be highly disruptive and would have profound political, economic and legal implications, most seriously for the UK, but also for Ireland and the rest of the EU.  In light of the ongoing political uncertainties in the UK and the Brexit deadline of 29 March, just a few short weeks away, the Government agreed greater priority should be given immediately to preparations for a no-deal Brexit.  Since then, the Government published its Brexit contingency action plan on 19 December.  This sets out in detail sectoral analyses and approaches to mitigating the impact of a no-deal Brexit.  The plan is designed to be consistent with and complementary to the approach being taken at an EU 27 level to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal.  The legislative provisions envisaged in that plan are due to be published this Friday and will be introduced in the D&aacute;il next week.</p> <p>  I will now focus on the non-legislative preparedness measures being taken to ensure east-west trade continues as smoothly as possible.  We are, of course, developing the additional physical infrastructure needed at our ports and airports.  At Dublin and Rosslare ports, sites suitable for temporary infrastructure have been identified and refurbishment work has already begun.  Space for truck parking is being secured in both locations.  At the same time, plans are advanced for the development of permanent infrastructure in both ports.  At Dublin Airport, existing facilities can cater for the volumes of traffic involved in the event of a no-deal Brexit. </p> <p>  Revenue will have 400 additional customs staff trained and in place by the end of March.  An additional 200 staff can also be recruited by the end of this year.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is implementing the necessary steps to facilitate more sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, controls.  Veterinary personnel and 70 other support staff are now being recruited to implement animal and health SPS checks, as are 61 extra environmental health staff.   In budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019 the Government put in place supports to help businesses prepare for Brexit.  These include a &euro;300 million future growth loan scheme and a separate &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme for business. </p> <p>  Ireland is also preparing for Brexit as part of the EU 27 and with the full support of the European Commission.  Many of the actions aimed at mitigating the effects of a no-deal outcome will be taken at an EU level, as they involve sectors regulated by EU law.  The European Commission published its contingency action plan in November and a communication on contingency in December.  These contained guidance on planning for Brexit but also outlined approaches in key areas.  The EU has also published more than 80 Brexit preparedness notices.  The Commission&rsquo;s contingency action plan emphasises that it stands ready to engage with the member states most affected by a no-deal withdrawal.  It also states that &ldquo;the Commission will support Ireland in finding solutions addressing the specific challenges of Irish businesses&rdquo;.  The EU has agreed to facilitate basic connectivity in air transport and road haulage between the UK and the EU on an interim basis in a no-deal scenario.  The Government continues to engage in intensive discussions with the European Commission and with our EU partners.   My colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, had a detailed discussion with and answered questions in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence last week.  </p> <p>  Regarding the MFF, the European Council had its first substantive discussion of that proposal in December, following a number of policy discussions by the General Affairs Council, which I attend, in the autumn.  The ground was well prepared by the Austrian Presidency which presented a draft &ldquo;negotiating box&rdquo;.  This document essentially outlines the key issues ultimately requiring political decisions.  We welcomed that work as balanced and fair and we see it as the basis for ongoing work in the European Council.  We have, however, stressed that we do not feel the balance is quite right yet.  The Heads of State and Government also said that the European Council should aim to reach agreement on the MFF in the autumn of this year.  We agree with that proposal.</p> <p>  As the European Council President, Mr. Tusk, has highlighted, there is still much work to be done to reach a common position.  Each member state has its own priorities, as does the European Parliament, which is also part of the negotiating geometry.  Negotiations on the MFF are always difficult, but these negotiations have an added complexity due to the uncertainties surrounding Brexit.  The European Parliament elections will also have an impact.  The likelihood, therefore, is that agreement will not be reached in European Council until the latter half of 2019.</p> <p>  Since December, the General Affairs Council has had two discussions on the subject, the latest just yesterday in Brussels.  The Romanian Presidency presented Ministers with a state of play report, which includes a work programme for the months ahead.  The Presidency will focus now on narrowing down the range of options contained in the &ldquo;negotiating box&rdquo; and its aim is to have a revised negotiating box prepared ahead of the June European Council.  It is expected that the General Affairs Council will hold a series of thematic discussions in the meantime to provide the Presidency with political guidance on some of the cross-cutting aspects of the budget.  We have suggested some on climate change and migration, as well as contingency and others.  Work is also under way on agreeing the sectoral programmes which the new budget will fund, either at European Council level or, in some cases, in trilogue with the European Parliament, while that is still possible.  Consideration of the proposed euro area budget is also under way.</p><p>The Irish position has not changed since I last addressed the committee.  As the Taoiseach emphasised at the December EU Council, we want a well-funded Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  The Taoiseach also underlined the need to protect the structural and cohesion funds for countries in central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean.  Ireland, as we know, benefitted enormously from these funds and the investment in our infrastructure that was made possible by them.</p><p> In the current climate we need to ensure continued funding for the INTERREG and PEACE programmes, which are integral to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process and particularly important to Northern Ireland and the Border region.  It is essential that we continue to fund other programmes that work, such as ERASMUS+, which is particularly valuable to young people.  Another example is Horizon Europe, formerly Horizon 2020, which will support the investment in research and development necessary to create the jobs of the future.</p><p> In regard to the overall General Affairs Council, GAC, agenda I will now mention the other topics discussed at the meeting yesterday.  We discussed the agenda for next month&rsquo;s European Council.  The March meeting will discuss climate change, providing guidance on the overall direction of a long-term EU strategy to be submitted under the Paris Agreement.  We will also prepare for the EU-China summit which will take place in April.  In preparation for the next EU strategic agenda, the March Council will focus as always on jobs, growth and competitiveness.  We welcome the inclusion of this topic on the European Council agenda and we are looking forward to a substantive discussion at the meeting.</p><p> Ireland has consistently been a strong supporter of the Single Market and of removing restrictions to trade in goods and services within the EU.  In particular, as I emphasised yesterday, we have stressed the need to make greater progress on services in the Single Market.  This is essential for the competitiveness of all member states and for Europe to remain competitive with other global trading blocs.  Ireland and four other member states commissioned a recent report by Copenhagen Economics, entitled Making EU Trade in Services Work for All.  It clearly shows that the strength of the Single Market is linked inextricably with Europe&rsquo;s competitiveness on the world stage and with European prosperity.</p><p> My colleagues and I also exchanged views yesterday on the Commission&rsquo;s reflection paper, Towards a Sustainable Europe by 2030.  The paper outlines how EU policy is contributing towards achieving the sustainable development goals and where further action is required.  Ireland welcomes the paper as another confirmation of the EU&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to achieving the sustainable development goals.  The discussions made clear our hope that it would bring a renewed sense of urgency.  The goals were first agreed more than three years ago.  In particular, we support the paper&rsquo;s reaffirmation that sustainable development is deeply rooted in the European project.  As I repeated to the Commissioner yesterday, many member states, including Ireland, have their own national implementation strategies.  The EU&rsquo;s focus should now be on ambitious practical implementation, not general discussion within the European Union.</p><p> Finally, two important topics have been preoccupying the General Affairs Council, namely, the rule of law in Poland and the values of the EU in Hungary.  The GAC held five hearings on Poland last year and the Romanian Presidency updated Ministers on those issues yesterday.  As the committee will be aware, the central issue is the rule of law and its application there.  In October, the European Court of Justice issued an interim ruling ordering Poland to adopt measures to temporarily suspend the application of Polish legislation which had lowered the retirement age for sitting and future judges.  Poland has since adopted legislation to amend the law affecting its Supreme Court and enable the return to work of judges forced to retire.  This move was in response to the interim ruling.  A final judgment from the European Court of Justice is due within the next few months.</p><p> Ours is a Union based on shared values including democracy, human rights and the rule of law and Ireland has consistently supported the Commission in this matter.  In my intervention yesterday I urged Poland to continue its engagement with the Commission on concerns that have been aired while acknowledging the importance of the work Poland has done to date.  I also acknowledged the fact that Commission Vice-President Timmermans has raised further concerns about which we had not previously heard.  We urge the Polish Government to continue to engage.  The Presidency concluded that the EU Council will remain seized of the issue.</p><p> The Presidency also updated Ministers on Hungary yesterday.  As the committee will know, the Parliament referred an opinion on the values of the European Union to the Council following the adoption of the Sargentini report.  The Commission has since prepared a paper on the values-related infringement procedures that it has undertaken to address concerns about the situation in Hungary.  Ireland has previously made its concerns known in relation to issues surrounding the rule of law generally, particularly recent legislation targeting non-governmental actors in Hungary.  Several member states, including Ireland, expressed concerns yesterday about the current situation in Hungary and the Presidency promised to return to the issue in due course.  At this time, when we are facing many challenges within the European Union, it is more important than ever that we stand by our shared values.  Moreover, a new development was raised by the Commissioner yesterday concerning a Government-funded campaign in Hungary specifically targeting Mr. George Soros and the President of the Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker.  This is a worrying new development.  Obviously these issues need to be dealt with on the basis of mutual respect, and I hope we will be able to discuss them again at a later date. </p><p> Finally, I would like to comment on alliance-building and strengthening the EU.  Ireland has always been an outward-looking country and recognised that our influence grows through co-operation with others.  As we were reminded during the D&aacute;il 100 celebrations, one of the first acts of the D&aacute;il was to send a message to the free nations of the world to ask for their support in our search for independence.  The presence of so many of our friends and EU partners at the anniversary celebrations and the remarkable solidarity we have experienced throughout the Brexit negotiations is a testament to Ireland&rsquo;s message being heard and to our place at the heart of Europe.  Solidarity is built on understanding, shared perspectives and reciprocity.  It is a priority for us to thank our European partners for the solidarity they have shown to us, but it is also essential that we understand their perspectives on the full range of issues we face in our shared Union and to discuss our priorities for the future.  To do this, we have strategically increased the range and intensity of our contacts with other member states and the EU institutions.  We have intensified our engagement at political and official level, strengthened our diplomatic presence and undertaken joint initiatives to help to shape the EU agenda in a way that best reflects the interests of the Irish people.</p><p> The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and I have stepped up bilateral engagement with our European counterparts.  Last year, along with my general affairs visits and other Council meetings I managed to visit nine other EU capitals as well as the European Parliament in Strasbourg.  I look forward to meeting my Latvian and Lithuanian counterparts in Riga and Vilnius later this month.  The Government&rsquo;s ambitious programme of visits for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day will serve as a platform to underline Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to and membership of the European Union.  Ministers will visit all 27 European capitals over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period.  Extra personnel have been added to key missions and more will follow in this summer&rsquo;s rotation.  A Consulate General of Ireland will open in Cardiff shortly and a new Irish Consulate will open in Frankfurt in the autumn on foot of a root-and-branch review of our relations with Germany.  The Irish ambassador in Paris is due to make proposals to the T&aacute;naiste and myself in April as part of a wider review of our excellent relations with France.  I also want to recognise the very important role that this committee plays in strengthening our engagement with both current and prospective member states.  I am heartened to see this reflected in its work programme for the coming year.  I thank members for their efforts.  I would like to thank the committee for the invitation to speak here.  I thank the Chairman and his team for the work that they do and I look forward to any questions from the Deputies and Senators. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019022000002#B00500"><p>I will try to keep my remarks to specific questions with minimal commentary.  In regard to the multi-annual financial framework I would like to raise the timelines the Minister of State has laid out for Council adoption.  Is this in order or is it a little bit shorter than it usually is due to obvious concerns facing the Union at the moment?  What are the timelines laid out for the European Parliament's involvement in this process?  I am delighted to see the Government putting so much emphasis on maintaining funding for ERASMUS+ and Horizon 2020.  My main concern is that this must be accompanied domestically by encouragement and emphasis to make sure people are taking up those programmes.  I am strongly of the belief that we are not taking up as many opportunities to send young people abroad through ERASMUS+ as possible.  We need to maximise our opportunities to work with other partners through Horizon 2020, particularly with the UK leaving.</p> <p>  The rule of law is an issue I am extremely worried about.  I know we have shared many discussions about it.  I note the actions that have been taken and the ongoing work, particularly in Poland.  However, the concerns I have relate to Hungary.  What are the sanctions?  I know what the European Court of Justice can do and the rules on which the Council can insist.  If they are not adopted, what are the sanctions for a member state that continuously flouts the values of the European Union?</p> <p>  Alliances are particularly vital, especially when it comes to the multi-annual financial framework and other challenges connected to that, such as the renegotiation of the CAP and the possibility of new measures concerning taxation.</p><p>That is something we need to double down on.  We need to build our multiple layered alliances, not only with one or two countries, be it the Hanseatic alliance or anything else.  We really need to increase it.  </p><p> I am delighted to hear we are opening a consulate in Frankfurt.  I met the Irish ambassador in Paris.  I strongly believe we also need a consulate somewhere in the south of France.  It is such a big country and it is vitally important to our future diplomatic efforts within Europe.  Overall, the amount we invested in terms of people, money and resources in our embassies across the EU has shown in recent years how good an investment that has been.  It is time we doubled down on that investment.  We need to strengthen our diplomatic footprint, not only around the world.  I am enthused that we are opening embassies in Chile, a consulate in Vancouver and so on but we have to look after Europe first.  There is great scope for us to increase that.  </p><p> Within that outreach, was there any discussion at the General Affairs Council on the Minister of State's work in the eastern Balkans?  I am considering future partners and potential future members, particularly in terms of the events as they relate to the area that is now officially North Macedonia and everything that is going on there.</p><p> It is hard not to mention the "B" word but we are 37 days away from it and the situation is becoming increasingly worryingly.  I appreciate the Minister of State's comments on our preparedness in terms of the legislation.  I was at the committee meeting, along with others, last Thursday when we got a good briefing from the T&aacute;naiste.  I look forward to welcoming him to the Seanad Chamber before St. Patrick's Day but hopefully we will not get to that point.  I hope I will not have to welcome him to the Chamber but I will if needs be.  What were the discussions in terms of comparisons at the GAC meeting yesterday?  I know the French and the Dutch have taken a very different approach from the Irish in allowing Ministers far more direct powers to prepare for a no-deal scenario.  What was the Commission's opinion on the work that has been done domestically by the Irish Government on our preparedness for it?  Also, will the Minister of State outline the mood at the GAC meeting?  What are the thoughts of our 26 partners in the European member states on the unfolding disaster we see in Westminster at present?  Is the solidarity with Ireland still strong?  I have no doubt it is but it is very important we relay that and that we continuously stress we are a European Union of 27 member states which are sticking together right until the last minute despite the concerns or outlandish desires of certain people in our commentariat?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019022000002#C00200"><p>I agree with much of what my colleague has said, but I would like to bring the focus back home.  In 2016, the day after the referendum, I wrote an article on the re-establishment of a Border on this island.  At the time, it was scoffed at by many as an impossibility.  It is not quite so impossible now.  I would like to know what steps has the Government taken to bring back the corporate knowledge we have lost since roughly 1998 to 1999, in particular to bring back customs people who worked the Border at that time and understand it in terms of training some of those 400 people who are coming forward?  We have closed Garda stations over the years and there is no Defence Forces location anywhere between Donegal and Dundalk.  In terms of Cavan and Monaghan, are we carrying out reconnaissance to find locations where soldiers can be accommodated in the event of a Border being put in place?</p> <p>  Language is everything when we are talking about the future of our relationship with Northern Ireland.  I deeply resent the term "hard border".  There was never a hard border on the island of Ireland, not since the foundation of the State.  There has been a highly militarised Border and a Border that was managed with checkpoints but there was never a hard border on this island.  When we talk about a hard border going forward, are we considering putting in place a hard border which means, to use a "Trumpism", building the wall?  I do not see that happening.  I see us going back to the type of Border we had which was a managed Border which will require physical presence at approved crossings.  Once we put a physical present in place, it will require personnel from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  Has that even been war-gamed at this stage?  Have we any idea where we stand there?  </p> <p>  The next issue is that of funding.  My colleague, Senator Richmond, mentioned it to a certain degree.  We had two groups before the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement last week and they are particularly concerned about the mismatch of funding that will take place in a post-Brexit scenario, even if it is a soft Brexit.  We expect we will still have European money coming to the Southern counties through the various programmes in place but what steps are being taken to guarantee that the British will match pound per euro to ensure we have funding on the Northern side.</p> <p>  In terms of the other issues that have arisen, much play is made about the unity of Europe and how we are all in this together but as one famous investor, George Soros, put it, Europe is likely to catastrophically collapse in a situation worse than the Soviet Union.  He points to the various things that are happening around Europe, including the yellow vest protests in France, the right wing in Italy, and deviance within the systems in Poland and Hungary.  How sure are we that the solidarity we talk about will remain in place in the event of a crash out?</p> <p>  I will make two final points the first of which is on the issue of a Border poll.  Those who advocate for a Border poll are not here, which is a pity, because I would like to see that this issue is firmly eliminated from the discussion by the Government.  We want communities in Northern Ireland to live together in harmony and to trade and work with people in the South of Ireland.  A Border poll is a long way away.</p> <p>  My final point is that Senator Richmond&rsquo;s committee has set up a number of meetings in the North of Ireland in early March.  Wisely, he has included civic groups from the unionist and nationalist communities.  I have spoken to Senator Richmond on that.  There is a growing civic voice in the North of Ireland that is neither nationalist nor unionist.  They are the ordinary citizens who are concerned for their future, regardless of whichever way it goes, whether there is a crash out Brexit or a hard Brexit.  They need and want a voice.  Has our Government considered a way we might give them a voice to ensure their concerns can be raised, first across Ireland and, second, across Europe?  Sadly, the voice from Northern Ireland we are hearing down here is that of one side only, which does not necessarily reflect the feeling on the ground.  I thank the Chairman.  I am sorry if I went on a bit.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019022000002#C00400"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the committee again and being forthright in the information made available to us.  I will make two or three brief points.  I refer to direct access to the Continent post-Brexit from the point of view of Irish exporters by way of Rosslare or other ports.  Questions have been raised as to whether that might not be easy to do.  I do not see any logistical reason that cannot happen.  Do we have sufficient investment provisions put in place to ensure that Irish hauliers can get directly to the Continent as quickly as possible, thus bypassing the need to cross over into the UK, with the obvious delays that might occur?</p> <p>  On the &euro;300 million future growth loan scheme, to what extent has that been accessed or is it being accessed by the various businesses throughout the country?  Is it working, or will it work, satisfactory?  Has sufficient evidence been gleaned at this stage to determine that?</p> <p>  It is important that we recognise the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  There has been a sort of revision in recent times to the effect that agricultural production should be scaled down to meet other requirements and so on.  I believe it is possible to maintain both agricultural production and meeting carbon reduction requirements without damaging the agricultural sector.</p><p>I emphasise that there are thousands of people all over the globe, including children, who are dying of starvation.  We must recognise that we have to be realistic.  We have to ensure sufficient food is produced in order that we can make our contribution towards alleviating the ongoing threat of starvation.</p><p> Senator Craughwell needs to be careful about making provision for the creation of a border.  We need to be careful that we do not create one.  The position we have been forced into is one where, by virtue of its diplomatic provisions, the United Kingdom is effectively abolishing the Good Friday Agreement and all that it has stood for, which is extraordinary.  It is a solemn agreement that was written and acceded to by several countries, including Canada and the United States of America, as well as by the European Union and others who made major contributions.  All of this is to be set aside to follow a particular political path that nobody seems to understand.  It saddens me that as eminent and powerful a body as the United Kingdom sees fit to set aside a solemn agreement of the nature of the Good Friday Agreement.  Effectively, this is what is being attempted.  Is it being reminded of the seriousness of the issue?  It will have serious consequences for Europe and, particularly, Ireland, North and South.  We need to be absolutely certain that we will not do that work for it by saying this is inevitable; we must not do it.  The fact is that it decided what it wanted to do and it is pursuing it.  Of course, it has other options.  Far be it from me to try to tell our neighbours what they should do, but they could go back and hold another referendum.  They say they cannot and will not do so, that the referendum result is sacrosanct, but it is as sacrosanct as everything else when it comes to negotiations.  They could do so, but of what are they afraid?  Are they afraid the result might be in the opposite direction?  I am certainly of that opinion.  It is so sad and worrying at this stage of our development to see a major European player such as the United Kingdom continuing in this direction, notwithstanding the indications of concern from the businesses and investment sectors.  Some companies are moving out, while others are expressing their deep concerns at the potential disastrous consequences.</p><p> My last point relates to the European Union's cohesiveness.  We welcome and thank our EU colleagues for their solid support.  Without it there would be no sense in having any discussion at all and there would be no European Union either.  If it starts to fragment or one brick is out of the wall, we must remember that its concept was thought of when Europe lay in flames and ashes.  It was constructed in such a way to ensure we would not suffer the starvation of the past and as a result of member states deciding to take offence at each other and wage a war.  The concept was well thought out by people who had forged their opinions from the very harsh reality of the experience from 1939 to 1945, one that should never be revisited.  Everything possible needs to be done to ensure that will not happen.  There are those who will dismiss all of these possibilities and say, "Not at all; that is never likely to happen again," but they are wrong.  Man's inhumanity to man will continue forever.  It has never been known to have been surpassed, until the next time when it gets worse.</p><p> Ireland has a role to play in what lies ahead.  We have done well by our EU colleagues and I believe they have done well by us in recent times.  It remains to be seen what will prevail hereinafter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019022000002#D00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and her staff, as well as the ambassador and the embassy staff.  I commend the embassies on always having members here to listen to contributions.</p> <p>  I disagree with Deputy Durkan on the Good Friday Agreement.  From our discussions, it stands, irrespective of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.  All of the institutions under it - the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly - will continue post-Brexit.  That is a fact.  It is an international agreement which was signed and registered with the United Nations.  Under it, we will and must continue to develop and expand our relationship with our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom.  As the Minister of State mentioned, we can do this through our contributions at committee meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs which is willing and able to continue bilateral discussions at the highest level with Members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  I certainly aspire to this work being done by the committee in the future.  We have such a relationship that elements such as free movement for Irish people in the United Kingdom and a lot of other things will continue.  Let us sound a positive note in that regard.  The influence of the Irish in Britain is enormous and will be vital after Brexit.  </p> <p>  I see no appetite for the holding of another referendum.  It is aspirational and pie in the sky.  Having met and discussed the matter with British people, they are war weary about Brexit, the House of Commons, the ongoing debate, the political defections and the new groups being formed.  They just want finality as quickly as possible.  The deadline of 29 March stands.  </p> <p>  I compliment the Minister of State, her officials and the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, who briefed the committee last week on the 92 pages of a composite Bill which covers all Departments.  He made it quite clear that it would be an all-party Bill and that he wanted an input from all parties and Independents in order that when the comprehensive Bill passed through the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, there would be unity of purpose among Members to ensure it would cover all areas, including ones that may not have been considered at this point.  From the perspective of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party and the Seanad, I can assure him that we are very anxious to ensure the Bill will be passed on time and in advance of the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.  If something happens, the Bill will be put on ice until Britain leaves the European Union.  It will be a comprehensive insurance policy based on the United Kingdom leaving the EU on 29 March.  Post-Brexit there will be time for discussions and negotiations on what will happen next, but the angles are being covered very well.  Deputy Durkan referred to the land bridge.  It is protected, provided one sends a product directly from Ireland to elsewhere in the European Union.  It will not be inspected under the current international agreement.  The important aspect is that goods from Ireland will have a fast track to elsewhere in the European Union.  The British Government will co-operate in order that an extra lane on the land bridge will be dedicated to European Union traffic to and from Ireland.   It is also in the United Kingdom's interest to ensure we will be able to continue to move our exports through the United Kingdom.</p> <p>  On the issues for travellers and motorists, North and South, the insurance companies have indicated that they will be providing a green card, or pass.  It will be very honourable for them to issue it to all drivers, regardless of whether one travels frequently to the North.</p><p>It will allow anyone who is travelling to pass through, North and South.  It is very easy to do in County Monaghan and elsewhere.  One can pass through the North handily.  As such, the card should be issued to customers.  I call on the insurance company with which I deal, FBD, to show generosity of spirit.  I understand there will be no extra charge.  The card should be issued after the United Kingdom decides to leave the European Union.</p><p> The danger of an extension to Article 50 is that if it moves beyond 29 March, we will be into the European elections campaign.  Britain will maintain the right to field candidates in the elections if it moves beyond 24 May and the additional seats for the Republic of Ireland will not be available until a final decision is made.  They will remain in abeyance if the United Kingdom decides to contest the European elections, as it will be entitled to do.  It is just a proviso.  </p><p> I note that there is deep concern about the suppression of the opposition in Hungary.  The European Union should insist on the new opposition party which is associated with Fianna F&aacute;il's European Parliament group, ALDE, being given access to radio and television services.</p></speech>

As such, there will be plenty of time for contributions.  </p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive report and welcome what she said about alliance building.  Whether we like it, the United Kingdom is a major ally of the Republic of Ireland in the European Union and we will miss it and its support on a wide range of issues.  I encourage the Minister of State in her endeavours in alliance building.  There are issues of concern for us in that regard, as well as for other member states, be it in agriculture, taxation or defence matters.  I welcome the solidarity expressed and the work the Minister of State and diplomats are doing to build new alliances following the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  I also welcome the Minister of State's remarks on the rule of law.  She said the European Union was based on shared values, including democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  I encourage her in the stance she has taken, in particular on Poland and Hungary.  The European elections are to be held in May and there is concern that the basic values of the European Union may be challenged in them.  I hope citizens in this and other member states will reflect deeply on the type of European Union we want to see.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State clarify an issue related to the multi-annual financial framework?  In the event that there is a no-deal Brexit, what is the expectation in respect of the British contribution to the European Union?  While it is provided for in the withdrawal agreement, what is the expectation, should the United Kingdom crash out, of what its contribution to the European Union will be in the next few years?  </p> <p>  On preparations for Brexit, the Minister of State spoke about Dublin and Rosslare ports and said suitable sites for temporary infrastructure had been identified and that refurbishment work had commenced.  She said space for truck parking had been secured at both locations.  As a northside Deputy, I have a real worry about the Dublin Port tunnel.  There are reports that it may have to close on occasion if there are backlogs.  It is a major piece of transport infrastructure for the city and the country and if there is any hold-up whatsoever in the movement of trucks and other traffic through the tunnel, it will destroy traffic flows generally.  It will disrupt traffic completely.  I hope the line Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is conscious of this.  It is the first thing people will realise when they are stuck in their car in much longer traffic jams.  I hope that issue is being looked at by those who should be considering it.</p> <p>  I congratulate the Minister of State on her work at the citizens' dialogue on the future of Europe.  The report presented concludes by drawing attention to the summit to be held in Romania to prepare the strategic agenda for the period 2019 to 2024.  The document states that in advance of the summit Ireland will publish a statement on its strategic priorities for the European Union.  I ask for an up-to-date report.  The citizens who participated in the dialogue would like to know the results of their work and what the Government intends to do.</p></speech>

The 80%, approximately, of our exports which go to continental Europe travel through Britain via Dover to Calais.  What arrangements, if any, will be made in the event that there is no deal?  Will lorries have their own lane to pass through, given that it looks like there could be a back-up of British trucks well up the road towards London?  Some of the goods being transported will be perishable and even if we were to develop a sea route, the journey to France would take much longer.  We do not have the ferries necessary to handle them.  That traffic will have to continue to travel through Britain.  As such, it will be very important to ensure it will have its own arrangements.</p> <p>  I agree with Senator Craughwell that a Border poll would be dangerous and is years away.  The matter is governed by the Good Friday Agreement.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on the issue.  My understanding is the British Government is very firm in its view on the Agreement and does not propose to set it aside.  It is standing over it very firmly.  Will the Minister of State comment on the matter?</p> <p>  What does the Minister of State think of the possibility of an extension of the 29 March deadline?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019022000002#E00500"><p>I thank the Senator.  I was very glad to hear of the ambitious programme being put together by the Government to mark St. Patrick's Day.  It is co-incidental that St. Patrick's Day falls on the day that it does, but there is an opportunity to take sensible steps.  Sometimes people in the media have knocked this and other Governments for sending senior and junior Ministers around the globe, but it provides desperately good value for money and is a very worthwhile programme.  When I see Ministers, Ministers of State and their officials travelling abroad, I take the view that they are ambassadors for the country.  We are all flying the same flag and the Opposition parties and Independents, including Government supporting groups, should be 100% behind that job of work.  It is very beneficial, this year more than ever, to visit each EU capital at this critical time.  They are going to fly the Irish flag, which is tremendously important work and its importance cannot be overemphasised.  It is about using our ambassadors abroad and continuing a strong programme of engagement and work with foreign ambassadors based here and those who cover Ireland from overseas stations.  That is what will take us through the next number of weeks, months and years.  I was glad to see the Government being ambitious and making a special effort in Europe this year.  I recognise that work.  I do not want to delay the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019022000002#E00600"><p>We are okay on time.  We have another 45 minutes owing to the delay in the D&aacute;il.  </p> <p>  I thank members and the Chairman for their comments and support.  Ireland has a unique opportunity to sell itself and otherwise engage with member states and countries across the world on St. Patrick's Day.  It is an important opportunity for us to relay the best of what we have to offer in trade, business, culture and many other key areas.</p><p>I thank members for their comments on that.</p><p> Senator Richmond asked about the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and the timelines.  Initially, when this discussion started almost two years ago the current Commission had the ambition that it would be concluded and finalised before the European elections but, as we have seen in previous years, the negotiations are extremely complex and the added complexities of Brexit have pushed that out further.  We agree that a finalised political decision should be made by October.  Engagement is already happening with the European Parliament on specific areas, sectors and industries but we hope that when it is agreed in October or in the autumn it would then be passed on to the Parliament and it would work on it also and then it would have to be agreed.  I met the Chair of the committee on budgets of the Parliament and many others on this as well.  There is constant engagement on the MFF at various levels.  It is important that we try to conclude it in a timely manner.  I note that in the previous MFF a number of programmes were delayed because of the delay in agreeing the final overall budget, so it is important that we get it done on time.</p><p> I agree with what the Deputy said about Erasmus and many other programmes.  We need to highlight Erasmus more, as well as the fact that it is not just for third level students as it also now applies to those who are in traineeships or those who work in voluntary or community organisations, and those who are in primary school or secondary school.  There are so many more opportunities available that it is important that in addition to the education platforms, we highlight the opportunities that are available.  When we carried out the Future of Europe discussions throughout the country the one thing people highlighted and that became clear to us in the discussions is that people are not aware of a lot of what Europe is doing and that we need to communicate better.  In that regard, as part of our overall discussion and the presentation that we will make to the Council meeting in Sibiu on 9 May, we have started engaging with all Departments, including the Department of Education and Skills, to identify how they could better communicate their own connections with Europe or how people can benefit through European programmes such as Erasmus+ and others.  We have had engagement already and hope to have further engagement with Departments in that regard.</p><p> Senator Richmond referred to the rule of law in Hungary and asked what are the sanctions.  We must adhere to the process that is currently in place.  We have seen results in certain areas following the engagement with Poland.  New legislation was introduced on the basis of the hearings we have had.  I contributed to five different hearings and engaged with our Polish colleagues in the Commission.  We need to allow the process to take place for Hungary as well.  This was presented to the Council through the European Parliament.  An initial discussion was had on how that would be brought forward as it was a new initiative but following on from yesterday's discussion, the current Presidency has stated this will continue to be an issue and that we must continue to raise it.  I accept there are concerns but Hungary has asked for fair and due process in order to address the questions people have raised.</p><p> In terms of the alliances, as many speakers mentioned, we are losing one of our closest neighbours, friends and allies in the UK.  We want to continue to be able to work with the UK on key issues but when it comes to the European Council, the General Affairs Council, the agriculture committees or whatever other fora our Ministers will attend, they will not be around the table and it is important that we have other alliances on financial issues, tax, the next MFF, agricultural issues or the digital single economy in terms of the D9+ group that is set up.  We are actively engaged in various groups but we are also in discussions with member states across the European Union.  It is extremely important that we continue that process and where we can find commonalities that we would work with each other while at the same time not creating any divisions between the European Union and its member states.</p><p> In terms of the western Balkans, it is extremely important that we continue to show support for those states seeking to join the European Union.  While one member state is unfortunately looking to leave, there are many others who see the European Union as the way forward and as a way for their country to develop, prosper and grow, in particular for their young people.  Last year I travelled to Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro and this year I will go to Albania and North Macedonia.  What is very clear is that if the European Union does not continue to engage and to open up a process for those states to move along the path to accession, then other countries and regions will engage with them.  We must make sure we continue that engagement.  My visit to the western Balkans this year was with my Finnish colleague.  It is important that we do not just develop those relationships as individual member states but also that we work together to show unity from the European Union as a whole.</p><p> In terms of Brexit discussions, the Commission's thoughts on where we are and what we are doing and the general mood, to be honest I think the general mood is one of frustration at the moment.  The Commission is continuing to encourage all member states to prepare in the best way that they can.  The work that we are doing is not necessarily what other member states need to do, but we are trying to make sure, inasmuch as we can, everything that we do is in parallel with the work that the Commission is doing.  There is constant engagement to make sure that we are working in parallel and that we can replicate here anything it is working on where we need to do so.</p><p> Senator Craughwell asked what steps have been taken to deal with customs issues.  Officials have been hired to deal with east-west trade and the possible complications in terms of freight transport and having to provide documentation that was not the case heretofore.  Most importantly, our focus is on ensuring that businesses are prepared and are able to have the documentation and to prepare in that way.  In that regard Revenue has been taking part in an outreach programme recently since the central case planning has been ramped up to implementation of a no-deal scenario.  It is engaging with small and medium enterprises and it has engaged with a significant number of larger companies as well to make sure they have the correct expertise and knowledge to be able to deal with any of the possible changes that may happen.  It is important to stress that even in a deal scenario, some additional paperwork will be required, as well as some changes to the way people are doing business, so it is important that they avail of the assistance irrespective of whether there is going to be a deal or not, because it will be important either way.</p><p> As for sending soldiers or identifying places for posts, that is simply not happening.  It is not something we are considering.  We are not considering anything of the nature of a wall or otherwise and we have consistently said that.  We have consistently repeated that there is an onus on the UK to fulfil its obligations as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  The invisible Border that currently exists is integral to the Good Friday Agreement and the continued success of the agreement.</p><p> In terms of the mismatch of funding due to Brexit for the PEACE and INTERREG programmes for communities in the North, that is a significant challenge.  If the UK were to leave without a deal, we do not know what will happen with funding.  That goes back to the question on the MFF and what will happen next.  We would have to find out from the UK what funding it wants to continue to pay.  The Prime Minister has been clear that there are certain programmes the UK wants to leave, be it the Common Agricultural Policy or the Common Fisheries Policy, but the UK has consistently stated it wishes to remain part of programmes such as PEACE and INTERREG.  The UK has already given a commitment to continue to co-fund the programmes with Ireland and the European Union.  In addition, the UK also wants to continue involvement with Erasmus and Horizon 2020 among the social and educational programmes.  Until we hear from the UK as to what it is that it will continue to fund, it is very hard to identify where the gaps might be.  We will continue to fund the PEACE and INTERREG programmes and any others that require cross-Border and North-South support.</p><p> In terms of solidarity within the EU, support is strong from all member states.  There is frustration but there is clarity from all the colleagues to whom I have spoken, as recently as yesterday, that the withdrawal agreement must remain as is, and that the backstop, the Irish protocol and the issues discussed in terms of the financial settlement and citizens' rights cannot be reopened, but there is an opportunity to focus on the future relationship and possible changes to that.</p><p> Senator Craughwell mentioned the European elections that are coming up and that solidarity is strong but there are different factions within European member states that are possibly moving more towards the left or right.  Any colleagues with whom I have engaged on the future of Europe discussions and support for the European Union have said that support for the EU is not less than 60% in any member state.  Ours is quite high at 90% but most member states are 60%, 70% or 80% supportive of the European Union.</p><p>Through that engagement and through the future of Europe process, hopefully we can increase that number in all member states, including Ireland.<br/><br/>On the issue of a border poll, I reiterate what Senator Craughwell has said.  This is not the time for a border poll.  It is certainly not on this Government's agenda and will not be on our agenda in the context of the overall discussions we are having in terms of a deal or no deal.  Reference was made to civic groups from the unionist and nationalist communities and the fact that people feel that they do not have representation but the best way to address that is through a functioning Northern Ireland Executive.  It is two years and one month since the Assembly last sat, which is a world record for a region to be without a government.  It is extremely important that the Executive is back up and running so that groups like the Ulster Farmers Union, Retail NI and various other groups which have expressed support for the withdrawal agreement feel that they have a voice.<br/><br/>Deputy Durkan asked if there is enough investment in place for hauliers.  As I said in my opening statement, we are investing as much as we can to ensure that all of the facilities, space and mechanisms are in place at our own ports, including sufficient numbers of customs officials, staff to conduct sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks, as well as any required additional lay-bys or expansion of the parameters of the ports.  What we cannot predict is what the impact will be on those hauliers who continue to use the UK landbridge.  We can prepare at our own ports and can engage with our European colleagues, which we have done, particularly in France and Belgium, to try to ensure that when Irish trucks arrive, they are provided with a faster or a dedicated lane to drive through.  However, we have no such commitment from the UK and I do not expect that Irish hauliers would have a quicker pass through the Channel Tunnel than British hauliers.  That is obviously one of the biggest challenges that we face.  Of course, we are also ensuring that even in a no-deal scenario, there will be a reciprocal arrangement to ensure that UK hauliers could continue to travel through the EU and <i>vice versa</i>.  However, that is not going to replace what we currently have and is not going to be as good as the <i>status quo</i>.  This is one of the biggest challenges that we face but we are working with hauliers who are at the front line in terms of a lot of the chains that we talk about.  It is important that they are aware of the supports that are available to them, as well as what is happening on the ground.<br/><br/>On the &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme fund, it is my understanding that as of 28 January, 338 firms have been given approval.  The businesses involved range across the agrifood sector, retail, distribution, manufacturing, hospitality and transport.  A further 36 loan applications are being processed at present.  Loans to the value of &euro;15.34 million have already been sanctioned so there is still a substantial amount of funding available.  In that regard, I would encourage companies to apply to the scheme if they think it is appropriate.  We are trying to move the applications along as quickly as possible.  There are other supports available too.  At a European level, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, has been given permission by the Commission to establish a rescue and restructuring fund in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.  This will provide further support for SMEs whose very survival is under threat.  In cases that are not as severe, additional supports can be provided and ceilings can be lifted by Enterprise Ireland.<br/><br/>Reference was made to the CAP and to food security and we have consistently stated in the context of the next round of multi-annual financial framework, MFF, that we would be willing to pay 1.1% rather than the 1% currently being proposed by the Commission.  That said, we would obviously want to ensure that our traditional priorities are protected, including the CAP.  This is not just important for our own farmers and our own indigenous agriculture sector, but also in terms of food security, hygiene and health.  We have a real opportunity to connect this with our discussions on research and innovation, climate change and how our own farmers are champions of change and continue to produce food in the most sustainable way possible.<br/><br/>I assure the committee that the UK has been reminded of the seriousness of the Good Friday Agreement.  While it is not for us to interfere in the political process in the UK, we are within our rights to remind the British Government of its obligations as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and we continue to do so.  European support has been absolutely steadfast and is very strong.  While we might disagree on certain issues and processes, solidarity on this particular issue and the unity of the EU 27 on it has been very strong.  Senator Leyden also spoke about the Good Friday Agreement and its standing, irrespective of Brexit, and I agree with him that we must continue to develop the relationships we have.  That is why Irish Ministers are continuing to engage with their UK counterparts, separate to the Brexit negotiations which are being handled by Mr. Michel Barnier and his team at a European level.  It is fair to say that relationships are somewhat strained, which is only natural when a negotiation is under way but we have been very clear that we want the progress we have made in recent years to continue post Brexit.  We will continue to use the already established ways and means, including various committees, to support that engagement.  The committees formed as a result of the Good Friday Agreement could be a good way of engaging with the British when they are no longer sitting at the table at European Council meetings.<br/><br/>We want to pass the so-called omnibus Bill on time and thank Deputies from all sides for their support.  We will do everything we can to ensure that it is implemented on time.  If it is not needed for 29 March, it will still be there for when it is needed.  In response to the various questions about hauliers and being able to ensure that goods can get to the EU as quickly as possible, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has done an enormous amount of work on sea transport.  A new vessel, the <i>MV W.B. Yeats</i>, has been launched which can carry three times the amount of its predecessor, which is very significant.  However, in terms of perishable goods that need a 20-hour turnaround time rather than goods that can handle a 40 or 60-hour turnaround time, the land bridge is obviously going to be the quickest option, notwithstanding the challenges faced by hauliers when they get to the UK.  We are doing everything we can to try to address that.  <br/><br/>A question was asked about an extension of Article 50 but as recently as last week, the British Prime Minister said that she is not going to ask for one.  Until the British actually ask for an extension, we cannot predict what will happen there.  Of course, if they do ask for an extension, we have always said that we would look upon such a request favourably.  However, having spoken to colleagues in Europe about this recently, it is clear that the Commission and member states would want to know that there is a good reason for granting an extension and that we will not end up in the same place as we are now in three months' time, which is simply prolonging the uncertainty for so many businesses and people.<br/><br/>On the issue of the green card, this is something that insurance companies are taking on board, based on what was in place prior to our membership of the European Union.  My understanding is that they will begin to engage with all of their customers at the beginning of March if a deal has not been agreed or if we have not seen progress.  Obviously people do not want to have to fill out additional paperwork but contingency plans must be in place just in case.  <br/><br/>We will continue to engage on Hungary and to voice our concerns about the many different issues involved, including the negative impact of recent legislation on voluntary and community organisations, the moving of university courses to Vienna and the Government-funded campaign against the President of the European Commission.  Deputy Haughey made reference to the need to continue to build alliances in Europe.  As I have already said, we are continuing to engage with our EU partners in the context of discussions on the MFF, the digital agenda, agriculture and finance and taxation issues, as well as on a one-to-one basis.  I will be travelling to Lithuania and Latvia next week and the T&aacute;naiste will continue his engagements across all of the EU member states.  The rule of law in Poland was mentioned.  We will continue with our current policy in that regard but there is a frustration at European level that this process has been ongoing for some time now.  While we have seen significant developments, not enough progress has been made in certain areas.  This is something on which we need to work together to try to bring it to a conclusion sooner rather than later.</p><p>We will have to wait and see if the UK will continue to make a contribution to the multi-annual financial framework in the event of a no-deal scenario.</p><p> In April, we hope to publish our contribution to the future of Europe event in Sibiu, Romania, on 9 May.  I hope there will be a debate in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in order that everybody can engage in and contribute to it before it is presented by the Taoiseach on 9 May.</p><p> Senator Paul Coghlan asked about the hauliers and ensuring that our exports to the EU reach member states as quickly as possible.  We are obviously doing everything I have just outlined, from the work on our ports, to engaging with our EU colleagues, to additional ships, to various other ways that we are trying to engage.  The UK has not stated that it will ask for an extension on Article 50.  Unless it does so, it is difficult to deal with that issue.</p></speech>

The Minister is most welcome and I trust his visit to our country will be successful.  It has been successful already in that he has been warmly received at every engagement included in his programme.  Committee members are very interested in hearing from him and we are very happy to have this engagement with him in our Parliament.  I also welcome the Maltese ambassador to renew our friendship.  I thank colleagues on the Joint Committee on European Affairs for accommodating the approach to this meeting.  A visit by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Promotion of a valued partner member of the European Union is very much of interest to our colleagues on that committee.  We will hear the Minister's opening remarks before having a question and answer session with members of the committee.</p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or body outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I call on the Minister to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Carmelo Abela" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019022000002#A00300"><p>I am grateful for the kind invitation the Chairman and members have extended to me to address this esteemed committee on the occasion of my visit to Ireland.  I wish to provide them with an updated r&eacute;sum&eacute; on bilateral relations between my country, Malta, and Ireland, as well as to discuss issues of common interest at bilateral and global levels, namely, migration, the Middle East peace process, the situation in Libya and Syria, as well as Brexit and the future of Europe.<br/><br/>I underline that Malta and Ireland have enjoyed strong bilateral relations since the establishment of diplomatic ties on 13 June 1990.  During the years these ties have been strengthened by means of several agreements in various fields such as air services and the avoidance of double taxation, through continued exchanges and high level meetings and within the framework of co-operation between our two foreign ministries.  I am also pleased to observe that in defence matters both countries enjoy excellent, long-standing co-operation, with regular contact.  Personnel of the armed forces of Malta receive regular training at Irish military institutions, while Malta co-operates with Ireland in humanitarian search and aid matters.  Thanks to co-operation with Ireland and the vessel <i>L&Eacute; Aoife</i>, now renamed P62, Malta's largest naval vessel, the Maltese armed forces have been better able to assist in the rescue of migrants who regularly encounter difficulties in Malta's search and rescue area.  Similarly, I am pleased to observe the ongoing postgraduate medical training being offered to Maltese health specialists, in collaboration with the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland.  This is a highly prestigious undertaking and Malta is very proud of this collaboration with Ireland.  I take the opportunity to inform the esteemed members of the two committees that Malta and Ireland look forward to further amplifying their mutual collaboration on a multilateral level, reflecting the excellent bilateral interface nurtured during the years.<br/><br/>I will speak about migration.  Malta wholeheartedly welcomes the efforts of the Irish Government in supporting other EU member states directly hit by large flows of irregular migrants and in relocating asylum seekers.  Frankly, we remain concerned about the lack of predictability that prevails before and after the process of disembarkation of migrants arriving by sea.  We are disappointed to register that the European Union has been unable to respond effectively to the irregular arrival of migrants along the central Mediterranean route.  Were it not for an <i>ad hoc </i>solidarity procedure agreed to every time by a coalition of willing EU member states to relocate migrants, member states in the region would have been left guessing at how the next case would pan out.  However, we could not continue with <i>ad hoc </i>arrangements all the time.  In view of the <i>status quo, </i>I am particularly grateful for Ireland's direct support in relocating migrants arriving in Malta on the <i>MV Lifeline </i>in June 2018 and, again, aboard the <i>Sea-Watch 3 </i>and the <i>Professor Albrecht Penck </i>in January this year.<br/><br/>The peace process in the Middle East has always been a subject close to the heart of Malta's foreign policy.  I reiterate Malta's long-standing position in favour of a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict and the readiness of my country to support any initiative that aims to breathe new life, in concrete and tangible terms, into the peace process, with the aim of advancing the prospects of peace through the revival of negotiations as soon as possible.  Malta also believes the status of Jerusalem as a capital city must be mutually agreed to through meaningful peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.  Any unilateral pronouncement to the contrary jeopardises the prospects for peace in the region.  In that regard, I underline the importance of effective multilateralism and the role of the United Nations and its agencies in addressing this conflict that has been ongoing for 70 years.  <br/><br/>Malta, together with the European Union and its member states, continues to support the excellent work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, and will strive to ensure sustainable, continued and effective assistance for Palestinian refugees at this difficult juncture.  We regret the United States' decision to cut financial aid to UNRWA and urge it to reconsider.  In that context, it is worth noting the efforts of both our countries to further support and sustain UNRWA in its endeavours.  Last year Malta tripled its share of overseas development aid, ODA, funding for UNRWA and this year a substantial contribution has already been made prior to my visit here.  I am also pleased to note that Ireland fares no less well.  With the Middle East peace process firmly consolidated as a priority of its foreign policy, I note with positive interest that Ireland has launched a new initiative, the Ireland-Palestine scholarship programme, about which I look forward to learning more.  I also firmly believe the European Union can play a significant role in the region.  The Council conclusions of July 2014 on the Middle East peace process remain valid today.  EU unity in this regard is crucial.  We need to maintain the long-established EU position, particularly on the four parameters.<br/><br/>The situation in Libya is another issue that is very dear to my country, given Malta's proximity and long-standing relations with Libya, including its commercial ties.</p><p>Malta continues to fully support the UN-led facilitation process based on the United Nations' recalibrated action plan for Libya.  The overarching baseline remains full commitment by the Libyans and the international community to the political process and the renunciation of the military track.  In a follow-up to the Paris summit in May 2018 Malta welcomes the conclusions adopted in Palermo to revitalise Libya's road map by all local and international stakeholders.  The need for a constitutional and legal framework before elections are held remains essential.  The support of the international community is imperative to ensure the necessary technical, legislative and security conditions will be in place prior to the holding of elections by spring 2019, if they are held by then.  The results will be acceptable to all if the rules of the game are agreed to prior to the holding of elections.  Within this framework, Malta will continue to provide its unwavering support in facilitating capacity-building measures in Libya and reiterates its support for the efforts of the United Nations, especially those of Special Representative Ghassan Salam&eacute;, to that end. </p><p> Another conflict is happening in Syria where the escalation of violence continues to be a source of grave concern.  There can be no military solution to this conflict.  We condemn, in the strongest terms, the use of chemical weapons which resulted in numerous casualties.  This is unacceptable and the international community has the responsibility to ensure the perpetrators will be held accountable in calling for zero impunity.  The Syrian conflict is causing heightened regional instability.  Malta urges all regional players to exercise restraint and pursue the path of political dialogue to re-establish peace and security in the region.  It also supports the UN-led reconciliation efforts via the Geneva process and the creation of a broadly representative constitutional committee in co-operation with the Astana guarantors which would be charged with drafting a new constitution and laying the ground for the holding of democratic elections to be supervised by the United Nations.  Malta looks forward to participating in the upcoming Brussels III conference on Syria and building on the work and outcome of the Brussels II Syria conference last year which asserted the importance of establishing a lasting, fully inclusive political settlement based on the Geneva communiqu&eacute; and full implementation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions.  For too long - nine years, to be precise - the Syrian people have toiled in the woes of the conflict.  It is high time that we regenerated the discussion and took stock of actions taken in the past to forge our present and future.  We owe them that much.</p><p> I will turn to Brexit which may be the subject of the day for quite some time.  Malta fully respects the democratic decision taken by the United Kingdom, although we still find it difficult to come to terms with the fact that it will soon depart the European Union.  Notwithstanding this decision, I reiterate Malta's stance that it will do its utmost to maintain a very close relationship with the United Kingdom.  We hope the transition, whether through a deal or without one, will be as smooth as possible.  I reiterate that the Maltese Government remains committed to the unity of the EU 27 and we reaffirm our support for Ireland on the Irish backstop. </p><p> I again thank the committee for the opportunity it has so kindly given me to inform it about some of Malta's bilateral relations with Ireland and share with it our perspective on a number of issues.  I look forward to hearing members' perspectives on the issues I have presented or on others and answering questions they may have.</p></speech>

I had the opportunity yesterday to thank Malta for its support of this country in its concerns about Brexit.  Mr. Abela has reiterated that the unity of the EU 27 is particularly important and articulated his understanding of the backstop and the necessity for it in the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>  I welcome the Irish ambassador to Malta, His Excellency Patrick Duffy.  I call on the Vice Chairman of the committee, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, to make some remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019022000002#B00300"><p>I welcome all of the delegates.  I see that Mr. Abela has had a very interesting political career and been continually re-elected.</p> <p>  There were concerns about the murder of the journalist Daphne Galizia.  I note that there was something happening in January and wonder if there is an update.</p> <p>  There are many concerns about the situation in the Mediterranean and Libya.  They include concerns about the Libyan coastguard which is not really engaged in a rescue operation as such but which is bringing those whom it takes from the sea to detention centres in Libya.  We know from a number of NGOs what conditions are like in the detention centres.  Does Mr. Abela also share these concerns?  There is a massive amount of money from the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa going into this activity and I have considerable concerns about the fate of some of the migrants.  Malta has accepted a number of migrants and I wonder how it deals with them.  I know that it has had close relations with Libya dating back to before Colonel Gaddafi and his reign.  Is it confident about the elections, considering that there are so many diverse groups in Libya and that the economy is in such a precarious position?</p> <p>  Malta has recently sent a trade delegation to Ghana.  Ireland is very proud of its development aid record.  Our aid is untied and poverty focused.  Mr. Abela might outline Malta's role in the provision of development aid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1221" speakername="Niall Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019022000002#B00400"><p>I welcome Mr. Abela to Ireland.  Following on from what my colleague said, I thank Malta for its support and solidarity in the ongoing debate on the Irish backstop.  </p> <p>  Will Mr. Abela give us an overview of Malta's position on taxation?  Malta has received criticism, rightly or wrongly, for being a tax haven.  We have also received some criticisms and undertaken measures along the way to improve the level of transparency.  </p> <p>  Mr. Abela made specific reference to the Middle East peace process, which interests the committee a lot.  We have controversial legislation before us on occupied territories, of which there are stand-out examples in the Middle East.  I am not sure if Mr. Abela is aware of that legislation or if there is any debate in Malta on goods and services originating from territories occupied illegally under international law.  What is the state of the discussion or debate in Malta on the absence of any viable Middle East peace process?  A promise has been held out that there is some form of initiative coming.  While nearly every country in the European Union is prepared to recognise the state of Palestine, not everybody is on board in finding a viable solution.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.39" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Carmelo Abela" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019022000002#C00200"><p>I hope that I have taken note of all of the questions asked but if not, I ask the Deputy to remind me.</p> <p>  A question was asked about developments in the investigation of the killing of Daphne Caruana Galizia in October 2017.  The Maltese Government has condemned that killing and has made it clear that it will leave no stone unturned in terms of solving that crime.  After a number of weeks the local investigators, with the help of international investigation organisations, managed to gather enough solid evidence to arrest a number of people.  Three people were arraigned and the investigation is ongoing.  Of course, the three suspects have been kept in prison and the hearing in the law courts is still going on.  This is the judicial process when it comes to the arrest of these three people.  The investigators believe that they have enough evidence to prove that these three people are the ones who committed the crime but the investigation is ongoing because the investigators need to establish whether they acted alone or whether others were involved in the ordering of Ms Galizia's killing.  The investigation into this aspect is ongoing.  An article was published recently which indicated that the police have a number of suspects in their sights but they want to have hard evidence before proceeding or announcing further developments.  </p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the conditions in Libyan migrant camps and I share her concerns in that regard.  The United Nations High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration, IOM, have the same concerns.  They are on the ground in Libya and we share their concerns.  The Libyan authorities, if I am not mistaken, say that the numbers of migrants kept in these closed camps are not excessive but regardless of the numbers, human decency must be respected.  These are not centres that respect human decency.  I share the thoughts of the Deputy on this issue and believe that we must help the Libyan authorities in this area.  The Libyans feel that their country is being used as a point of transit when it comes to migration.  It must be said that we have seen improvements in terms of the work of the Libyan coastguard.  As members will be aware, a number of EU member states participated in the training of the Libyan coastguard and we are now seeing the positive results of that in terms of the commitment of the Libyan coastguard to saving lives and handling situations at sea well.  It is not enough, however, and we need to do more in this area and to work together.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked if I have confidence in the Libyan elections.  I made reference to the process that needs to be undertaken in terms of agreeing the rules of the game.  That will help everyone to recognise the election results.  It is important that this is decided as soon as possible and that everyone agrees with the legislative framework.  I acknowledge the work of Mr. Ghassan Salam&eacute;, the UN Secretary General's special representative in Libya, who is trying to involve every actor and authority in Libya, to bring them together to at least agree on the way forward.  This is a very good sign because we need everyone to be on board.  This should be a Libyan led and owned process, first and foremost.  While the international community must support the process, primarily it should be Libyan led and owned.  </p> <p>  The next issue is Ghana.  When it comes to Africa, from our perspective the developments in Ghana are relatively recent.  We have relations with all north African countries which is understandable, given our geography.  However, we were absent in sub-Saharan Africa until some weeks ago when we opened an embassy or high commission in Ghana.  The Deputy referred to a trade mission or delegation.  That took place in July 2017 when her excellency, the Maltese President, Ms Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, visited Ghana.  I accompanied her on that state visit and we were positively surprised to learn that a number of Maltese businesses were interested in joining the President on that trip.  I was positively surprised because 21 companies, which is a considerable number, were interested in a destination with which we had no close contact or connectivity and in which a number of issues had to be overcome.  We are trying to look at Africa in a different way, especially the sub-Saharan region.  We would like to develop this further.  We can learn from and share the Irish experience in respect of the African continent, particularly in the area of overseas development assistance.  We may even be able to consider some joint projects and to work together in that area.</p> <p>  This brings me to the broader question of development aid or assistance.  In the context of our African partners, we need to speak more about trade rather than aid.  That does not mean that there is no scope for aid, especially in certain regions, but in essence we should talk about trade, which means investment and the creation of employment in these countries.  At present, we are looking at our development assistance programme to determine how we can improve it, particularly through the work of NGOs that are active on the ground.  Hopefully we will continue to improve on the process that we have started.  We are grateful for the support of the Irish Government in this regard.</p> <p>  Questions were asked about the issue of taxation and about statements that were made by some which suggest that Malta is a tax haven.  I fully reject such statements because that is simply not the case.  Let me remind everyone that before we joined the EU in 2004, like every other member state Malta had to go through a whole process with the Commission and the various European institutions.  Our taxation system did not change.  The regime of taxation that we have today is the same as that which prevailed before we joined the EU.  When some in certain European institutions say that Malta is a tax haven, which I refuse to accept, one must ask if they are alleging that the EU did not conduct its pre-membership scrutiny properly before we joined.  Taxation is a sovereign issue and we want that to remain the case.  When it comes to taxation, every member state should make its own decisions.</p><p>It is important to state that we have a similar attitude towards Europe when it comes to taxation.</p><p> Deputy Niall Collins mentioned the Middle East peace process and the fact that, for the time being, there is no process ongoing.  This is a concern I share with the Deputy.  That is why, in my opening remarks, I made reference to the current situation and to the hope that something will be going on soon and that discussions can possibly be engaged in again.  We need to prepare for that however.  Taking unilateral decisions will not help with the process.  That is why, like many other countries that are active in the United Nations, we were not happy to use the terminology used in the unilateral decision of the US to relocate its embassy to Jerusalem and to recognise it as the capital of Israel.  That will not help the process.  We also heard statements from the Palestinians that will not help the process to start.</p><p> The Deputy made reference to goods and services which originate in the occupied territories and asked whether we have a debate on this issue in my country.  At least at present, we do not have such a debate.  When it comes to the 1967 borders and all the rest we fully concur and agree that we need to find a solution to the issue of the settlements.  That is part and parcel of the discussion that needs to restart.  We hope that, especially if the US is coming with some proposals such as the famous "deal of the century" about which we have heard, there will be a balanced approach to all of these issues which will bring all to the table again.</p></speech>

On the last issue, I suppose he is looking on with interest to see what developments occur in respect of the Bill going through the Irish Parliament.  Many countries in Europe and around the world are looking to see how this debate shakes out.  I am not putting words in the Minister's mouth in that regard.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that he has mentioned his support in respect of the backstop regarding Ireland.  As he knows, we believe it is critical to the Irish situation that there be a fallback position.  We do not want to go back to a hard border.  We have had a hard border in the past and we had conflict.  We should be thankful that we have moved from that and that we have a peace process which, while it still has its flaws and challenges, has helped us to move on as a people and to develop better relationships with our neighbours.  Brexit is obviously one of the main issues facing the EU today.  I have visited Malta and am aware that it has a very large population of British expatriates.  What impact does Mr. Abela think that a hard Brexit would have on a country such as Malta?  What impacts are his Government looking at, particularly in respect of the impact of retired elderly people on Malta's health service post Brexit?</p> <p>  There was mention of the journalist, which probably ties into the hard border issue.  Mr. Abela used the expression "no stone unturned".  This has a different significance in Ireland.  Many atrocities were carried out here over many years.  A film made by families affected by the Loughinisland massacre was recently released in Ireland.  These people were watching a football match.  The Republic of Ireland was playing a game.  Some loyalist gangs came in and slaughtered people in the bar.  The British Secretary of State went on television afterwards.  Those who carried out these killings were loyalists but also British agents.  Unfortunately the expression used by the Secretary of State was that there would be no stone unturned.  Here was a British Secretary of State in Ireland who may not have been aware that his own security services were involved in the assassination of these people.  Many of those families still believe, to this day, that those who directed, controlled and armed those loyalist paramilitaries, some of whom were convicted of other offences, and those senior politicians who were complicit and who would have been aware of that strategy of killings, will never be brought to justice.  I am not drawing comparisons with what Mr. Abela said, but that expression stood out starkly.  Daphne Caruana Galizia's murder sent shockwaves around Europe.  Groups have been set up to investigate it and they have come out with very strong statements.  Ms Caruana Galizia's own family has spoken out publicly and said that they fear that those who ordered her death will never be brought to justice.  I am just making the comparison with families in Ireland who had a similar problem.</p> <p>  Mr. Abela mentioned migration and its impact.  It is one of those massive issues affecting countries right around the world but Malta's location means that it has a tremendous responsibility and a tremendous burden in this regard.  It is facing significant challenges every day.  One of the concerns expressed by many countries - particularly Italy but also Greece and other countries, probably including Malta - is the lack of solidarity from the rest of Europe with regard to this issue.  Does Mr. Abela have any view in this regard?  Ireland has offered its support in a very small way.  Many of us in this House believe that we could do more.  Ireland has been involved in the rescue of people and so on, as Mr. Abela has said.  Other countries, however, are talking about building barriers and stopping people who are fleeing conflict.</p> <p>  Mr. Abela mentioned some of the regions in which there is conflict in the Middle East.  People are fleeing wars and so on.  Many of these countries have no difficulties with selling weapons of war to those counties who have ended up in these conflict situations or with supporting these conflicts.  Is Mr. Abela concerned about the lack of solidarity?  Is he concerned about the direction in which Europe is going?  During the time of austerity we felt that Europe could have done more for Ireland, particularly with regard to the banking crisis.  Does he feel frustrated?  Does his country feel that Europe, and particularly those countries who are further away from where the refugees are landing, is not showing solidarity?  What more should we be doing in that regard?</p> <p>  Mr. Abela mentioned Libya.  To go back to that conversation, many of us look at Libya as a failed state.  One sees the images of slave markets and militias dividing up and running the country.  At the same time, we are supporting a coast guard that is stopping people leaving Libya and bringing them back to these slave markets.</p><p>That would be my concern about the direction in which we are heading in Europe.  I thank the witnesses for their support for the backstop and Brexit.  It is probably the big issue that is dominating discussion for the past two years, certainly in this House.  I hope there will be a soft Brexit, or perhaps no Brexit at all, which would be the ideal.  It will certainly have an impact on Ireland.  We are trying to work with our European partners but when Brexit happens we will look to countries such as Malta which understand the difficulties a small country such as Ireland will have.</p><p> Could the witnesses please comment on the lack of movement in the peace process in one of Malta's neighbours, Cyprus?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1402" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019022000002#E00200"><p>The Minister is very welcome, in particular as he is a Labour Party Minister.  I am a representative of his sister Labour Party in Ireland and we are also a member of the PES in Europe.  I thank him for his comments on the backstop and echo what colleagues have said about the most pressing nature of the backstop and the issues around Brexit as we count down the days until Britain is due to leave the EU.</p> <p>  I wish to focus on social developments in Malta.  Many parallels have been drawn between our jurisdiction and that of Malta.  We were very conscious when we passed the gender recognition legislation providing for transgender rights that Malta had very progressive legislation on transgender and intersex recognition.  We had a lot of references to the process and legislation in Malta.  We have also followed with interest the marriage equality debate.  Marriage equality was legalised in 2017, a little more recently than we did in 2015.</p> <p>  My specific question relates to abortion law.  Until last year Ireland and Malta were often linked as having the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe.  Now that we have at last legalised abortion in Ireland, following our referendum last year, I am conscious that Malta is now the only country in the EU with an outright prohibition on abortion.  Are any steps currently being taken to change the position in Malta, especially now that it is so exceptional within the EU?  I speak as somebody who campaigned for many years for change in the law here from a pro-choice perspective.  I know that many of us here are looking with interest at Malta.  We still campaign for a change in the law in Northern Ireland, which retains a very restrictive abortion law since the British legislation was never extended to Northern Ireland.  That is an anomaly in terms of Europe too.  I wonder if there are any moves afoot to change the law in Malta.  I am conscious that Ireland is now pushing for greater emphasis on sexual and reproductive rights funding at a development aid funding level.  This is an issue not just for domestic policy but it is also an issue that is feeding into development aid programmes and into the UN programme, for example, and into policy-making at international level too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1219" speakername="Se&aacute;n Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019022000002#E00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses to what I regard as an important event.  Given the fact that Britain has decided to leave the European Union, this country finds itself out on its own in the middle of the Atlantic, further away from mainland Europe and therefore that has a psychological effect.  It is important that we renew the friendships that we have with people within Europe and that we realise how important it is for us to be part of the European venture, as it were.  I very much welcome having the Maltese representatives here today.  That is important, especially as Malta is a smaller country like ourselves.  We live in a time when we could get lost.  We are a very proud member of the European Union, dating back many years, but I do not think the importance of the exit of Britain is realised in terms of the break-up of the European Union and how it will affect us physically.  Therefore, visits such as the one by Malta are very welcome to me personally.</p> <p>  It is time for Europe to have a look at itself and the mission of the European Union.  From time to time one tends to lose sight of why we have this Union.  Is it just about finance?  Is it about people?  Is it about the movement of people?  We must renew what we mean by being European.  I make no apology for supporting colleagues within the European Union, no matter where it is or what the event may be.  It is time that all of us had a look at why we are in the European Union and what it is about.  Is it solely about trade or is it about allowing us to be European in the real sense, so that we can travel, meet, share and learn?  Such things are vitally important.  We tend to look at all the problems around the world without looking at our own problems within.  I am in this Parliament since 1981 and I find that as countries we are becoming more and more selfish, as distinct from following a particular cause or route.  For that reason, visits like this are very important to me as they allow us to share ideas and support.  I stress the word "support" for each other.</p> <p>  Smaller countries in particular need to recognise that they are full members of the European Union and we must demand our rights within the European Union.  It is very important that Malta visits us and that we visit Malta, that this contact continues and we share our concerns.  Following the visit, there should be more parliamentary delegations from both countries meeting and sharing our concerns and views.  That seems to have fallen away because in this country it is regarded as a junket by the media if we decide to visit other member states for two or three days.  That said, one just has to ignore it because it is vitally important to build up the European project.  I do not underestimate the damage the European project is suffering as a result of the exit of Britain.  It is underestimated, although it is going to happen within four or five weeks.  We are going to be strangers, in effect.  This is something that is very big.</p><p>It is something all of us who are interested in the European project need to seriously start thinking about.  There is a need for us to meet each more often and share views, and we should make no apologies for helping each other.  For that reason, I certainly welcome the Minister's visit, as do all my colleagues as has been said.  I hope we can reciprocate by returning to his country and I had the pleasure of being in Malta previously.  There is nothing in particular I want to ask him other than to say how important it is that he is here.  He is very welcome and I hope this will be the beginning of ongoing relationships.</p></speech>

Regarding the backstop, as I said in my opening remarks we support the Irish position.  It is good the EU 27 remain united on this issue.  It is good for the European Union, at least for the EU 27, and it is important we remain united.</p> <p>  Yesterday, we had the opportunity to go to Cavan County Council next to the Border and it provided a different perspective to the declarations we usually make.  I agree with my colleague who said we need to meet, discuss and see the situation with our own eyes and look into the eyes of the people who will be affected because after all Brexit is not only a political issue, it will have an impact on the people.  In terms of meeting the people who might be affected by these kinds of decisions, it is important for us as policymakers, politicians, and as their representatives to understand the hardship they might have to experience.  The current situation is creating a great deal of uncertainty.  We do not know where we are going or what will be the impact of Brexit, which, as was said, will happen within four or five weeks.  It is like preparing for the unknown.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Carmelo Abela" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019022000002#F00400"><p>I can understand that because I have to go to my parliament too.  How can the business community prepare for something when they do not know what it will look like?  Yesterday's visit was very much an eyeopener and a confirmation of our declarations but it provided a more informed position such that when we give our support we know exactly what we are talking about.  We met the business community and the representatives and we can better understand this issue.  However, there is also the Good Friday Agreement.  The concern is not only regarding the commercial aspect, how matters might work out and what changes we might expect after Brexit, there is more to it.  The Irish people, especially those who live close to the Border, know better than anyone else what the situation was in the past.  No one wants to return to that and, therefore, we need to move forward on this.  We know the situation that exists today and we need to preserve that - given the discussions taking place in the House of Commons in London - as was agreed by the EU 27 in terms of the support we give to the Irish Government and the Irish people.</p> <p>  Reference was made to whether there will be a hard Brexit or what kind of the Brexit we will have.  It seems everything is possible as matters stand today.  We need to be more focused on how the situation will impact on the people.  For example, we have a number of people of Maltese descent who live in the United Kingdom and likewise there are citizens of the UK who live in Malta.  Political declarations have been made by both sides.  We want to make it easier to protect these people such that the impact of Brexit should not create difficulties for our respective citizens.  That is the type of attitude we would like to continue to adopt when considering the future relations between the EU and UK but also on a bilateral level between each an every member state and the United Kingdom.  We should definitely work hard to avoid creating hardships for people when it comes to education, health, work and residence.  We also discussed that process in cabinet in my country in order to facilitate people as much as possible in every possible scenario whether we have a deal or a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe raised the issue of the killing of Daphne Caruana Galizia's and he asked what does it mean to leave no stone unturned.  I will not comment on what happened.  I do not believe it is right to do so but I can comment on what that means for us.  For us, it meant that we already arrested three people.  They have been prosecuted and are going through the judicial system.  We also for the first time ever announced that for people who come forward with tangible information, there will be a &euro;1 million reward.  If people come forward with tangible information that leads to arrests - there have already been arrests -  and they have evidence that can lead to people being condemned for this, that is still valid.  Local investigators have been involved and they have full access, as should always be the case, and more resources have been put at their disposal.  There is co-operation still even today, as far as I am aware, with international investigators.  I mentioned the FBI and the Dutch forensic laboratory, and Europol was also involved.  This is what I meant by what is being done at present.  That is part one as I see it.  Part two is that the investigation is still ongoing.  As I said, we need to verify whether these people acted on their own or people were involved in the ordering of the killing.  Our hope is not only to bring to justice those three people who have been arrested.  The local investigators, with the help of others, are working to bring to justice also those, on the basis of evidence the investigators will have, who ordered the killing.  I can sympathise with the family.   I might not agree with what they say, with their allegations or with their behaviour at times, but I can sympathise with them.  I assure everyone that our government, with the respective authorities, would like to solve this case as soon as possible.  That is for sure.</p> <p>  When it comes to migration and lack of solidarity within the European Union, such migration flows have been happening for four years.  I recall in 2001 to 2002 when the migration flows began from north Africa to Europe that the number of migrants leaving at that time were fewer but over the years there have increased to hundreds of thousands.</p><p>This is a concern, and the EU has not agreed on how to deal with the situation internally.  When I was the Minister for Home Affairs and National Security, we discussed the relocation and resettlement programmes.  This was done primarily to help Italy and Greece, which were considered to be under a great deal of pressure at the time.  I am satisfied that we kept our promises.  We were the first member state to implement them over a two-year period.  We do not just talk about solidarity - we practise it as well.  We wish for others to do the same.  We are happy that Ireland is doing so and are thankful to it for the collaboration it has shown in various ways, for example, defence.  Our collaboration in terms of the <i>L&Eacute; Aoife </i>has allowed our armed forces to work in the Mediterranean saving lives and three or four <i>ad hoc</i>arrangements allowed for the relocation of a number of migrants.<br/><br/>The question on the direction Europe is going is a big one.  We are not debating the future of the EU.  Perhaps that is because of Brexit and our fears about one of the largest member states leaving.  As mentioned, we are rightly afraid about that.  Maybe we are not appreciative enough of how the EU will be after the UK leaves.  We also need to consider the future relationship between the two.  After the divorce, we need to start discussing a way forward.<br/><br/>Reference was made to austerity measures.  At times, they hit those who are most in need.  When austerity measures are in place, the first budget cuts are to pensions and social contributions.  These cuts affect people who need them most, putting them under pressure and pushing them into poverty or risk of poverty.  We need to reconsider whether austerity measures are the best way forward when dealing with difficult economic or financial situations.<br/><br/>It was suggested that perhaps Libya should be considered a failed state.  We need to work with the Libyans.  Libya becoming a normal state should be a Libyan-owned and Libyan-led effort.  We must appreciate that it is not a poor country.  Rather, it is a rich one when one remembers its oil production.  We are not discussing a country that is poor, but one with many possibilities.  The money is there.  Therefore, it should be easier economically.  My concern is from a security point of view, that is, whether there will be sufficient security to proceed with the elections this year.  Spring was mentioned, but it seems that we will miss that target.  Not only the legislative process needs to be in place, but also the requisite security.  To proceed with this process, there needs to be political will on the part of everyone involved in every region in Libya and it needs to be supported by the international community.<br/><br/>I was asked about the social developments in Malta, in particular gender rights, marriage, gay rights and so on, that we managed to achieve in a relatively short period.  Today, we view these as rights given to minorities, but they are citizens who deserve to be considered first-class citizens instead of being made to feel like second-class citizens.  The changes that we made were a credit to activists who worked on this for a long time.  I will also give credit to a Maltese Administration that implemented in a just way the rights that every person should enjoy.<br/><br/>A question was asked about abortion.  It is not allowed in Malta for any reason.  It is a criminal act according to our legislation.  There are no steps being taken to change that legislation and the current Administration has no electoral mandate to do so.  Mention was also made of sexual and reproductive health and rights, SRHR.  With the exception of abortion, we provide all kinds of service that fall under the terminology of SRHR, for example, IVF.<br/><br/>On renewing friendships, I will reiterate that committee members may consider Malta as a friendly nation to Ireland.<br/><br/>I was asked about the mission of the EU and why we had the Union.  We are nations of values, including solidarity, even when that solidarity is just interpreted by some as fitting their own purposes instead of the general well-being of each and every member state.  The EU is also a confirmation of our belief in multilateralism and in being far better off together rather than apart.  In today's world, we need to make this statement about multilateralism in terms of the internal and global challenges that Europe is facing.<br/><br/>Regarding the role of smaller countries, I agree with the comment on this being a union of states and that there should be no difference between a small and large member state.  It is a union of states irrespective of size.  Opinions and relevance should be respected.<br/><br/>Visits help us to understand the situations in other countries better.  They also give us the opportunity to work together more on a number of issues.  I had the pleasure of meeting the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, this morning where we explored the possibility of our countries working together bilaterally on a number of issues that we would like to consider further.  We are not only partners within a union.</p><p>We also need to work to enhance our collaboration from a bilateral aspect.  I agree on the parliamentary aspect mentioned.  I believe in parliamentary diplomacy, and I am all for friendship groups, for example.  Irrespective of the opportunities to talk with media and via different technologies, the human element should be included, and exchanging views and visiting our respective countries will help us work better together for our people.  It is important to stress the parliamentary aspect of this, and use parliamentary diplomacy.</p></speech>

I was glad to hear the Minister reiterate his country's strong support for the Irish position on the backstop.  He again emphasised the importance of the solidarity of the 27 EU member states and the support for Irish issues that have been raised.  The Minister spoke in a similar way when he visited the Border region yesterday.  I was struck by the comments he made, and also those of the Maltese ambassador, to the effect that we cannot view Brexit solely in the context of the effect on the economy or on political structures, but also must be very conscious of the effects it will have on people, particularly those living in the Border region.  There is nothing as good as a visit to the region to see the Border first-hand and to meet the communities there.  From speaking to some officials from local statutory agencies, the representatives of businesses and other local public representatives the Minister met yesterday, I know they were very glad to have the opportunity to have that exchange with him, and were reassured that he was there to reiterate support for and commitment to the Irish positions that have yet to be finalised in the context of the British withdrawal from the European Union.</p> <p>  Over the years Malta has had a strong friendship and relationship with Britain.  Despite our difficulties with Britain it was, in many respects, a very close ally in the European Union.  As Deputy Barrett said, we will both be losing a close ally and colleague in the European Council and the other institutions when Britain leaves.  I am also conscious that there are substantial Irish business interests in Malta which provide worthwhile employment and investment, which we are happy about.</p> <p>  I refer to the difficulties in north Africa back in 2011, and particularly the evacuation of Irish citizens from Libya.  Malta played a critical role in ensuring that our people were transported safely back to their homes.  I understand that the Irish Air Corps had some aircraft based in Malta at that time.  We appreciate the support provided for our people at that time, when they were facing particular difficulties.</p> <p>  As all members have said, we are delighted the Minister has had the opportunity to engage with us.  He has had a very demanding schedule since arriving here.  We wish him every success in the remainder of the talks and discussions he will have with our parliamentary colleagues and staff from the Department.  I thank the Minister and his delegation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019022000002#B00700"><p>I will speak to amendments Nos. 1, 8 to 15, inclusive, Nos. 18 to 20, inclusive, Nos. 22 to 24, inclusive and 26 to 28, inclusive together.  The substantive amendments are amendments Nos. 8 and 18 and are concerned with strengthening the roles and responsibilities of the board and CEO.  The other amendments are consequential amendments.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 8 gives new functions to the board.  First, the board must be satisfied that appropriate systems, procedures and practices  are in place to further the HSE's object.  This is critical as, under the Health Act 2004, the HSE's object is to use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p> <p>  Second, the board must ensure that appropriate systems, procedures and practices are in place for internal performance management and accountability.  These systems must cover how the HSE performs its functions under the Health Act 2004, how the HSE achieves its objectives in accordance with its corporate plan and how the HSE delivers health and personal social services in accordance with the Health Act 2004.  These will also cover how the executive enables compliance with Government or ministerial policies, whether set out in codes, guidelines or other documents. </p> <p>  Amendment No. 18 provides for the CEO's role.  The CEO must ensure that these appropriate systems, procedures and practices are in place.  The board's requirement to satisfy itself that appropriate systems are in place is therefore mirrored by the requirement on the CEO to ensure that the systems are put in place.  The intention under these amendments is in this way to situate roles and responsibilities appropriately.  In addition to the provisions I have outlined, amendment No. 8 will also place a responsibility on the board to ensure the establishment and implementation of appropriate arrangements to manage the CEO&rsquo;s  performance. </p> <p>  Amendments Nos.  9 to 15, inclusive, and Nos. 26 to 28 are technical amendments to the Bill arising out of amendments proposed to the functions of the board.  They amend section references.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 1 and  22 to 24, inclusive, are also consequential to the substantive amendments.  Where referring to Government or ministerial policies, the language in the amendments refers to policies whether set out in codes, guidelines or other documents.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 22 to 24, inclusive, are consequential amendments from the wording in amendments Nos. 8 and 18.  The aim of these amendments is to ensure consistency of language throughout the Health Act 2004 where reference is made to ministerial or Government policies.  </p></speech>

I am open to correction but that strikes me as something of a shift in responsibility.  It seems to shift a great deal of responsibility from the shoulders of the Minister and onto the CEO or director general.  I am concerned about that as it conflicts with Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare seeks to maintain or shift much more responsibility towards the Minister.  I am concerned about this and will oppose amendment No. 18 purely and simply because of that line.  The Minister of State should correct me if I have misread it.</p> <p>  Will she go into more detail to explain why amendments Nos. 22 to 24, inclusive, are necessary?  There seems to be some duplication.</p></speech>

Strategically from a policy perspective, the legislation will now require the CEO to put in place systems and procedures for internal performance management and accountability for the HSE.  </p> <p>  This is a new legislative requirement, which will ensure that the HSE puts in place not just the performance management framework that monitors the implementation and delivery of the corporate plan and services, but also sets out what accountability system it will put in place to ensure senior management answerability regarding the achievement of these plans.  </p> <p>  The aim of some of the amendments is to ensure consistency of language throughout the Health Act 2004 when referring to Government or ministerial policies.  Policies are polices whether set out in codes, guidelines or any other documents or combination of documents.  </p> <p>  The need for these technical changes arises in section 7 of the Health Act 2004 in respect of the object and functions of the HSE, section 29 of the Act in respect of the corporate plan, and section 31 of the Act in respect of the service plan.  </p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 22 and 24 are drafting amendments to the corporate plan and services.  They add text to the description of how the policy can be examined, for example, documents or codes.</p><p>I have nothing further to add on that.</p></speech>

The amendment refers to ensuring "appropriate systems, procedures and practices are in place" for the "internal performance management and accountability of the Executive".  This appears to shift some responsibility from the Minister, where it should lie, and place much more responsibility on staff who do not set ministerial objectives but are left holding the can if they are not achieved.  Much of this is resource dependent.  The amendment strikes me as unnecessary and runs counter to what we are trying to do with Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for facilitating discussion on these amendments.  Health systems across the world are faced with rising demands for health care, increasing inequalities in health and limited resources to address these needs.  If, as envisioned in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, we are to improve population health planning and deliver more effective and integrated care, we will need to premise the design and delivery of new models of care on best national and international evidence and make appropriate use of all of the available data sources which can inform service planning and provision.</p><p>A health needs assessment is a systematic method of identifying unmet health and healthcare needs of a population and identifying the changes required to meet those unmet needs.  The intention of the health needs assessment amendments is to provide for a more strategically targeted, beneficial and ambitious approach to such studies than is currently the case.  Their use will ensure that the health system becomes more responsive to the dynamic and changing nature of our population's healthcare needs and ensure, as proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, that addressing the social determinants of health becomes a guiding principle in the design of our healthcare system.</p><p>The amendments provide for ministerial directions to be issued to the HSE which will require it to conduct evidence based scientific, statistical or other systematic analysis with a view to bringing about change beneficial to the health of the population.  The scope and timeframe for conducting any such assessment will be included as part of the direction.  Provision is also made for the development of guidelines which will inform how assessments are to be conducted and for supplementary directions to be issued in circumstances where the content of an assessment report may need to be improved prior to publication.  The findings of assessment reports will be published by the HSE on its website.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 2 is to include provision for the issuing of ministerial directions for the conduct of health needs assessments within the ambit of section 10 of the Health Act 2004, which covers ministerial directions more generally.</p><p>Amendment No. 4 provides for a new section to be included in the Bill, which inserts a new section 10AA in the Health Act 2004, addressing the details of how the ministerial directions relating to health needs assessments will operate in practice, the implementation of such directions and related matters.  Subsection (1) provides that a direction relating to health needs assessments that is issued by the Minister must include details as to the specific requirements to be taken into consideration by the HSE when conducting the assessments that are the subject of the direction.  Subsection (2) provides details as to the types of requirements that might be taken into consideration for inclusion in a direction.  Subsection (3) provides for consultation by the Minister with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and any other person, as appropriate, prior to issuing a direction.  Subsection (4) provides for the submission of a report on the findings of a health needs assessment by the HSE within such timeframe as the Minister may specify within the direction.  Subsection (5) provides for the approval of any such report within a period of one month after its receipt or for the issue of a supplementary direction to address any defects in the content of the report after it has been submitted.  Subsection (6) provides for publication of the report on the Internet.  Subsection (7) provides for the development of guidelines by the Minister with a view to facilitating the conduct of health needs assessments by the HSE.  Subsection (8) defines the term &quot;health needs assessment&quot; for the purposes of the new section.</p></speech>

If that is a correct understanding, then subsection (2) seems redundant.  It goes without saying that the Minister may include whatever he or she wishes to include.  If it is not advisory, should the word "may" be replaced by "shall"?  I would not support that change, but I do not understand the point of the subsection otherwise.  I would include consideration of issues around gender and equality of access, for example.</p></speech>

It is almost a by-the-way suggestion that these are some things which the Minister may consider.  Primary legislation is not the place for that.</p> <p>  The idea of an annual health needs assessment is welcome.  However, it is not currently carried out by the HSE and, therefore, it will require very significant new capabilities.  The HSE will need healthcare econometricians and a significant amount of new data that do not currently exist, are not collected very well or are not comparable between regions.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that when the Bill is passed, the HSE will be able to comply with it and will have the resources, personnel and training to do so?  When is it expected that the HSE will start crunching the numbers on this issue?</p></speech>

I took on the health brief this time last year.  I was shocked when I looked at the executive team of the HSE, and, as it had been for the previous few years, only recently had a clinical lead been added to the senior team, which is extraordinary for a healthcare system.  Just as worrying, there was no patient advocate at all at a senior or junior level.  If there is anything to be learned from what has gone on in healthcare over the past while, it is there must be strong patient representation and advocacy at the highest levels throughout the organisation.  There must also be senior clinical representation, as one of the major failings of our healthcare system is that there are not enough clinical leads or clinicians' voices for doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals across the board.  They are rendered largely silent.  It is interesting that at joint committee meetings there may be eight or nine people in front of us from the HSE and one might be a doctor.  We hear almost nothing from the level of senior management representing nurses and midwifery, allied health professionals and so forth.  That error is being replicated in this Bill putting the board back in place.</p> <p>  The amendment is important, as it would mandate that one of the board members would be a patient advocate.  This does not mean that as well as other duties in a job, that person would happen to do some patient advocacy on the side but rather that the person would be a patient advocate or the voice of the patient on the board.  I would like there to be two clinical experts on the board.  I considered having one from the specialist register as a consultant and another representing nurses and midwifery but that is probably too specific for the legislation.  I have provided for two clinical experts in order that the clinical community would be represented and not just doctors.  Doctors need to be represented but there is a useful opportunity here, for example, to appoint somebody who represents nurses and midwives to the board.  The final board position I would like inserted into the legislation relates to financial expertise for all the obvious reasons.  We need serious financial oversight.</p> <p>  I looked at the Minister's appointments to the board but I will not comment on individuals.  They are pretty mixed, however, and I took a look at the background and expertise of everybody that will be on the board.  Some of the people have relevant expertise for the board of the HSE but some, to be frank, do not and I have no idea what they would be doing on the board.  It is not a well-balanced board and it does not have the requisite financial expertise or clinical representation, including that of doctors, nurses and midwives.  It does not have sufficient provision for patient advocacy, as one of the board members would have patient advocacy as one of a long list of responsibilities.  The person in question is not there solely to represent the voice of patients and the advocacy is just one descriptor in a long list.</p> <p>  We need to mandate the membership.  We cannot leave it to the Government, because we have done so and we can see the board that will be put in place.  I am sure they are all fine people and they will do their best on behalf of the HSE but it is not a balanced board.  Regarding some of the appointments, one would have to wonder what was driving their placement on the board other than politics.  Some nominees are extraordinary.  It is important to mandate clinical representation, financial expertise and, critically, patient advocacy on the board.  I would be very much obliged if the Minister of State accepted the amendment.</p></speech>

The amendment would require the eight ordinary members to include a patient advocate, a financial expert and two clinical experts.  I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s thinking on this amendment but the view of the Minister is that the best approach is as set out in the Bill as it stands.  Members appointed by the Minister to the HSE board must be people who, in his or her opinion, have sufficient experience and expertise relating to matters connected with the HSE's functions to enable them to make a substantial contribution to the effective and efficient performance of those functions.  The Bill provides for patient advocacy experience or expertise on the board.  This meets the recommendation made by Dr. Gabriel Scally in his scoping review.</p> <p>  In line with the 2014 guidelines on appointments to State boards, vacancies on the board are advertised through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  The particular requirements required for membership of the board are set out in the PAS campaign.</p><p>The recent campaign for membership of the board sought candidates with experience and expertise in a number of areas including corporate governance, clinical governance, quality assurance and patient safety, strategic planning and change management or business management skills, financial planning and management, patient advocacy, strategic human resource management and public communications. </p><p> A key role of the chair of a State board is to identify the needs of the board for new skills, competencies or experience to ensure that it can effectively perform its role.  It is desirable that board members have a mix of competencies rather than specific competencies.</p><p>The amendment proposed is, therefore, to the Minister's mind, not required as there is a process to ensure the required skill set and competencies for the board of the HSE.</p></speech>

The board does not currently have the correct skill mix.  Members have been appointed to the board who have zero experience in healthcare.  It is beyond me what they are doing on that board.  There is no mandated position for a patient advocate.  One member has patient advocacy listed as one of his or her responsibilities.  There is a bunch of scientists.  One scientist, or perhaps two is fine but the clinical expertise is not there.</p> <p>  The board has been appointed.  We know what will happen without this clause because a board has been appointed.  Which member or members of the board represent the clinical community, that is, doctors, consultants, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals?</p></speech>

Amendment No. 6 provides for a nomination from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, which is a broad representative group, while the HSE is the largest employer of the State.  It will be no surprise that I propose this given my background.  Deputy Donnelly's amendment and mine, taken together, are not intended to comment on the board - I do not want to put words in anyone's mouth - but the intention is to ensure the board is the best it can be.  With the greatest respect to the Minister of State, we believe that the more guidance that is inserted in the legislation to assist the Minister, the better the board will be.  The board has an important function and Sinn F&eacute;in sees a clear role for a representative of workers generally, but specifically from within the HSE.  We were clear to ensure that the amendment provides for that person to have sufficient experience and expertise relating to matters connected with the function of the executive to enable him or her to make a substantial contribution.  It is not somebody who would be there keeping a seat warm, but who, in the Minister's view, by virtue of his or her nomination by ICTU would make a substantial contribution to the board.  We do not seek to point fingers at anyone who might be on the board but to ensure that the Minister, and his successors, have sufficient guidance to ensure that the board is representative.  I will support Deputy Donnelly's amendment for that reason but I also believe that the ICTU, as a broad and representative body, has, and should have, a role in ensuring that workers are represented on the board of the HSE, which is the largest employer in the State.  Too often in this State we have seen the consequence of ignoring workers when they try to bring issues of concern to the fore.</p></speech>

The Minister appreciates that the amendment states that the nominee should have sufficient experience and expertise to allow him or her to make a substantial contribution to the performance of the HSE's functions.  However, in establishing the board, we need to move away from the concept of nominations by a stakeholder group, however well suited to the role the nominee may be.  In the case of the HSE board, the Minister's view is that nominees by individual organisations would not be good practice and would lead to calls from other bodies to make nominees.  I do not, therefore, intend to accept either amendment.</p></speech>

My views on the composition of the board have been on the record for a long time.  This is not criticism of the Minister or any members of the board or my colleagues.  However, I strongly believe that for a board to work, its composition should be drawn from the country at large.</p><p>Individually, they should have the required capacity and direct experience in the delivery of the services at local level.  The problem the HSE has faced for as long as it has been in existence is its inability to connect with the troops on the ground and to connect them to management.  Individual service providers would tell one that.  They feel isolated.  General practitioners, nurses and consultants would say the same.</p><p> Clinicians, as a group, should not have all that much influence.  We need to examine where they are coming from as opposed to who they are and how much influence they exert at board level.  The approach could well be very dangerous.  During my previous incarnation, there used to be long battles between members of the health boards and the consultants, for example, at one level or another.  The question was who dominated whom.  There should be no domination.  There has to be an agreed push forward in the delivery of the health services.  As long as there is friction and competition between the two demands, there will always be unease, controversy and gaps in the system that cannot be bridged.</p><p> It was alleged by clinicians that politicians should be removed completely from anything to do with the delivery of the health services.  That was achieved but it did not create a better system.  As a matter of fact, the reverse is the case.  By the same token, I have long believed we need a regionalised system and a national board &mdash; this board we are talking about now &mdash; drawn from the three or four regions.  Everything else has been tried but this has not.</p><p> My belief, based on what I have seen over more than a few years looking at the attempt to deliver a comprehensive health service that enjoys the confidence of the general public and practitioners within the system, be they doctors, consultants, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists or others, is that we have gone away completely from what is desired and tend to rely on expertise.  This is not a criticism of the amendment before us.  There is a need for expertise and provision has to be made for it but we are missing the crucial point, which concerns the representational value of the individuals on the board, where they are coming from and who they represent.  General practitioners on such a board have to represent their clients, and they should.  They have first-hand experience of this.  If this is not the case, there is second-hand experience.  We see headlines all the time about diminishing numbers of personnel in various areas, including rural areas.  The general practitioners have direct knowledge and experience of delivering to their clients.  My hope and belief is that, within five to seven years, there will be a change.  There will need to be a return to the old system.  I do not believe the system we have now will work, and I do not believe the revised system will work either.  This is my view but it is not a criticism of anybody.  We need a wholly committed health service.  That commitment requires the inclusion of those who are delivering the services on the ground at board level in one form or another.</p></speech>

Surely board members should be the most qualified people.  The decision should not be based on who they are or their background.  It is important that there be appropriate expertise on any board.  Obviously, we are talking about a specific board here.</p></speech>

Let me refer to one of the documents I have been given by the Minister's office.  Potential board appointees come through the Public Appointments Service process.  The competencies sought in respect of board appointments are advertised, which allows candidates to be put forward for appointment based on the skills and experience they bring.  The Minister does not intend to accept these amendments.</p> <p>  I know one board member.  I do not know him personally but through an organisation, Barnardos, with which he worked.  I am not sure whether I can comment on the individual expertise of the board members.  Although they do not represent one particular group, they have expertise in other fields as well.  I am not in a position to accept amendments from either Deputy.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the Minister of State has been asked to step in at the last minute and perhaps did not know she was coming in today, so my remarks are no reflection on her.  She has been asked to come in by the Minister.  However, I believe that, in a discussion on legislation to reinstate the board of the HSE, it is pretty extraordinary that the Minister did not turn up.  This is an important conversation.  The Minister of State does not have the briefing and even if she did she would not be in a position to make any decisions because she is not the line Minister and not a member of Cabinet.  It is extraordinary that the Minister is not here to debate the issues about the reinstatement of the HSE board.  Deputies O'Reilly, Durkan and Murphy O'Mahony and I were talking about whether anyone on the board of the HSE should have a medical background.  That is a pretty important conversation to have.</p> <p>  I have considered the board membership and am open to being wrong but my understanding is that not one member has a medical background.  If that is correct, it is pretty extraordinary.  The Minister should be present to explain why, in his opinion, he is comfortable that no one on the new board of the HSE has a medical background.  That is pretty astonishing.</p> <p>  We have rehearsed all the arguments.  I will be pressing this amendment because I have heard nothing that gives me any confidence that, without these amendments, the HSE will have the requisite experience it needs.  How any Government could try to tell the Parliament that the board of its health system has the correct blend of skills and experience when not one of its members has a medical background is absolutely extraordinary, yet that is what we are hearing today.  I will leave it at that.  I will be pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

As the guy said to someone looking for directions, "If I were going there, I would not start from here."  By the same token, I am just a little worried about one of the points made by Deputy Donnelly.  One member of the board could have a medical background but it could be tilted in the direction of one particular profession, which might not necessarily be of any great advantage to the board at all.</p><p>It could skew the authority of the board in a particular direction.  I would be worried about that.  It would not be truly representative, which would not be good.  One might be as well off to have persons who do not have a particular bias.</p><p> My own strongly held view is that members of the board should represent those who are delivering the services on the ground directly.  That would not necessarily enlarge the board to any great extent.  I spoke about this during the Sl&aacute;intecare hearings and on many occasions.  Nobody agrees with me, the Chairman will be glad to know, and not for the first time.  My view is based on long experience of listening to various boards associated with the health services over the years.  We can never achieve a seamless delivery of health services unless we have such mixed representation from all of the staff - the nurses, the GPs, the consultants and pharmacists - who are involved in delivering the health services.  It achieves the following aim.  It creates an equilibrium within the deliverers of the service that one cannot get otherwise.  Otherwise, one has a "them and us" situation where staff resent what they are being asked to do on the basis that those who are asking them do not have the necessary experience.  It often happens that way.</p><p> I reiterate that my views are not the same as my colleague, Deputy Donnelly, but I hear what he is saying.  If we were delivering a service to some executive, that would be a different story.  We are not; we are delivering a service to the people.  The people's practitioners on the ground need to have some access to that board, be represented on that board or have a representative on the ground from the board to keep the dialogue going in both directions.  I have said it all before.  I do not expect anybody to agree with me and I will not cry all the way home if nobody agrees with me.</p></speech>

The Minister is.</p> <p>  It is important that we put on the record our views, that we push our amendments and that that process takes place but to a certain extent, it does not matter how persuasive our arguments are if they will not be accepted.  These amendments will be pressed or withdrawn and re-tabled, and we will have this discussion again.  It is an important discussion to have but it seems somewhat futile that we could make a very persuasive argument and, ultimately, our amendments will not be accepted.

We could debate all day how every one of us wants the right people to end up on the board.  We are all as one on that, albeit we may have different views about how the right person will end up on the board.</p><p>Recently, we saw the appointment and reappointment of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  We have had many discussions on that and what constitutes a competency-based board.  When an issue arises with the board and with the HSE, we tend to have to raise that with the Minister, but there is a role for the Oireachtas in hearing from persons who are proposed by the Minister so that Deputies can discuss the approach they would take in their role and help us understand how they intend to approach their role on the board.  We would like to have some involvement in that engagement.  One might say that I would say this, but this is a sensible proposal.  In the interests of transparency I hope that the Minister of State, notwithstanding what was previously indicated, is in a position to accept the amendment.  If she is not able to accept it, perhaps she might recommend that the Minister give it consideration.</p></speech>

There is no requirement in the code of practice for other members to appear.  The amendment proposed places this requirement in legislation on the chairperson and on the other members of the board - the deputy chairperson and ordinary members.  The Minister's view is that it is part of the role of the chair to lead the board and it would not be advisable to bestow the same function on all members.  In addition, the Minister does not believe that matters of this nature need to be provided for in the Bill.  The system for proposed chairpersons to come before committees works well in practice and these provisions are not normally in legislation.  The Minister does not therefore propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

Recent events have proven such engagement could have some value.  Sin &eacute;.  We have already discussed the fact that the Minister of State is not in a position to accept any amendments so I could make the most persuasive argument of my life and it is not going to be accepted by her.  I do not suggest I was about to do that.  I might have been but it does not make any difference because the amendment is not going to be accepted by the Minister of State.  I do not mean this disrespectfully, but it is a pity that the person who could accept the amendments did not see fit to attend this meeting.  While the apologies are accepted, it is a pity because the amendments that have been put forward are very constructive and have the aim of ensuring that the Bill is improved and that it is as good as it can be.

The board does not have a role.  However, given that the CEO is appointed by the board and the board will be managing the CEO's performance, the Minister has given this further consideration and proposes that the board should determine terms and conditions for the CEO.  The board will need the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is the process in many other Acts.</p></speech>

I want to see whether the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is still included.

Does it mean the prior approval of the Minister?</p><p>Does it mean the prior approval of two Ministers?  Is it Minister or Ministers?  It could be worded as "given the approval of the Minister" but "the approval of the Minister given" is something I have never seen before.  I do not know why it has been drafted in that fashion or in parliamentary draftsman's language.  Perhaps my education has been greatly neglected along the way.  I just want to know if it means something of which we are not aware.  The phrase is used twice and I do not know what it means.  If necessary, will the Minister of State examine the wording and clarify it on Report Stage?  That would be fine.</p></speech>

It seeks to ensure that the chief executive officer of the HSE should not hold any additional office.  We saw that the previous director general had a role in another company.  Running the HSE is a big job and it should take up all of the time of the post holder.  We should be absolutely sure there is no scope for any conflict of interest or any suggestion of a conflict of interest.  It is not appropriate for the CEO to have another job or to sit on boards.  His or her focus should solely and entirely be on running the HSE.  There should be no division.  This amendment proposes to leave the wording, &quot;The chief executive officer shall not hold any other office employment or carry on any business&quot;, and delete the subsequent words, &quot;without the consent of the Board and the Board shall inform the Minister in writing of any such consent given.&quot;  The previous holder of the position informed the Minister he had an additional role outside the HSE.  I am not suggesting there was anything untoward about that but it is not a good idea.  This latitude was available and given previously.  We need to remove it and ensure the person in charge of the HSE is focused solely and entirely on that job.</p></speech>

The Minister must be informed of any such decision by the board.  The proposed amendment would prevent the CEO from holding any other office, under any circumstances.  This issue arose during debate in the Seanad and the Minister&rsquo;s view was that it was not possible to foresee all circumstances and that there may be situations where holding other offices may be justified.  The legislation as it stands allows for this, while giving the safeguard that the board&rsquo;s consent is needed.  The board will be the decision maker.  If it believes it is not appropriate, the CEO cannot undertake the work in question.  It is not, therefore, proposed to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

I cannot think of any such roles.  I appreciate the Minister of State's response and note the debate in the Seanad in which the Minister said it is not possible to envisage all circumstances and such a scenario might arise.  The person in charge of the HSE should be focused solely on that role and I cannot think of any scenario where that person's membership of another board or employment by another company would be appropriate or beneficial to the running of the HSE.  The Minister may have had in mind a specific scenario that could be beneficial or at least have a neutral effect on or cause no harm to the role of the CEO in running the HSE.  I cannot envisage such a circumstance.  The CEO of the HSE is a big job and incredibly time consuming.  I do not know where he or she would find time for other roles.  It would not be appropriate for him or her to have to find the time to carry on other work or business.</p></speech>

The issue is that it not possible to predict all situations and there may be a valid reason for the CEO to hold some other office.

The paragraph relates to the chief executive coming before the Oireachtas, so mainly to this committee, I imagine, and probably the Committee of Public Accounts.  There is a get-out clause, which says that the chief executive officer &quot;shall not be required to give an account before a Committee of any matter relating to the general administration of the Executive which is, or has been, or may at any future time be, the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal in the State&rdquo;.  That provision pretty much gives <i>carte blanche</i>for the chief executive officer to just never appear.  Deputy O'Reilly's amendment is spot on and does not try to delete the paragraph.</p><p>One cannot have a situation where the head of the health service says, &quot;I am not coming in because at some point in the future somebody may take a case over&quot; whatever.  Almost everything that this committee has discussed in the past year could lead to legal cases in the future.  The amendment is very good and I am inclined to support it.  Perhaps the Minister of State has a solid legal reason the provision must be included.  In the absence of a solid argument by the Minister of State, I do not see why one would give that sort of <i>carte blanche</i>to any executive officer.</p></speech>

It gives the chief executive officer of the health system the ability not to appear before any Oireachtas committee to discuss any issue which may at some stage be before the courts.  That rules out pretty much everything in the healthcare system.  I can understand the committee not bringing in a chief executive to discuss a matter before the courts which I think is covered by Standing Order 50 which is specifically about court sittings in which there is a jury and where it might be influenced by a conversation in the Oireachtas.  It is not that the Oireachtas cannot discuss matters that are before the courts; we can and do all the time.  The matter of CervicalCheck is before the courts, but we still discuss it here.  This is an extraordinary level of protection for the chief executive because any matter this committee, or the Committee of Public Accounts, may decide to address can be deemed to be before the courts.  I still do not have an answer to the question as to why such an extraordinary level of protection is being granted.  The Minister of State said it was to protect future court cases, but I do not understand how discussing things here would jeopardise them.  If that rule was applied, it would shut down Parliament.  Maybe the Minister of State might expand on the matter.</p></speech>

The question I am asking is about paragraph (2) and concerns why the Government is choosing to give such extraordinary protection from parliamentary accountability to the chief executive officer of the HSE.  The Minister of State said it would, in some way, jeopardise future court cases.  Will she explain how this committee discussing issues with the chief executive officer would jeopardise future court cases?</p></speech>

The question is a direct one.  Extraordinary protection against parliamentary accountability is being afforded in the paragraph to the chief executive officer of the HSE.  The rationale the Minister of State has given is that it is to avoid jeopardising future court cases.  I do not understand how discussion at this committee will jeopardise future court cases and I am worried that, if we accept that logic, we will have to ask if we are allowed to discuss anything at this committee.</p></speech>

Effectively, we will be neutered and precluded.  Like Deputy Donnelly, I cannot understand how this will work in practice because all the chief executive officer or the director general will have to do, if asked to come before the committee, is respond to the effect that the matter could be the subject of a court case.  He or she would be right in saying so, as anything could be the subject of a court case.  This will give the person in charge a veto.</p> <p>  I have withdrawn my amendment on the basis that I will retable it, but in the intervening time it would be helpful to have a note on this issue.  We say the Minister of State is giving the director general a veto in deciding if he or she should ever come before the committee, but she is saying she is not doing so.  The reasons this provision does, effectively, amount to a veto were very well outlined, but the Minister of State insists that she is not giving one.  Perhaps she might ask the Minister to outline for us, in some detail, why he believes this will not operate in such a way.  The Minister of State says she will not accept amendments.  While I will do my very best to accept her explanation, she should not be surprised if I do not accept it.  I ask for a note to be provided well in advance of Report Stage with an explanation of how this provision will not act as a veto.  To my mind, it clearly will.</p></speech>

I am not condoning speeding, but it would be good if the Minister of State could give us a note on what is included as an indictable offence.  Paragraph (4) states such a person shall cease to be qualified for office.  This is black and white.  It is not that an issue could be raised by the board and considered in the round.  Once it happens, the chief executive officer will be gone.</p> <p>  At the start of the section 21A, it states the board shall, as soon as practicable, appoint a person recruited in accordance with the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 as CEO.</p><p>Will the Minister of State run through what that means in practice?  Does it mean that the PAS, the top level appointments committee, TLAC, or some other group will come up with a shortlist and the board will choose?

This section makes amendments to section 40H to take account of the move to a board governance structure, for example, providing that the audit committee is appointed by the board rather than by the director.  The Bill currently provides that audit committee membership is to comprise the board members and no fewer than four external members.  However, the Minister has considered this further and believes that some amendments should be made.</p><p>As the HSE is now to have an independent board, it is important in terms of good corporate governance that board members are now further represented on an audit committee as part of the audit planning and insurance process.</p><p> Amendment No. 25 therefore changes the composition of the audit committee.  The amendment provides that not fewer than three members of the new HSE board will be on the audit committee.  The audit committee will continue to have not fewer than four external members.  In summary, this will mean that the audit committee will consist of not fewer than three board members and not fewer than four external members, with the relevant skills and experience.</p></speech>

Perhaps I am misunderstanding the amendment, but the essential function of the audit committee is to be independent and external auditors.  Maybe I am wrong, but if that is the case, does it give the board too much say on a body that might be looking at the activities of the board?  Maybe I misunderstand the role of the audit committee, but that is my concern.</p></speech>

This seems peculiar.  One of the core functions of the audit committee is to provide financial advice to the board, including on activities of the board.  If three of the seven members of the audit committee are drawn from the board, is there not a conflict of interest or at least a lack of independent oversight given that it would only require one of the other four members to side with the board members on an issue?  It does not feel sufficiently independent and removed.  Is the Minister of State saying that the audit committees of other State bodies, for example, the National Transport Authority, would also have three members drawn from the board of the body in question?  Is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guideline?</p></speech>

If half the members of the audit committee are on the board of the HSE, the board is advising itself.  The Bill provides that the board may at any time remove a member of the audit committee.  Perhaps I have got this wrong.  Maybe the audit committee is not meant to provide independent advice or feedback to the board, but if it is meant to do so, it seems the board will be providing advice and feedback to itself.</p></speech>

It is important to note that the three board members from the HSE board on the audit committee will help feed back to the HSE board what is happening on the audit committee.  I am confused as to why the Deputy would have a problem with three of the members from the main board sitting on the audit committee because there will not be an imbalance, if that is the point he is trying to make.  My understanding is that four external members and maybe more as well as an independent chairman would outnumber any members who are also on the HSE board.  I am not sure why the Deputy is pursuing this avenue around the board members.  The amendments provide that not fewer than three members of the HSE board will be on the committee.  It could be less.  If there could be more external people on the board, I do not understand the Deputy's point.</p></speech>

The board members are there, but it is a sub-committee of the board which can bring on additional expertise.  Let us say it wants to avail of the services of actuaries or corporate lawyers, that is okay.  We already have a board and the board is talking to the chief executive all the time.  Essentially, the board's job is to hold the chief executive to account and to set the strategy for an organisation.  Those are two of the big issues.  Separate to that, one has an audit committee, which is giving financial advice on the functions of the board.  It is giving governance advice on the structures and it is giving financial advice to the chief executive.  If the objective is for that to be essentially independent of the board, and providing a second pair of eyes, if it is full of board members then that does not happen.  It is essentially the board reporting to itself about its own functions.</p></speech>

I am aware that Deputy Barry, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, and a number of other Opposition Deputies have introduced Bills relating to this area, largely because so many individuals and families are insecure and in fear of becoming homeless because of insecurity in the private rented sector.  My Bill covers a wide range of measures that are urgent and necessary to provide transparency, security from eviction and protection from unfair rents and unfair deposits.</p> <p>  In my written submission to the committee, I provided some background, which is important in the context of arguments which are often made about certain measures being unconstitutional because of the balance in the Constitution between property rights and the public interest.  I refer to the 2004 report of the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution, which concluded that the power of the Oireachtas to impose restrictions on property rights in the public interest was constitutionally well-established.  I was a member of the committee, which heard much eminent legal advice from constitutional lawyers and examined a number of precedents and cases.  The report recommended that the Kenny report could be implemented and, generally, that the Constitution should not be used as a shelter or excuse for inaction on the rights of the public versus the rights of private property.  I also refer to a document that the Oireachtas Library and Research Service provided, entitled Private Rental Sector: an International Comparative Study, which examines the impact of the European Convention on Human Rights, its various provisions, and how decisions on these issues need to be in harmony with European Court judgments.</p><p>Recent decisions of the European Court of Human Rights affirm that interference with property rights is authorised if it is in accordance with the law, is necessary in a democratic society and is proportionate to the aim sought.<br/><br/>The document also goes on to outline the regulations of the private rented sector in various countries across Europe.  That is very useful because there is a great deal more security for tenants in most of our European neighbouring states.  For example, in Germany the private rental sector comprises 41% of the housing stock and renting is considered a secure and long-term option.  Germany has strong contract protection and rent control.  There is a database of all the rents in the local area, tracking all rents agreed in the preceding four years.  Landlords determine a rent for their property by referencing - the referenced rent concept - dwellings of comparable size, quality and location.  Rent may not exceed the reference rent in the locality by more than 10%.<br/><br/>Interestingly, and I am aware the landlords' representatives will be here later, it points out that the law benefits landlords as well as tenants.  There is an argument for rights for landlords as well and recognising the costs to them.  In Germany there are depreciation allowances, mortgage interest tax relief, deduction of maintenance costs and the possibility to deduct losses from the income tax base.  There is, therefore, a balance in other European countries.  The proposals in our Bill are far from being abnormal from an international comparative perspective.<br/><br/>I will briefly go through the provisions of the Bill.  Some of them overlap with Deputy Barry's Bill and others.  In section 1 we seek to commence the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Acts that have not been commenced, particularly with regard to a deposit protection scheme.  That would come into operation within six months.  That has been provided for already but has not been enacted.  Second, our Bill introduces a new definition of &quot;landlord&quot;.  That would deal with the issue of receivers, something that has been raised by many people here.  Threshold and other bodies have said that the extent, if any, to which a receiver is bound by the tenancy agreement is uncertain and that tenants' rights in respect of adequate notice, upkeep of the property, deposit return and so forth may be ignored.  We want the definition of a landlord to include a receiver.  Third, we provide for a definition of &quot;deposit&quot;.  We say the deposit must not in any case exceed one month's rent under the tenancy.  We have heard reports of people asking for two and three months' rent, basically to deter people who cannot afford to have that amount of money up front.<br/><br/>Sections 5 and 6 deal with rent control.  Again, other parties have made the same proposal, that increases which are currently limited to 4% in rent pressure zones should be linked to the annual rate of inflation as measured by the all items consumer price index published by the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  We also propose that for a three-year period, the entire country should be designated as a rent pressure zone.  As I am from Limerick city, members will understand why I feel strongly about that issue.<br/><br/>The next set of measures deals with security of tenure.  Most of them are not original.  There is a consensus, which includes many parties and members, as to the need for most if not all of these proposals.  Some of them are included in Deputy Barry's Bill.<br/><br/>In section 7 we propose that the Part 4 tenancy effectively will become a tenancy of indefinite duration.  We also propose to delete paragraph 3 in the table to section 34, which permits a landlord to terminate a tenancy on the grounds of an intention to sell the property within three months.  We are saying that sale should not be a ground for giving a notice of termination of tenancy to a tenant.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, recommendation in this regard states: </p><blockquote>	One view is that this could reduce the price that those selling rental properties could achieve, compared to the price with vacant procession.  On the other hand, the more the Irish rental system is driven by long-term yield, rather than changing asset prices, the higher the value purchasers will put on properties with an existing, secure rental stream. </blockquote><p>Obviously, there is insecurity for the tenant.  We argue this would yield more long-term security for the landlord as well.<br/><br/>We also deal with refurbishment to renovate the property.  I note the Minister has a definition in that regard in his Bill.  However, our definition says that termination is permissible on this ground only if no reasonable measures can be taken to maintain the dwelling fit for human habitation during the refurbishment or renovation.  A person who has a private home generally does not move out of the house if he or she is doing significant renovations, so we do not believe tenants should have to move out either.<br/><br/>Finally in the area of security of tenure, we narrow the definition of the family member moving into the property.  Currently, it is very broad and includes a sister, nephew, niece, parent-in-law and so forth.  We shorten the list to include just a spouse or civil partner or a child, including a stepchild, foster child or adopted child, of the landlord.<br/><br/>Section 9 provides for a rent register.  It would be a dwelling specific rent register, which is argued for by Threshold.  However, it would protect the identity of the landlord and of the tenant.<br/><br/>That is an outline of what is in the Bill.  The Bill is comprehensive because tenants face a number of difficulties and insecurities.  I believe everybody here agrees that we need legislative reform and this is our contribution.  I am happy to answer any questions from members of the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1432" speakername="Mick Barry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019022000002#E00300"><p>Evidence from all the agencies funded by the Government to deal with homelessness shows that the vast majority of homelessness is caused by evictions from the private rented sector.  According to Focus Ireland, which is funded by the Government as the main agency dealing with family homelessness, 69% of homeless families reported that their last stable home was in the private rented sector.  Traditionally, the number of evictions into homelessness peaks in January.  If that has happened again this year, the official homelessness figures for the State will surge to in excess of 10,000 when the information for January is released next week.  It is insanity to continue to allow economic evictions to take place in the midst of the greatest housing and homelessness crisis in the history of the State.  This Bill aims to address that issue and try to stanch the flow.</p> <p>  The level of precarity in the private rented sector is illustrated by the fact that the majority of tenants have been renting their current home for less than two years.  By contrast, only 5% of mortgaged owner occupiers and only 11% of local authority tenants have been living in their current homes for less than three years.  This fast rate of turnover is persisting despite the fact that an increasing number of people are living permanently in the private rented sector.  An April 2018 survey of tenants by Threshold found that 70% have been renting for five years or longer.  In other words, families are repeatedly being uprooted and forced to move.  This insecurity of tenure is especially sharp for housing assistance payment, HAP, rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and rent supplement tenants who find it hardest to source private rented accommodation and are most likely to end up homeless as a result.  These tenants now make up between a quarter and a third of tenants in the private rented sector due to the collapse of council housing construction under Fine Gael and the privatisation of social housing.</p> <p>  The Bill targets four of the main reasons for evictions from the private rented sector and into homelessness.  Focus Ireland research shows that one third of homeless families became homeless after being evicted from the private rented sector for the reasons covered by the Bill.  The reasons are the private rented home being removed from the market due to the landlord selling, the landlord's property being repossessed or sold by a bank, the landlord moving back in, major renovations, or the landlord giving the property to a family member.</p><p>In other words, this Bill would help to keep one third of families currently being made homeless in their homes.  Likewise, if this Bill had been enacted in 2017, when its first iteration was moved, well over half of the families or individuals contacting Threshold, having been threatened with eviction, would have been protected.  The Bill would also cover the reasons cited in 40% of all eviction notices disputed with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  <br/><br/>Let us look at some of the proposals.  In the case of a landlord claiming that he or she wants to sell, this Bill would ban the sale of property as a reason for eviction.  The property can be sold with tenants <i>in situ, </i>as in other European countries, for example, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark.  According to Threshold's 2017 annual report published last year, sale of property was the common reason given in eviction notices, it having been used in 38% of the eviction notices dealt with by the Threshold.  Almost 2,000 families or households faced with eviction on grounds of sale of property would have been protected by the first iteration of this Bill if the Government had not voted it down in January 2017.  According to Focus Ireland, the biggest push factor into homeless remains families being evicted into homelessness from the private rental sector, where landlords are selling up and, further, that without structural changes to reduce this influx into homelessness it will be hard to make further progress in reducing total homelessness.  That speaks for itself.<br/><br/>The Bill gives tenants of buy-to-let properties in receivership the protections of the Residential Tenancies Act, RTA, by including banks and receivers in the definition of &quot;landlord&quot;, as called for by Threshold.  This would remedy the current situation whereby tenants essentially lose all their rights if their landlord defaults on a loan and the home is repossessed by a bank.  The latest Central Bank figures show 12,732 buy-to-let mortgages are in long-term arrears of over two years.  The majority are tenanted with the occupants at risk of eviction on grounds of sale and-or because of the lack of Residential Tenancies Act protection for tenants of buy-to-let properties in receivership.  This Bill would give tenants in this situation the same security of tenure as other tenants as well as the other RTA protections, for example, in regard to deposits and repairs.  <br/><br/>On the issue of a landlord claiming a relative is moving into a property, this Bill would oblige landlords to pay six months' rent in compensation to the tenant in the case of a break of a lease for this purpose.  The purpose of this is to prevent unscrupulous landlords from using the relative argument as an excuse to evict tenants in order to bring in new tenants on a higher rent.  <br/><br/>On the question of renovation, the Bill also removes renovation and refurbishment as grounds for eviction.  This is in addition to the original anti-eviction Bill of January 2017.  This is necessary now in light of the major increase in so-called renovictions.  Some 12% of Threshold eviction queries in 2017 related to refurbishment or renovation and 8% of eviction notices determined by the RTB in 2017 cited substantial refurbishment.  An outrageous 74% of such claims were found to be invalid.  In most cases, refurbishments can be done without any need for the tenant to move out and certainly without need to terminate a tenancy.  Tenants could move out to allow major refurbishment but this should only happen with the consent of the tenant.  Otherwise, the landlord should wait until the end of the tenancy to renovate.  In the event of health and safety or fire issues, this could be dealt with under the relevant legislation in those areas rather than the Residential Tenancies Act.<br/><br/>On the issue of landlords giving notice just before the expiry of the four to six year Part 4 tenancy, landlords can currently evict tenants for no reason at the end of a four or six year Part 4 tenancy.  This Bill makes Part 4 tenancies indefinite so that this recurring eviction period or danger zone for long term tenants would no longer exist.  <br/><br/>Other measures in the Bill include purpose-built student accommodation to be brought within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act.  This would ensure that tenancy protections of the Residential Tenancies Act, as amended by this Bill, including rent pressure zones, apply to the nearly 40,000 students living in student specific accommodation, whether private or publicly owned, for example, by the colleges.  According to a survey of students carried out by the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, in 2017, this would cover approximately one third of students.  I understand a representative of USI is here and will also make a presentation so I will not elaborate as I am sure she will do so.  <br/><br/>The Bill would reduce the timeframe for the coming into effect of Part 4 tenancy protections from six months to two.  Currently, landlords can evict tenants for no reason during the first six months of a tenancy.  Threshold's latest survey of tenants in April 2018 found that nearly half, 46%, of tenants have been living in their current home for one year or less.  This is a necessary change.  An additional reason for amending the law so that Part 4 tenancies kick in after two months is that we anticipate that if this Bill passes, landlords might try to circumvent the increased protections for tenants it contains by bringing in new tenants every six months.  This is a way of future-proofing the Bill.<br/><br/>The Bill extends the notice period to be provided by landlords when terminating a tenancy.  I do not propose to read all of the details into the record as the tables are laid out in the Bill.  <br/><br/>We believe there is a need for this legislation.  We are in the middle of the greatest housing and homelessness crisis in the history of this State.  The cause of the increase in homelessness is eviction from the private rental sector.  This Bill aims to stem that flow, in particular by tackling two of the main reasons cited on the notices to quit, namely, eviction on ground of sale of property and eviction on ground of renovation, or so-called reno-victions.  Let us ban this practice.  This is a sensible and practical proposal in the current climate.</p></speech>

I agree that we are in a significant housing crisis, the worst in the history of this State.  I acknowledge and appreciate fully the points that have been made but it is important to point out that a number of actions have been taken to protect tenants.  The HAP initiative has been very successful in ensuring tenants are able to pay their rent.  It allows people who would not otherwise be able to meet the increased rents that are being demanded to compete in the marketplace as equal players.  The powers of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, have been strengthened.  There are currently over 340,000 tenancies registered with the board.  It is proposed to increase the powers of the RTB to regulate the sector and to increase the rights of tenants, which is useful and helpful.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the rent pressure zones.  This initiative has been very successful in the areas in which it applies.  In Drogheda, it has been so successful the number of people complaining about increased rents has significantly reduced.  Local authorities and private construction companies are significantly increasing the number of houses being built.  The number of houses built during Deputy O'Sullivan's tenure as housing Minister was very low.  I acknowledge I was Minister of State of that Department during that term.  We know that the reason for that was the economic conditions.  As things have improved, housing construction has increased significantly.  It is important I make these points to balance the arguments that have been made.  </p> <p>  On the issue of evictions, is there data available on the number of evictions that have taken place and is an eviction a notice to quit?  Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on those points.  I hold no property other than the house in which I live and I am not a spokesperson for landlords.  In fact, I have in the past stood up to the abuse by landlords of tenants and I have helped many in that regard.   One way of dealing with this issue is to put in place a moratorium on evictions for a set timeframe.  In terms of all of the issues raised, there are arguments for and against them.  I do not believe there is any reason not to have a moratorium on evictions, be it for one or two years.</p><p>The point is that most people who are renting that I meet are waiting for a social house, council house or affordable home.  They do not want to stay in rented accommodation forever.  As the number of houses increases and as choices increase, rents will go down.  While it will not happen today or tomorrow, people will get the homes they want.  We should look at that as a moratorium, albeit I am not sure what legislation would be required.  It would avoid many of the other pitfalls that may be there if the D&aacute;il were to pass that legislation.</p><p> If someone is to suggest there be no evictions, it is important to impose three conditions.  It is important to say that the vast majority of tenants are good tenants and the vast majority of landlords are good landlords.  I would not tar them all with the same brush.  If a tenant is paying his or her rent and does not owe substantial arrears, is not involved in anti-social behaviour and if the occupied property is in reasonable condition, that tenant should have security of tenure for a period to be defined by the D&aacute;il during which he or she could not be evicted.  It might be two or three years or some such period.  The landlord who lets the property is having his or her rights respected.  The rent is being paid and the property is being looked after.  The tenant is a good tenant and is living reasonably and properly.</p><p> A point I make strongly is that when I started in public life, which was a few years ago now, the average waiting list for a council house was two to three years.  In Drogheda, it is getting close to ten years.  There is huge insecurity in that for families and there are great disadvantages when they have to move properties to another location.  These include disadvantages around schools, friendships and family.  I agree that we need to improve the rights of tenants significantly.  However, one cannot say, and I do not presume it is being argued, that if people do not pay the rent, behave anti-socially and destroy or damage the property they are in, they nevertheless have the right to remain there forever.  It is of great importance to have absolute clarity on that.  I would never stand over that, no more than I would stand over a bullying landlord who might switch off the electricity, harass a tenant, enter on the property without the tenant's consent or demand entrance without due notice.  The middle ground is to protect people and to provide them with increased rights, provided that they meet their obligations also.</p><p> I appreciate the Chairman's latitude on this.  I ask that we look at a moratorium, which would meet the requirements of security of tenure until such time as the housing supply increases.  The other point that has been made strongly is that 86% of all landlords own no more than two properties, while 70% of the landlords in the State own only one.  That is the reality of the people we are dealing with.  Clearly, families get into difficulties.  I know families where the parents became homeless as a result of decisions made during the boom.  As such, I would not exclude grandparents from the Labour Party's list, which I think it is intended to do.  It would not be right.  The positive needs which have been identified may not be fully provided for in the Bill.  They include the question of increased long-term leases.  That means encouraging landlords to lease for 20 or 30 years by providing tax incentives, refurbishment grants and so on to achieve the best practice we see in other countries.  Germany and other countries were referred to in that regard.  If that knowledge can be brought to the table, it would assist the debate.  There will always be a private sector and we need longer leases to provide greater security for families there.  Greater stability for tenants is required.  Provided everyone plays his or her full part and meets his or her responsibilities, I do not see why the thrust of what the witnesses want, which is what I want too, cannot be provided for.  We want longer and more secure tenancies and no evictions, certainly for a given period.  There were no evictions 20 years ago when supply met demand because people who were not happy with a particular landlord would leave a property.  When supply increases, people will have a lot more choice.  However, they can be protected now with a moratorium.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions first.  I will keep a record of any questions asked while Deputy Barry is away from the meeting to facilitate him coming back in.</p><p>Legal advice was discussed.  We have advice from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service and can seek advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser, OPLA, if the committee agrees.  What legal advice have the witnesses received in putting the Bill together?  I have questions regarding what I believe are unconstitutional proposals within the legislation.  While some of what is proposed is already incorporated in the Government's Bill, some provisions are unconstitutional.  Regarding a refurbishment as grounds to end a tenancy, we received assurances from the Department on clarification of what was and was not a refurbishment of a property.  That is coming.  Student accommodation will be included in rent pressure zones.  Where I have a real issue is around the sale of a property as grounds for terminating a lease.  The witnesses want a requirement to sell with the tenants <i>in situ</i>.  While I know this is a tricky one, I believe it is an unconstitutional proposal.  I say that on the back of the fact that 86% of landlords in the market own one to two properties.  We have approximately 174,000 landlords, some of whom might be accidental landlords, I do not know.  The proposal infringes on someone's rights.  As Deputy O'Dowd said, they are paying their taxes, including the local property tax, and are good landlords with, probably, good tenants.  If the person chooses to sell the property for whatever legitimate reason, I do not think we can infringe unconstitutionally on the right to sell with or without a tenant.  The person can sell it with a tenant if he or she so decides.  That is his or her choice.</p><p>I have another issue around the compensation proposed in the Bill.  It is proposed to give six months' compensation on the termination of a tenancy, even when the termination is within the prescribed time period and is legally acceptable.  What is the rationalisation for that?  How was it quantified?  How will it be enforced?  Would such a provision not push landlords out of the market?  There is a very fine balance to achieve to give both landlords and tenants security in this sector.  They both need assurances to make it viable for the non-commercial operators out there.  I am not talking about the big landlords to whom the witnesses always refer.  I am talking about the people who own one or two properties or up to even three or four.  Given the need to make it financially viable for them to remain as landlords, do the witnesses not see that this provision will tip matters over the edge?  Where did the rationale for six months' compensation come from and what legal advice, if any, was provided in that regard?</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Board's representatives will be here later.  The board has set out the main reasons landlords served notice in 2017 and its figures are a little different from those provided by those before the committee now.  According to the board, 44% of tenants on whom notice was served were in rent arrears.  In 20% of cases where notice was served, the landlord intended to sell the property.  In 8% of cases, landlords intended to use the property for their own families.  A further 8% of cases involved landlords who intended to substantially refurbish the property.  I am always conscious of circumstances in which it may be intended to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  In respect of a problem in 8% of cases, the witnesses seek to go in with a very heavy hand.  The rental market has been maturing over the years and we are coming off the back of a recession with social housing building increasing dramatically.  We need far more.  We need the private sector and private supply is increasing.  It will take a couple of years for the market to stabilise.  However, we can see the steady improvements taking place and the supports that exist.  I always use the analogy of the builder's leveller.  Whether I believe they are unconstitutional, we will have to get legal advice on some of these proposals.  In any event, with some of these proposals, the bubble in the leveller will be outside the lines and landlords will be pushed out of the market.</p><p>I do not think that is the intention of the Bill's sponsors but it is what will happen.  I would like to hear some responses, especially around the legal advice they may have received.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1432" speakername="Mick Barry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019022000002#H00400"><p>Yes, we can do that.  We wish to make a political point and then a legal point about this.  The political point is that there is a clash of interests, namely, the interests of landlords and the interests of tenants.  One can assert the rights of private property and the rights of the market, but where has that led society?  It has led us to the greatest housing and homelessness crisis in the history of the State.  It has led to the real possibility that the Department will release an official homeless list for the State that is above the 10,000 mark.  As an alternative, I would assert the rights of society and say that society has the right to protect itself and those in rented accommodation from that situation by strengthening the rights of tenants.  This Bill aims to do so in particular areas which are being cited daily, week in, week out, to use notices to quit as grounds for evicting people, in many cases into homelessness.  These include the sale of property and so-called renovictions.</p> <p>  On the legal issue, I note that the Constitution provides for the rights of private property.  It also provides for the State to take action in the interests of what it describes as the "common good".  It enshrines that as a strong and in some cases overriding principle.  Our legal argument will be that the common good overrides the rights of private property.  Our opinion is that this is not unconstitutional and is a legally sound Bill to put before the Oireachtas.  My personal view is that if we were found to be wrong on that, and I do not think we are, an urgent constitutional referendum is needed to facilitate the implementation of the legislation.  The rights of society and of the tenant should outweigh the rights of the market and private property in this instance.  The case for that is overwhelming in the midst of the housing and homelessness crisis.  I am happy to share our advice in that regard.</p> <p>  I will explain what we are trying to do in regard to the issue of six months' compensation.  Many tenants are given notices to quit which state that a relative is going to move in as the reason for eviction.  In some cases this is genuine.</p></speech>

The provision for six months' compensation aims to flush out the landlords who put that forward as a false reason.  We also think that six months' compensation is not unreasonable.  Finding alternative accommodation is very difficult for a young family with children.  It is very expensive.  The inconvenience that this family is put to by being forced to move out to make way for a relative is worthy of compensation.  We can debate what the level of compensation should be.  We feel that six months' rent is not unreasonable.  The principle of compensation for a tenant who has been asked to quit the premises is not unheard of internationally.  In the Netherlands, the state provides for compensation for tenants in this situation and in other circumstances.  We would argue that case.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dowd asked about the number of evictions that take place.  The data provided by Threshold, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and Focus Ireland provides some sense of it, if not a precise figure.  Focus Ireland says that 69% of homeless families report that their last stable home was in the private rental sector.  We can imagine that the vast bulk of them did not voluntarily evict themselves into homelessness.  There was a degree of-----</p></speech>

In other words, more than 5,000 families or households contacted Threshold that year because they faced losing their homes as a result of threatened eviction from the private rental sector.  This was up from 14% of all queries in 2016.  It is not realistic to think that 100% of people in this situation came knocking on Threshold's door.  That is a subset of the overall total.  Similarly, the Residential Tenancy Board's annual report for 2017 shows a massive 35% annual increase in disputes over invalid notices of termination from landlords.  Some 41% of termination notices ruled on by the RTB were found to be invalid, in other words, to be attempted illegal evictions.  Taken in the round, the Focus Ireland data, the Threshold data and the RTB data certainly show that this is substantial.</p></speech>

I would point out that as I understand it, the current legislation is that a tenant whose rent is in one week's arrears can legally receive a notice to quit and be asked to leave within a period of 28 days.

Also on the issue of legal advice, this particular area has not been amended in the Constitution since 2004.  The legal adviser to the all-party committee was Mr. Gerald Hogan, an eminent constitutional lawyer.  We can rely on that, therefore, as being the basis for the kind of balance I am trying to achieve in this Bill.  Regarding the term "evictions", we do not use it in our Bill.  We are specifically referring to particular circumstances where people get notices of termination of tenancies.  Rather than have a blanket concept of eviction, we are dealing with specific areas in our Bill.  I will try to respond to the questions raised.</p> <p>  Turning to the question on numbers, the Chair and Deputy O'Dowd referred to the number of people who have to leave their homes for a variety of reasons.  It is hard to quantify.  Threshold only knows about the cases that come to its attention.  The RTB, by and large, only knows the cases taken to it for decision.  Similarly, Focus Ireland also has only limited knowledge.  I do not know, therefore, if anybody can supply accurate information on this.  If we can help the committee to get that information, however, we certainly will be happy to do so.</p></speech>

We are trying to present legislative measures that would give those tenants security in their homes and also protect them from undue rent hikes.  Regarding the rent pressure zones, they have had some success in the areas where they apply.  I agree with Deputy O'Dowd on that.</p></speech>

That is partly because there is not a rent register and, therefore, a new tenant does not know whether he or she is being charged more than the 4%.  I accept the Minister has stated he is going to bring in an amendment on Committee Stage regarding that.  That does, however, have to be dwelling specific, and Threshold has made that case as well.  In other words, it is not just the rent on a particular road.  It is the specific rent for the particular property a prospective tenant may want to rent.</p> <p>  Turning to the other issues, sale is the one with which the Chair is particularly concerned.  Other European countries have legislation requiring that tenants have the right to stay in their homes.  If we are going to expect people to live in long-term rental situations, which is a norm in many European countries, then there cannot be a situation where tenants do not know when the property is going to be put up for sale and they will be out on their ears.  It is important to achieve that balance.  I acknowledge we have many accidental landlords in Ireland.  They might well just want to get rid of the property completely and the person likely to buy the property might not want to be a landlord.  If, however, we are ever going to move our policy to have a situation where we have a secure private rental sector, then we need to grasp that nettle of sale as a ground for termination of a tenancy.  That is why we have put it into this Bill.  It is a matter of judgment.  I would say it is not unconstitutional.  Others might argue it is.  Longer tenancies were also mentioned.  We all agree we want to see Part 4 tenancies extended.  Deputy O'Dowd made some general points.  I will not answer them because they are not so much to do with the Bill itself.</p></speech>

I do not think she is dumping on the system in the context of encouraging long-term letting of property.  That is what we have to do in conjunction with the State building more homes.  We must get the balance right.  I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan on that.  There must also be greater support for tenancies.  If, however, there are fewer landlords in the business today than three years ago, and I think about 21,000 fewer homes are available to rent now than a year ago, something is going wrong in the system.  We need those homes to stay in the market.  That is the problem we are facing.</p></speech>

We have many people now in a private rented sector which is undeveloped.  We are all trying to grapple with ways in which we can protect tenants in that situation.  Different kinds of tenants are in competition with each other for a shortage of supply.  That is the ultimate problem.  We are trying to tease out in this committee what we can do to protect tenants in that precarious situation.</p></speech>

I welcome Deputy O'Sullivan and her Bill, as well as Deputy Barry and his Bill.  My party also has a Bill on this issue, as does Sinn F&eacute;in, and the Government has its Bill on the way too.  There is a fair emphasis to try to resolve this issue regarding landlords and tenants.</p><p>We had a fairly productive meeting with the Minister in private session of this committee last week.  We discussed the proposed amendments that we are all prepared to put into that Bill.  There is a need to find a balance between landlords and tenants and a compromise position that facilitates both.  We need landlords and tenants.  We need to keep them both there.  As has been said, the lack of detailed data available to us to make the correct decisions is disappointing.  The RTB says it has 307,000 private rental tenancies registered.  What percentage are we talking about in respect of evictions?  If we had that information in front of us, we could probably make more concrete, accurate decisions.</p><p> The last thing we want to do is have an impact on the market that makes the situation worse.  The RTB is already telling us that 6,000 private rental tenancies exited the market last year.  We cannot sustain that.  In the absence of the delivery of housing, we are depending on the rental market.  We can ask ourselves as society where we want to go.  Do we want to move away from the traditional landlords that Ireland has always had?  Everyone has pointed out that 70% of landlords in Ireland own less than one property while 86% have two or three more.  We have only 14% commercial landlords as we would consider them.  It seems to be a lot easier to bring in legislation around the commercial landlords.  For our traditional landlords, there is great emotion attached to it.  It is their one-off property that they have bought, whether as an investment or because they were caught at the crash, and they feel entitled to do what they want with it.  They feel that if they want to sell it, they should be entitled to do so.  That does not apply to the commercial landlords because they are completely different.  As the rental sector is becoming more important because people are deciding to rent moving forward, we need to make sure that the decisions we make here do not have an adverse effect on the market or further exacerbate the situation we are in.</p><p> I agree with a lot of what Deputy Jan O'Sullivan is proposing in her Bill.  I have no issue around the proposals in the area of deposits.  I fully agree with her on the rent pressure zones, RPZs.  I have said it from day 1.  It would have been easier to put the whole country in and have regulation on how areas would get out.  In my constituency it is having a huge impact.  I have one local electoral area, LEA, that is very rural but that contains a huge urban area in Blessington, right beside Tallaght.  It will never qualify as a rent pressure zone.  Arklow sits right beside Wicklow, Bray and Greystones, which are in it.  I know there are landlords abusing the system and shoving rents up because they are in fear that they will be in an RPZ moving forward.  I do not have many direct questions.  I just feel we need to be very careful in what we decide.  Everybody in this room has the intention of finding the correct balance for the tenant and the landlord.  We need to keep the 86% of landlords there while we ramp up the delivery of social housing in the long term.</p></speech>

There are some issues on which we would not to be in agreement, particularly regarding the Anti-Evictions Bill, but by and large most of the recommendations are very solid.  We talk about rent pressure zones and normalise this idea that there can be a 4% rise every two years.  That has been the wrong road.  People say it is working in some areas.  We would have been better off linking it to the consumer price index, CPI, as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan has said.  We are effectively saying to landlords that every two years, they can get an increase of 4% and it does not matter about inflation or the cost of living.  We have been locked into this by the Government and it is a mistake.  We should be pushing the idea of linking it to the CPI.  The problem with the rent pressure zones is putting them across the whole country.  That is why I do not think they are fit for purpose.</p> <p>  It has been said that we cannot gauge how many people are being evicted for the sale of houses.  I hear about it quite a lot in my office.  It is quite big and that is what is so worrying.  People are being told the landlord is going to sell the place.  The big issue is the intention to sell.  We then discover on occasions that it is not the case but that the house is being refurbished and re-let.  The sanctions from the RTB do not seem to be fit for purpose in terms of dealing with that.  It is a major issue.  It is a good idea to try to get a definition of a family member because it is quite often used.  We need to look at that.  The issue of having a proper register is also very important.  On the refurbishment of properties, I have heard it used a few times and we do get it every now and again.  I do not think there is always a necessity to move the tenant out.  Some of these things can be worked around or at least an alternative could be put forward by the landlords if they are going to do it.  We have to look at that.</p> <p>  We are also seeing people on the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, being forced to go to the housing assistance payment, HAP.  This is causing a major problem and adding to the homelessness situation.  People are finding themselves not able to do this although it is common that they are getting letters and being told they have to.  They are coming into my office panicking like mad and some of them are ending up homeless as a result of all this.  We are talking about people losing their home.  These letters are adding to the problem.</p> <p>  The issue of the students' rights is very important.  Most of them seem to be on licences and we need to tie the RTB into that more.  It is an extremely important area.  Another issue is eviction.  I do not think anyone would tell a landlord he or she cannot evict someone over anti-social behaviour or very serious arrears.  We all accept that people cannot just plop themselves down and expect to get away with it.  However, in the past, the money was paid directly to the tenants.  That was a big mistake.  It still happens.  It should be going to the landlord, the receiver or the bank.  We need to be careful how we do this.  I have seen people get money and go off and spend it, and they end up in massive arrears.  It is a common thing.</p><p>By and large, there are many good things in both Bills and we will debate their merits.  Deputy Barry has raised some issues with which we all have some problem in terms of how we deal with them and we will discuss those matters in due course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.487" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019022000002#L00200"><p>This Bill is very important.  I do not wish to repeat what has been said, but to return to the rent pressure zones, I note that a period of three years is specified.  I believe the term should be five years because at the moment many counties are in rent pressure zones when others are not and areas that are not included such as my area of Carlow and parts of the areas represented by Deputy Casey and others are far behind.  It is important that we would consider specifying a five-year period in the Bill.  I ask Deputy O'Sullivan to respond on that point.</p> <p>  Section 9 relates to the rent register which will identify landlords and tenants.  That is crucial.  All parties, including Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, have Bills and we must all work together.  The Bill will be crucial for tenants and landlords.  We have good landlords and we have good tenants and we must strike a balance.  It is important to get the balance right.  At the moment, everybody's Bills are so different.  Why can we not sit around the table together and come up with a good composite Bill?  This is about ensuring tenants with children are looked after, as well as landlords.  I know of a landlord recently who bought a second house in the boom.  He was probably an accidental landlord but he now has to sell his home to move into the other house.  He has no choice.  There are genuine landlords who have good reasons for having to move.  If we do not get the balance right in the Bill then it will be unfit for purpose.</p> <p>  Whether we enact this Bill or another one, enforcement is important.  We could have as many Bills as we want but the legislation will not work if there is no enforcement.  Local authorities will have to play a significant part given their role in HAP and RAS.  Local authorities will be key.  Various agencies such as the RTB must work with local authorities to create a register, which we do not have currently.  That should be the key aim.  Overall, the Bill is welcome.  We must all make sure we get the Bill, which must be enacted as soon as possible.  It is a long time since 2004 when we had something to work on.  I am in favour of getting this right.  No matter what party we are in, we must work to make sure that we introduce a Bill that will suit tenants and that we also strike a balance for landlords.</p></speech>

When we got the submission from Threshold on the Bill proposed by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, it made a proposal that is worth considering.  It suggested that if a landlord issues a termination notice to a tenant for whatever reason, that he or she should be obliged to tell the RTB and that the RTB would then advise the tenant of the fact of its existence and the various rights of the tenant.  That is worth considering because it would allow for earlier intervention.</p> <p>  I suggest that the local authority should also be informed, in accordance with Senator Murnane O'Connor's point.  I think it is the case in Britain that if there is a danger of people becoming homeless one has an obligation to inform the local authority and that it must intervene in some way before a person becomes homeless.</p></speech>

The provision is not in my Bill but it is worth considering.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Casey's point about rent pressure zones, I have exactly the same situation where there is an expensive urban area attached to a rural part of a local electoral area and it will never be included.  They are chasing the average the whole time.  We are all agreed on that.</p> <p>  On Deputy Ellis's point relating to the same issue and the 4% being too much in some situations, and Senator Murnane O'Connor's point about three years versus five years, one of the reasons we included that is because there is a previous provision that rent increases would be linked to the consumer price index, CPI.  There is a possibility that the consumer price index could go higher than 4% within a time period so it is a question of the point in time when one carries out the review.  In some cases it might be disadvantageous to the tenant if the review is not carried out at an earlier stage.</p></speech>

Currently, in the case of Deputy Ellis's point, the increases would be much lower than 4% if they were linked to the CPI.  The question is to figure out what will happen in the future, which none of us can do.</p> <p>  On the issue about money to the tenant, that still happens with rent supplement and possibly RAS but not with HAP.  With HAP it goes to the local authority.</p></speech>

The IPOA encourages and educates its members on what constitutes good quality accommodation and on professional standards of management.  The association is a not-for-profit organisation and membership is not compulsory.  Property owners who join the association are, by definition, responsible and use the association for education and advice to help them comply with the complex legislation governing the sector.<br/><br/>The State has failed in its role to provide sufficient social housing for people who need accommodation.  The private rental sector has provided homes for people where the State has failed and is a vital part of the housing market.  Two thirds of tenancies in the Irish rental market are provided by property owners with fewer than three properties.  A total of 70% of landlords have one property and rely on it for their pensions.  The composition of the Irish market should be taken into account when drafting legislation.<br/><br/>Investing is a choice and the changes proposed in the anti-eviction Bill and the greater security and rent certainty Bill will further damage investment in the private rental sector and result in less accommodation being available.  Supply is the issue that needs to be addressed, and with this in mind the State needs to incentivise investment in rental property rather than penalise it.  A move to selling with the tenant <i>in situ</i>will limit the selling market to investors, which together with the rent pressure zone restrictions will substantially devalue a property.  Investment value is based on yield, which will be driven by the restricted rent level in place on the property.  Investors are less likely to purchase properties with restricted income.  It makes more sense to purchase a property that has never been let where market rent can be charged.  Presentation of a property also affects the price and an occupied property may not present well.  The threat of withdrawing selling as a ground for termination has already resulted in some investors leaving the market.<br/><br/>Indefinite tenancies are not workable.  A two-month probationary period is insufficient time to assess a tenancy and six months is more reasonable.  The existing six-year tenancy cycle allows for a no-fault method to get a property back and it is essential that this remains in legislation.  Six years is a long time and more than fair.  The private rental market houses people from all walks of life and often it is impossible to prove anti-social behaviour as a result of intimidation or breach of obligation.  A no-fault termination process is, therefore, essential.  Property owners with good tenants want to keep them and are happy to renew after six years.  Long leases can also be entered into but the continual interference in the market makes this option unattractive.<br/><br/>Substantial refurbishment is essential as a ground for termination.  After a number of years of a tenancy, substantial refurbishment is required to modernise and ensure the property is up to date and suitable for the changing accommodation needs of the market.  Substantial refurbishment is required to satisfy the needs of the market.  State housing policy should not lead to the running down of accommodation.  In a substantial refurbishment the removal of floorboards and the dust created from sawing, rewiring and removing walls create an unsafe environment.  It is essential as a health and safety issue, and often as an insurance issue, that properties are vacant during the works.<br/><br/>Restricting the deposit to one month&rsquo;s rent is inadequate.  There may be substantial damage to a property in excess of the deposit and the rent may not be paid.  The proposal is entirely inconsistent with the Residential Tenancies Act, which requires a minimum of six weeks to terminate for rent arrears and a minimum of four months to get a determination order.  There is no recourse for property owners where the occupier has no income.  A property owner must be free to decide how much deposit is required.<br/><br/>Rent pressure zones that cover the whole country would be entirely inappropriate.  No properties would be built in rental areas with low rent as the return would not justify investment.  It would drive landlords out of those areas, resulting in a severe shortage of rental property in rural areas.<br/><br/>Including receivers in the definition of landlords is essential.  The receiver collects the rent and should comply with the obligations of landlords in their entirety, including upgrading, repairs and refund of deposit.  Including student specific accommodation in the definition of landlords is impossible as the terms and conditions of licences are different.  They do not have exclusive possession of the property, they are licensed individually and they are responsible only for their own accommodation cost.  They may not have collective responsibility for the common parts of the accommodation.<br/><br/>The consumer price index, CPI, would not function in the context of the rental market.  The CPI does not reflect the significant costs associated with the provision of private rental accommodation, including taxation and increased labour costs for plumbers, electricians and painters.<br/><br/>Placing the rent payable for a tenancy on the register is a fundamental breach of the data protection rights of the landlord and the tenant, and is in breach of the existing European legislation.</p><p>It may be the landlord's sole income, in which case his or her personal information is not protected under GDPR.  The information is between the landlord and the tenant and, in the case of new tenancies, the landlord must provide the information to the tenant.  The information is featured on registration of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, which will be in a position to investigate where it is concerned that there may be a breach of the rent pressure zone regulations. Tenants <i>in situ</i>can request the information from the RTB if they believe they have been given incorrect information. <br/><br/>In conclusion, if passed, the Bills will have a significant detrimental impact on the sector and will lead people with capital to invest their money in an alternative asset class. </p></speech>

I appear on behalf of the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, which represents 374,000 students across the island.  We would like to indicate clearly the support of the USI for the proposed Bills and thank Deputies Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan and Deputy Barry for proposing them.</p> <p>  I will begin with a general outlook of the crisis students face.  On the night of the census in 2016, 8% of the total number of people who were homeless that night, or 429 people, were students.  When the Government&rsquo;s student accommodation strategy was launched in July 2017, there was an excess demand in purpose-built student accommodation, PBSA, of more than 23,000 beds.  This is expected to increase to almost 26,000 beds by 2019, which means we will remain 16,000 beds short even if all projected PBSA is successfully built.  Casting an eye over inner-city Dublin today, one would be forgiven for thinking that student accommodation seems to be being built everywhere and that there is surely enough to meet the need.  There has been a 2% increase, however, in student numbers every year for the past decade and this is expected to continue for the next decade.  The Government has not built enough student accommodation even to cover this increase, not to mention addressing the shortage.  The housing system, in effect, is buckling under the pressure and, in practice, is becoming a significant barrier to access to education.  The context for students and their families is that, according to the Dublin Institute of Technology "Student Life" survey, the cost of living while studying at third level is estimated at &euro;12,500 per annum, including fees of &euro;3,000, which are the second highest fees in Europe.  Grant rates were severely cut in budget 2012 and have not been adequately restored, in particular for postgraduate students.</p> <p>  We are examining three main areas with PBSA, namely, the cost or lack of affordability, rent pressure zones and the lack of tenants' rights.  Much of the new student accommodation being built is PBSA, funded by Irish and global property investors, but the rents being charged are frequently unaffordable for the average student.  In our experience, it is predominantly targeted at international students, who are generally fee paying and thus attractive for underfunded universities.  Students in PBSA are treated as licensees rather than tenants and, therefore, do not have the same rights, which is detrimental in many ways.  The students sign a licensee agreement rather than a contract and there is little legal protection for licensees.  They do not have to be registered with the RTB, for example, and no minimum standards, rent-book regulations or minimum notice periods are required.  Even in rent pressure zones, PBSA does not fall under the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  As a result, students are in legal limbo.  We hope that the Anti-Evictions Bill will address some of these concerns.</p> <p>  Last summer, there were increases of up to 19% in one development in Galway, which affected National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, students, and 27% in Dublin, which affected Dublin City University students.  Last month, there was an increase of 10% in Cork in University College Cork accommodation and 20% in another complex in Galway, presumably in preparation for legislation on rent pressure zones we were told to expect last year.  The story is not improving for students, as Ms Reilly will further outline in a moment, but I will first outline the USI's research through the student housing survey of 2017.  We are carrying out another one for 2018 but the survey of 2017 is the most up-to-date data we have.  More than one in five respondents experienced an unexpected increase in rent before or shortly after moving into or outside of the allowed agreed period.  One quarter of all respondents had a dispute with their accommodation provider, out of which the majority were in PBSA and privately rented student accommodation.  Some 17% of those experiencing conflict sought professional help.  Most frequently, those students who were looking for assistance turned to their students' union or Threshold.  The impact of the cost on students is that they drop out of college, stay in the library and couch-surf with friends.  They commute for hours to lectures, which directly affects students' ability to get a decent education.  The system is perpetuating and exacerbating educational inequality because students of many families who are considering going to college will end up not pursuing their first preferences in places such as Cork, Dublin or Galway because of the cost of accommodation in urban areas.  In effect, this will reduce the social capital of upcoming generations.</p> <p>  On the Anti-Evictions Bill 2018, extending the tenancy rights of students in PBSA is a vital change to housing policy.  Students have little to no rights in PBSA and are licensees rather than tenants, which the Bill addresses.  PBSA does not have to be registered with the RTB, which has left many students confused about whether they can take a case or whether they have any rights.  At a time when students are desperate for a roof over their heads, they are being exploited and we must do ensure we do whatever we can to amend that.</p> <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Greater Security of Tenure and Rent Certainty) Bill 2018 also addresses significant problems for students, including but not limited to deposits exceeding one month's rent and a residential tenancies register.  Due to the nature of students staying in accommodation for approximately nine months and because landlords of PBSA often do publish the amounts that have previously been charged, this would help to provide clarity.  Ms Reilly might comment on the practical issues in Galway.</p></speech>

The Bills address some of the issues that students have faced but just scratch the surface of what is taking place.  Last year in NUIG, a student residence associated with but not owned by the university increased its rents by 19% overnight.  In the students' union, we strongly opposed and protested the increase and took a case against the accommodation provider with the RTB.  This was how we learned about the 4% rent pressure zones not being extended to PBSA, the difficulties with residents in PBSA being classified as licensees rather than tenants and, as a consequence, the lack of rights that are afforded to students.  In our case, even though it was titled a licence agreement, the adjudication treated it as a tenancy.  We have learned from Threshold, however, that a similar case in Cork was treated as a licensee agreement, showing a lack of clarity in how these cases are treated, which the Anti-Evictions Bill will contribute to clearing up.  Our case failed on a technicality, unfortunately, but we then started to lobby for rent caps to be extended to PBSA.  Almost a year has passed but rent caps have still not been extended to PBSA.  We are faced with another increase of &euro;1,400, or 20%, in another of our student villages.  Again, this increase was announced overnight and was brought to us by a student who is considering taking a year out to afford her final year in college.  She has two working parents and just missed out on the threshold to receive the grant, and she works 25 hours a week to keep herself in college.</p> <p>  These unprecedented rent increases come with extortionate deposits, often of two months' rent or more to be paid upfront, which is why we welcome the addition of a limit to a deposit of one month's rent in the Residential Tenancies (Greater Security of Tenure and Rent Certainty) Bill 2018.  A residential tenancies register is also a welcome change, as quite frequently we in students' unions are left trying to gather data on what has happened year on year.  PBSA do not currently have to disclose previous rents and, therefore, we are reliant on students bringing forward information on increases.  </p> <p>  The issues we deal with in Galway are also happening in Dublin and Cork and spilling out of cities throughout the country.  Students are frustrated, but it is more than that.  It affects their access to education and their successes even within that system.</p></speech>

Threshold has advocated for increased security of tenure, affordability, improvement in standards and a sustainable private rented sector since its foundation by Fr. Donal O'Mahony in 1978.  We are working towards a vision whereby private rental is an equal tenure status with other tenure options in Ireland.  The two Bills tackle many of the varied issues and seek to improve the rental sector for those who have made their homes in it and for those who will make their homes there.  Both Bills seek to include lending or financial institutions in the definition of a landlord.  The Residential Tenancies (Greater Security of Tenure and Rent Certainty) Bill 2018 goes further to include receivers in the definition.  As the committee will be aware, Threshold has long called for the recognition of banks and receivers as landlords in the case of repossession of homes subject to buy-to-let mortgages.  It is essential that both banks and receivers are recognised as landlords to ensure tenants' rights are respected in the case of repossession or the appointment of a receiver.</p><p>The establishment of such security is essential if private rental is to exist as a legitimate tenure alternative to owner occupation and social housing.</p><p> We welcome the proposal to include licences for student accommodation in the definition of tenancies and licensees in student accommodation in the definition of tenants.  It is our position that all licences and licensees, and not exclusively those living in student accommodation, should be added to the definitions of tenant and tenancy.</p><p> It will be of no great surprise to the committee that Threshold supports the proposed definition of a deposit as outlined in the Residential Tenancies (Greater Security of Tenure and Rent Certainty) Bill 2018.  At this time of increasing unaffordability, where tenants are being asked for the equivalent of two months' rent as a deposit in addition to their first month's rent to secure a home, a legal definition is vital to ensure tenants can afford to access the private rented sector.  We have called for this definition for some time and for it to work alongside a dwelling specific rent register, which is essential for the protection of tenants and the enforcement of the rent pressure zone, RPZ, rules.</p><p> Linking rent increases to the consumer price index, CPI, will link rents to a tangible measure, reflective of supply and demand.  We are in favour of the proposed amendment.  We propose, however, that the increase should be subject to an overall limit of 20% over the course of five years.  In addition, we support the proposal to designate the State as a rent pressure zone.  We recommend that the designation be extended beyond the three years as Dublin and Cork will cease to be RPZ areas in December this year followed by the remaining areas in 2020.  The enforcement of such measures is key, assisted by the dwelling specific rent register that I mentioned.</p><p> We see merit in extending Part 4 rights to tenants once they have been in occupation for two months.  In addition to this, we fully support the creation of indefinite tenancies through the removal of section 34(b) which has been a long standing position of Threshold.  This is an essential step in making the private rented sector a viable, sustainable tenure choice.</p><p> Sale as grounds for termination has no place in a modern rental sector.  This has been the number one reason for tenants to contact Threshold in 2016, 2017 and 2018.  Continuing to permit sale as a grounds for termination prevents the establishment of a sustainable private rented sector and undercuts the effectiveness of housing assistance payment, HAP, as a social housing support.  We support the proposed removal of sale as a grounds of termination as proposed in both Bills.</p><p> Threshold supports the extension of notice periods for tenants, particularly those who have been in occupation for less than six months and for long-term residents who may have lived in a home for a substantial period of their life and are possibly at a later stage in life.</p><p> If renting is to become a tenure of choice and given that an increasing number of people are renting into older age, one year or more is not an unreasonable notice period.  The committee may well be aware of our view on this matter.  Threshold has long called for the creation of a publicly available rent register.  It is essential that it be dwelling specific, allowing a tenant or prospective tenant to determine the rent on the property prior to moving in.</p></speech>

I will be a bit parochial with the questions for the USI.  The witnesses made a couple of mentions of events in Cork.  Will they come back in and restate those?  I am not sure if I quite caught one and would like more information on another if that is possible.  They mentioned University College Cork and a 10% increase.  Will they clarify what they were talking about there?  They mentioned the Residential Tenancies Board challenge that was mounted in Galway and said there had been a similar challenge in Cork, where there was a ruling that someone was a licensee.  Will the witnesses give the committee more information and detail about that case?  I am interested to hear that.</p><p>The submission from the Irish Property Owners Association states:</p> <blockquote> 	The threat of withdrawing selling as a ground for termination has already resulted in some investors leaving the market. </blockquote> <p>I note that the witnesses regard protection for tenants on grounds of sale of property, which is the legal position in Germany, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands, as a threat.  Will they indicate to the committee the evidence, which they obviously have, about investors leaving the market because of the possibility of sale of property being taken away as grounds for termination?  I am a bit surprised by that.  I am hopeful for the Anti-Evictions Bill and will push it as hard as I can in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I hope that the emerging housing protest movement pushes hard for this Bill too but I do not think anyone would say that selling as grounds for termination being removed is on the verge of happening here.  I am surprised there is talk about investors leaving the market because of the threat of it.  Can the witnesses quantify that? Will they give an idea of the numbers about which they are talking?</p><p>Having mentioned Germany, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands, has the IPOA examined the position in those jurisdictions?  It is the law of the land in those countries that one does not have the right to sell a property and evict a tenant on those grounds.  The tenant must be kept <i>in situ</i>.  I do not see that it has caused a significant upheaval in any of those countries.  It seems to have become law and works reasonably well.  Will the witnesses comment on the position in those countries?</p><p>Ms McCormick stated:</p> <blockquote> 	[I]f passed, the Bills will have a significant detrimental impact on the sector and will lead people with capital to invest their money in an alternative asset class. </blockquote> <p>A point that often comes up in the committee is that 70% of landlords own one property and 87% own one or two properties.  Can the witnesses see a circumstance where, if they gave the tenant the right to remain in the case of a sale or renovation, they would have people in that category leaving the market, and to what end?  I do not see what one might do other than sell the property.  If one remains the owner of the property, surely it is better to have a tenant in the property than to leave it to lie idle?  It does not seem to me that the idea of a massive flight of investment is really on the cards.  Maybe the witnesses have information that would contradict that and I would be interested to hear it.  It underlines the importance of the State intervening and providing social housing on a significant scale so that people have a real option.</p></speech>

I am fully aware there is a significant number of good landlords and tenants out there.  We all know there are also bad landlords and tenants.  We need to make sure we have a balance.</p><p> The association's statement clearly states that it should be one's right to determine the level of deposit a tenant should pay.  That could lead to landlords choosing people who qualify for private rental accommodation and excluding people who cannot afford more than one month's rent.  Do the witnesses think that is fair in today's society?</p><p> Does the association have a definition in mind of what is substantial refurbishment?</p><p> I agree with what has been said here about rent pressure zones.  As I said in the most recent session, the whole country should have been included in the rent pressure zones.  The criteria should have been around how to exit a rent pressure zone rather than how to get into one and maybe we would not have the inconsistencies we are having around the country.</p><p> The representatives from the Irish Property Owners Association are showing reservations about the data register.  What are their fears about that?  We all believe it is important that we get down to that level of detail to control this.</p><p> We have spoken before about the fact that 86% of the market is controlled by small landowners and only 14% are commercial landowners.  We could all give examples of people who bought an apartment in the boom times, got married and had a family, moved out and are renting their own property while trying to get rent.  They are getting to the stage where they need to offload that apartment they bought to be able to move on with their lives.  Should we be focusing on getting a greater percentage of commercial landlords into the marketplace?  Are they easier to manage and control?  Is that the direction the State should be moving?</p><p> I welcome Ms Byrne from the Union of Students in Ireland before the committee again; she was with us in November.  She is a constituent of mine from Dunlavin.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien introduced the Residential Tenancies (Rent Pressures and Student Accommodation) (Amendment) Bill 2018 which specifically deals with the union's concerns.  That Bill gave a clear definition of student accommodation and put them into the picture of the rental pressure zones.  Do the union's representatives think that Bill would help to control the majority of the issues they have raised here today?</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Barry for his question.  The UCC case applies to campus-owned accommodation.  The rent did not go up last year but it has jumped by 10% this year.  The students' union has made a number of representations in order for that to be lowered because a 10% jump, year on year, is too much.  We can potentially see this as a reaction to the rent pressure zone legislation that will hopefully come through in the next year.  Landlords are hiking up rents now, anticipating that rent pressure zones might actually cover these purpose built student accommodation blocks.  We can also see it as colleges trying to bring in more income as a result of an underfunded education system which is a conversation for a different committee.  It could be the outcome of both of those things.</p> <p>  I will let Ms Reilly address the second part of Deputy Barry's question.</p></speech>

I do not have the details of the cases to hand but there were two separate cases in Cork and one was found to be a licensee and the other was found to be a tenancy.  The one we took forward failed on a technicality because the person in question was not a sitting tenant.  The purpose of bringing forward that case was to challenge this increase and we were saying that, while it might be titled a licence agreement, it had all the characteristics of a tenancy agreement.  That was essentially agreed at the hearing but the case could not succeed on a technicality.</p></speech>

His questions and the Bill he is putting forward demonstrate a certain ignorance of the sector and I would welcome the opportunity to put some facts around the matter.  His Bill is the latest in a series of misguided, populist measures that are interfering in the residential rental market.  The impact of his policies and pronouncements on the sector are probably hurting some of the people he espouses to represent.</p> <p>  The committee has been debating the Bill for two hours this morning and I wonder has supply been mentioned once in that time.  Deputy Barry has asked questions of the witnesses and for anecdotal evidence about the sector.  If the Deputy was attuned to and following what is going on in the sector, he would be well aware of the supply issues.  I have some statistics that are not my own but are publicly available from various Daft reports.  I took the time to look at them last night and went back as far as the Daft quarterly bulletin that was issued in December 2012.  There were more than 8,500 properties available to rent nationwide at that time.  The graph from the same period in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 shows that stock continually declined until December 2017 when it hit a low of 3,250.  In December 2018, the figure was 2,800.  It is clear there is a supply issue.</p> <p>  Sherry Fitzgerald is one of the leading estate agents in the country and probably the most respected in the research it conducts.  It has categorically stated that fewer than 40% of rental properties put on the market are subsequently acquired by investors.  If ten buy-to-let properties are brought to the market, approximately four of those properties come back into the rental market.  There is a rapid decline and deterioration in stock.  That is not because people have, all of a sudden, decided the rental market is unattractive.  They have looked at the tax cuts and provisions and legislative changes since 2009 and decided there are easier ways of making money.  They can put their money elsewhere without being subject to legal, tenant or funding risk.  They can make the same return and more elsewhere.</p> <p>  The supply issue must guide legislation.  All of the provisions that have been directed at the rental sector in the past ten years have been anti-landlord and anti-investment.  We have population growth of a minimum of 0.5% every year so 200,000 additional people are residing in the country since 2013.  Supply is the issue.  If Deputies Barry and Jan O'Sullivan were doing their jobs, and were actually interested in addressing the supply issue, they would have brought legislation through the D&aacute;il which saw tax incentivisation for people to invest in property and sought an easing of the administrative and legislative burden on landlords in an effort to bring more properties to the market.  That has been proven to reduce rent.  Rent halved during the recession when a surplus of property was available.  The only way to resolve the rental issue is to bring more supply to the market.  The proposed Bills are incredible at best, misguided from a neutral position and, if it were not so serious an issue, it would be funny.</p><p>The idea of introducing more legislation that would knock further investors out of the market is mind-boggling.  There are constitutional issues around property rights which are pertinent to the proposals, as well as serious GDPR issues regarding the tenancy register which Deputy Casey mentioned.  The country's best legal minds will not be able to find a way to protect both the property owner and tenant's details without breaching EU-wide data protection legislation.  There are a couple of hurdles to jump on this.</p><p> On the specific issue of how we know that investors are selling, we took soundings this week from an investor in Deputy Ellis's constituency.  There are 30 properties on the rental market in Dublin 9 this morning.  An investor was renting a two-bedroom apartment in the area.  He took 72 calls in respect of that property and over 50 of them were from people seeking accommodation as a result of their landlords selling their properties.  The Deputy wants more relevant data on whether owners are selling up.  They are.  It is entirely obvious.  If Deputy Barry was involved in the business, which he clearly is not, he would be well aware that this practice is happening.</p></speech>

Some of the questions are so basic in substance that there is no other way to address them.  We do not need to prove statistics.  You guys need us more than we need you.  We are not trying to sell a concept here.  There is a severe shortage of accommodation in the market.  All the political measures are anti-supply.  There is no taxation basis and no business case for investing in buy to let property at the moment.  A person doing so will pay 55% tax, funding costs of 6%, management charges, local property taxes, and taxation that is not treated on a consistent basis with other industries.  If we are sitting here a year from now, the 2,800 properties that are available nationally will have fallen to closer to 2,000.  I would say to Deputies Jan O'Sulllivan and Barry that a welcome development would have been the introduction of a measure to incentivise people to get into the market.  I do not hear many people discussing capital allowance schemes in areas of high demand.</p></speech>

Rather than having sound bites and policy by populism, we should have people who are trying to make a real difference to the sector, trying to bring accommodation to the market at affordable prices.  Frankly, we have seen nothing in this Bill that will do anything to improve supply.  We will continue to grapple with supply, high rents and a lack of accommodation.</p> <p>  The first thing the representative from the Union of Students in Ireland stated was that there is a shortage of accommodation.  Regardless of what side of the fence people are on, we all accept that there is a shortage of accommodation.  None of the legislators on this side of the room have brought forward any measures in respect of this matter.  It is just looking at protecting the existing level of stock, which has been proven to be inadequate.  We would not have a supply issue if it was not.</p></speech>

How do we do that without pointing out some of the obvious issues inherent in it?  If I may finish, reference was made to other countries which were cherry-picked that they would align or be consistent with the paper.  The most obvious country which was not mentioned and which is culturally, economically and systemically consistent with Ireland is the UK.  That was conveniently left out.  Does Deputy Jan O'Sullivan know what the position of the UK is in respect of the proposals?  Is she aware of the position regarding eviction when rent is not paid?  Does she know what the UK position is in relation to positive protection?</p> <p>  It is an example of what we have seen with all policy in recent years.  The countries that suit the argument best are cherry-picked.  A bit is taken from the UK system and from those of Germany and so on, and one gets very poor and misguided policy as a result.  I might sound frustrated.  The reason is because we are frustrated.  We have been before the Oireachtas on several occasions and we feel it is only a box-ticking exercise.  Our views are not listened to.  The outcome is that the State finds itself in its current position whereby there is a lack of supply.  The unintended consequence of the Bill will be that existing stock will be further undermined and reduced.  We are two or three years down the line and we are no further in terms of addressing the housing shortage.</p> <p>  Deputy Casey raised issues regarding the fairness of deposits and whether a two-month deposit is fair.  Is it fair that a landlord would be left with no rent for the past three months, that there be damages to his or her property and not being able to retain the deposit as compensation?  The thing has to be fair both ways.  We are mute on refurbishment.  We think that if a landlord does substantial refurbishment, he or she will be able to get a return on that investment.  Why would anybody invest money in refurbishing a property that meets the minimum standards if he or she cannot increase the rent?  The unintended consequence that will arise is that in three or four years there will be a very tired supply of stock.  There will be people who are looking to relocate to quality stock, those looking to work with companies such as Facebook and Google, who come with a particular expectation of accommodation standards but this country will not be able to provide it because the legislation does not allow landlords to refurbish.</p> <p>  I do not need to offer my views on rent pressure zones.  I do not know how a tenancy register will in any way comply with GDPR legislation.  That is not something that the Oireachtas can deal with locally.  It is an EU law.</p></speech>

The vast majority of people whom Threshold assists, work with and advise are being housed by small landlords.  We do not take the things that we are saying lightly as we are mindful of that balance.</p> <p>  There is a place for the larger institutional investors.  They have grown.  I have worked in this area for some years and had hoped that the larger institutional investors would be one of the larger sources of supply for private rental tenants.  However, they are essentially interested in the higher-end or higher-income renter.  As such, as well as attempting to retain what we have, we require affordable rental.  We need supply which is provided by a number of players, including approved housing bodies, and which provides rental at an affordable level but which is also financially sustainable for the providers themselves.  There could be a range of providers that may be able to offer this.  It is something that has been debated at Government level for some time.  It would be great to see some of these come on stream and build up in volume.</p> <p>  I will respond to some of the comments.  We talk about a dwellings-specific rent register.  There is already a property sale index which is specific to the dwellings that are sold so there is already a precedent.  We referred to sales as grounds for eviction.  England is not my favourite country right now, particularly in light of Brexit, but it is a place where sale is not permitted as a grounds to evict.</p><p>It is a common law jurisdiction, like the Republic of Ireland, but even in a place with such ambivalent policies towards renters that is a rule.</p></speech>

It is a little bit disingenuous to make that point because it is much easier to get vacant possession in the UK which allows a person to sell on that basis.</p></speech>

I have felt frustrated.  The witnesses looked on everyone here as an enemy and spoke as if many of these Bills were designed to attack the Irish property owners and people renting.  I do not see it that way.  I do not necessarily agree with everything that is in these Bills.  I would have problems with some areas.  The way I see it we are trying to get a proper functioning system, whether social housing, private housing, people renting or otherwise.  We are trying to get it into perspective.  Supply has been constantly raised in the House and at committee meetings.  We have constantly argued that the method and policies being pursued are not giving us enough supply.  That is the key in many ways to keeping the rental market at a certain level.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien gave me an example from Dublin 9.  The average rent there for a house is &euro;1,800 or close to &euro;2,000 per month.  No one, including Mr. O'Brien, could tell me that is justifiable.  I hear it constantly and I know many landlords.  I am not for one minute anti-landlord because I know many decent landlords.  No one can turn around and say we do not have a problem with people being put out of their homes for the sake of a sale.  That is constantly raised in my constituency office.  Many landlords are saying they are going to sell.  Some of them are genuine and some are not.  We all know that.  We have to get a balance in dealing with this.  </p> <p>  Refurbishment was mentioned.  There has to be a case for very substantial refurbishments and if it is possible for the landlord to put the tenant somewhere else that is fine but that is not always the case.  If there is a genuine argument that has to be considered.</p> <p>  The deposit is very difficult for many people in the private sector.  Some people have got a deposit from their welfare officers and that worked in some cases.  I know landlords who have not received rent payments for two to six months or even longer and that is not acceptable either.  That has to be addressed.  </p> <p>  The area needs to be strengthened for students.  They should have the facility to go to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  I do not accept Mr. O'Brien's argument that they are in a different situation and cannot be tied into rent pressure zones.  I disagree with the concept of rent pressure zones.  I would prefer that we were tied to the consumer price index, CPI, across the board.  There are rent pressure zones in some areas but not around the country.  In Dublin the limit is 4% but every two years the landlord can add 4%.  I do not buy that argument.  It is wrong.  Sometimes being tied to the CPI can work against a person, if inflation goes up but by and large it is a fairer system.  </p> <p>  We are not making any dent in the housing list for all the measures that have been put in place.  There is still massive homelessness.  We do not seem to realise that the population is growing.  The demand is growing and the amount of stock in the private sector is reducing.  We must build more and create more supply.  We should not underestimate that.  </p> <p>  Obviously there cannot be anti-social behaviour or people in arrears.  The council has a policy of moving against people being anti-social.  The same should apply in the private sector.  There has to be a mechanism to deal with serious anti-social behaviour or massive arrears.  I do not think anyone disputes that.</p></speech>

I have read the witnesses' opening statements and have been watching the proceedings.  I apologise for not being here.</p> <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il facilitated this Bill coming to the committee by abstaining in the vote in order to allow people put their views forward whether they agreed with Deputy Wallace's Bill or not.  There is a large portion of his Bill that I do not agree with and that I do not think is workable.  I sense the frustration across the sector, public and private, but this conversation should never be a question of tenant versus landlord or landlord versus tenant.  Good legislation does not have to be anti-landlord or pro-tenant.  It is a question of balance.  That is what we need.  We need to take out some of the blunt instruments which make for good headlines from time to time but we should not dismiss every element.  We should look within the Bill at some parts of it that would absolutely have merit, as in seeking to include a lending or financial institution in the definition of a landlord.  There should be no issue with that.  It is something my party proposed.  I would like to see it included in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018.  </p> <p>  I thank the USI for coming here again today.  I would be more than hopeful that the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018 that the Government is bringing forward would include purpose-built student accommodation.  We had a private session on the Bill a couple of weeks ago, and my party introduced legislation last year that defines purpose-built student accommodation, which is defined in the Planning and Development Act 2018.  It can be done, we can bring in a licence to reside.  We have lost a year on this and this committee is unanimous in ensuring that students are given the protection they deserve and that they get the protection of the rent pressure zones.  A licence to reside also falls under that Act.  My understanding is that will be brought forward in this Bill.</p><p>The committee met in private session to discuss it.  I have made it clear to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that it should be addressed.  In fairness to Sinn F&eacute;in, my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Broin agrees that if the Government does not bring it forward, we will table amendments to the Bill and have them passed.  The Labour Party and others have also agreed to this in order to ensure students will get the protection they need.  I acknowledge that more needs to be done, but it has been quite tortuous to get to this stage.  However, we will get there eventually.  The job of the committee is to deal with things in a structured way to ensure the measures introduced will work.  I could produce Bills every day of the week that would make big pronouncements on certain things, but if they are not implementable, legal and constitutional, we would just be leading people down the garden path and giving them false hope.  As I said, financial lending institutions should be encompassed within the definition of "landlord".</p><p> Supply is a major issue across public and private housing provision.  Leaving aside private landlords, the State has been very slow to provide public and cost rental housing.  More than 6,000 landlords were lost from the market last year.  There are many good landlords.  It is a significant issue.  It is evident in my area of Dublin Fingal which has one of the youngest demographics in the country and where every apartment viewing is attended by between 30 and 40 couples.  As Mr. McCafferty and Ms McCormick will know, the majority of those entering homelessness come from the private rental sector.  As that sector is part of the solution, the idea of making it more difficult for people to enter the market through the blanket prohibition on evictions proposed in Deputy Barry's Bill simply would not work.  It would have the unintended consequence of driving more landlords out of the market which would mean less availability, unless the State could pick up the slack and provide housing, as it should.  I have always been a supporter of public housing provision.</p><p> One does not have to be especially perceptive to sense the frustration of Ms McCormick and Mr. O'Brien, in particular.  In fairness, I also recognise the restraint shown by Deputy Barry during his exchanges with them.  All present hold pieces of the puzzle and it is possible for advocacy groups, Threshold, students, property owners and the State to solve the problem together.</p><p> We need to strengthen tenants' rights.  My party proposes to table more than 25 amendments to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill to so do.  We need to strengthen these rights in a real and tangible way.  However, we also need to ensure we are not driving people out of the market, unless the State can step in and provide housing.  The committee held a private meeting two weeks ago, at which it went through a significant number of amendments to the Bill with the Minister.  We did it in private session on a cross-party basis involving all of the members present to try to gain agreement and expedite the process.  The Government wants to have the Bill passed by 19 April.  I am somewhat concerned that it has been two weeks since that meeting and the Bill has not been progressed.  It is a matter for the Chairman to ascertain when the Bill will be progressed because it will be of assistance.</p><p> Certain measures brought forward in the budget were criticised by some parties.   I suggested the incentivisation of long-term leases in an attempt to strengthen the rights of existing tenants, but other parties criticised it as a boon to landlords.  That was not the motivation behind it.  I was trying to ensure longer leases would be offered because it is a significant problem in Ireland.  </p><p> Pre-legislative scrutiny by the committee is very important .  We wished to ensure the Bills in question were subject to scrutiny because there was merit to aspects of the legislation brought forward by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and, in fairness, Deputy Barry.  There are other elements of the Bills with which Fianna F&aacute;il does not agree.   That is why it is important that it be done in public session in order that the views of all present can be taken on board as we progress the various items of legislation, particularly the Government's Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill that it is hoped will reach Committee Stage in the next two weeks.</p></speech>

While Deputy Darragh O'Brien abstained in the vote on Second Stage of the Anti-Evictions Bill 2018, I voted against it, as Deputy Barry is aware, because I believed it was unfair and unconstitutional for various reasons.  Two weeks ago the committee met in private session with the Minister and representatives of the Residential Tenancies Board to tease out these issues, as mentioned by Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  We resolved differences on many issues, including student accommodation and received significant clarity and moved forward on the issue of refurbishment.  All parliamentary counsel will be occupied for the next month with the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019, but I presume that the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill will be brought before the committee as soon as possible.</p><p>I acknowledge the frustration of Mr. O'Brien and agree with the majority of his comments.  Cost rental will be a game changer as the State will become a major landlord in the market.  It is about having the right supply in the market.  According to the <i>Daft.ie</i>quarterly bulletin figures referred to by Mr. O'Brien, 8,500 properties were available to rent in 2012, compared with 2,800 last December.  If the 6,000 landlords who left the market in 2017 had not done so, their properties would bring availability back up to 2012 levels.  That indicates the fragility of the sector.</p><p>I was present for the discussion of the legislation to implement rent pressure zones more than two years ago and heard the arguments from all sides.  However, very few alternative solutions or options were put forward.  I am opposed to rents being linked with the consumer price index, CPI.  Is Deputy Ellis proposing that it be done on an annual basis?  Landlords take a risk.  The CPI does not take into account the additional costs incurred by landlords which have been mentioned.  We must be real about it.  I am not referring to the big commercial landlords but to those who own one or two properties, who make up the majority of landlords.  We must tread carefully in dealing with this issue.  When rent pressure zones were introduced, we said it was about treading carefully and protecting the rights of landlords and tenants equally such that one was not given precedence over the other.  We must be very careful in how we proceed with legislation when it comes to people's rights.</p><p>We are here to scrutinise the Bills before us.  Deputy Barry stated he would provide us with the legal advice he had received.  Unfortunately, the provider of legal advice for Deputy Jan O'Sullivan was unable to attend the meeting, but the Deputy will provide the committee with that advice.  I look forward to seeing it because although a Government Bill goes through various legal processes and is subject to scrutiny before it is brought before the D&aacute;il, that is not the case for Private Members' Bills.</p><p>I am opposed to the proposal made in Deputy Barry's Bill that six months' compensation be paid to a tenant whose landlord terminates the tenancy in order to sell the property.  I also disagree with his definition of &quot;eviction&quot;.  To me, a valid notice to quit involves the proper notice period to find another property being given and the notice to quit being within the legal parameters.  The Deputy wishes to provide for compensation to be paid in such circumstances.  He may correct me if I am wrong, but I think such a provision would be unjust.  I ask him for his feedback in that regard.</p><p>We are making great strides in the provision of student accommodation.  Supply is a significant issue.  I am glad that Ms Byrne alluded to the amount of student accommodation that had been delivered and where we were going.  Obviously, we need to go much further, but significant work in including student accommodation in rent pressure zones has been done and I think she will be happy with what is coming forward.</p><p>A landlord has the right to sell a property once it is done within the legal parameters of the notice to quit and relevant termination periods.  If a landlord wishes to sell the property with the tenant <i>in situ</i>, he or she has the right to do so.  However, to stipulate that it be sold with the tenant <i>in situ </i>would be going too far.  I wholly oppose such a measure as it would favour one side over the other.  As Deputy Darragh O'Brien pointed out, this is not about pitching landlords against tenants; rather, it is about having a functioning rental sector, which is only now beginning to mature.  We have a lot of catching up to do.</p><p>On supply, we do not need to go over what happened in the past, but we know that what is coming down the line in expected population growth and with Brexit.  We know that we are running to stand still, but we are making great strides.  I do not want any legislation to be brought forward that would push landlords out of the market and exacerbate the issues before us.  It is about equal rights on both sides.  I ask Mr. O'Brien to outline his responses on the proposed legislation.</p></speech>

Tenants can sit in properties and not pay rent.  They can challenge an appeal through the RTB without having to put up funds or put the rent payments in an escrow account in the event that they lose their case.  Landlords are expected to wait 12 to 18 months to have their cases heard.  There is no balance in that regard.  RPZs have been introduced retrospectively, while landlords who were fair with tenants and have not increased the rent have no redress to bring it up anywhere near the market rent.  There has been no balance in the discussion so far.</p> <p>  On the issue of compensation, we all have experience.  We have had tenants who signed a one year contract and left after six months.  I presume - I am not being facetious - that under the proposal, if a tenant were to leave before the lease was up at the end of the sixth month, he or she would owe the landlord the last six months of rent payments in order that it would apply both ways in the interests of balance.</p> <p>  Equally, in relation to RPZs, although I understand they are not a feature, when there is another downturn similar to that in the period 2010 to 2014, inclusive, when rents slid by 50%, I presume that the proposed measures would apply to tenants also in that the decrease would be limited to 4% every two years.  If we are to have balance, there should be balance on all sides.  That is really all I have to say.</p></speech>

It is brilliant to see cross-party support on the measures proposed.  We started this process last year.  There is a lot of fear among those whom I represent about how long the process is taking.  There are particular instances in Cork and Galway where there will be drastic increases next year of 10% and 20% next year.  We recognise the work of the committee and that of the different parties that are bringing forward legislation, but we want it noted that we are concerned about how long the process is taking.</p> <p>  We mentioned the supply issue.  It was great to see some of that supply being provided in the past year.  The problem is that the new builds are coming onto the market at unaffordable prices of &euro;1,000 a month.  When one talks about supply, what is being provided for students?  It is completely unaffordable.  We should be looking at other models such as cost rental which was mentioned, or perhaps capital grants for colleges to build student accommodation on campus.  That is where we stand on that issue.  It is too late for the 4% rent pressure zones, to which Deputy Ellis alluded, when places are coming onto the market at &euro;1,000 a month.  While it is too late, we will take it now because it is all we have and if we are to see increases of 20% year on year, an increase of 4% would definitely be welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.552" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann-Marie O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019022000002#T00600"><p>We wanted to come in to say something about the compensation provision proposed in the Anti-Evictions Bill 2018.  It is proposed that if a landlord was to issue a notice of termination on the grounds that a family member wanted to move in, the equivalent of six months' rent be paid by way of compensation to the tenant.  This happens in other European countries.  It is usually expected that the landlord and the tenant would agree between themselves and there are restrictions in that regard.  As proposed in the Anti-Evictions Bill, one could see a tenant who has only lived in a place for one month receiving notice and then compensation, which seems excessive.  It also seems to be a harsh levy to place on a landlord who may be in genuine need of the property.  If it is the case that the measure is being proposed to prevent landlords from abusing such grounds for termination, there may be better mechanisms to use.  As part of the Department's review in 2017 of Rebuilding Ireland, it was proposed that a landlord be required to notify the RTB when issuing a notice of termination.  As a measure to prevent the issuing of such a notice on false grounds, it could be expanded to include a verification process through the RTB.  Another option may be providing for a signed declaration from the family member, as well as from the landlord, to accompany the notice of termination.  In addition, in the context of the forthcoming Bill proposed by the Government, this could be included in Schedule 2 to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to enable the RTB to investigate if it believed a notice of termination had been issued falsely on the grounds that a family member wanted to move in.  While we see abuse of that ground, we are not so sure payment of compensation would be a sufficient way to tackle it.  As most landlords only own one property, it would be quite an expense for them to pay compensation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.553" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret McCormick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019022000002#T00700"><p>What I find worrying is that we constantly talk about the average rent.  We do not know what the average rent is.  The <i>Daft.ie</i>index deals with rents in the last three months and refers to incoming tenants and new tenancies.  The RTB's index also reflects the position in the last three months.  One does not know what the average rent is from it as most people are living in their properties for much longer.  The average tenancy is three years.  The registration process will capture that information, but we are basing all of the legislation on the average rent.  That issue needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>We need a deposit that is sufficient to warrant the risk being taken.  For most landlords, a property is extremely expensive to purchase.  Landlords with fewer than three properties make up two thirds of the market.  If damage is done, there has to be a mechanism or some recourse to get some of the cost back.  In a situation where we have received a one-month deposit, if the tenant does not pay the last month's rent, that money is gone.  If tenants do not pay their rent, we have to start serving notices and follow the legislation as it is written.  Therefore, we have to issue warning letters and a notice of termination.  If they do not leave, we must go to the RTB.  We are, therefore, looking at a huge risk.  Anybody who takes in a tenant at any time is facing a huge risk.  The vast majority of tenants and the vast majority of landlords are good, but it is up to a landlord to decide how much is required by way of a deposit and with how much he or she is comfortable.  It is that simple.  If damage is done and the rent is not paid, there is nothing available, no recourse and no protection if somebody has no income.  In that instance the State does not protect the landlord.  The tenant is protected by it as the landlord cannot evict the tenant until the processes are complete.  In a case where the rent is not being paid, this is fundamentally unfair and a huge risk for the landlord.<br/><br/>The CPI does not reflect the cost of providing accommodation.  The rent pressure zones were provided for with good intentions, but they have had dark consequences for many.  If the rent is substantially below the market rent, one cannot increase it.  Having decreased substantially for a long time, from 2012 to 2015, inclusive, when they started to come back up, there was a two-year cap provided for by the Minister.  As soon as it was lifted, we were in a situation where many landlords whose rents were substantially below the market rates were not in a position to keep subventing the rent payments on their properties and as a result had to sell.  The last call I took yesterday was from somebody with a three-bedroom house in Drogheda.  The rent paid by the previous tenant was &euro;600.  That tenant has left and the landlord can no longer afford to subvent the rent payments.  Under the HAP scheme, it is wanted for &euro;1,200 which is below the market rent.  The landlord cannot do it because it would be breaking the rent pressure zone law.  The property is being put up for sale.  There is nothing in the legislation that addresses the properties that are being rented at substantially below market rents and there are unintended consequences, on of which is that are we are losing properties.</p></speech>

After I had made my original presentation, I had to leave.  However, I have read the presentations made.</p> <p>  I refer to Mr. O'Brien's comments.</p><p>The Chairman has dealt with this.  These are Bills presented by me and Deputy Barry.  They are not the committee's Bills.  The committee has different views on our Bills and is simply holding hearings on our Bills.  Any criticisms on the Bills should be directed towards myself and Deputy Barry rather than to everybody on the committee.</p><p> I want to raise a number of matters and to deal first with the student issue, which is not in my Bill.  The Sinn F&eacute;in and the Fianna F&aacute;il Bills were both published at the same time as my Bill and dealt with the student issue.  My Bill is not comprehensive but I fully supported their Bills.  As the Chairman has said, the Minister also told us the that issue of student accommodation is going to be dealt with by way of amendment to his Bill.  To be completely frank about it, his Bill is much more likely to go through and to go through more quickly than any Bill of ours from the Opposition because it tends to take an awfully long time to get an Opposition Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We will work with the Minister on that issue.</p><p> I thank the Threshold representatives for the ongoing information on the issues that come to their attention.  They also gave us some data on the Minister's Bill, which is very helpful.  In that context, in our earlier presentation, Deputy Casey raised the issue of data and the accuracy of the data we have.  Perhaps Threshold may be in a position to help us because different organisations have different data on the reasons for people becoming homeless.  The committee wants to gather as much accurate information of this sort as possible.</p><p> I specifically wanted to ask Threshold on the obligation to inform the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, when a termination notice is being issued, something I understand it included in the documentation on the Minister's Bill.  The RTB would then inform the tenant, so that the tenant would know that there were certain things he or she could do, including going to the local authority, which itself would also be informed.  As far as I know, and perhaps Threshold may be able to clarify this, in the UK, and I am aware that Mr O'Brien referred to the UK, there is an obligation to notify the local authority well in advance when there is a risk of homelessness, so that the authority can respond appropriately rather than waiting until the tenant becomes homeless.  If Threshold could give some clarity on that, that would be welcome.</p><p> On the issues that are of concern to landlords in particular, I do not know if the representatives heard my opening statement, which I submitted in writing to the committee as well.  In that I spoke about the examples we got from the Library and Research Service relating to Europe, which are in its international comparative study on the private rented sector and which included the UK, incidentally, and I quoted the example of Germany where 41% of the housing stock is privately rented and that this is considered to be a secure, long-term option.  In this regard, many of the measures in my Bill are around giving tenants security so that they can have a secure long-term option in the private rented sector, and I very much defend that in my Bill.  I also said, however, that it is pointed out that the law benefits landlords as well as tenants.  There are depreciation allowances, mortgage interest tax relief, deduction of maintenance costs and the possibility to deduct losses from the income tax base.  These are all taxation measures and are not measures that would be in any Bill that would be presented to the housing committee.</p><p> We are accused of being anti-landlord, but while we recognise that there are issues for landlords as well, they are not in this Bill because this Bill is about protecting the rights of tenants and giving them security of tenure.  In this very changing market that is in many ways catching up, where we had a collapse of the economy and houses not being built, I fully support the idea that the main thing we need is the publicly led construction of social and affordable houses.  That is our policy.  In the meantime, however, we have to protect tenants in the very fragile situation that they are in where they do not have any long-term security.  It has to be looked at from their perspective, as well as from the landlord's perspective.</p><p> In that regard, on the point made by Ms McCormick about the deposit and the risk to the landlord who has paid big money for the property he or she is renting out, there is a risk to the tenant as well.  If the tenant does not get his or her deposit back, he or she does not have a deposit for the next tenancy.  There is a balance of risk there too.  I certainly know of cases where the tenant did not get the deposit back from the letting agency where it said that it could not get the deposit back from landlord because the property had been sold.  I know of cases where tenants had done nothing wrong to the property and did not get their deposit back.  There is a balance there as well.</p><p> On the Constitution, in my presentation I put it in the context of the constitutional balance between property rights and the public good.  In that regard, there is very little security for people in the private rented sector who, through no fault of their own, have to rely on that sector because there is not enough supply in the public sector at the moment.  We could all go back to the reasons for that.</p><p> Those are the main points that I wanted to make.  On the question of legal advice, the Chairman has dealt with that.  My legal adviser was supposed to be here today but, unfortunately, could not be.  We are trying to deal with the real situation that tenants find themselves in, and the measures in my Bill are fairly specific.</p><p> One other matter which I wish to refer to is the rent register.  The Minister has said that he will bring forward proposals for a rent register.  I agree with Threshold that it needs to be dwelling specific.  We have it in our Bill that it will not disclose the identity of the landlord or the tenant of the dwelling.  We are saying a prospective new tenant should know how much rent was charged previously on the property but that it would not contain the identity of the landlord or the tenant.</p></speech>

One of the charges that was made was of a certain ignorance of the sector.  I do not believe that to be the case.  I offered Mr O'Brien the opportunity to enlighten me and the committee on the claim he made in his presentation to the committee that the threat of withdrawing selling as a ground for termination has already resulted in some investors leaving the market.  We have a Bill here which is at the early part of stage 3 of progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I expressed some surprise that the content of those Bills would be forcing a flight of capital at this point, and I asked Mr. O'Brien to provide evidence.  He provided evidence of investors leaving the market.  I did not hear any evidence of people leaving the market because of the possibility of sale as a ground for eviction being removed.  Perhaps he might enlighten me on that point in his reply.</p> <p>  One matter that I am very aware of is the people who crowd out my constituency clinic every single Monday morning, and have done so in recent weeks, months and well beyond that, and who bring stories to me about how they have received a notice to quit because their landlord is selling the property.  These are often family people with young children who feel, with some reason, that they are on the verge of being evicted into homelessness.</p><p>I will give an example of the people from one block of apartments where 15 or 17 families approached me - some of them crowded out my clinic - to ask where they were to go and what they were to do.  Their landlord, a vulture fund, was evicting them on the grounds of the renovation of the property.  The renovation of the property was to get around the issue of the rent pressure zone, RPZ, to hike up the rents and go for a more affluent tenant.  They fought a battle on that and pushed back, which is very much to their credit.  People approach me who are extremely upset and are crying and everyone present has had that experience.  Mr. O'Brien said that I should do my job.  As far as I am concerned, I am doing my job here today.  It is my job to represent the woman who comes to my office with the eviction notice and the family facing homelessness because of the threat of a "renoviction" to make more profit for a vulture fund.  Mr. O'Brien's job may be to represent other people, which is fair enough.  This is my job and I am doing it.</p><p> If the number of people joining the homelessness lists for this January are anything like those in January of 2018, 2017 or 2016, then the numbers of people officially homeless will go over the 10,000 mark for the first time in the history of the State.  Threshold and other organisations doing similar work tell us that the number one cause of homelessness in the State today is eviction from the private rental sector.  That is an unchallengeable and incontestable fact.  It is insanity to continue to allow these evictions to take place in the midst of the largest housing and homelessness crisis in the history of the State.  This Bill aims to staunch the flow with strong practical - and from the point of view of ordinary people - reasonable measures, such as banning the sale of property as grounds for eviction.  We have established during these hearings that this is the case in law already in Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark.  It seems to me that the highest rental investment profits in Europe are being made in Ireland.  Whatever way one looks at the figures, Ireland is up at the top of the table in that regard.  </p><p> It is a bit much for me where there is a lot of sympathy being offered to representatives of the Irish Property Owners Association, IPOA, here today.  It does not sit well with me to listen to the poor mouth for an hour and a half while fabulous superprofits are being made by many landlords, including corporate landlords, in this country.</p><p> What is being said is that if one brings the standards and rights for tenants up to the level of other European countries and follow what is best practice for tenants' rights and entitlements, that landlords are going to turn tail and flee the market.  There is a significant element of bluff in that to maintain and defend those rental profits.  If there is any degree of truth in that, what it actually points to is not giving more tax breaks and concessions to landlords but to the need for the State to provide a genuine alternative by way of significant and massive investment in social housing to provide a roof over our heads with decent rights and conditions for our people.</p></speech>

Deputy Barry asked for evidence.  I gave Deputy Barry clear evidence that there is a mass exodus of landlords leaving the sector on the back of ongoing tax and legislation changes that have been implemented and are currently going through the Houses.  On evidence of these particular measures in the Bill, we can only rely on the feedback we get through our helpline in the IPOA.  Since this Bill was been announced publicly at the end of November 2018, we have been inundated with members ringing our office, wondering is this coming into law, when is a coming, and expressing-----</p></speech>

There is absolute evidence of that and as we are closer to that than is the Deputy, we can speak on behalf of property owners in that regard.</p> <p>  The Deputy has mentioned his concern and discomfort at people crowding out his clinic as result of having been served with notices to quit.  I do not understand how the Deputy believes it is private landlords' responsibility to sort out the homelessness crisis.  The homelessness crisis is a State responsibility.  It is not for the private sector to resolve that.  Without the private sector, the homelessness crisis would be a lot worse.  The private sector should receive some gratitude and acknowledgement for the important role that it plays.  I stand by my comments on the Bill.  The Bill does nothing to sort out the problem we are experiencing at the moment.  If there was a serious intent to resolve the problem of housing, all parties would be coming forward with incentivisation measures.  If one looks at the section 23 provisions, one would get laughed out of court if one mentioned reintroducing it.  Without section 23, however, we would be devoid of thousands of apartments in Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Athlone and Cork and the housing crisis would be a hell of a lot worse than what it is now.  The reintroduction of incentivisation and tax breaks is needed, as unpopular as they might be to members in reaching out to their electorate and support base, as soon as possible.</p> <p>  The last point I will make is about the following figures, which I have given and explained to the committee previously.  Superprofits have been mentioned in the rental sector before and while I thought I had explained it the last time we met, to do so again, if one takes an apartment that is rented for &euro;1,000 a month, this represents a gross rental of &euro;12,000 a year.  The tax take on that is &euro;6,500 before one goes anywhere.  The local property tax, LPT, due is &euro;300, the service charge is &euro;1,500 and general repairs come, on average, to about &euro;1,000 a month.  That leaves &euro;3,000 to service one's mortgage.  The figures do not stack up.</p></speech>

A total of &euro;6,500 is paid in tax, &euro;1,500 on a service charge, &euro;300 for LPT and &euro;1,000 per year on the general repairs such as the washing machine going or for plumbers, electricians or whatever the case may be.</p></speech>

The mortgage at that level will be running at &euro;12,000, &euro;13,000 or &euro;14,000.  To state there are superprofits in rental is absurd and possibly is the reason we have this sort of anti-investor legislation coming through.  It is probably the reason we have the supply issue.  There is no return unless one has no mortgage in the buy-to-let sector.  Hence, we need tax breaks to resolve that &euro;6,500 hit that is there, on a property-by-property basis; reintroduction of 100% mortgage relief; and a special rate of income tax for rental of 20%.  All that is needed and one will find then that apartments and houses will come back to the market and people will stop selling.  Unless people face up to the reality that property owners need to be incentivised, as they do not do this and take on financial, tenant, and legal risk lightly, there will be no increase in supply and we will be sitting here this time next year with the same issues except that - members are correct - the homeless figures will have gone up and the number of properties available for rental will have gone down.  We will be sitting here wondering why that is the case, when we have been here time after time.  We met Deputy Jan O'Sullivan in her time as housing Minister, and we now have been before this committee on three occasions.  We have met the Minister for Finance and his representatives, as well as the Minister for the environment and his representatives, but nobody wants to listen because are no votes in landlords as there are not enough of them.  It is not populist to come out and say that one wants to incentivise property owners.  It is okay to incentivise Google, Facebook and every other business person in the country can get incentivisation, be it grants or whatever.  Landlords cannot, however, because it is not populist or a popular thing to do.  There are no votes in it and we all understand the reality of the situation.</p></speech>

I will speak first on our own figures.  In 2017 we saw that 38% of notices of termination brought to us were for the purposes of sale, 17% were for the landlord moving in, 12% were on the grounds of renovation and 8% were on arrears.  I will make a brief comment on arrears.  We were able to resolve the vast majority of arrears cases that were brought to us successfully for a tenant and landlord.  That indicates that there is a way of resolving this and making sure that neither tenant nor landlord lose out on their home or rental income, respectively.  On determining the reason for homelessness, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, has published some statistics on that in the last few years, indicating that about 50% of those presenting as homeless were coming from the private rented sector.  A further breakdown of the figures is not available but the information is there.  As the DRHE managed the pathway accommodation and support system, PASS, on behalf of all the local authorities, it is possible that it could extract the information.  That would come down to the local authorities entering the information on the PASS in a regimented manner but it certainly is possible to determine that.  In respect of the Bill proposed by the Government, we have suggested that all notices of termination be issued to the RTB, as well as the tenant.  This is one of the recommendations in the Rebuilding Ireland review.  The RTB itself could then monitor the reasons tenants are receiving these notices of termination.  As it stands, we do not have solid, reliable data.  Threshold can only comment on the tenants who come to us.  The IPOA can only comment on the landlords who come to it and so on.  Certainly either through the DRHE or the RTB, it is possible to start collating that information and making real decisions based on it.</p> <p>  In respect of profits and what is left to service the mortgage, as it stands, between 30% and 40% of rented properties are under a buy-to-let mortgage.  While I have the greatest sympathy for those landlords who are struggling to pay a mortgage, it is only about that percentage who are paying a mortgage.  Interest rates are at their lowest.  It is certainly not enough just to say they must pay their mortgage.  Ireland has one of the highest rental yields in Europe at present, second only to Cyprus. </p></speech>

It is a source of great frustration to a lot of students that there could be a house two minutes down the road from their own accommodation where the rent can only go up by 4%, yet rent for the purpose-built accommodation they live in can jump by 25% overnight.  With student villages releasing information now, there is no telling how many increases we will see before this legislation can be enacted.</p> <p>  I want to come in on a few points Deputy Jan O'Sullivan made which we did not address in our opening statement.  In respect of deposits, the one-month issue would be very welcome because in a lot of student accommodations, moieties have to be paid upfront.  That can be a massive chunk of money.  We also experience many issues with students not being able to get deposits back or being discriminated against for particular things.  For example, professional cleaning fees may be outlined but with no real evidence or justification given.  I also wish to express support for the dwelling-specific rent register.  As we mentioned, a lot of the information gathering to see the increases year on year has been left to student unions.  Our own data gathering shows that even four or five years ago, increases were about 3% per year but now all of a sudden we are seeing these massive jumps of 20%.  There is a lot of concern about a market that goes so unregulated.  It brings it up to the market standard and where does the market go from there?</p></speech>

I am accompanied by the director of the RTB, Ms Rosalind Carroll, and Ms Caren Gallagher, head of communications and research.  The Residential Tenancies Board is the primary body dedicated to regulating the rental sector in Ireland and one of the only bodies that works impartially with landlords and tenants.</p><p>Our core functions include replacing the courts for the majority of landlord and tenant disputes through our dispute resolution service.  We have a national system of tenancy registration and, increasingly, provide information, research and education.</p><p> The overall vision of the Residential Tenancies Board is for a well-functioning rental sector that is fair, accessible and beneficial to all.  However, we know that in the current market demand continues to grow at a time of restricted supply and access to accommodation is difficult for many tenants.  We also recognise that there are many people in very challenging and uncertain situations as a result of the ongoing supply and affordability issues.  Given the number of households that rent in Ireland, and will continue to do so into the future, we will need to continue to adapt the regulatory framework in a way that supports and serves both landlords and tenants in this evolving market.</p><p> Both Bills being discussed here today are about trying to improve the current situation in the rental sector.  The spirit of both recognises the need to strengthen security of tenure protections to meet the needs of a rental population that will rent homes for much longer periods than previous generations.  In terms of both timing and effectiveness, before considering further changes it is important to note the level of regulatory change that has already occurred and the current profile of the sector.</p><p> There have been a series of legislative changes introduced over the past number of years including the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act in 2015, another in 2016 and another Bill is currently before the Houses.  The original regulatory framework established in 2004 has grown and become more complex with each change to the point where most landlords and tenants do not understand their rights and responsibilities.  We believe that is the biggest threat to successful implementation of any further regulatory change.</p><p> The proposed new powers for the RTB under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill (No. 2) Bill 2018 will enable us to build on the protections in current legislation and allow us move to more proactive regulation of the sector.  However, we cannot rely on regulation alone to solve all the issues.  We must also protect existing supply and encourage future investment.</p><p> In this context, it is important to consider the current profile of the sector.  There are approximately 340,000 tenancies registered with the RTB, of which 307,000 are private rented tenancies.  The majority of landlords - just over 70% - own one property, with a further 16% owning two properties.  In our organisation we are starting to see evidence that the stock of rental properties is falling despite demand being at an all-time high.  Since 2017, the number of private rental tenancies has fallen from 313,000 to just over 307,000 at the end of 2018.  That is a significant reduction given the extreme demand pressures in the market at this time.</p><p> We cannot afford to risk further loss of stock in the sector as it is the most vulnerable tenants who are affected most by a lack of supply.  Given the degree of regulatory change introduced over the course of the past three to four years and what is proposed, there is a careful balance to allow the legislation to bed in and allow the RTB to exercise new regulatory powers, manage the transition properly and ensure that we do not worsen the situation, even with the best of intentions.</p><p> The Bills being introduced contain a wide range of measures covering: student accommodation; rent transparency and rent reviews; changes to security of tenure relating to section 34 and Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act; rent pressure zones; and deposits. It is our understanding that a number of areas are under consideration as amendments within the context of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018.</p><p> With regard to student accommodation, the RTB came before the committee last November to discuss this issue.  We support reform and clarity in this area given the increasing number of student specific accommodation that will be provided over the next number of years.  The RTB strongly believes that the vast majority of student accommodation does currently fall within our remit, whatever it is called, and we understand that the Minister is working to include further clarity on student accommodation in the proposed legislation.</p><p> In considering rent transparency, the proposed move to annual registration will ensure that landlords provide the RTB with up-to-date details on an annual basis, including correct rent amounts.  This will ensure better and smarter regulation and will support rent transparency measures.  It is our understanding that the Minister is working to establish if it is legally possible to provide for measures to ensure rent transparency in the sector.</p><p> In considering some of the other measures, it is useful to look at the applications for dispute resolution services coming to the RTB which tend to give an important insight into the sector.  In terms of the most common types of dispute we see on applications, 27% relate to rent arrears and overholding, 26% relate to invalid notice of termination, and 21% relate to deposit retention.  That trend has remained steady in recent years. </p><p> In 2017, we tried to drill down into the particular applications coming before us to see if we could give further clarification or information on the types of disputes.  We have found that there are a wide range of reasons notices of termination are being served.  The most common reason is rent arrears.  That is the biggest issue facing the sector.  Forty-four per cent of the notices served in 2017 were for rent arrears; 20% were served for the sale of the property; 8% were served because the landlord wished to move a member of their family or extended family into the dwelling; and 8% were served to allow for substantial renovations.</p><p> There have been a number of legislative changes to enhance security of tenure in recent years and the RTB supports further strengthening in this area.  However, there are legal considerations and at this point, given the data that exists relating to supply in the sector and notices of termination, we need a careful balance and a strong evidence base to support further regulatory change.</p><p> In respect of rent pressure zones and the criteria that apply, the RTB has fed into the considerations by the Department.  It is important to balance any potential impact on supply, particularly where rents are lower than the cost of provision.  The RTB rent index, produced in conjunction with the ESRI, provides data on rental indices across the country down to local electoral area.  The quarterly report shows the degree of variation across the country in both growth rates and standardised average rents, which is significant, with some areas having an average rent of &euro;470.</p><p> Outside of rent pressure zones, there are rent certainty measures in place whereby landlords can only review the rent once in a 24-month period and cannot set a rent in excess of market rent.  There are existing protections for tenants and the RTB believes that with the additional new powers and a more proactive regulatory framework where we can go into a property and assess it, landlords and tenants can be supported on a pathway to compliance.  It is important to allow for the new powers to be established and tested.</p><p> When considering the range of other measures proposed, the case outcomes and RTB experience are useful to consider, such as the practice and outcomes in respect of deposits.  In 2017, 92% of deposits were partially or fully refunded to tenants who took a case to the RTB.  We do not see evidence in our data of a trend whereby landlords are seeking deposits of more than one month's rent.</p><p> The RTB will soon have more effective powers that will change the nature of how we regulate the sector.  Critically, the new civil sanctions regime allows for a proportionate response from a caution all the way up to a sanction of &euro;15,000 for potential breaches of the law.  These powers will make the regulatory framework more impactful and effective.  However, regulation alone will not resolve the current issues in the sector.</p><p> When considering further regulatory measures in the market, equally, there is a need ensure there is quicker and more effective access to justice when something goes wrong in a tenancy.  We also need to ensure that we are doing more to promote supply and encourage further investment.</p><p> The proposed new powers for the RTB under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018 are a significant change for the RTB as an organisation and for the rental sector.  We hope that many of the measures will address the issues in the sector and that the legislation will enable more effective, proportionate and smarter regulation.  We are focused on the successful and smooth implementation of the proposed legislation for both landlords and tenants in what is an extremely complex and bureaucratic regulatory framework.  This will take time.  The RTB is committed to supporting all those involved in the sector, whether they are landlords or tenants, on pathways to compliance.</p><p> Given the wide range of issues in the Bills, we have focused on some elements of both but welcome the opportunity to discuss further with the committee any issues arising.  I hope we can assist in that regard.</p></speech>

The RTB gave us some statistics there around deposit retention, for example, rent arrears and the percentage of cases that deal with particular issues.  If I heard the witnesses correctly on deposit retention, the RTB said that 92% of cases returned some element of the deposit.  Do the witnesses have statistics on the success or otherwise of the various cases?  In other words, if there are cases of rent arrears or cases of eviction on grounds of sale or termination on grounds of sale, to use the correct terminology, the statistics on same would be useful because earlier on we talked about not having accurate data on a lot of the issues. </p> <p>  I refer to the complexity of the regulations.  When I was speaking on the Minister's Bill, I said that it might be better to just totally rewrite the whole Bill because it is quite complex for Members trying to deal with the amendments to amendments of Bills and so on.  That is just a comment.</p> <p>  Maybe the RTB cannot comment on this but one of the matters that came up at the last session was a suggestion that it was very onerous to be a landlord in terms of the various costs involved.  I do not know whether the RTB can answer that but it would be useful to know what the witnesses think because they started off by saying the RTB was impartial between the landlord and the tenant.  Do the witnesses have any evidence or information on those claims that if any further impositions are put on landlords they will simply not be able to cope with the financial pressures?  It would be interesting to get a perspective on that.</p></speech>

I know that most of the RTB's dealings are between tenants and landlords and there is a proposal here around the receivers and the banks.  How would the RTB see that sort of an engagement?  I am curious how that would work and I can understand the reason for it being here because we are obviously encountering this more and more.  Can the RTB fill us in on that?  It is interesting that an awful lot of the cases that we get, as the witnesses probably heard, are people who come to us about sale of property and about the landlords.  How does the RTB find it to deal with landlords?  Does the RTB discover that some of them are possibly selling to reconnect with another tenant etc.?  Does the RTB find that this is out there?  We certainly find it out there in our clinics and some landlords are just saying they are selling.  We need to get to the bottom of the issue of the definition of a family member, which is very well needed, because this is being used so much.  How much of an advantage would having a proper register give the RTB?</p> <p>  On landlords who are not registered, does the RTB deal with that situation much?  As far as I can see, it is not very common but we have had issues with people who have not been registered as landlords.</p></speech>

Our statistic on the deposit retention scheme is 92% as the Deputy said.  As an organisation, previously we only had the statistics on what was coming into us but not what was found beneath that.  We often see applications coming in and people will tick every box because they are afraid of not ticking a box.  Therefore, applications are not really a good demonstration of what the actual dispute underneath it all might be.  As much as we can, where we get to a hearing, we have started to find out what the issue was and what the result of that was.  We have specifically looked at notices of termination and we have been looking at that data since 2017 for the first time.  From that, we found that where notices of termination are served for rent arrears, 78% of them are found to be valid.  Where notices are served for sale, only 50% of them are found to be valid.  Where they are served for a landlord requiring them for their use or for their family members, 48% of them are found to be valid.  We can share this information with members afterwards.  For substantial refurbishments, 74% are found to be invalid.  I know that both of the members have made proposals on the refurbishment issue, but I would say that where cases are coming before us, the law that is there does work.  This question of getting people to come forward with cases has shown that many of the cases are found to be invalid when they come through and they do not meet the threshold of substantial refurbishment in the type of cases that are coming before us.  As I said, we are happy to share those statistics.  We are collating our 2018 statistics and they will be available within the next few weeks and we can get those to the committee as well.</p> <p>  On the complexity of the Bill, we feel that is one of the biggest issues with regulating the sector because people simply do not know what they should be doing.  Every time we bring in a new law, what normally happens is that we get more non-compliance.  I would say there are different categories of landlords and tenants out there.  There are people who knowingly do not comply and then there are people who are just not getting it right and we are trying to support the people who are trying to get it right.  In terms of the sanctions, hopefully the new legislation will give us the power, a bit like they have in the Revenue framework.  In that framework, Revenue works with the people who are trying to comply but if people do not engage they are treated in a much harsher fashion.  It gives us a whole new framework in which we can deliver.  Having said that, the Bill that is coming before us is still adding complexity; we would also like to see a new Bill but there is a balance between how we just get something in place now to deal with some of the non-compliance around rent pressure zones and so on.  If we start rewriting it I suspect it would be another two or three years before we get anything moving on it.  The balance between all of this is that at this point, we would like to just get some of this legislation in place and for us to get some of the new powers.</p> <p>  In many circumstances in the current market it is onerous to be a tenant and it is onerous to be a landlord.  What I would be very keen on from our perspective, is for everyone to have an awareness that we need a diversity of our landlords.  The smaller landlords in Ireland have played an important part in price control because small landlords have personal relationships with their tenants and they often do not charge the maximum rent.  As they get to know their tenants over time, they might take account that there might be a communion on or whatever event happens to be taking place and they have a personal relationship so for me, we need to make sure that whatever frameworks we put in place allow for that diversity over time.  At the moment we have that diversity but it is starting to change in some areas.</p></speech>

With any body, there comes a saturation point in terms of regulation.  The sector can only be regulated so much before it reaches saturation point and people say they are not bothered with this anymore and it is too much for them.  We need to support both the landlords and the tenants and in terms of the landlords, there is an awful lot they need to comply with.  There is a lot the tenants need to comply with as well and they are on the hard end of the stick in the relationship between landlords and tenants.  We need to try to support both parties in the sector.  They are both a crucial part of it and the more successful their relationship, the more successful the sector.</p></speech>

We had 319,000 units in 2016 on the private rental side and we are now down to 307,000, which is a concern for us.  While we would support further security of tenure measures, we would like to see them coupled with some reforms on the supply side to ensure that we do not lose that diversity that I just spoke about.</p><p>Security of tenure is not an issue for institutional investors.  They will have no problem with sale, and they will sell with tenants <i>in situ</i>.  There is the risk that this would impact on the more vulnerable.  In terms of security of tenure, one of the concerns I have is that landlords may then start to pick what they think would be short-term tenants, for example, students or people without family - people landlords think are more transient in the market.  I would be concerned landlords might discriminate against certain elements of the market to give themselves room to be able to sell openly on the market.  At the moment, there is a significant valuation issue.  We have had cases come before us involving the Tyrrelstown amendment that came in during the time of the last legislation.  In respect of that, evidence was provided of a 28% fall in the value of a home when sold with a tenant <i>in situ</i>.  We have also liaised with some of the financial institutions to get an idea of where we are with valuations within that framework.  It ranges from between 20% and 30% in terms of the impact of selling with a tenant <i>in situ</i>.  We would like to normalise that so that we can get to a point where we can have that security of tenure with a sale with a tenant <i>in situ</i>.  <br/><br/>I know everybody is pressurised for time.  I will deal with Deputy Ellis's questions about receivers and banks.  Yes, there are more and more receivers in the market.  We probably have more clarity than we would have had a few years ago in terms of this.  Officials from the RTB have been on interdepartmental working groups to work on this issue.  A receiver has an obligation to ensure the maintenance of the dwelling is kept up during the receivership period.  It is not explicitly stated in the legislation.  What is explicit in the legislation is that the tenant has a right of offset if the maintenance is not carried out.  </p></speech>

What cannot be provided for legally, even if there is a change in legislation, is the issue of deposit, which comes up a lot, because the deposit was paid to the landlord.  It is never paid to the receiver and, therefore, the tenant will never be able to get back his or her deposit.  The only person from which the tenant can get his or her deposit back is the landlord.  We cannot retrospectively change that within the legislative framework.</p></speech>

We are not in favour of a deposit protection scheme but as an organisation that has been given a significant amount of change to implement, I have had to advise the Minister that we simply could not implement all of the regulatory change and the deposit protection scheme at the same time.  The deposit protection scheme would mean we would administer &euro;300 million worth of deposits.  Because there are so many other pressures within the market, we need to prioritise the ones we are going to address.  Because cases involving deposits coming before us are being dealt with well, people who are afraid should come to us.  If somebody takes a case, it proves worthwhile. There are people in rent pressure zones who are afraid to take a dispute to us because they fear there will be action by a landlord.</p></speech>

Otherwise, it would not be great for tenants.</p></speech>

Obviously, landlords may be in financial difficulties themselves and be unable to pay over the money but because the receiver has never received that money, he or she has no accountability for it.  I do not believe we would be able to overcome that even within a legal framework of legislation, but that is a matter for the Attorney General as opposed to us.  That is just our interpretation of the issue.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the definition of family member.  We agree that the definition of family member could be tightened up within the Act.  Nephews and nieces are included at the moment.  We could certainly look at that.  A question was asked about whether people were truly selling their properties.  In many cases people are selling their properties but since the introduction of rent pressure zones, we have seen more cases where people have not gone through with the sale.  That is related to the figures about which I spoke, where 48% were found to be valid while 52% were found to be invalid.  In those cases, tenants have a right to come forward to us.  There is penalisation within the Act and tenants can apply to us for damages.  That is not necessarily going to get them back their homes, which is really at the heart of what we are talking about here.  We are working with the Department and the Minister's officials to see whether there is more we can do around this issue in terms of potential sanctions.  </p> <p>  In respect of the rent transparency piece and the public register, again, we are very supportive of that.  Hopefully, the Attorney General will give it the go ahead.  We would certainly hope to facilitate that and the annual registration which, again, we brought through to the committee, gives the data and allows us to publish it.  </p> <p>  A question was asked about registration of landlords and how we see that in terms of enforcement.  Last year, and the previous year, we sent out approximately 15,000 letters to landlords where we thought there might have been some level of non-compliance.  In general, once that letter goes out, we get compliance straightaway.  At the moment, we are quite limited as an organisation.  All of our data sharing is with State bodies so that means it is more to do with people in receipt of rent supplement, HAP or RAS.  Visibility in terms of the private market outside of that is very difficult.  We do not have investigative powers.  One of the things the new Bill will give us is investigative powers, which means our ability as an organisation to actually pursue non-compliance will be greatly enhanced.  That is one of the measures that will help.  </p></speech>

I thank the witnesses from the RTB for coming before us for a second time in a fortnight.  If the Minister has his way, they might be in again in a fortnight or three weeks' time.  This is an area of significant concern to everybody around the table.  The committee has given the Government a commitment that we will work with it with regard to its Bill.  While we would all like our own Bill to go through, the political reality is that the only Bill that will actually get across the line is probably the Minister's Bill.  It is in all our interests to work with the Minister and we did so in private session last week.  I thank the witnesses for appearing before us today and I apologise for the delay.  We could probably spend another hour with them but we just do not have that time today.  I thank the representatives from the RTB for attending today and engaging with the committee.</p></speech>

My statement will focus on two of the issues which were suggested for discussion, namely, the obligation to ascertain the views of children and the structure of the court system.  As I will explain, I consider these two issues closely connected.  As a question of policy, the obligation to ascertain the views of children during family law proceedings has been settled.  It is a matter of international human rights law to which Ireland has subscribed and a matter of Irish constitutional law.</p><p>Article 42A of the Constitution requires that in family law cases the views of all children who are capable of forming views shall be ascertained and given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child.  That initial question has been settled.  However, Article 42A is not self-executing; its implementation is dependent on legislation.  Unfortunately, since Article 42A came into effect in 2015, the legislative response of the Oireachtas has been rather timid.  Article 42A is mandatory.  It requires that every child who is capable of forming views shall have his or her views ascertained in family law proceedings.  However, when we look at the family law legislation which implements it, we have an uneven and patchwork approach to the question of whether children get to participate in family law proceedings.  Different rules are applicable in different family law cases and they often afford significant discretion to courts in deciding whether to ascertain the views of children.  Essentially, whether a child is afforded the opportunity to be heard depends on what the case is about, where it is being heard, which judge is hearing it and who is paying the costs.  That is a far cry from what the Constitution states should happen.  In my written submission I itemise the form that this difficulty takes in various areas, including child protection cases, private family law cases, international child abduction cases and adoption cases.  The issues revolve around the question of how much discretion courts have to decide whether they should hear from children, as well as the question of who pays the cost in appointing a guardian <i>ad litem</i>or expert to convey the views of the child.<br/><br/>It is clear that we need to engage in significant legislative reform across the wide spectrum of family law cases to ensure the legislative provisions match the constitutional obligation in Article 42A.  While legislative reform is a necessary step, alone it is not sufficient.  Another significant obstacle to effective child participation is the lack of child-friendliness in the courts.  We have significant evidence, some of which I cite in my written submission, that the environment in the courts is not child friendly and acts as a significant barrier to child participation.  Legislative reform on the mechanisms used to hear children is likely to encounter an implementation gap, unless we also address the structure of the courts.  There have been multiple calls for the establishment of specialist family courts in Ireland for a long time now, dating back to a detailed Law Reform Commission report in 1996.  The commission identified multiple problems related to inadequate physical facilities, the absence of specially trained judges, the inconsistency between courts in decision-making and excessive caseloads.  The commission made a series of recommendations which, in their totality, moved in the direction of establishing specialist family courts.  The recommendations have not been implemented and in the years since there have been multiple calls for their implementation, including by the Law Society of Ireland, the Government's special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, Dr. Carol Coulter and the Child Care Law Reporting Project and the UCC child care proceedings research group, of which I was a member.<br/><br/>More broadly, the trend in Europe is towards specialisation in the area of family law among judges and courts.  Separation is not so much the key; rather, specialisation is.  Having a separate court does not work, unless there is also specialisation among judges and staff within that court.  We have evidence from Australia which illustrates that if family courts are staffed by judges who are not specially trained in child and family law, their effectiveness is limited.  Conversely, however, there does need to be separation in that the scope of what can be achieved within the general court system is somewhat limited.  Judges who also deal with other kinds of case are not incentivised to significantly up-skill in the area of child and family law.  In many jurisdictions child and family law has a history of being the poor relation when it comes to resource allocation in respect of court time, physical facilities and so on.  Separation is also important in that respect.  Some issues would need to be considered in achieving this outside major population centres.  It is easier to do it in Dublin or Cork than in rural areas.  There are models from other jurisdictions such as Queensland where a mix of regional centres has been established and there are travelling judges.  There are references to it in my written submission.  <br/><br/>The final point I wish to make is that the establishment of a specialist family court does not require a constitutional amendment, as has been suggested on various occasions.  The designation of the District Court as the Children Court for dealing with juvenile justice matters under the Children Act 2001, as well as other examples, make it clear that it is possible to do this by way of ordinary legislation which could specify the characteristics of a specialist court.  <br/><br/>There is more detail on all of these points in my written submission.  I will be very happy to take questions later.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.609" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Keith Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#D00300"><p>I will lead off and our vice chairperson, Ms Helen Coughlan, will then come in with a couple of practical examples.  The Law Society of Ireland welcomes the opportunity to add its voice to the calls for reform and to contribute positively towards it.  Everybody is more or less agreed that the current family law system is broken and not working properly and that we need to reform it immediately.  There seems to be a great degree of unanimity about having a specialist, not separate, cadre or division of the courts to deal with family law cases.  The Law Society of Ireland set out what we believe should happen in our detailed 2014 paper and our submission today.  None of this is news to anybody here or anyone involved in family law.  All of the groups represented here have been calling for action for almost 20 years, since the Law Reform Commission published its report on the family law courts.</p> <p>  The first thing we want to raise is the issue arising from the problems with security on 20 December in the Dublin Circuit Family Law court.  Somebody was able to compromise the security of a courtroom and there were issues arising.  That highlighted the complete inadequacy of the Dublin Circuit Family Law Court.  There is also a significant issue with the childcare courts in the old Bridewell, our Victorian criminal courts.  Parents and children who are attending public law cases, where Tusla is bringing an application to have a child taken into care, have to go to a Victorian prison where the acoustics make it very difficult to hear and the environment and atmosphere are completely unsuitable for adults and, even more so, children, should they be present.  The physical premises of the courts need to change, as does the structure of the courts.  The Law Society of Ireland agrees that if the specialist court system proposed was taken up, it would not require a constitutional referendum to be held.  </p> <p>  The other issue the Law Society of Ireland has is with the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 which gave effect to the change to Article 42A of the Constitution.  It was greatly welcomed by the Law Society of Ireland and is being implemented by our members in the District Court and the Circuit Court throughout the country.  The difficulty is that no resources were allocated to give effect to hearing the voice of the child.  We have Rolls Royce legislation with no resources attached to it.  District Court judges are attempting to hear the voice of the child without the assistance of any expert and without any great funding from the Courts Service.  A recent regulation, about which the Law Society of Ireland has a concern, fixes the cost of an expert report on hearing the voice and welfare of the child under section 32 of the 2015 Act at &euro;250 or &euro;300.  That will mean that experts will not produce these reports.  They typically involve at least four visits to the family and the parents to determine what will happen.  As the person who produces a report will be cross-examined in court, there may also be attendance at court and, in addition, the expert will have to produce the report, into which at least 20 hours will have to go.  People will not do that.  The current system is that judges in the District Court may hear the voice of the child in person.</p><p>The facilities for that are completely inadequate.  The training is on a patchwork basis.  It also means that the judges are taken from their normal work.  From a resource point of view, therefore, it is not efficient at all.</p><p> The Law Society states that a specialist division of family law courts and judges would greatly assist in dealing with family law cases more efficiently as it would be likely that the same judges would be available to deal with cases which appear regularly before the courts and a greater degree of consistency would be established.  It has been noted elsewhere that judges should not be confined to this speciality but should be general judges who could be assigned to family law but would not necessarily spend all their judicial career in family law.  However, they would have to be trained and spend sufficient time there as well.</p><p> More focus should be placed on settling cases earlier in the process.  Obviously, an exception is domestic violence where cases may not able to be settled or may not be suitable for alternative dispute resolution, ADR.  Active intervention in family law cases by judges, not by county registrars who are currently the court officials who deal with it or other officials, with an emphasis on resolution in ADR could result in significant savings of time resources for all concerned.  ADR obviously happens before people get to court as well because of the new Mediation Act and the provisions in the Family Law (Divorce) Act.</p><p> The Legal Aid Board appears to be chronically underfunded.  It is not economically possible for solicitors to make a living from the private practitioner scheme relating to the Legal Aid Board.  That has led to a flight of solicitors from the District Court where it currently operates.</p><p> One of the questions we were asked was about a dedicated court system and whether it would remedy the issues.  A dedicated family law court structure throughout the country would fix many of the problems at present, but only if it was properly resourced.  The family law court system must be integrated with ADR and the Legal Aid Board would have to be involved, with the courthouses providing facilities not only for courts but also for ADR and the Legal Aid Board.  Proper premises would have to be provided in the family law courts.  If it was simply a case of creating a family law division within existing structures, a referendum would not be required.  Equally, changes to the District Court and Circuit Court would require some consideration.  We have proposed alternatives to this model but from a practical point of view and to move this forward, given the consensus regarding the specialist courts, we fully support the calls for a specialist court and would like to see that implemented sooner rather than later.</p><p> The issue of costs also arises and we have set out our views in that regard.  The best way to deal with the issue of costs and whether cost orders could be used to punish bad behaviour is to encourage settlement at every opportunity, increase the case management and have a cost order potentially as a punishment for those who insist on going ahead with their cases when a very fair offer has been made by the other side and they are unlikely to do better in court.  However, where people persist in proceeding, which uses up valuable court time and increases costs on both sides, there should be some sanction available to the court.  There is something called a Calderbank letter which effectively means that one sets out one's position in writing, and that can be used subsequently for an order for costs.  That should be considered but it should be done on a case-by-case basis.</p><p> We again call for consistent judicial supervision of cases to ensure that alternative dispute resolution is considered before one goes to court and, when one goes to court, at the start of the court process and at every stage along the court process so it is dealt with by a judge and there is more active case management.  We believe that would be a far more efficient use of resources and would also lead to cases being resolved much earlier for the parties in the majority of cases.  Some cases are simply too acute to settle, but very active judicial case management would work.</p><p> Legal aid has not kept abreast of developments in the complexity of the law, the needs of the clients or what is involved to defend and represent a client.  The resourcing of legal aid is very important.</p><p> My final point on behalf of the Law Society relates to the rights of fathers.  The Law Society family and child law committee is composed of people who do this work every day of the week and are in a variety of courts.  We represent the solicitors who act for parents whose children may be taken into care, people who act for the health board and people who deal with divorce and separation every day in the District Court.  We have a wide variety of people who are in the courts.  We have seen that the current access model does not necessarily work, particularly for fathers and definitely not for children.  We probably need to do some research on how access currently works in the court.  The model of every second weekend with an overnight on a Wednesday is perhaps the standard default access for fathers in many cases.  Where there are accommodation problems, particularly in Dublin, access is a genuine issue and real hardship is caused for children and families as a result.</p><p> In summary, there should be action on this.  There has been plenty of discussion up to now, but a change is needed.  The change can be introduced by legislation, but legislation alone is no good.  There must be resources to back up whatever changes are made.  Ms Coughlan will deal with some practical examples of the problems.</p></speech>

I work as a family law solicitor in Kildare.  If somebody comes to see me today seeking maintenance or access, I will submit an application to the court.  It will be four months before that application will first come before the court.  It goes before the court for mention only so unless it has been resolved it will then be put into a further list a further four months down the road.  For the person who comes to see me today, it could conceivably be October before that matter is adjudicated in court.  That is the situation in Kildare.  There are similar delays elsewhere.  According to the Courts Service, in Letterkenny one would be waiting 13 weeks, in Carlow it would be 12 weeks, six to eight weeks in Wexford and four weeks in Dundalk.  Those figures are from 2017 and I have not seen more up-to-date figures.</p> <p>  That is the case if one has the resources to go to a private practitioner.  If one is going to the Legal Aid Board, before one can get one's application off the ground one will face delays in even seeing a solicitor for the first consultation.  For example, in Blanchardstown there is currently a 44-week delay before one will see a solicitor.  If one is in Ennis, the delay is 21 weeks, it is eight weeks in Wexford and 17 weeks in Wicklow.  That is before one even gets one's application into court.  It is to see a solicitor initially to get advice.</p> <p>  There is a very serious issue in terms of access to justice.  In practical terms those delays mean that parents may not be seeing their children and they might not be getting suitable financial resources for their children.  Mr. Walsh mentioned childcare and the facilities in Chancery Street.  Childcare cases are heard in Chancery Street at present.  This was the old Bridewell.  Hearings where the most vulnerable people are before the court, where their children will be taken into care by the State, are downstairs in what is equivalent to what the dungeons were.  That is where the family law childcare cases are heard at present.  We are not serving the most vulnerable in society with the facilities we have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.613" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Saoirse Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#E00400"><p>We thank the committee for the opportunity to attend this meeting.  This is a very timely hearing to examine family law matters given the recent reforms that have taken place and the urgent need for further reform.  We will probably echo much of what our other colleagues have already stated.</p> <p>  The Children's Rights Alliance unites over 100 members who work together to make Ireland one of the best places in the world in which to be a child.  We change the lives of all children by ensuring that their rights are respected and protected in our laws, policies and services.  We also provide legal information and advice to children, young people and their families through our newly established legal information line.  We offer legal advice outreach clinics nationwide.  That will inform some of what we have to say today.</p> <p>  Like Dr. O'Mahony, we will focus on two key aspects.</p><p>These are the role of children in family law proceedings, particularly with regard to the voice of the child, and the need to reform the family law court structures to meet, in particular, the needs of children and young people.  The family law courts have not been designed to meet the needs of children and families, who are often embroiled in difficult family law disputes.  The physical environment does not provide them with the necessary space and privacy to deal with very sensitive private family matters.  Judges are making decisions in courts about intimate family law issues in the same rooms in which they hear cases relating to, for example, driving offences.  Despite the fact that most proceedings involving children are subject to the <i>in camera </i>rule, we have heard from lawyers about the lack of privacy in court settings.  They are giving legal advice in stairwells and corridors and not in private consultation rooms, never mind child-friendly consultation rooms.  Children who are present in the courts often witness disturbing, upsetting or even violent behaviour.  That needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>Guidance is available on how we can adapt our structures to make them more child-friendly.  The Council of Europe has issued child-friendly justice guidelines.  These provide that states should ensure that any proceedings involving children are dealt with in &quot;non-intimidating and child-sensitive settings&quot;.  They call for interviewing and waiting rooms for children &quot;in a child-friendly environment&quot; be provided in court settings.  They say that children should be familiarised with the court setting, the layout and the roles and identities of officials ahead of the actual proceedings so that they know what is going on and understand what is happening.  They also advise that court sessions involving children should be adapted to the child&rsquo;s pace and attention span, with planned regular breaks and hearings that are limited in duration so that children can properly participate.<br/><br/>As a priority, we recommend the development of suitable accommodation for children and young people in the courts.  A key aspect of this will be progressing Hammond Lane and the dedicated children and family courts that we have been promised for so long.  All stakeholders should be consulted in developing and designing the new family courts, including legal professionals, families and those who work to support them.  Most importantly, children and young people should also be consulted.  This has happened previously in the context of the development of the children&rsquo;s court in Smithfield.  Other experts should be brought in.  For example, Barnardos was invited to help to design the child-friendly spaces in the Criminal Courts of Justice.  We recommend that this be done in this instance as well.<br/><br/>As Dr. O'Mahony stated, most child and family law cases are heard by generalist judges in the general courts system.  However, specialised family or children&rsquo;s court systems are commonplace across Europe and in other common-law jurisdictions where in which there are specially designed court facilities and the member of the judiciary and lawyers have specialised training.  We have also seen good examples elsewhere.  In the UK, Mr. Justice Peter Jackson wrote a letter in accessible language to a 14-year-old in a custody case.  It was so unique that it made news headlines.  He also wrote a judgment in emojis to help very young children understand what was going to happen to them in a way they found accessible.  We think we could look to some of these examples and try to adapt them here.  In the context of any family law reform, we recommend specialised training for all professionals working in the family law courts.  This should reflect child-friendly justice principles.  We need to train judges, lawyers and everybody involved in family law proceedings in order that they will know how to communicate effectively with children and young people.  I invite my colleague, Ms Ahern, to talk about the role of children in proceedings a bit further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.615" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Julie Ahern" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#F00200"><p>In addressing the role of children in proceedings, I will focus on two key issues.  First, I will talk about the voice of the child in family law proceedings and, second, I am comment on the provision of information to children and families.</p> <p>  The right the child to be heard is one of the fundamental values of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The child-friendly justice guidelines Ms Brady mentioned also provide that judges should respect the views of children and their right to be heard in all matters affecting them.  Importantly, they also recommend that children should be consulted about the manner in which they would like to be heard.  It should not just be assumed that children should be heard in one particular manner.  Rather, children should be asked how they would like to have their voices heard.  The guidelines also provide that children should not be presumed to be unable to give their views based solely on their age.  In fact, we should look at children's level of maturity and understanding.  Everyone in the room will know two 12 year olds who would be very different in their understanding of what is going on in life and in any particular situation.  It is important that we look at the individual child and not make a blanket assumption of someone's capacity based on their age.</p> <p>  Dr. O'Mahony has very kindly outlined the legal position on hearing the voices of children.  We want to highlight the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  For the first time, this Act placed an obligation on judges to hear the views of children when determining the best interests of the child.  It is very important to remember that the Act is not prescriptive about the way in which children's voices are to be heard.  There are a variety of ways in which children's voices are currently heard and can be heard.  This can include judges hearing them in chambers, hearing them in open court if appropriate, and if needs be bringing in an expert to help the court elicit children's views.  We note that in his recent report as special rapporteur on child protection Dr. Geoffrey Shannon recommended the development of guidelines on how judges can interact with children and young people in family law cases.</p> <p>  On our legal information line, I hear directly from children, young people and their families who feel their views are not being adequately heard in the family law system.  I get calls from children and from mothers and fathers who feel the courts are not listening to what children have to say when they come into court.  Similar to the Law Society of Ireland, the Children's Rights Alliance is very concerned about some of the provisions of the regulations on child's views experts.  In particular, we are very concerned that the regulations place a burden on families to pay for the experts to hear the views of children.  As this plays out, families who can afford to employ a child's views expert will have their voices heard.  Children whose families cannot afford it will not.  The right of the child will be dependent on their parents' ability to pay.  We echo the view of the Law Society to the effect that the cap placed on the number of child's views experts is incredibly low.  In very complex cases, no experts are willing to take on the role.  We are extremely concerned about this because children in the most vulnerable situations may not have their right to be heard vindicated.</p> <p>  The second point I wish to make relates to information provided to children and families.  I hear every day from children and families that they do not understand the nature of the process in family law courts.  They do not know what to expect or what is going on.  They want information about their rights, how to go into the court and how to navigate the process.  They want basic information to assist them in going into what is a really unfamiliar and scary environment, particularly for a child or a young person who has never walked into a courtroom before.  The Council of Europe&rsquo;s guidelines on child-friendly justice have been very helpful in setting out what information should be provided to children.  This should include information on their rights, the system and how it works, what their role will be and the available support mechanisms.  The last point in particular is very important.  If children, young people and families are supported, they will hopefully find the process a lot easier to navigate and much less traumatic. </p> <p>  Consideration could be given to providing information to children and families in a format that is child-friendly and adapted to the needs of the families and the age and maturity of the child.  Consideration should also be given to employing digital technology and making the information widely accessible.  While there is some very good information out there, I find that families and particularly children want to get information from someone they know and trust.  Alternatively, they look online.  A quick Google search for information about how the family law process works produces results that are very difficult to understand.  As someone working in the area even I wonder what it is meant to mean.  It is very important that it is very accessible and that people can find it in their own right.  It must also be there for people who work with families to guide them through the process.</p> <p>  Another method of providing support is the employment of specialist child court liaison officers.  This person would be an official who children and families could go to for information.  He or she would be there to support them in the really difficult process of going through the family law courts.  We recommend considering this as part of any proposed change to the family law system.  We recommend in particular the prioritisation of information for children and young people.</p></speech>

RCNI recognises the expert and detailed consideration given to the issues of interest to this committee by our peers today and in the last 12 months.  I refer in particular to the Garda Inspectorate report, the Child Care Law Reporting Project, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the special rapporteur on child protection.</p><p>Rather than repeat them, I will focus on RCNI&rsquo;s particular area of expertise and specialist concern, sexual violence and in this context, the child victims of familial sexual violence and incest.  We have three priorities, the first of which is the establishment of a specialist family court, as our peers have also advocated.  Our second priority is transparency and accountability of our child protection system including the family law system, while the third is the development of a national strategy on child sexual violence.<br/><br/>Child sexual violence is a crime, not just a civil matter.  However, in cases of child sexual violence and incest, the criminal justice system often fails and the protection of these children can become the subject of the family law courts, both publicly and privately.  Tusla receives approximately 3,000 child sexual violence referrals  per annum, although the number of children concerned will be fewer.  I invite the committee to consider what happens to these 3,000 reports.  International in-depth studies of disclosures, from whatever source, of sexual violence committed against children allow us to state that we can expect some false allegations at a rate of approximately 2% to 8%, with the lowest rate of false allegations being detected for the child who discloses themselves.  In accordance with the law and protocols, all cases are notified to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Difficulties with these protocols are detailed in the specialist reports cited in the footnotes and are part of the implementation plan arising, in particular, from the Garda Inspectorate report but I do not propose to dwell on those matters here.<br/><br/>According to the Garda Inspectorate, for these cases there is a 4% prosecution rate, with less than 2% resulting in criminal convictions.  Therefore, our criminal justice failure rate in reported and true child sexual violence is between 90% and 96%.  For these children, risk needs to be managed and they need protection regardless of the absence of a criminal conviction.  The protection of these children is one of the complex tasks we expect families and communities to undertake informally and which the legislature has mandated Tusla to undertake formally on all our behalf.  In the course of this work, Tusla relies on the family law courts for some of its actions such as applications for care orders.  In addition, these cases arise in private family law because for many child victims, the family is not a safe place and is the location of harm.<br/><br/>The inspectorate's report, published in December 2017, shows that in 44% of child sexual violence cases the alleged perpetrator was a family member.  When we look at different age cohorts within childhood, which the RCNI did in our national statistics report of 2015, we see that in 62% of all cases of child sexual violence against children younger than 13, they were reported as perpetrated by family members.  Where a child discloses incest, some but not all cases will result in the family breaking up.  This can be expected to be a highly acrimonious situation<b></b>which is likely to escalate into the private family courts.  This means that we can expect that a significant proportion of family separation and child custody cases going through our family courts involve the rape and sexual abuse of children by family members in the absence of a parallel criminal conviction.<br/><br/>The family court service processes on average 11,600 cases involving guardianship, custody and access matters.  The Child Care Law Reporting Project and the Legal Aid Board have tried to estimate how many of these involve child sexual violence.  RCNI believes this figure should not be a matter of a guesstimate.  It  should be possible, if novel, for our court services to gather and release statistics on how many private family law cases involve allegations of child sexual violence. <b></b>We recommend that the Courts Service gathers and publishes this information regularly as an imperative matter of justice and public interest.  Our family courts are handling highly criminal matters of the most sensitive and urgent child protection nature in unknown numbers, without criminal authority, without the appropriate tools and in the absence of appropriate specialisation.  RCNI advocates strongly for a special family law court which addresses these concerns.  Such a court was recommended in 1996 by the Law Reform Commission, and since then by the child rapporteur and the Child Care Law Reporting Project among others.  It is long overdue.<br/><br/>As noted by the committee, family court hearings are held <i>in camera</i>.  This means that apart from the very welcome Child Care Law Reporting Project and the work of the rapporteur, there is little by way of gathering and collating of data to allow for accountability and reassurance.  A thorough review of how the <i>in camera</i>rule impacts on transparency and accountability should be considered.  In addition to the <i>in camera</i>rule, confidentiality and non-disclosure clauses imposed on parties in the family courts do sometimes occur, whereby the court rules, among other things, that a child&rsquo;s disclosures of rape and sexual violence must not be reported directly to the State&rsquo;s investigative authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but must be mediated through appointed individuals or Tusla who will decide when a child&rsquo;s voice can be heard by our mandated criminal justice investigative authorities.  There is no data or analysis generated by the courts services or Tusla to make publicly transparent how many children and their guardians are bound by civil court ordered, non-disclosure clauses.  While we recognise the complexity of the cases we would recommend that achieving greater transparency on these matters through Courts Service data is a minimum for the discharge of oversight when such grave matters are at issue.<br/><br/>Finally, we recommend that this committee adds its voice to the call for an urgent child sexual violence national strategy<b></b>that would ensure that the child victim of rape, and most particularly of incest, does not continue to be at risk of falling through the cracks.  Until we increase our family courts and allied child protection structures transparency and accountability and specialisation, children and their voice will remain disturbingly silent.</p></speech>

I wish to make them aware of the process involved here.  We are going to produce a report but, obviously, this is an area of some complexity, which is why we need outside expertise to assist us in preparing that report.  There is a lot of agreement between the witnesses here on some fundamental areas.  However, it is also worth pointing out that family law is legitimately regarded as different to the determination and resolution of other disputes.  Other disputes which are before the courts can affect one part of a person's rights or life but family law disputes seem to involve orders being made by the courts which fundamentally affect the personal relationships that somebody has in their lives.  It is of unique importance in terms of the consequences that a family law proceeding will have on people and on the family involved.</p> <p>  I will begin by asking a few questions about Article 42A of the Constitution and its implementation through the Child and Family Relationships Act.  Dr. O'Mahony stated that everyone agrees that we must try to ascertain the views of the child.  Perhaps Mr. Walsh or Ms Coughlan, as practitioners can assist here, but in practical terms, has that increased the amount of work in a family law case because now one must ascertain the views of every child?  How is it done, practically?</p></speech>

The structure of the District Court is that every county has its own district, so we have approximately 26 districts.  Each District Court judge is not really answerable to the President of the District Court; he or she is completely a law unto himself or herself.  A specialist court system would allow more of a whip in terms of that, to some degree, or certainly a degree of consistency.  How the voice of the child is heard differs from case to case.  In Dolphin House, there are three judges presiding today who are dealing with access and custody issues.  Depending on which judge, there might be three different views on how the voice of the child can be heard.  One way that the voice of the child can be heard is through the evidence of the parents.  Another way is an expert report and yet another way is the judge speaking to the child in chambers.  The latter is the least used method, in my experience, because of the time involved and the lack of training.  District Court judges are far more likely than Circuit Court judges to hear children in chambers.  Circuit Court judges really do not get involved in that, whereas District Court judges would.  The referendum and Article 42A is about hearing the voice of the child but the most important thing is that the welfare of the child is to be paramount in any proceedings involving custody, access or guardianship and also adoption matters.</p><p>If there is a dispute about what is in the best interest of the child's welfare, and if the parents' evidence will be very different, one needs to bring in an expert.  It is quite difficult to hear the voice of the child without an expert.  In the District Court, what has happened is that there are many constitutional, legislative imperatives on the judge without any resources.  The experts are simply not available to do the reports.</p></speech>

Is it done through affidavits signed by the children, or by giving oral evidence, or by expert reports?</p></speech>

If one wanted to get an expert report, as we stated in our submission, what happened prior to the 2015 Act was that one would go into court and probably be dealt with on the first date unless there was a for-mention-type situation.  Currently, in a Dublin court, one would have to apply for the report on the first day, return another day to get the report and return yet another day to figure out how long the report will take and whether it can be agreed.  Before one gets anywhere, therefore, one will have had four court dates and appeared on the list four times but one will not even have received a hearing date.  At the hearing date, the expert will probably give evidence if there is a conflict, which there will have to be because if there are two parents, the expert will not necessarily solve the problem.  We read the 2015 Act as providing that the voice of the child must be heard and that is generally done by providing an expert report.</p></speech>

If a family can afford an expert report, they will get it.  Such reports cost in the region of &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000, in my experience.  The latest legislation allows for &euro;250 for the preparation of that report but I cannot see any expert doing it for &euro;250.  In practical terms, it depends on the judge of the day and whether he or she wants to hear the child.  In general, if the judge has the facility to have an expert elicit the child's view, in my experience he or she will use it.</p></speech>

The Act is silent on how to ascertain the views of the child where there is no expert, which leaves open the possibility that the views of the child simply are not heard.<br/><br/>By contrast, there are better approaches to the issue.  The Brussels IIa regulation on international child abduction cases, for example, requires the court to certify either that the child's views have been heard or the reasons that has not occurred, while the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2018, which is working its way through the Oireachtas, contains a provision which states that if a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is not to be appointed, the court must state in open court why not and, more importantly, how the views of the child will be alternatively ascertained.  That is missing, however, from the 2015 Act, which leaves open the possibility that it simply does not happen.<br/><br/>On the question of lengthening the proceedings and making them more expensive, that is inescapable but we have committed to it.  We either follow through on the commitment or hold a referendum to repeal Article 42A and withdraw from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p></speech>

How does she regard the quality of legal representation litigants receive when availing of legal aid?  How do they cope with the delay in getting representation or legal advice?  I presume that most people will find it difficult to pay for solicitors and barristers in family law proceedings.

There was a private practitioner scheme for dealing with matters in the District Court in respect of custody access and maintenance.  From our experience, however, due to the fee structure that was put in place, most private practitioners no longer do it because it is not cost effective for them.

A pilot project for mediators, which has been running in Dolphin House in Dublin for a couple of years, deals with some of the cases and is successful.  The mediators are on the premises of Dolphin House and it seems to have worked.  A similar project has been rolled out in Ennis, County Clare.  Mediation and alternative dispute resolution are the kinds of features that everyone would like to have available in courthouses.  The solicitors who work in the Legal Aid Board are utterly overworked due to the volume of cases and there is a constant pressure on them to service people.  Perhaps outsourcing services or providing more resources would help but the waiting lists are unacceptably long.</p></speech>

For example, they know that something has happened in the family and that they will have to go to court.  They know that the parents are going to court on the Friday, which happens, and they think that the matter will be resolved but it is not.  They do not know what is happening.  Families are going through turmoil because of the delay.  I have received calls from parents who have taken a day off work without realising they would have to return.  They think that they are going to go in for one day and have the case heard and sorted to allow them to move on with their lives.  The delay has an impact on families and, in particular, children and the relationships they have with their parents.  Sometimes, children might not be able to see one parent during the period, or they might have limited contact, or there might be arguments about when the contact can be.  The impact of delays on children, therefore, is particularly significant.</p> <p>  The overall issue is that the system was not created with families and children in mind.  It is again a matter of hearing the views of children.  While it is true that the 2015 Act is silent on how the views of children are heard, the system we have created has not made a provision that the court must be a child-friendly place with child-friendly proceedings in which children can have an active position and take part if they wish.  I have heard from children who have been heard through an expert but who do not feel that their voices have been heard, and they themselves sometimes want to speak with the judge.  While there is no consistency, the looseness exists for a reason because every child, family and situation is different.  The system needs to catch up with that reality and become more friendly for families.</p></speech>

Sometimes there is a mix of both.  We certainly brought this to the Department of Justice and Equality and it is in talks with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs about how this could potentially be done.  I know it is a longer-term objective but it is really practical.  We should not create inequalities between different children, depending on the type of court proceedings they come across.</p></speech>

Many of these people end up relying on services in the community and welfare.  We are not adding all that up.  The domestic violence bodies and services are really looking at how homelessness and domestic violence are interlinked.  Currently, with homelessness, we are not really talking about domestic violence; we separate and silo those.  There is a fair amount of work to be done on how this has an impact on poverty and homelessness.</p></speech>

Could we insert into our report a recommendation that would try to make parties in family law recognise they would be in a much better position if they could try to resolve disputes through mediation and get agreement on access to children that way?  That is in preference to the cut and thrust of a court case, where generally there is a winner and a loser.  Is there anything we could do to encourage that in our report?</p></speech>

A solicitor must now swear a statutory declaration that mediation has been discussed.  That has been far more effective than the old system of certificates.  That is in place.  If matters can be resolved outside the courts, that is the best way and it is certainly in the family law guidance that we give to solicitors.  When it gets to court, we need the active case management intervention of a judge immediately.  Currently, one goes to the county registrar for case progression within the system but while the county registrar does not have the same "teeth" as a judge, people really only see a judge at the end of a case.  What we are considering now is perhaps introducing the judge at the beginning to say that although parties are in court, they can still consider all this alternative dispute resolution, with the judge leading an examination of how far the case would need to go.  The judge would do two things.  Currently, the county registrar does case progression or management but we could certainly look at having a judge look at case management and stating that although such action could be taken, parties might consider alternative courses of action.  That probably would not be the judge who ultimately would hear the case but if a judge could be put into the process quickly, it might help to resolve cases that currently take a lot longer and which could be done much more quickly.  The process could be front-loaded.  This involves a commitment of resources from the Judiciary and from the practitioners and parties involved.</p></speech>

I have been an advocate of that for years on the criminal side whether children or family matters are involved or not.  The principle of mediation and alternative dispute resolution has certain limitations and one should be wary of advocating it or using it in any situation where there is an indication of sexual or domestic violence or an abusive situation of some kind or another.  There is much potential for the abusive party to manipulate the process completely to the detriment of the other people or family members involved.  My fear is there is a risk, if it is not done properly, that in the early stages a party who had witnessed sexual or domestic violence in a domestic setting would feel he or she had no choice, would be constrained or would feel that it would be very hard to avoid mediation, although everything else would scream against such a process with good cause.</p></speech>

When we speak about transparency, we would like much more data as we do not have anything but anecdotes on this because of the nature of family law and how it is conducted.  We have anecdotes that raise the question of how many such cases there are.  This begins to intersect with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  We must examine how Tusla engages on the question.  As I have said, if there is a 96% failure rate for child sexual abuse that is disclosed and is probably true, if some of the cases end up in family courts, how are they being handled?  Tusla has a system of categorising the 3,000 referrals in terms of risk management as "founded" and "unfounded".  It does not disclose and there is no public data on what percentage of these cases it deems to be founded and unfounded.  Therefore, what it sends to family courts, how it behaves with respect to the courts and the information it gives would depend on how the cases are categorised as either founded or unfounded.  Tusla's policy around how it treats an unfounded case varies.  There is not a standard way of handling the risk assessment and such cases naturally would always need to be individualised.  There would need to be an individual response to such cases.</p> <p>  On the question of whether we can end up with a situation where there is child sexual abuse in a private family case, we would say "Yes" for all the reasons we have mapped out here.  What is critical for us to know is whether we can begin to log this, put a number on it or count it.  We think there is much that is hidden.  As Ms Counihan said with respect to alternative dispute resolution, we do not know how many such processes involve people in cases of coercive control and domestic violence who make a calculation that it is easier to compromise.  We do not know to what extent the cases that are long and protracted, where people will not agree, are because there is domestic and sexual violence.  We are not counting these allegations that are parts of these cases.  That is not to say they are true but that they are part of the case.</p></speech>

I am sure after listening to the witnesses and the other groups coming in, we will have much food for thought.  It looks like it will be very difficult to make things as good as we would like them to be.  The witnesses seem to agree that resources will be a big challenge and it will cost much money to make this fit for purpose.  We are up against the wall then of whether those resources will come on stream.</p> <p>  The witnesses have indicated no additional resources have been allocated to pay for the required experts to complete the voice of the child report.  The Law Society has called for cases to be resolved earlier in the process, with a focus on alternative dispute resolution.  Ms Counihan raised concerns about the use of such processes in cases regarding child sexual violence and domestic violence.  How does the Law Society feel about the use of alternative dispute resolution in these complex cases?</p></speech>

We have a policy against it.  It may be worth dividing up family law into two or three areas.  The Circuit Court deals primarily with legal separation and divorce cases, while the District Court deals with public law cases, namely, childcare, taking children into care, as well as access, custody and guardianship cases which are primarily non-marital.  There is already a division within the court system in that the Circuit Court deals with people who are married and all of their problems as a bundle in divorce or judicial separation proceedings, while the District Court deals with people who are unmarried in the context of guardianship and, separately, maintenance cases and, separately again, custody issues.  There are also public law childcare cases which involve taking children into care.  There are a variety of others, but they are the headline areas.  If there are no allegations of sexual violence or other such issues, an ADR mechanism could be trialled in divorce and judicial separation proceedings.  The primary issues in judicial separation and divorce cases are money and children.  This can be done, either before going to court or afterwards but ideally as soon as possible.  </p><p> As I said, the District Court deals with custody and guardianship cases.  Again, an ADR mechanism would be suitable for use in the majority of these cases and should be tried.  We might not solve everything via an ADR mechanism, but we might have a number of issues netted or resolved.  An ADR mechanism would not necessarily be suitable for use in public law cases because the decisions are binary.  In other words, either the child will be taken into care or he or she will not.  There may be a voluntary element.  An ADR mechanism works on a case by case basis.  Generally, where possible, it reduces the resources required by the courts system, but it does require the provision of alternative resources.  It would not be possible to operate it without an additional judge or two, but if it was resourced properly in the longer term, it will definitely pay dividends.  Most importantly, it would reduce the legal costs involved for the parties and speed up the timeframe required to resolve all of the issues involved.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Callaghan has made the point that it will be very difficult to bring it about.  It is a huge challenge.  Under the 2015 Act, the appointment of a child's view expert is entirely at the discretion of the court.  There is no guidance in the Act on what should happen in cases in which the court decides not to appoint an expert, be it for financial reasons or in the case in which the child is deemed to be able to speak for himself or herself.  Given that the courts can be an intimidating place for children and that many judges and lawyers are not trained or equipped to speak to children in that setting, should the appointment of an expert be the default position in law rather than discretionary?</p></speech>

Ideally, there should be a menu of options.  If one is dealing with a 16 year old, he or she may very well be able to speak for himself or herself and it may be a better vindication of that child's rights to have him or her participate directly, rather than doing so through the medium of an expert.  If one is dealing with much younger children, the communication barrier is more significant.  My personal view is that it is more important to have a flexible menu of options than to have a default position into which every child is shoehorned.  As I mentioned, because the 2015 Act speaks about the expert but not about the other options, it raises the question as to what those options are and how would they work in cases in which experts are not appointed.  We know that there will be cases in which experts will not be appointed.</p></speech>

For our part, we would be looking at a specialisation that would be able to recognise, for example, coercive control and grooming.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh has made the point that in a lot of cases this amount would not cover the cost of a report, but for many families, it is too high.  Am I correct that the delegates are recommending that the State put in place a mechanism to foot the bill?  If so, how would it be managed and how would costs be controlled?</p></speech>

Some will not be able to afford it.  We recommend a scheme akin to the legal aid scheme.  A scheme was piloted, but the fees for child abuse experts were set very low.  The regulations published in December came into force on 1 January.  They were a long time in the making, given that the Act was passed in 2015.  We did make submissions on the issue of fees, as did the national advisory council on children and young people.  We engaged with Barnardos which operates the guardian <i>ad litem</i>scheme on how many hours it would take it to carry out this work.  It told us that it would take about 30 hours because the person would have to establish a relationship of trust with the child and ensure he or she was not being coached by one or both parents.  There is a responsibility on the State to provide resources to do this work.  It is provided for in legislation and to enforce it, we need to ensure the regulations are fit for purpose.<br/><br/>On the issue of who can be appointed as an expert, the regulations set our four professions, one of which is a psychologist who comes under CORU, the body for health and social professionals.  One of the issues arising is, if one has a complaint, to whom one can make it.  That is not clear from the regulations.  Some of our members have asked for the regulations on the professionals who can be appointed as a child abuse expert to be fleshed out further, lest we lose some really valuable expertise.  Ultimately, the fees are far too low.  That will not help to solve the problem and we need to find a way forward.  The national executive office in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, when established and up and running, could look at how this issue could be addressed.</p></speech>

Are there spaces within existing court buildings that could be refurbished and made good?  Do we need new buildings or should we consider using different settings?  For example, could a school building be modified and used part time for this purpose?  There is a huge cost involved in the provision of new buildings.  I presume we would be talking about one per county, as in the case of the other courts.</p> <p>  On Ms Brady's response to my question about the State footing the bill, as a matter of interest, do any of the groups engage with the Department of Justice and Equality on the need for modification and better resourcing of the legal aid system?

We also have a users group with the Legal Aid Board because the Law Society of Ireland wants to support the solicitors with the Legal Aid Board who are overworked and underfunded.  We get both sides.</p> <p>  In respect of premises, there is a vacant lot on Church Street, beside the corner of the Four Courts, which approximately four or five years ago was earmarked for the new system of family justice.  It was apparently given the green light, but the project is now stalled somewhere between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Law Society of Ireland and, I am sure, the other groups represented here have been in constant touch with the Department about moving the project on.  If it was enacted in Dublin, it would be the flagship for the integrated system of specialist family justice, with the mediation services of the Legal Aid Board and alternative dispute resolution, ADR, service providers.  It would house the Children Court which is where criminal issues involving children go, public law cases, private law cases, the Circuit Court and the High Court.  It would be the ideal way to deal with it.  We went very far into the detail of its format and lay-out.  We say the specialist division of the family court cannot wait and that we must make the best of what we have in the Courts Service.  We will have to identify the regional centres and see whether this can be rolled out.  We are talking to the Courts Service about this, but we really cannot wait for the buildings to be built.  We have to do the best with what we have got.  Family law has always been the poor sister or relation in the allocation of resources, but we need to see this specialist court being set up as soon as it can be.  It may be that it has to move a little ahead of the premises, but if we are to wait for the buildings to be built, we will never have a specialist division of the family court.  We will have to do our best with what we have and perhaps think creatively with the Office of Public Works, the Courts Service and the Department of Justice and Equality and say that while they may not have the facilities required, we want to press ahead with this project.  Unfortunately, it will never be fully resourced.  The best may be the enemy of the good in that regard.</p></speech>

There was a great project for child contact centres in operation a couple of years ago which was run by Barnardos and One Family, both of which are members of the Children's Rights Alliance.  The issue of access for families and children has been brought up.  The centres were operated very effectively in providing a neutral space for children to meet the other parent.  Families found them really useful, but the funding for them was cut.  They ran for several years and funding was not reallocated.  We have been talking to some of our members which provide domestic violence services and they all advocate that we look again at that system.  It was cost effective, provided child-friendly spaces for children to access their other parent, particularly, as Mr. Walsh pointed out, single fathers who had particular problems in finding adequate accommodation, given the housing crisis.  They need that space to meet their children and access visits.</p></speech>

Some court buildings throughout the country are in fairly good shape and with some slight modifications, they could accommodate this service, but there are many that would not.  Certainly at District Court level, there are many very small Victorian style District Court buildings which are utterly unsuitable.  Reference has been made to the courthouse on Chancery Street in Dublin which is almost the last place where child protection cases should be heard.  It has razor wire on the top of the walls and bars on the windows of the consultation rooms and so on.  We could absolutely use other buildings.  In some ways, for this type of case, the less it looks like a traditional courthouse the better.  It would not be necessary to build shiny specialised court buildings in every town in Ireland.  There is a lot that could be done in using creatively other accommodation and then regional centres in having dedicated buildings.</p></speech>

I agree completely with the idea of having a menu of options.  What will make it easier for an individual child to participate in the process?  We should start with the children and the menu of what in the criminal courts would be called special measures and perhaps, in the wider context, criminal proceedings protective measures.  That leads me to the need for specialised training, the range of approaches which might be suitable in the case of an individual child and for everybody else, including Courts Service staff, judges and lawyers who appear regularly in the system.  Everybody has to have a basic understanding and accept that each individual child needs an individual approach.  From there spring ideas and imaginative solutions to the problem of the fabric not being adequate.  We could easily become creative and improvise for a period, while waiting for the beautiful new courtroom to be built in an area, just by considering what was essential.  It is essential that the place be friendly, safe and not intimidating; that the child have an opportunity to ask questions beforehand about the procedure; that the process in court be child friendly; that there be no bullying of the witness; and that there be no repetitive questions in convoluted legal language and so forth.  That is where we need to start.</p></speech>

We know that conviction rates are incredibly low in cases of child sexual violence.  I think I read that they are at a figure of 4%.  As well as the low rates, the courts are not gathering statistics for child sexual or domestic violence cases in the civil family law court.  How will Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar go about data collection and publication?  Has Rape Crisis Network Ireland thought it out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.668" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#L00700"><p>The prosecution rate found by the Garda Inspectorate was 4%, with a conviction rate of 2%.  That leaves everything else and accepting that some of them will simply not be true at a figure of between 2% and 8%.  Not every one of those cases will end up in the family law system, but many of them will in some way, shape or form.  As Mr. Walsh said, the family law system is broken.  Sexual violence cases disappear into a broken system in which we lose sight of them.  That is why it is critical that we figure out how to count them to keep track of them.  That is a matter for the Courts Service.  We are asking the servants of the courts to log cases going through them and to say, for example, if there is an allegation of sexual violence in a case, they make no judgment on whether it is true but simply that it is present.  We would then have an indication of the percentage of child sexual violence allegations present in the family law court, in public and private cases.  In public cases it will be straightforward; the blind spot is in private cases.  In a footnote to our submission we mention that some of these cases are interminable, something with which the practitioners will be familiar.  In the area of the criminal law there are cases that are <i>sub judice</i>, but there are others that are finished and we can talk about them.</p><p>When we venture into this space these cases seem interminable but the system does not track them as one case, so they pop up again and again.  The system does not know how long the same people remain in the system coming back over and over again.  Consequently, we could really fix that part as well in order that the system understands just how long and interminable some of these cases are because one continues to be brought back in, if one likes.  That is especially likely where there are situations of coercive control and domestic violence where the courts are essentially being used in that way.  This type of visibility where the Courts Service can begin to track these data would give us a handle on it and allow us to begin to have a conversation whereby we ask how we manage it in terms of the case management and the practices and specialisations we need.</p></speech>

Dr. O'Mahony said that we do not need a constitutional amendment for the establishment of a specialised family court.  What legislative changes does he envisage as being necessary?  The Law Society recommends establishing it within the Circuit Court system, whereas he suggests that family law divisions should be set up within the District, Circuit and High Courts.  In terms of practicality and costs, which does he think is the most realistic option?</p> <p>  Some fathers feel they do not get a fair deal.  I went through the system myself.

At present different aspects of family law are allocated to different courts.  Mr. Walsh alluded to that earlier.  Some decisions are made in the District Court, some in the Circuit Court and some in the High Court.  What could very easily be done is what happens in other areas, for example, in the Children Court for criminal matters involving children.  For those family cases one would designate the courts when they are hearing those issues as the family District Court, the family Circuit Court or the family High Court.  The legislation would then set out what are the characteristics of the family District Court to differentiate it from the regular District Court, be that procedural, in terms of facilities or specialist training for judges or other staff members.  In that way, one would slot it into what we already have but one would then separate it out in terms of that level of specialisation around the staffing and facilities that make it a specialist court.</p></speech>

We would call for proper research to be done to ascertain the exact position.  Anecdotally, it seems to be that the perception is that fathers do not get a fair crack of the whip.  We need more research and data to see how they are treated.  Following on from that, it comes back to what we are also advocating, namely, that there is a need for specialist judges and for judges to be trained.  Society has changed.  The role a father would have had 20 or 30 years ago could be very different to the role a father has now.  We do not know whether that is being reflected in court orders in respect of maintenance and especially access so we need some research on it.</p></speech>

What this comes down to is data because right now we do not know what the situation is.  We have other pieces of data, for example, on the distribution of care in the raising of children.  As 70% of the time it is mothers who are doing the caring, the question is how that impacts when one goes to court.  We have income inequality between women and men as well, which also plays a part.  Until we have data on what is happening in the courts, we cannot even have the conversation.  This is another area where the Courts Service could begin to illuminate matters for us so that we could have a conversation based on evidence.</p></speech>

My head is spinning a little, given what has been said.  The presentations indicate the situation is a minefield.  If in Ireland we cannot make our vulnerable children a number one priority, then I do not know what kind of country we are.  There is no doubt it should be a number one priority.  The image of the Bridewell and children going into that family law scenario is so traumatic.  I cannot imagine what it must be like for the children.</p> <p>  There are a couple of areas I want to touch on, which Deputy O'Callaghan touched on a little in terms of prevention and how the witnesses see that.  I will give an example to explain what I mean by that.  I work in family therapy, specifically in the area of addiction.  I wish to refer to addiction a little bit because I am sure it plays a significant role across the board in family law and court cases.  A family I might work with could involve one parent in addiction and the other parent being so preoccupied, stressed, worried and anxious because of the chaos it brings into the home that the children can often be left neglected, as the parent who is not in addiction cannot function.  As a result, the older child can be taking care of the younger children and they are looking after themselves.  All of the chaos is going on and then there is a court case.  I advocate that there should be some way of preventing all of that through the provision of resources for addiction services or by having the services working together.  For example, Tusla could work with the addiction services to see if there was some way of preventing people from getting to the last stage of a court case to avoid children being obliged to go through all of that.  What is the view of the witnesses in that regard?</p></speech>

Senator Black focused specifically on addiction in her comments.  There is a very distinct link between addiction and the child protection issues that come to the attention of Tusla.  Tusla's social workers are so overburdened in trying to address the critical cases that this keeps them from doing the kind of work on early intervention that they might like to do and that might catch things further upstream and prevent them becoming more acute, as Senator Black suggests.  As a general matter, when we talk about child protection, if we want early intervention to work then we need to resource Tusla to be able to do that.</p></speech>

To follow on from Dr. O'Mahony's point, the area-based childhood programmes have now been taken into Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and they specialise in prevention and early intervention.  That will form part of Tusla's wider work, which is welcome.  Senator Black is correct that there needs to be a more joined-up approach and that needs to happen well before there is any crisis.  It is evident from Carol Coulter's childcare law reporting project that parental addiction and alcohol abuse plays a part in many of the cases she has seen come before the courts.  A number of helpful measures have been put in place.  I am so used to talking about the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill that I forget it is now an Act but measures such as that will hopefully help address some of the addiction issues.  We now have an early years strategy, First 5, and that is built in there as well, so in addition to the affordable childcare scheme we will see provision for vulnerable families.  A number of agencies will be tasked with identifying those families and providing them with quality full-time childcare to help with the family support piece and prevention and early intervention because if one can get children into a good quality service such as that, where there are wraparound services, it can identify those problems earlier, signal them to Tusla and try to put in place the family support and parental support programmes that are needed in order to address them.</p><p>There is some work happening.  We can send the committee further information on it.  We will be launching our report card next week, which will deal with some of those issues.  The committee will see how we can join up some of the existing work, which might be useful for its own report.</p></speech>

Regarding legal aid, Mr. Walsh mentioned that many legal aid lawyers are completely overburdened and overworked.  What would he recommend?  I do not understand how it all works.  What attracts somebody to legal aid work?  How can their lives be made easier?  Do they need more resources?  What is the major problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.683" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Keith Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#N00300"><p>The major problem is the volume of people who need to seek legal aid.  It is means-assessed so one has to be earning less than a certain amount of money to qualify.  The number of people who fall into that bracket and who are involved in family law proceedings is quite large.  The Legal Aid Board is involved in roughly one third of all Circuit Court cases and a slightly smaller portion of District Court cases.  The Legal Aid Board is a huge player in this area.  From my experience, the type of person who is attracted to work with the Legal Aid Board is somebody who wants to make a difference and who is not necessarily motivated by money, because it is not hugely well-paid work.  They are people who genuinely want to help people resolve problems.</p> <p>  Resourcing is a massive issue.  More resources should be given to the Legal Aid Board so that it could hire more solicitors and set up private practitioner schemes that would work to take some of the burden off the board.  We are not talking about hugely well-paid schemes but about adequately funded schemes.  This would mean, for example, that instead of a Legal Aid Board solicitor spending a full day in District Court doing one case, that work could be hived off to private practitioners.  A restructuring of how the Legal Aid Board does business is certainly required.  The board constantly looks at that.  We meet its chief executive, Mr. John McDaid, and other members of the board regularly and they say they require more resources due to the volume of people applying for legal aid.  </p> <p>  Delays in respect of legal aid usually affect the other person involved.  That person may also be on legal aid, which may result in a delay to his or her case, but if he or she is not the court considers equality of arms and fairness.  If one of two parties is on legal aid it slows the case down for both people.  If somebody applies for legal aid, it slows down proceedings.  The Law Society believes more resources are necessary.</p></speech>

They are quite entitled to do that but very often it is not done by choice but because they cannot wait.  That raises questions in respect of access to justice, delays and training for judges in dealing with personal litigants.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.685" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#N00500"><p>It should be said that the issues dealt with by the Legal Aid Board are disproportionately on the side of custody and access.  The board prioritises child protection cases in which the State seeks to take a child into care because of their nature.  If the State comes in with its legal representatives and seeks an application for a care order, the judge will not want to proceed unless there is a solicitor for the parent.  Because these cases often involve neglect or abuse, those applications cannot wait.  The Legal Aid Board's resources tend to be sucked up in ensuring that people in cases involving applications for care orders have representation.  The private cases end up having to wait.  The impact on private cases, as has already been mentioned, may also result in parents not seeing their children.</p></speech>

Is that how he sees it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.687" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Keith Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#N00700"><p>One certainly feels it when one practises in this area rather than other areas.  It is not a very sexy area of practice and is not treated particularly well in the hierarchy of the courts.  From our perspective, we view it as something that has traditionally had difficulty getting funding allocated to it.  It requires a lot of funding but it does not necessarily get it.  There is a perception there.  One of the difficulties relates to the <i>in camera</i>rule.  People do not realise what is going on behind closed doors in respect of delays and so on.  The <i>in camera</i>rule effectively prevents things about the courts being reported on a daily basis.  If something happens in any of the other courts it is reported.  There is very little reporting of the family law courts.  The 2004 Act does allow for certain journalists to go in and report on the courts but the reality is that, because of resource issues in the media, the media does not want to devote resources to people going in to sit at the back of courtrooms.<br/><br/>We need some sort of change to the <i>in camera</i>rule to allow people to see into courts.  It should not allow anyone's identity to be revealed, but should allow people to see how fathers, mothers and children are treated in the District Court with regard to guardianship, access and custody and how people are treated in respect of separation of divorce.  People should be allowed to see how child abduction cases are handled in the High Court.  Most people are not even aware that such cases happen.  Transparency and further relaxation of the rules would assist the whole system but this is a hugely divisive issue.  The people who are going to court do not necessarily want anything reported by the time they get there.  It is a really tricky issue for the users or litigants in person and for the lawyers.  This is an area on which no two people agree.  More transparency is essential, however, otherwise family law will remain the poor relation.  We have to acknowledge that this is one of the reasons for it.</p></speech>

Going into court and not being heard is probably one of the worst traumas that a child can experience.  Perhaps this was said, I hope the witnesses will forgive me if I missed it, but would they recommend that a therapist or somebody else be there to support children, particularly in cases in which there has been any kind of sexual violence?  Should that happen all of the time?  What are the witnesses' thoughts in that area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.690" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Julie Ahern" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#N01000"><p>I raised the issue of children telling me on the phone that they feel they have not been heard.  This can happen in a variety of circumstances.  It could be the case that they wanted to talk to the judge but that the judge did not want to talk to them or did not hear their voice directly.  It could be the case that they feel what they have said has been misrepresented in some way.  Judges and people working in the courts need to be more aware of what child-friendly justice is and of how they can listen to and hear the views of children and communicate back to them.  Ms Brady raised the example of a judge doing a judgment in emojis and explaining to the children that he had heard what they said, the reasons why he did not agree with them, and what was going to happen.  When I am talking to children and young people about any area, I find that if one explains to them that one has heard them and then explains why one has come to a particular decision, they are more likely to accept it and it is likely to be easier for parents.  On the other side of it, I get calls from mothers and fathers who say their 12 year old or 15 year old is screaming and does not want to get into the car to go to access.  If an effort is made by judges, in the first instance, to explain to children why they have come to a particular decision and the reasons for that decision in a way that will not damage or traumatise them further and that is child-friendly, it could have a really big impact.</p> <p>  The Senator is right.  Support services are key.  One of the big issues I find arising on the information line I run is that people are not aware of what is there in the community.  There are actually an awful lot of supports in the community for children and young people.  Some of them have longer waiting lists than others and can be difficult to access.  That is another issue, but people are not actually aware.  They do not know that they can contact different people and get different supports.  Work on information is needed in that respect.  People need to be linked to the right places at the right time.</p></speech>

She is absolutely right.  Information about what services are available is very important for everybody who is involved in the justice system to have, if not in their heads then at least readily available to them.  They must also ensure, as far as possible, that what they are talking about is appropriate to the situation.  In the context of the criminal justice system, the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act refers to specialist support services.  It refers to information about the appropriate kind of service, if not a single service.  It is very important that those who work in the Courts Service and lawyers who regularly deal with family law cases at least have an idea of where to go to find out information or who to go to for a decent referral for a particular therapist, for example.</p> <p>  On the question of therapists being in court on the day, I am not sure if that is necessary.  It is much more important that all of the professionals have an understanding that every child is an individual and may need individually tailored supports in order to have his or her voice heard and to have a menu of options available.</p></speech>

Our waiting lists are enormous.  There are almost no services for teenagers in this circumstance.  That must be taken into account if we are looking at a joined up process the whole way through the care system for the child.  In order to ensure a child centred response, we must look at funding the resources in the community also.</p></speech>

Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh go leir as bheith anseo.  I thank our guests for attending.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said earlier, all of these issues might not be front and centre of the news very often but they have huge implications for people's right to relationships and to safety.  These are fundamental rights and it is important that we get this right.  Some of the difficulty with the <i>in camera</i>rule is that cases are dealt with away from the public eye but the rights involved are fundamental.</p><p>I am pleased to note that UCC is very well represented.  My first question is straightforward.  Our guests will have to forgive my ignorance on this matter.  There has been a lot of reference to experts.  Am I right in assuming that in the vast majority of cases, the expert being referred to is a child psychologist?  Are there examples of other experts who might be involved?</p></speech>

Are there instances in which a child might have a child protection social worker from Tusla, a guardian <i>ad litem</i>and legal representation?  How well does that work?  Does it work seamlessly?  Am I misunderstanding the process?  Is it difficult for a child to have to deal with three professionals, all of whom have slightly different responsibilities and possibly a different perspective or philosophy or does it work seamlessly?</p></speech>

It provides for the appointment of a guardian<i>ad litem </i>or a solicitor for the child.  It is an either-or situation, so a child would not have both in a single case.  The evidence is that the mechanism in the Child Care Act whereby a solicitor can be appointed for a child is used very infrequently.  In recent years, it appears that there was only one judge in the country who was inclined to make use of that particular mechanism.  The guardian <i>ad litem</i>is the primary vehicle in a set of proceedings through which the views of the child would be communicated to the court.  There would always be a social worker involved on the Tusla side and there would be a solicitor representing Tusla in the proceedings.  A social worker would invariably be involved in presenting the evidence to the court on behalf of Tusla as to why the child should be taken into care or why there should be a supervision order put in place.  It is important to say that the social worker is not impartial.  While social workers may characterise themselves as being in the court in order to represent the child's best interests and they may have spoken to the child and may communicate that to the court, they are in court seeking a particular outcome.  It is almost equivalent to asking the mother or father in a private case what are the views of the child.  That is why the guardian <i>ad litem</i>becomes so important because he or she provides independence in terms of an analysis of the child's best interests and communicating the views of the child.  The social worker has a stake in the outcome, as it were, whereas the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is independent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.704" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Saoirse Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#O01400"><p>To add to that, the new Child Care (Amendment) Bill, the most recent version of which we should see quite soon, makes provision for a child to have both a guardian <i>ad litem</i>and a solicitor if he or she is party to the proceedings, which is welcome.  As Dr. O'Mahony said, under section 25 a child can be joined as a party to the proceedings but that has not really happened.  That is something that we would call for because if we really want to ensure that a child is participating in proceedings, we have to assess whether he or she should be party to the proceedings.  There has been a paternalistic view of this, which holds that we should protect a child by not letting him or her be a party but the child should be involved.  Ultimately, the decision is about the child so that is something that must be addressed.  The guardian <i>ad litem</i>Bill is in preparation and that is one area that could be looked at again.<br/><br/>Child abuse experts really need to have the space and time to represent the views of the child.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides guidance in Article 12 on the views of the child.  The representative is there to say what the child thinks and not to interpret what the child thinks.  A guardian <i>ad litem</i>will talk about the best interests of the child but he or she is meant to actually relate the child's view and not to sugar-coat it for the court.</p></speech>

The first arises where an expert is not appointed and there is not a lot of clarity around what should happen.  Second, there is not a lot of clarity around determining whether the child has the capacity to have his or her voice heard.  The third difficulty arises where an expert is to be appointed but the parties cannot pay for it.  Would greater clarity on the first matter, in terms of what happens if an expert is not appointed, be the most crucial issue?  Obviously, all of the difficulties have to be addressed but would the first be the most important?  Would clarity in that aspect provide for greater consistency across the board?  Does the Child Care (Amendment) Bill address any of the issues that they have identified in the context of clarity?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.706" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#O01600"><p>It does on that last point because it requires the court, if it is not to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, which would be the public law equivalent of the expert in the private law cases, that is, the person acting on behalf of the child and representing his or her views, first to explain why in open court.  It must also stipulate what it is doing instead.</p><p>That is crucial because if the court is obliged to state, in open court, how it is going to ascertain the views of the child, it becomes quite difficult for the court to simply not do it.  The 2015 Act leaves the door open for that to fall by the wayside if the expert cannot be paid for.  There is nothing in the Act about what happens next and it could simply not happen.  If the court has to explain those reasons in open court, it becomes much more difficult for a court to let it slip in the manner I am describing.  That is important.</p><p> The question of how the court assesses whether the child is capable of forming the views is extremely important because that is the gateway to the obligation to hear the child kicking in.  All children who are capable of forming views must be heard.  Children who are not capable of forming views do not have to be heard.  How do we distinguish between those two groups and who distinguishes between them?  One judge might take the view that he will bring in the expert to make that assessment in the first instance.  Another judge might attempt to make that judgment himself or herself and may or may not have the skills to properly make that assessment.  Another judge might simply decide to speak to every child over a certain age and not to speak to children under that age.  That is a recipe for inconsistency.  It would be good to have some clarity on that assessment.  We have this crucial gateway concept of children being capable of forming their own views without clarity as to how we establish which children meet that criteria and which do not.</p></speech>

The voice of the child is falling by the wayside and it is difficult for cases to be dealt with because of the pressure on District Court judges and on court listings.</p> <p>  To take up what Dr. O'Mahony said, this could be dealt with in a real way if private law proceedings mirror what is happening in public law proceedings.  The court should state how it proposes to facilitate or hear the voice of the child in court at the beginning.  The court should also state why it is not going to appoint an expert to hear the child's views.  Legislative change to the 2015 Act or the 1964 Act is all that is required.  Judges obviously have to follow the law.  It is not a hugely difficult for this committee to make a recommendation for change in its report.  That could be done and would result in the kind of situation where rights that are slipping by the wayside would be put front and centre.</p> <p>  The difficulty and opposition that might be encountered from the Government is that there is no doubt that change would impose real resource obligations on District Court judges which the Government may not wish to resource.  Without that type of provision in the 2015 Act, it is only really paying lip service to the voice of the child.</p></speech>

Something like guidelines for judges on how to carry out this function could be introduced.  All the other professionals involved, including lawyers, should be trained how to communicate and work with children.  It is something we are already doing within the court system.  It is worth pointing out that the Children Court talks and listens to children all day, every day.  Children go in and give evidence within that specially designed system.  We could learn a lot from how the professionals and the judges in that system engage with children.  Talking to a child is not an alien concept we have never encountered before within the legal system.  We do not need to work on something brand new.  We need to look at what is already in place here and in other jurisdictions, as Dr. O'Mahony set out earlier.  There is a lot out there and it could be done quite easily with a legislative amendment and some other supporting pieces of work such as training and guidance.</p></speech>

We have talked about the failures of the criminal justice system.  Tusla and HIQA made some urgent recommendations around specialisation last summer.  HIQA was clear that the specialisation was not there for the people doing the assessments and talking to these children and HIQA needed to work on that urgently.  It was training specialist interviewers, the most recent tranche of whom came out in January.  If Tusla does not catch that, these cases are not going to turn up in public family law.  The next net for them to fall into is private family law.  There is then a situation whereby experts are publicly funded when we have not got the regulation right yet as to specialisation and provision and the cost will be &euro;2,000 to &euro;4,000.  There is not another safety net if one does not have that money.  That is the last safety net and that child falls through another crack.</p></speech>

People can respond if they wish.  I want to make an observation on the issue of access and that kind of stuff.  Ms Brady picked up this, and it is a point I have previously raised about contact centres.  For a time, I was on the board of management of a family centre in Togher in Cork that had a top-class, excellent contact facility.  An issue was raised locally by Judge Con O'Leary.  At one stage, it was in a position to facilitate contact from Tusla referrals and referrals from Judge Con O'Leary and, more generally, from family cases.  The only contact it currently provides is where there is a child protection issue and that reduces the scope and the options available to family law judges.  It has really excellent facilities and huge potential and I would very much advocate and support greater investment in it.</p> <p>  On access and maintaining relationships, as far as I can see, an awful lot of local authorities do not properly take into account where an applicant to the housing list has access rights.  They are very often treated as single applicants and that is an issue that needs to be addressed.  I frequently come across that issue.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh touched on another issue I frequently come across.  Maintenance is a significant issue for an awful lot of parents.  In the overwhelming number of cases, mothers have difficulty getting maintenance to which they are entitled.  They often do not want to go down the formal route and accessing maintenance can be difficult.  There is a child maintenance service in Britain, although I am not very familiar with the mechanism involved.  I do not know if any of our guests are familiar with it or if they have any views on whether it is good, bad or something we should consider.</p></speech>

For example, one family advocated, and continues to advocate, for a child maintenance agency like the one in Britain because there are difficulties in getting the maintenance.  The issue of money can exacerbate an already tense situation and the fallout usually lands on the children in the withholding of access visits.  There is something in looking at that idea.</p> <p>  Maintenance is also sometimes used in terms of social welfare access and social welfare payments and there were measures in the 2019 budget to address that.  We will hopefully start to see a streamlining of that.  An agency that could be put in place to address the real issues in family issues should be explored.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.713" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Keith Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#P00700"><p>I agree with the agency concept.  A simplification of maintenance or more transparency so people have a better idea of what they are entitled to would be welcome.  Maintenance is something that helps people out of poverty, particularly if they are trying to cope with children on their own.  We should have a more streamlined system for maintenance.  It is really a kind of means tested exercise, to a great degree, involving children.  There must be a more efficient way than the way we are currently dealing with it.  There would certainly be an argument for maintenance to be dealt with in a more streamlined way and any reform of the court structure should look at that.  We should look at the enforcement of payment, but also how do we get there and is there a way to do it quicker.</p></speech>

They are slightly different.  The first is really an observation.</p><p> On the evidence from RCNI, I was generally aware of the low charge and conviction rates for sexual crimes but I had no idea it was as low for sexual violence against children.  I am just shocked at that low level.  I echo the witnesses' call for greater research and information on this because the rate is appallingly low.</p><p> I will make two final points.  I am interested in the point about facilities.  It seems to me that there may potentially be a need for significant capital investment to bring our courts of State up to scratch.  I do not necessarily expect this to be outlined on the floor of the committee, but if anyone is aware of any detailed document outlining the level of capital expenditure that would be required, I am sure it would be useful to provide it to the committee.  I am also interested in the point made by Dr. O'Mahony and a few others, I think, that there may be scope for more flexible approaches in respect of other buildings.  That is very interesting.</p><p> I will ask a final question.  We may consider this at a later date, but it would be remiss of me not to pose the question.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is bringing forward a referendum on divorce which would remove the matter from the Constitution.  We have not seen the detail of the proposition, but the indication is that legislation would accompany it providing for a reduction in the period of separation required, I think, from four in five years in the Constitution to two out of three years in legislation.  Will the witnesses outline even a brief initial view on the legislative end of this, whether it is the right approach, whether it is too restrictive or whether it is not restrictive enough?</p></speech>

We have a two-tier system at present whereby one can apply for judicial separation and then one applies for divorce.  This is doing the same thing twice, so there are delays and also cost involved.  I would certainly welcome the referendum.  I think it will bring about huge improvements in family law if it is remitted to legislation in order that the period is reduced to one or two years.  It will be hugely beneficial.</p></speech>

Regarding the rate of conviction, by and large this committee is used to Rape Crisis Network Ireland coming before it on criminal matters.  We do not necessarily come here very often to discuss civil matters.  We are here because of the failure rate in respect of criminal matters.  It is very important we get that part right.  We are also very conscious that there is a whole set of other things that happen before a case ever gets into civil law matters.  This is why we are abdicating on the national strategy on child sexual violence.  While this part can be fixed, attention also needs to be paid to all the others across the whole of Government and the entire system.</p></speech>

I have just a couple of comments and questions I do not think have been discussed.  There is mention of creation of a specialist courts structure, and it is mentioned that a constitutional amendment would not be required in this regard.  Could this be performed by the president of the District Court in any event, without necessarily having to engage with the Oireachtas?  Could it involve Government regarding funding in the Courts Service?  Do we need to have it mandated or structured by the Oireachtas?  What I would like to know is how many more judges we would require.  Would existing District Court judges be siloed into a specific family law structure?  How many more do they reckon we would need?  The practical requirements for structuring are kind of a separate place.  Would it be a regional system or would it mirror our existing District Court model?  Those are just some of my questions.  I will try to bank them together.</p> <p>  Regarding the regulations that were introduced and how the capping of the fees has made things worse, how can this be changed?  Just so I can understand, is the &euro;250 the whole fee?  What is the fee structure?  Perhaps our guests could provide more detail on that.  Is it capped at &euro;250 per specialist or is the fee for each general consultation?  Would a number of people be involved?  Will our guests answer those questions first.</p></speech>

If one qualifies for legal aid, the Legal Aid Board will pay for the assessor in one's case, so that is slightly different.  The difficulty with the regulation is that it caps the total amount payable on a particular section 32-type report, which means that if one charges more than that, one is in breach of the law.  This is the real difficulty, that one will be doing something unlawful if one charges for a section 32-type report specified in the regulations.  This has a fairly chilling effect on experts.</p> <p>  Regarding the courts structure, the difficulty at present in the courts is that the president of the District Court has no great coercive power over other judges.  If one were to get into this, one would probably be straying into constitutional territory as well, but my understanding is that the Department of Justice and Equality has examined this.  It is at quite an advanced stage in that there may be potentially a draft Bill on specialist courts.  I am sure this committee could liaise with the Department on where it is with this.  The Law Society would see it as perhaps between ten and 14 hubs, if one likes, where there would be a Circuit Court and a District Court sitting.  We are looking at a family law division, whereby a president of the family law division or a judge would be assigned as - the title probably would not have to be "president", but something else.  That person would be in charge of the division in the Circuit Court and the District Court.</p></speech>

The Law Society held a number of conferences and seminars on this about five or six years ago and four years ago at which we discussed the advisability of limiting judges to family law.  There was a concern among practitioners that if judges were to remain in family law for the entirety of their careers and were not switched around, it generally would not be a good thing,  It is advisable to get a mix of practice such that one comes into family law and stays there for a number of years and then may do it.  We want a general judge.  There are a number of judges who were appointed as specialist judges in the Circuit Court for insolvency arrangements and cases having regard to the capacity Act, which only recently came in.  Some of those judges are not sitting at all because they are specialist judges in the Circuit Court and there are no cases for them and because if one is appointed as a specialist judge, one cannot do other, more general work.  Those judges could be released immediately if they could be changed from specialists.  We are therefore not generally in favour of the appointment of specialist judges.  We are in favour of judges being properly trained and getting specialist experience.  We want a wide breadth of talent.  There are particular skills one picks up in other areas, particularly in criminal law, such that one is familiar with a variety of disciplines before one sits on the bench and when one is on the bench.  That is the Law Society's viewpoint.  We think one should be appointed as a general judge but one is assigned to this division.  Again, that can be done administratively and legislatively.</p></speech>

If legislation is passed to deal with an issue, resources may be allocated to that as a consequence.  The court rules are amended by statutory instruments, which have a different function.  To make this work would require a specific and detailed family law courts Act.  The publication of such a Bill would get all the stakeholders involved and substantially progress the issue.  The fact that the committee is looking at this area has substantially progressed things.  A significant number of new facts have come to everybody's attention in the context of this hearing, which is very useful.</p></speech>

However, that has only had application in the Dublin metropolitan district and, to an extent, to travelling judges.  As alluded to by Dr. Walsh, the President of the District Court is limited in what he or she can do in respect of a District Court hearing in Letterkenny, Cork or elsewhere.  A relatively limited amount can be achieved using that approach.  If one wants this dealt with on a more consistent and unified basis across the system, one must go down the legislative route to bring in rules that will apply in the same way in each venue.  We have a system with a very strong concept of judicial independence.  To a certain extent, judges operate in independent kingdoms and that, broadly speaking, is one of the reasons for the level of inconsistency in family law.  It is also evident in the inconsistency in judicial training: some judges are very keen to take up judicial training, but others are not.  Under the current structure, it is very difficult to insist that judges undergo such training.  However, if the issue were tackled on a legislative basis, one could set out the characteristics of a family court in a more structured way, which may address some of those issues.</p></speech>

I studied family law.  From an academic perspective it is very difficult to access case law, particularly given the anonymisation of parties.  How can that issue be dealt with even from an academic point of view?  Dr. Walsh mentioned the media perspective and the difficulties involved in getting an allocation and reporting family law cases.  From an academic perspective, what could the State do to facilitate more collaboration on an ongoing basis in order to drive consistency from the academic pillar and allow a higher degree of case reporting?  That would promote consistency across the Judiciary.</p></speech>

I participated in a study in involving a qualitative study of District Court childcare proceedings and looking at child protection in particular.  We ran into many difficulties with the <i>in camera</i>rule in the study.  At the time, we wrote to the Minister for Justice and Equality expressing our view that the <i>in camera</i>rule was having a chilling effect on that kind of research.  To put it simply, we were able to speak to professionals such as judges, solicitors, barristers, social workers and guardians <i>ad litem</i>, but could not speak to parents or children involved in the proceedings.  Obviously, that is a very significant gap in the research we were able to produce.  However, if we had gone down the road of trying to speak to parties, we would have immediately risked being in violation of the in camera rule.  An exception to the rule in regard to courtroom observation has enabled Dr. Carol Coulter to engage in the childcare reporting project whereby she may sit at the back of the court and observe and report on proceedings.  There is a similar exception for journalists but it is not being utilised to any great degree, as was mentioned.  However, research comes in many shapes and sizes.  Research involving he qualitative process of speaking to people who have been involved in proceedings or reviewing case files, for example, is currently very difficult to conduct because of the nature of the <i>in camera</i>rule.  It would be fantastic if there were some flexibility in that regard to accommodate a broader variety of research that would help to inform some of the decisions we need to make in the future.  I would love to see a recommendation in that respect in the report of the committee.</p></speech>

I have been impressed by their answers.  There are no winners in the family courts.  Whether it is the mother, the father or the children, somebody loses out.  I am no expert on family law.  The facilities in family law courts are ridiculous.  A child could walk in the door of the court with one parent and, a couple of hours later, leave with the other parent.  To me, there are no winners.  My main concerns are the heavy caseload of judges and whether judges make the right decisions.  Not a week passes without a mother or a father coming to my constituency office and stating that a certain judge usually sides with women or men or does not have sufficient expertise to hear the case.  What is our guests' impression of family law judges?  Certain judges may know more about particular topics.  In general, are judges making the right decisions?</p></speech>

For example, in Kildare there are family law sittings on the first and third Mondays of each month, with 80 to 100 cases listed on those days.  It is impossible for a judge to hear the voice of the child in each of those cases.  A judge will do his or her best to deal with the cases in the best possible way but that inevitably means that cases will be adjourned and put back to the next list.  Every list is full.  Judges are in a very difficult position.  There probably is a need for more judges.  There are certainly more cases in the system.  Judges should have enough time to deal with the issues properly.</p></speech>

In the absence of data and research, one gets myths, some of which are very mistaken.  However, we cannot show that until we have data.  We very much endorse Dr. O'Mahony's proposal regarding the capacity to carry out qualitative research and speak to the service users, namely, parents and children, to ask them their experience.  Quantitative data are also critically important because in its absence there are myths that we cannot prove right or wrong.  Much time and energy is spent trying to understand whether what is happening in the courts is right but we simply do not have the data to make that judgment.</p></speech>

However, we have evidence that judicial personality and preferences play a significant role.  For example, the project in which I was involved identified that some judges almost always appoint guardians <i>ad litem</i>, others do so in certain circumstances and others who are very slow to do so.  Judges seem to have set preferences that come through very strongly.  One of the most interesting things a judge stated during the compilation of the study was &quot;I don't know what my colleagues are doing&quot;.  In other words, judges are operating in silos and not necessarily looking at other examples of practice in order to try to gain consistency but, rather, doing their own thing in their own areas.</p></speech>

I want to go back to my busy constituency office in Dundalk.  Three fathers came into me this week alone and the reason they came in this week is because they realised that this was coming up in the Committee on Justice and Equality and that all of the witnesses would be here today.  They are saying to me that their voices are being muted, they feel as though they are being undervalued and they feel that as society is changing, fathers should play a bigger role in this.  One of the fathers said to me that fathers feel as though they are being under-represented and being actively excluded from the decision-making process and all matters pertaining to family law.  Do the witnesses feel as though these stakeholders have been omitted from the process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.756" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Keith Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019022000002#S00400"><p>We have flagged anecdotally that there is a problem with fathers because of the change in society.  I have been doing this work for about 20 years and there is a much greater involvement from fathers now than at the start of that period and there is also a great change in the role of both parents in terms of how involved they are with their children.  One of the real difficulties for fathers in Dublin, where I practise, is accommodation.  The result of a judicial separation or the end of a relationship is that one of the two people is not living with the other one and it is usually the father who is living in different accommodation.  The challenge is to get accommodation that is child friendly or even capable of having an overnight with the child.  At the minute in Dublin, unless one is on a significant salary, that challenge is huge.  If one is not living near one's children, the reality is that one does not see them as much and does not have as much contact with them.<br/><br/>The judges are trying to work with that and to some degree, our system of justice is an adversarial one.  It is up to the lawyers to put it up to the judges as well.  It is not inquisitorial justice where the judge intervenes.  An awful lot of family law cases are resolved by settlement, particularly judicial separation and divorce, which is where marital couples deal with custody and access issues.  Non-marital couples deal with it in the District Court, which is a lot more summary justice.  There is an unfair distinction between marital cases and non-marital cases because of the venue for the proceedings, how they are dealt with and the amount of time given to them.  Cases in the High Court will get the most time, the Circuit Court would get a bit less time and cases in the District Court get an awful lot less time.  That is reflected in the costs of the cases as well.<br/><br/>The <i>in camera</i>rule is unhelpful as well.  The difficulty is that there is a perception that fathers should perhaps be happy with every second weekend and one overnight during the week and some fathers will be happy with that but for fathers who are not happy with that kind of traditional model of access, it means that they probably have to go and get an expert report which will support their contention that they should have more access.  They can do that and they can dig their heels in but they have to dig their heels in a bit and it is not automatic.  One gets the report and one advocates for access but it can be done.  Most solicitors would push that for their clients but it does require a push and if one is fighting on a number of fronts in a case to do with finances, maintenance, a house and negotiating a mortgage, the children, who may be the most important part of it, sometimes get a bit lost in the mix.  The father is trying to juggle a full-time job, deal with his life, deal with access and deal with the breakdown of a relationship so it is understandable why people might not push it.  Ms Coughlan mentioned that we require some fairly serious quantitative research on the type of access orders that are being made and to lift the <i>in camera</i>rule and allow people who have been through the process to speak to someone such as Dr. Carol Coulter or other independent academics about their experience.  The family law courts need to reflect this and there is probably a need for training in this area as well to move it on.  As practitioners, without any objective evidence, based on our own cases and meetings, we believe that there are problems for fathers and that it is harder for fathers to get the access they want than it should be.  If it was a fair system that it the way it would work.</p></speech>

I would expect that the decisions in courts would somewhat reflect that.  They would not necessarily absolutely mirror that because we can see that once a family breaks up there might be a change in that pattern in terms of who is doing the primary caring.  To echo what Dr. O'Mahony said, is it the case that there are voices being muted?  What we are hearing is that all parties are being muted here.  We are not hearing from all parties.  To build a case and an argument on anecdotes may not be very helpful.  What we really need is the quantitative data that will allow us to actually say what we are looking at and have a conversation because we probably need a conversation about this but until we have the data in front of us, we cannot have that conversation.</p></speech>

What I mean by that is that I believe that one can represent oneself if one makes an application but one cannot take anyone else in unless they are either a solicitor or a barrister.  I spoke to a young lad from Dundalk recently who went to the family court and wanted to take in a friend of his to represent him but he was not allowed to take his friend in.  Is it true that one has to be either a solicitor or a barrister to represent a client?</p></speech>

Those are the current rules.  I said earlier that a person is quite entitled to represent themselves in court and they often do so because of the delays in getting legal aid.  There are many reasons people represent themselves in court but the<i>in camera</i>rule is to preserve the sanctity and the importance of family law proceedings.  The alternative might very well be that everybody would be walking in and sitting in on family law proceedings and that would not be optimum either.</p></speech>

There is a provision for that and a potential for that but the difficulty is around what the effect on the other person is if one is bringing in friends or relations.  There is a balance that a judge would have to strike in those types of proceedings as to how they can deal with the <i>in camera</i>rule and how they will enforce it.</p></speech>

It is the right thing to do because many people would go in and could be very nervous with a solicitor or barrister and they would feel a wee bit safer if they had someone beside them who they actually know.  The other half would not have a problem with that because it normally would not be a family member, it would be someone who might have similar experience who is trying to help the person to get the issue sorted out.  As I said earlier on, the most important thing is for the child to be sorted out.  I know it is in a closed room but I just cannot understand how someone cannot take someone else in with them to help them along the way because there are a lot of nervous individuals who like to have someone accompanying them to help them along.  To me, it does not seem fair.</p></speech>

However, if the <i>in camera</i>rule is interpreted strictly, which we tend to do in family law cases in this country, then that person is not a party to the proceedings, nor are they a legal representative and therefore the<i>in camera</i>rule essentially kicks in.</p><p>I have encountered the situation described, where somebody had a person to accompany him or her who was asked to leave by the judge.

I cannot understand why it is means-tested.  A Deputy was recently able to get legal aid and, in fairness, Deputies are pretty well paid.  I cannot understand how a mum or dad who cannot afford to get a solicitor or barrister cannot go in and get legal aid.  There seem to be two different approaches to family courts and other courts.

It is based on one's income but it is also weighted such that a person might get some credit if he or she has a mortgage, if he or she is the primary carer of the children.  It does not just depend on how much a person earns but also on the outgoings and what they are for.  Most legal aid is means-tested but it depends on the urgency of it.  It is a very bureaucratic system, with hoops to get through of submitting one's financial documentation and being put on a waiting list.  I do not think anybody could disagree that more people should be eligible for free legal aid from the Legal Aid Board.  It is rigorous because it has been judicially reviewed a number of times about how it conducts its mean-testing.  In my dealing with it on behalf of clients, I witnessed it in practice and I worked for the Legal Aid Board for a while.  Inside the system, it seems very difficult to get through the hoops of getting legal aid.</p></speech>

I can easily envisage a situation where the other person might be unrepresented or might be particularly vulnerable and might find this quite intimidating, especially if the McKenzie friend seems to be dominating the proceedings by taking an inordinately long time to whisper instructions, advice or such in the other person's ear.  One wonders about equality of arms and such.  A McKenzie friend in a family law setting is a tricky situation.  I would be happier with everybody being represented by a competent lawyer who, after all, has professional responsibilities not just to the client but to the court and his or her own professional body.  If a lawyer misbehaves, there are sanctions.  With great respect to McKenzie friends, since I am sure many are very responsible, good people, I would rather know that anybody there who is representing or assisting somebody in court has some training and some professional structure.</p></speech>

The severity of the <i>in camera</i>rule in Ireland means that Deputy Fitzpatrick is right that one will not be able to get somebody into court unless that person is a lawyer or a party to the case.</p></speech>

I believe that solicitors are obliged, at the time, to provide their clients with the cost of the procedure in writing.  My question for the Law Society is whether that is actually happening.  When solicitors meet their clients, are they sending them information on the breakdown of the cost?</p> <p>  The Law Society states that fees must be reasonable for the work undertaken and if a person is not happy, he or she can complain to the Law Society of Ireland.  Are there many complaints to the Law Society of Ireland about the costs for solicitors or barristers?</p></speech>

That does not state exactly what they are but sets out the rough basis for their costs.  It could be an hourly charge.  The solicitor could say that he or she normally charges a certain amount but that it may be something else if a certain thing happens.  It is not a precise estimate, simply the basis for the cost.  This will change radically in the coming months when section 150 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 comes into effect because a much more detailed estimate of solicitors' and barristers' costs will be required at the beginning of the case.  The system is currently more general but will get much more precise when the Legal Services Regulatory Authority brings in its complaint aspect.  The Legal Services Regulatory Authority is an independent body separate from the Law Society and solicitors, which was set up by the Government to deal with this.  There is currently a reasonably broad range of ways to satisfy the cost requirement and estimate.  It will get much more precise for solicitors and much better for consumers when section 150 comes in.</p> <p>  The Deputy's second question related to complaints.  The level of complaints to the Law Society is at an all-time low.  There are some complaints about costs but they are at one of the lowest historical levels with regard to both costs and other issues.  Costs are just one of the issues that people may complain about with regard to solicitors.</p></speech>

If a solicitor has to go to court on one day, that will cost a certain amount, but if there are constant adjournments, that will inevitably add to the cost.  If the system could be improved, I firmly believe that the cost will come down.  If a solicitor is in for just one day instead of four days, that would make a significant difference.</p></speech>

It is the first of three special hearings that the committee will undertake on this matter.  I referred earlier to Dr. Coulter coming to our next sitting.  It will not be next week because we will have to deal with the Brexit legislation with the Minister for Justice and Equality next week.  It will be in the following week, on 6 March.  Another hearing on the matter will be held on 13 March.  We hope to see the witnesses all back because we will have a public launch of our report which will, fingers crossed and touch wood, maybe be before the summer recess.  We might get there, pushing a little bit.  It will be good to have it done within that timeframe.  We will invite the witnesses to come back for that occasion and if they are not in a position to, we will certainly send them all a copy.</p> <p>  We thank the witnesses very much for their input, as I said earlier with regard to their written submissions, and for the quality of their responses to the questions posed by my colleagues on the committee.  It has been very helpful and informative.  I thank Ms Saoirse Brady, Ms Julie Ahern, Mr. Keith Walsh, Ms Helen Coughlan, Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar, Ms Caroline Counihan and Dr. Conor O'Mahony.

Members will be aware that this is a short but nevertheless important item of legislation.  It is required to enable ratification of the Istanbul Convention on combating violence against women and domestic violence.  I acknowledge the work of this committee last year in particular on the matter of the new Act relating to domestic violence and, a short time before that, on the very important Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017.  This is the final piece in the suite of legislation necessary to enable ratification of the convention.  I am very keen that we would be in a position to ratify this at the earliest possible opportunity.  Members will be aware of the timeframe involved.

The committee has met representatives of several Departments, agencies, representative bodies and other bodies on the theme of sustaining small rural and community business and we are delighted to have representatives of Enterprise Ireland and Offaly County Council's local enterprise office, LEO, with us today.  The committee has also considered the implications of Brexit for communities in rural and urban Ireland.  We would be interested to hear how we might mitigate the effects of Brexit.  Investment in rural broadband and digital technologies opens up opportunities for rural Ireland.  At the last meeting of the committee on 6 February we discussed smart communities and remote working with the Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development, Deputy Canney, and representatives of Grow Remote.</p><p>Today we welcome representatives of Abodoo, which has worked with Wexford County Council in preparing a talent heat map for County Wexford.  Abodoo is also involved in local hubs, Enterprise Ireland, local authorities and LEOs in encouraging local employment.  Representatives from HQ Tralee are also present and there is an interesting story about its successes with co-working hubs in Tralee and Listowel in County Kerry.  I welcome the following witnesses to the meeting: Mr. Mark Christal, Mr. Michael Brougham and Ms Rowena Dwyer from Enterprise Ireland; Ms Anna Marie Delaney, Ms Orla Martin and Ms Geraldine Beirne from Offaly County Council LEO; Ms Vanessa Tierney and Ms Louise O'Conor from Abodoo; and Mr. Ken Tobin of HQ Tralee and Tralee Chamber Alliance.</p><p>I remind members, staff, witnesses and people in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile telephones as they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult to report on the meeting.

I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Michael Brougham, regional director for the midlands and mid-east, and Ms Rowena Dwyer, manager of our policy, planning and corporate relations department.  I intend to use my statement as a brief, not to go through it in full but to select the key points.<br/><br/>Enterprise Ireland's primary remit is to support indigenous companies engaged in manufacturing and internationally traded services.  The agency also has a responsibility for foreign direct investment in the food and natural resources area.  The majority of the companies that Enterprise Ireland works with are small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  Through a national network of ten offices the agency works with these companies to assist them to start, innovate, grow their business, target and secure export sales in international markets and strengthen their competitiveness.  These companies cross a wide range of sectors and are located in every county throughout the country.<br/><br/>Enterprise Ireland works in partnership with a wide range of enterprise development partners to support a regional enterprise development agenda.  These include the local enterprise offices, the business incubation centres and the Design &amp;amp; Crafts Council of Ireland, whose funding comes through Enterprise Ireland.  In addition, upon direction from the Government, the agency administers funding schemes to non-agency clients, such as the online retail scheme launched by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in late 2018 to support eligible SMEs in the retail sector to develop a more competitive online offer.<br/><br/><b><i></i></b>Reflecting the strength of the Irish economy and of global markets in 2018, Enterprise Ireland companies reported strong employment performance.  In 2018 the employment survey reported the highest employment in the history of the agency with 215,207 people employed in Enterprise Ireland-supported companies, 9,119 new jobs created after losses are taken into account and employment growth across all regions.  Our clients play an important role in the regional economy.  For example, in 2018 some 64% of employment was in client companies located outside Dublin and 61% of new jobs reported were created in companies located outside Dublin.  Enterprise Ireland-supported companies sustain over 375,000 direct and indirect jobs nationwide.  The total spend in the economy from Enterprise Ireland clients across payroll and goods and services purchased reached &euro;26.79 billion in 2017.</p><p>Through our network of 33 international offices, Enterprise Ireland has assisted client companies to increase their exports to a record &euro;22.7 billion in 2017, a growth of 7% compared to 2016's exporting results.  Importantly, Enterprise Ireland's clients are increasingly diversifying their global footprint beyond the UK.</p><p> We work with client companies under a number of key pillars.  First is our work with start-up companies.  We have provided full details of that work in the written submission provided to the committee.  Worth noting is Enterprise Ireland's new frontiers development programme, the national entrepreneur development programme for early-stage startups, which is run in partnership with 14 institutes of technology throughout the country.  Between 2016 and 2018, Enterprise Ireland supported 496 entrepreneurs across the country on this programme.  Innovation is essential for companies to be competitive internationally and to win market share.  Enterprise Ireland is working with its clients to drive innovation activity via a number of supports  In terms of market diversification, Enterprise Ireland is actively working with companies with global ambition to internationalise, and in doing so, diversify their global footprint.  Competitiveness is critical for companies to scale, internationalise and assist client companies to stay ahead of competition.  In 2018, Enterprise Ireland launched an operational excellence offer.  This offer supports established SMEs to target a whole of company transformation, including capital investment, business innovation and training.</p><p> There are some challenges of which we are, obviously, very mindful.  The outcome of the Brexit negotiations remains uncertain.  Brexit will result in increased costs and trade disruptions for both exporting and importing companies.  To support client companies navigate potential challenges, Enterprise Ireland has engaged in a programme of building resilience in Irish exporting companies, focused on innovation, market diversification and competitiveness, and addressing the awareness and preparedness of companies to Brexit.  Being prepared for Brexit is critical for companies as long-term, structural and disruptive change will emerge.  To promote awareness and supported by a national Prepare for Brexit campaign, Enterprise Ireland has developed and launched a Brexit SME scorecard, an interactive online platform which can be used by all companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.  To date over 4,435 companies have utilised this scorecard.  The agency has also launched a Be Prepared grant to support the costs of SME clients up to &euro;5,000 in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise the opportunities arising from Brexit.  To date, 156 companies have been approved for support under this initiative.  Enterprise Ireland client companies are taking action to prepare for Brexit.  A September 2017 survey reported that 38% of clients surveyed had taken Brexit actions.  In May 2018 this figure increased to 85% of client companies surveyed.  The survey reported that client companies are taking action in areas such as market diversification, developing strategic partnerships, improving operational competitiveness, improving financial management and strengthening business in the UK.</p><p> Skills remain a key focus of the agency.  Investment in skills and human capital is critical to driving innovation, competitiveness and diversification in Irish businesses.  As the economy approaches full employment, the challenges of matching enterprise skills needs with available labour supply comes into greater focus.  In partnership with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the agency is supporting client companies to identify and address their critical skills needs.</p><p> I turn to support for enterprise development in the regions.  Enterprise Ireland is seeking to ensure that all regions throughout the country are growing optimally based on their innate and unique strengths and capabilities.  In this way, jobs will be sustained, created and future proofed and the reach of the agency's client base will be expanded.  Within an Enterprise Ireland context, there are three critical components of this.  First, we support client companies to grow in all regions.  Second, we are building a regional infrastructure that can support enterprise activity including co-working.  Third, we are harnessing the enterprise potential of regions and the entrepreneurial assets within them.  Enterprise Ireland has made a significant investment in supporting the establishment of infrastructure that can house enterprise activity in regions throughout the country.  Details are presented in the table included in our written submission and include the national network of business innovation centres and specialist bio-incubation facilities, community enterprise centres, regional accelerators and business innovation centres.  I note also the community enterprise initiative under which 32 projects received funding to support public and private community enterprises.  The investment detailed has increased the capacity of regions to offer co-working spaces.  Co-working facilities have an important role to play in the rebalancing of regional growth nationally.  These facilities can help regions to retain skills and talent and assist companies with skills retention.  Giving workers the ability to remain in their localities daily has a positive economic and social impact locally.</p><p> Under its regional enterprise development fund, Enterprise Ireland has approved &euro;60 million in investment for 42 projects located throughout the country.  This competitive fund, provided by Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation through Enterprise Ireland, is a key action to support the Regional Action Plan for Jobs, regional enterprise plans and the Action Plan for Rural Development.  In line with its investment in regions to date, corporate strategy and national enterprise and regional development policy, the agency will undertake initiatives that will foster an environment where jobs will be created and sustained in regions allowing people to live and work in their local areas.  Such initiatives will include fostering increased resilience and productivity within client companies throughout all regions to enhance productivity and agility to respond to economic shocks, such as those emerging from any kind of Brexit; balancing regional development in rural, urban and regional city locations by maximising the investment in regional infrastructure, such as that in co-working facilities, to retain mobile talent in the regions, and making second sites in regional locations a feasible strategy for agency clients with growth plans.  We are also seeking to secure food FDI projects in regions and to address the skills challenge facing clients.</p><p> Enterprise Ireland is aware that further efforts are needed to ensure that companies are resilient to the challenges they face as they start and scale in regions throughout the country.  The agency understands the important positive and social impact these companies play in their local areas.  To this end, the agency will continue to work with client companies to support their efforts on innovation, competitiveness and diversification, which are the key attributes of internationally competitive companies.  Second sites, skills needs and co-working spaces in regions that build on the agency's investment will also be a key focus.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to work with Government and non-governmental stakeholders to support rural, urban and regional city development so that client companies can build on their ambitious strategies to sustain and create jobs throughout the country.

I am accompanied by Ms Anna Marie Delaney, chief executive of Offaly County Council and Ms Geraldine Beirne, business adviser with our local enterprise office.  For the purposes of this statement, I intend to address four areas, namely local enterprise office, or LEO, involvement; the local authority contribution; the wider context, future development and policy suggestions.  <br/><br/>There are 31 LEOs across the local authority network.  A LEO is the first stop shop for anyone wishing to start a business in Ireland.  LEOs also promote entrepreneurship and act as advocates and catalysts for the establishment of a best-practice enterprise culture.  Across the network of 31 LEO offices, staff are actively involved in supporting co-working hubs.  Some do this through local authority hubs and some do it through their involvement with publicly supported designated activity companies, DACs, or companies limited by guarantee, CLGs.<br/><br/>The primary focus of LEOs is to encourage entrepreneurship and start-ups.  In this context, managed co-working hubs are a valuable addition to the ecosystem of enterprise supports.  They provide much more than a physical centre for start-ups and expanding enterprises.  The interactions between early stage entrepreneurs, remote workers, more experienced business owners and LEO staff and supports contribute strongly to the enterprise culture of a town or village.  Tenants may or may not be directly supported, depending on the nature of the relevant business, but a wide cohort is supported through LEO entrepreneurial development programmes, networking and other business supports.<i></i>I refer in particular to sector-specific hubs.  Managed co-working hubs with sectoral themes provide new opportunities to develop clusters of expertise and innovation.  Sector-specific hubs include food hubs and other hubs with a defined theme.  For example, we established The Junction business innovation centre in Offaly in 2015.  This centre has a special focus on design, software and renewable energies.  We are building on this with funding of almost &euro;500,000 from Enterprise Ireland's regional development fund to develop the STREAM creative suite in Birr.  This new co-working hub will leverage the big data generated from the Irish low frequency array, I-LOFAR, radio telescope and connect researchers and businesses in areas using big data.</p><p>The theme is STREAM, an acronym for science, technology, research, engineering, arts and mathematics.  The businesses include everything from animation to astronomy to robotics to telecoms to software.  A dedicated hub such as this can create a very compelling proposition for IDA Ireland to attract related foreign direct investment to the area.  Furthermore, sector specific hubs can be a beacon for members of the diaspora looking to return or invest in their home counties.</p><p> The Local Government Reform Act 2014 provided for the strengthening of the role of the local authorities in economic, social and community development.  Over recent years, local authorities have been contributing to the delivery of the physical infrastructure of co-working hubs and, in many cases, have been providing support for operational costs.  Some hubs have been undertaken directly by local authorities and others have been delivered with support funding through LEADER, the town and village renewal scheme, urban and rural regeneration and Enterprise Ireland regional development funds.  Furthermore, local authorities have been providing supports for the development of smart communities via the local authority network of broadband officers.  They also prioritise needs through the network of 296 broadband communication points throughout Ireland and collaborate with providers and funders to provide fibre and Wi-Fi solutions for businesses, communities and tourist areas.  Library services provide meeting rooms and space for informal hot-desking and for pre-start-ups researching business ideas.  The local community and development committees assist community groups to incorporate co-working spaces into community centres.  With regard to skills audits and commuter surveys, local authorities, in conjunction with the LEOs and business support units, are commissioning research data to stimulate economic investment.  These data will also highlight opportunities for remote working and cluster development.</p><p> In a wider context, remote working in all of its forms can be very beneficial to individuals, businesses, communities and the environment.  Volunteer groups such as Grow Remote are playing an important role in communicating the benefits of remote working.  Individuals can benefit from reduced commutes and increased work-life balance.  By introducing remote working, businesses can retain staff and grow staff numbers by accessing a wider talent pool.  Communities benefit as busy co-working hubs contribute to vibrant towns and villages.  This, in turn, leads to increased spend in the locality.  The environment benefits from a reduction in carbon emissions.  A reduction of commuters benefits Dublin and allows it thrive as an international business and visitor destination.  The inclusion of remote working and co-working hubs as strategic objectives or supporting actions in a number of the regional enterprise plans demonstrates the importance of the concept and commitment to further development.</p><p> With regard to future development and policy suggestions, leveraging the opportunities of co-working hubs requires skilled managers.  At present, the funding supports for managers are for three years' salary.  We suggest funding support for five years would be more appropriate to allow the centres the required timescale to become viable and self-sustaining.</p><p> The next phase is enhanced connectivity between hubs and will involve exploring ways to support a formal network of co-working hubs so as to leverage economies of scale in research, collaboration, training and funding opportunities, include landing spaces for foreign direct investment and explore ways to facilitate IDA Ireland companies to establish an initial footprint in a town or region via the use of co-working hubs.  The promotion of co-working hubs and other forms of remote working could benefit from legislation on developing a national policy on remote working.  This could include appropriate legislation on employment law and could enable remote working to become the norm.  We reference the UK flexible working regulations of 2014.  Employers could be incentivised through consideration of an enhanced Revenue scheme or allowance for remote workers.  There could also be public sector pilots that explore opportunities for public sector employees.  This could include enhanced opportunities for remote working, either from home or through the use of dedicated co-working hubs in local authority buildings on a reciprocal basis.</p><p> I thank committee members for their time.  The document pack we have provided includes details of some initiatives taking place throughout the country.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Louise O'Connor.  We launched Abodoo in Gorey in north County Wexford.  We were a LEO client and have moved on to Enterprise Ireland.  We launched a year and a quarter ago from a co-working space, so we have a personal story about the impact of co-working on our business.</p> <p>  I have been involved in recruitment and talent acquisition for more than 15 years.  Seven or eight years ago I was restricted from working because of illness and I could not commute.  It was then I began to realise that around the globe many professionals could be working but for whatever reason, such as family commitments or childcare, they are restricted from doing so.  The reason we are here today is to speak about a successful pilot we ran in Wexford with the support of Wexford LEO and the local authority.  We had a real opportunity to identify the skills in County Wexford and present them to companies considering locations throughout the country.  If we look at Ireland, our unemployment rate is very low, which is brilliant, but we still have 79 unemployment blackspots throughout the country.  Mirroring these with co-working capacity provides a real opportunity to position rural Ireland as an opportunity for companies.</p> <p>  There are three key pillars for inward investment in rural Ireland.  The first is office space and capacity, and the Abodoo platform now lists more than 200 co-working spaces, which means there is at least one in every county.  The second pillar is connectivity, and this is improving.  From a remote working perspective, there are no connectivity challenges to working in rural Ireland at present because every county has connectivity and every co-working space has the best connectivity.  I moved back from England four years ago to 3 Mb broadband in the house.  We now have 140 Mb, so there is a real opportunity for companies.  The third pillar required by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland is the missing ingredient, and this is skills and talents.  We must question why Facebook and Salesforce make announcements to employ people in Dublin when 700,000 skilled people from throughout the country could be employed.  What is missing is the ability to provide data on them.</p> <p>  Until our pilot, information provided on the skills available was through the census and alumni information from various colleges.  The way we have built Abodoo means we capture a lot of data on what people are looking for with regard to skills, salary expectations and connectivity.  We were requested to produce a talent heat map of the available skills, initially just in technology, to present to some companies looking at the co-working space in Gorey.  We ran the pilot over six weeks.  We ran marketing campaigns above and below the line.  We had advertisements on the back of buses showing a mother and son and a phrase suggesting spending more time with the real boss, and we had signs suggesting the train will miss you.</p> <p>  Over a few weeks, hundreds of people registered.  We assumed they would be the tired exhausted commuters from Wexford to Dublin, but they have been a range of people, including those outside the country who want to come home but for whom house prices in Dublin are too expensive.  They stated that if they could go to Wexford, they would return in a flash.  We had people with mobility issues who cannot get to Dublin.  There were also very skilled parents in their mid to late 30s who could not justify going to Dublin when the cost of childcare was added in.  There were also older people who were not ready to retire.  An array of people registered.  We captured all of this, mined it for data and produced a talent heat map that gives granular information not only on technology skills but on exactly how many Python or Java developers there are.</p> <p>  One of the surprising facts that came out of the talent heat map was that salary expectations were 10% to 20% lower than in cities.  I raise this as a very big point for employers.</p><p>Many employers think that they will have to make a significant investment to embrace smart working.  However, they save on expectations alone because house prices can be lower by one third or a half.  The other thing which surprised us was that only half the people were in Wexford.  The other half were in Dublin or elsewhere and said that they wanted to return.  We ran the case study this time last year.  We provided it to the LEO, Enterprise Ireland, the county council and IDA Ireland.  In September, IDA Ireland successfully landed the first company into the hatch lab.  It intends to employ hundreds of people in the next three years.  Significantly, it wants to embrace what we call smart working.</p><p> I will say something bold.  I do not think Ireland is ready for remote working as people assume that means working from home.  We are ready for smart working and more flexibility in our working model.  Companies such as the one that has landed in Gorey intend to let people work two to three days in the co-working capacity and the other days at home.  That means that even though the building has only seating for 300, 500 staff can be employed because of the use of hot-desking.</p><p> We have worked and collaborated with LEOs, county councils, IDA Ireland, and Enterprise Ireland, and we are undertaking a roadshow with the Small Firms Association to educate people locally.  We are partnered with Grow Remote which is doing a great job at a community level.  We have a national partnership with Vodafone, educating people around smart working and educating businesses about its benefits and value.  We are looking to support Vodafone in opening up more gigabit hubs.  The gigabit hubs initiative was launched in 2017.  Since then, 29 new companies have moved their business to the hubs with an additional 80 people, with future plans for an extra 200 jobs over the next three years.</p><p> I will outline some of the benefits of smart working from a company's perspective.  As a small country, 1.9 million people commute to work daily.  People who sit in traffic are quite tired by the time they get to the office, particularly when children are thrown into the mix.  It has been proven globally that attrition improves by 40% when employers embrace flexible working.  Productivity increases by 15% and the overall saving to the company on average is &euro;10,000 and to the individual is &euro;7,000 annually.  That is &euro;7,000 that the individual can save.  If such people are staying in their local community, we can ask where they are likely to spend this.</p><p> The LEOs have invited Abodoo to make a presentation to all their 31 offices in April about our work in Wexford with a view to where we can extend it.  We are looking forward to this.  We are building technology not only to pull talent to heat maps but in future to do things such as connecting people in co-working places at a local level so that people with similar skills can come together, as has been done in Offaly.  We are launching smart working retreats - a lovely way to build on tourism - and leveraging the amazing co-working spaces that are coming up around the country, such as converted banks, to allow people to holiday and work here for a month.  We are plugging in e-learning.  The beauty of smart working, working from home, connectivity and co-working is that it is possible to learn from anywhere and upskill.  That will be the future.</p><p> If we can work out a national plan for remote or smart working, it will have some key benefits.  One is that it improves air quality by reducing carbon emissions.  Spending in the local economy will increase.  We can reduce unemployment in blackspots.  We can give people back time that they can spend with their families.  We are asking the Government's assistance on a number of areas in the coming years.  First is help in introductions that would help us to fast-track the conversations that we are having county to county.  Second, we seek support around talent mapping skills, extending what we have done in Wexford to the whole country.  That would be data that we could provide to companies in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere as well as companies that are in talks with IDA Ireland about locating in Ireland.  Finally, we seek support from the disruptive technology fund to mobilise the app that we are using, which is on the web, and localise it so that it is key to each county.</p><p> With 42% of the population living in rural Ireland compared with 27% living in rural areas across Europe, we have a real opportunity to become the smart working leader of the European Union.  We can reverse the brain drain and bring back some of the half million people who have left our country in the past ten years.</p><p> We have provided the Wexford talent heat map to members for their information.  I will conclude with our motto: life is a journey, not a commute.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.812" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Tobin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019022000002#E00300"><p>In 2016, my business partner, Tom O&rsquo;Leary, and I set about funding and developing the first co-working hub in County Kerry, which is also one of the first in Ireland.  As others noted, there are now more than 200 such hubs around the country.  Privately funded and operated, HQ Tralee grew from one building in Tralee town centre in 2016, a property which had sat idle for more than nine years, to a second building in Tralee the following year, and in October 2018 we opened a third building, this time in Listowel, a small town about ten miles from Tralee.</p> <p>  Today our hubs provide a home for almost 200 people in County Kerry.  We recognised the essential need for these spaces within Tralee and Listowel, like many other towns around Ireland.  In total we have provided in excess of 15,000 cu. ft of shared office, co-working, meeting and community space within our hubs at a fraction of the cost of a space in a larger city.  Our hubs all offer 1 Gb broadband connection using a combination of local Internet service providers and the SIRO-Vodafone&rsquo;s gigabit hub initiative.  We house a wide range of individuals and companies which are outlined in my submission.</p> <p>  I want to highlight some key factors that we have learned through our involvement with this industry, as one of the first groups to operate in Ireland.  The committee will have heard from previous speakers, not only today, but also in recent sittings, that remote working, enabling broadband connectivity, and supporting hubs are critical to reviving and sustaining rural and regional towns.  I will not reiterate the same things but rather demonstrate what has actually happened.</p> <p>  One of the key things we have learned over recent years is that the importance of these hubs is not solely on the service that it provides for companies and remote workers, but in their economic and social benefit to a town.  In the past three years we have seen every day examples of how a hub and supporting people to return to a town can actually benefit the local economy.  This is not just on a financial level, but it is worth noting that our hubs have an average salary of more than twice that of the local economy, which means double the spend per person in the locality.</p> <p>  On a human level, we have seen business owners and newly returned remote workers getting involved in supporting local Tidy Town groups, chambers of commerce, sports clubs, charities and volunteer organisations.  One of the main benefits of working from a regional town, with low commute times and a better quality of life, is that these people have more time to get involved in organisations and causes that matters to them.  As these individuals typically have been used to a city commute and a longer working week, they have more time on their hands to get involved.  Nor is it just the town in which the hub is based that benefits.  Returning remote workers and SME business owners are also opting to live in quieter villages or townlands near, but not in, the main town.  Typically, the people we see returning are at the age that they are considering starting, or have recently started, a family.  To a degree the companies and remote workers we have supported in returning to Tralee and Listowel have returned because they had a connection with the location.  We have found it tough to attract back the younger generation in their mid-20s and graduates.</p> <p>  On a business level, there are two critical elements to providing this opportunity for regional and rural towns.  The hubs support the growth not only of the businesses based within the hubs, but also the businesses in that town.  This is not anecdotal, this is real.  We see it every day ourselves.  The support to businesses is very wide and varied.  In view of time constraints, I will focus on a couple of key items.  One area is staff retention.  If any employer of an SME in Dublin or Cork in specific technical sectors is asked, he or she will respond that staff retention is the one thing that is killing their business.  This issue of not being able to hang on to good staff is being compounded by a number of key factors over which this Government has an element of control.  Quality staff are being hoovered up by the large multinationals, and invariably they are being lured from our indigenous companies at an alarming rate.  We all welcome each announcement of the next Facebook, Google or Salesforce entering the Dublin market, but behind that is a real concern that smaller companies will not be able to retain their skilled staff.  Each big announcement also adds even more pressure onto an already overheated housing market in our large cities, forcing even more people to seek housing farther out of the city, adding hours each day to their commute. </p> <p>  What the hubs in regional locations offer to these companies is an opportunity.  I cannot stress this enough.  We are selling ourselves short if we pitch these regional locations as a compromise.  These regional locations are an absolute godsend to many indigenous SMEs.  For example, a little over a year ago, one company joined us primarily because the larger companies in Dublin were poaching its staff.</p><p>Since coming down, this two-man operation has grown to seven people and by the end of 2019, will have grown to 20 people, purely because it is able to retain its staff based in a regional town.</p><p> To support staff retention, and to echo previous speakers, these hubs present a major opportunity for large organisations in Dublin to retain their staff by allowing them to work remotely, and have a better quality of life.  We have seen this ourselves, but larger companies need to be put under greater pressure to allow their staff have this choice.  As mentioned earlier, all bar one of our existing remote workers pay for themselves.  Their companies will not support them.  While they say they will support them, they will not financially support them to relocate to a regional location.</p><p> The second set of businesses that benefit from the hubs are actually not based in the hubs themselves.  Those business are the local ones, the shops, restaurants and pubs, around the town.  When we opened our first hub in 2016, we knew that the streets around our hub needed some support.  Our first building in Tralee was a large vacant property.  While a fantastic modern building, it had lain idle for over nine years and faced out onto a semi-derelict side street.  We developed a plan to promote the neighbouring shops, bars and restaurants and help them raise their footfall.  We formed a community of businesses that worked together which led to us taking on a privately funded regeneration project for the street around us in Tralee to such an extent that two new business opened up in that vacant street.</p><p> Listowel, where we opened our latest hub, did not need such support.  They are national Tidy Towns award winners from 2018.  Where they needed our support was on infrastructure.  We placed too much emphasis on the national broadband roll-out.  In the case of Listowel, we did not have access to high-speed fibre.  We were faced with a choice of operating off 70 Mb broadband or doing it ourselves.  Therefore, we engaged with a local Internet service provider and did it ourselves.  We invested in that company.  We supported that company to provide 1 Gb broadband to our building in Listowel, which is now available to the entire town.</p><p> I mentioned earlier that where we struggle is in attracting the younger generation to our hubs.  Through my work with Tralee Chamber Alliance, Tralee's chamber of commerce, and connecting with chambers all over the country, I know that Tralee and Listowel are not unlike many towns in regional Ireland.  There has been a drain of talent and younger people over the past number of years and a very visible cause and effect of this drain is the daytime vibrancy and nightlife in these towns.  Our high streets are struggling, rural bars and nightclubs are in free fall, our institutes of technology are fighting the larger universities to attract students and as the cities grow and expand, the younger generation are being lured and retained there.  Kerry, for example, now has the oldest average age in the country, and the statistics show that it has a dip in the mid-20s age bracket.  After the collapse of the Celtic tiger when so many of our young people left Ireland, everyone cried foul for a lost generation.  Today, the same thing is happening, only that they are emigrating from a rural to a city location.</p><p> When I started my submission, I said I would not focus on issues that others have looked at already.  I want to finish with what we in business call "the ask".  This is about connecting the dots and trying to see can we do this in an accelerated meaningful way.  We already mentioned that there are more than 200 hubs around the country.  More will be built but what we need to do is increase the demand for companies and remote workers to go to these regional locations.  Based on our experience, we see two quick-win items that could be done now.</p><p> First, we see an immediate need for a Government backed team - supported by Enterprise Ireland, the LEOs and the local chambers of commerce - the sole remit of which is to connect SMEs in Dublin and Cork with regional town hubs and remote work organisations.  Utilising the industry connections of Enterprise Ireland and the on-the-ground connections of the local chambers, this team should have the sole function of providing a funnel of companies and remote workers who want to escape the larger cities to set up in regional locations.  This team, as was mentioned earlier, should have the backing of a dedicated incentive programme to support these companies and remote workers in their relocation.  There are numerous examples, in the States and on the Continent, of successful incentive programmes where relocation assistance packages are provided to enable remote workers and SMEs to move to regional locations and these are done for a fraction of what is currently being spent on other avenues to create jobs.  Not only would this have the benefit of supporting these regional towns but it would take the pressure off the larger cities.</p><p> Second, we need support in the regional towns to attract back and retain the younger generation and families.  Without adequate funding to enhance the offering on the ground, younger workers will not consider these regional towns.  Specific investment must be made in towns to increase their vibrancy and support the retail and service sectors so that younger workers do not feel like that they are compromising on their experiences.  Locations must become more vibrant.  I would suggest utilising the document, A Framework for Town Centre Renewal.  My ask would be to legislate for the establishment of funded teams to support these regional towns.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak.</p></speech>

On this committee, our particular concern is regional and rural areas and how we can sustain livelihoods in those regions.</p> <p>  For the record, I acknowledge the work of Enterprise Ireland over the past number of years.  According to the recorded figures for 2018, there are now 2.23 million people working in Ireland.  It is the highest ever figure.  I am conscious of the work of the city and county LEOs as well, supporting entrepreneurs and new businesses.  Many such businesses started in the face of a harsh recession.  It was a bounce back by amazing people supported by the State agencies and the LEOs.  We should always acknowledge that when we can and I certainly want to do so here this morning.</p> <p>  There are new challenges now.  With the employment levels where they are, quality of life, smarter working and sustainability are the challenges for Ireland and we have a role in this committee to try to devise new policies to address the issues the delegations have raised here this morning.  I told some of them, on the way in, that often they are way ahead of the posse.  Often we are in a bubble here in Leinster House dealing with retrospective issues, which we have to do, but the real vision often comes from outside.  We are hearing it here today again and I want to acknowledge that, especially with the likes of Abodoo.  We have had Grow Remote in here as well.  These are people who have a vision for how our society should develop and where employment should go.  It certainly can fit with the needs of modern families and work-life patterns.</p> <p>  I was interested to hear that talent heat maps of Wexford have been produced.  Before we do anything in terms of policy, of course one needs to have evidence of where our assets and resources are and how we should best leverage those.  Often the easy answers are right in front of our noses.  Wexford has shown the way in terms of mapping out the talent that is available to it if a business wants to establish itself in Wexford, in smarter hubs or whatever.  It is a good starting point for anyone.  I take on board Ms Tierney's recommendation that we should have a national talent map.  Recently, I was in discussions with a company that is looking at establishing in the south east in the financial services area.  We met IDA Ireland representatives and the first thing they said was that they would have to do a skills analysis for the south east.  I had a bit of an argument with them.  I said that most of our graduates, unfortunately, have left the south east and are either in Dublin or elsewhere.  I stated that the skills analysis should not only be of the south east.  In fact, it should be of those all over the world because people want to move home.  I was delighted to hear Ms Tierney repeat it here this morning.  There is a mindset in officialdom.  I acknowledge the great work IDA Ireland is doing but it more or less boxes off regions and looks at where the talent in a region is presently, whereas I believe it must have a far more outward looking view.  I am only using the south east as an example because I am from the south east.  I am from Waterford, which is one of the employment black spots in the country.  It is one of the areas which has suffered the greatest brain drain.  Our graduates qualify in Waterford but, unfortunately, leave the region.  That happens right around the country.  Often I have compared Dublin with an economic vortex that is sucking in our best resources.</p> <p>  We need to think of new ways to try and get those brains and those graduates - as Mr. Tobin said, that life - back into the regions.  I certainly welcome the positive outlook that has been presented to us here this morning.  It is not merely an outlook.  There are real solutions being presented here.  I visited Boxworks, a co-working location in Waterford.  They have created a smart hub where hot desks or small offices are provided to any person, entity or body that wants to come in and work.  They are sharing ideas and resources and building out.  The good news is the second Boxworks office is opening in a few weeks in Waterford and it is doing exactly what the witnesses are talking about.</p> <p>  The evidence shows the entrepreneurs and the people are ahead of the policymakers.  We need to catch up.  How we do that, I believe, is the discussion we need to have here today.</p><p> Do we need to change our view on co-ordination overall?  While I acknowledged the work of Enterprise Ireland at the start, should it have a specific department to consider how to connect the hubs and new ways of supporting entrepreneurs?  I am aware it is doing this and its representatives will tell us it is but we need specific resources to attend to the new demands that exist.  These include demands for smarter living, smarter travel, smarter work, co-operation and joining resources.  There are examples.  The delegates stated there are 200 hubs around Ireland.  I mentioned two, in Waterford.  We need to co-ordinate all of these and secure policy support and incentives.  How do we do this better?  If the witnesses were in our shoes, as policymakers, where would they believe real change is needed to bring about the gear shift that is required?  Rather than looking at traditional ways of supporting employment, how can we engage with the employers to build their confidence?  We need to build their confidence to show this is a new way of working and that they can trust their staff, perhaps using a stepped process.  Reference was made to going to a co-working location first, perhaps on a part-time basis, and perhaps doing the rest from home.  There is work to be done on how to build confidence among employers to show them they need not spend a fortune building offices in Dublin, with staff crazed by the cost of living and cost of rent, and that they can proceed in a different way.  How can we package this concept and start selling it to employers?</p></speech>

Last week, representatives from Grow Remote were here to talk about the work they are doing on similar lines.  I represent Sligo-Leitrim and live in south Leitrim, which is quite rural.  It is probably one of the employment black spots mentioned.  Interestingly, somebody I was talking to some days ago was considering a job online &mdash; I believe it was with eBay &mdash; but it had to be done from home because some of the work was to be in the evening and some in the early morning.  The individual had no Internet so there was not a chance of getting the job.  That is a big problem for people who live in certain rural areas.  I accept that high-speed broadband is available in many regional towns, etc., but the problem arises when one goes out into the countryside a bit.  We need to address this.</p> <p>  There is great potential, however.  It was suggested there should be a Government-backed team to pull it all together  Is Grow Remote doing a bit of that?  Are other small groups doing part of what is being talked about?  Are the delegates saying we need to work in a proper, organised fashion and have the Government step in?  I agree this would be the way forward.  What can happen is that the process can become bitty rather than streamlined across the whole region.</p> <p>  Mr. Tobin spoke about making regional towns more attractive for people to live and work in.  Much of this concerns having the correct infrastructure in place.  A good few years ago, Peter Quinn Consultancy Services in Fermanagh carried out a study on foreign direct investment on where companies wanted to send their executives to live and work.  It was found that education was a big factor.  The companies wanted to know their managers would have good schools, in addition to recreation facilities and hospitals, and that healthcare would be adequately provided for.  The study found that executives also like to have nice restaurants and theatres to go to.  The companies like to be close to airports so executives can fly in, meet in company offices and get back on a plane and fly away quickly.  These infrastructural elements are key but we should not lose sight of the reality that it is not just about good roads and transport; it is also about having the services in place for people who want to live in the areas in question.  This will be key to getting people to come back to live in rural areas.</p> <p>  The delegates felt legislation to develop a national policy on remote working is required so it will become the norm.  Reference was made to flexible working regulations.  There is already legislation for people to have the option of part-time work.  An employer has to accept that an employee can request it.  We need to examine this in connection with remote working.  On the question of incentives for employers, revenue schemes and allowances for remote workers, most people are talking about the private sector whereby a lot of the work is done at home on a laptop, but the public sector also comes into play.  While we have had many rows about decentralisation in the past, it is really about getting it right and working out how we can do it properly.  I know staff in the public sector who work two days at home and three in the office.  Therefore, there is an element of working from home in the public sector.  The key task, as Mr. Tobin said, is making sure that we streamline the process and that the Government takes charge of it, organises it, structures it and drives it forward.</p> <p>  Working from home might suit individuals very well when they have children, for example, but as they get on a little and experience the empty nest, they might discover sitting at home in front of the laptop all day is not very sociable.  The hubs would be a better model for many.</p> <p>  Let me refer to the rights of the employee.  Everyone who works in this establishment is clearly a member of a trade union and has rights, which can be established and worked through.  An employee can do something about a problem if one arises.  If, however, an employee is working at home, or in a hub where there is only one other employee working for the same company, there needs to be some way to ensure his or her rights will be upheld.  Perhaps we could speak to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions about how it is organising in this regard.  It is a separate issue.</p> <p>  Co-ordinating this initiative is what we really need to drive.  I strongly believe we need to ensure a commitment by the Government to provide the correct infrastructure.  A major part of that infrastructure is broadband but there are also other aspects.</p> <p>  When people talk about rural Ireland, they talk about equality.  The difference between the equality and equity was explained to me once very well.  In rural areas, we need to achieve equity.  Consider the circumstances when two people who want to look over a wall that is too high are each given a box of the same size on which to stand.  If the first can see over the wall and the second, being a little shorter, cannot, both will have been treated equally but equity will not have been established.  We need to see not only equal resources going into rural areas but extra resources to establish equity because they have long been left behind.  The area I come from was the last place to see the boom and the first to see the decline.  That is what always happens.  We need to try to reverse that.  I certainly welcome this effort to try to do so.  Those are the key points we need to deal with.  We need to ensure sufficient commitment.  This means some element of the Government needs to take charge.  We need to take charge of the infrastructure and consider the rights of the workers when established.</p></speech>

There were some very interesting presentations.  Much of this debate is based on connectivity.  If there is no connectivity, particularly broadband but also mobile phone coverage, it is very difficult to run any type of business.</p><p>It is a major issue in my constituency of Cork South-West.  Much of it has to do with getting funds from the Government and getting off the ground.  It is about making a start.  If people can receive support in getting broadband and the funding right, they can start to go places.  I see it in Skibbereen with the Ludgate Hub.  It is getting the funding it needs and its feet off the ground.  It is getting places.  However, there is a vacuum in the surrounds of my constituency.  I can only speak on its behalf.</p><p> Details of the rural regeneration and development fund were released last week.  There is nowhere more rural than south-west Cork, as anybody who has been there knows.  It is beautiful in the summer, but it must fight on rural matters.  There were 48 projects proposed by Cork County Council and we got zero.  Therefore, I am right to be very angered.  I met some of the community groups over the weekend and they are incensed because they ticked all of the boxes.  I looked at those that had received money and some of them were great.  I would not take anything from them.  However, I can pick out some that are not so great.  Coillte received &euro;10 million, but it has its own funds.  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht received &euro;3.5 million and it also has its own funds.  Why are we dipping into the rural generation and development fund to fund these bodies and Departments?  Is the overspend on the national children's hospital project the problem and is this a back-door method to top up funding?  The problem is that of the 48 projects, most of which are in my constituency but some are in the rest of Cork county, zero was approved.  I could name some of them.</p></speech>

In a rural community, if we do not receive that type of funding, we will not be able to get our feet off the ground.  I would love to be able to bring in groups of people like those involved in the Ludgate Hub in Skibbereen, but it cannot live on its own.  West Cork needs that energy.  Unfortunately, we do not have broadband.  Everybody knows the fact it has not been rolled out is a national matter, rather than one specific to west Cork.  It is very hard for us to equal any of the great opportunities on which the delegates have worked.  I praise them from a height and would not take anything away from a community or an area that has worked for it.  It is an important point and the committee needs to bring the Minister before it to discuss it.  He should first explain how the money is being spent and why it is not being spent in rural communities that want to achieve results like those described by the delegates.  I wish them the best and I am not taking anything away from what they have done.  Nonetheless I have made a valid point and will continue to do so.  The announcement of the rural regeneration and development fund was only made last Friday; there was &euro;62 million, but zero went to west Cork.  I need answers.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.829" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Vanessa Tierney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019022000002#H01000"><p>There was a question about how we did it.  It is multifaceted, as has been highlighted.  There are many great groups on the ground, county to county.  I am not with a connectivity company, but I can see that a lot of them are making great efforts to connect places; perhaps they are not all homes but certainly they are co-working spaces.  A national framework for co-working is required.  We have highlighted that in most cases employees are paying their subscription or membership in co-working.  WeWork, a phenomenal global co-working company, announced last year that 35% of its members were employees of enterprise accounts.  They are attracting the likes of Facebook and Microsoft and can do so because once somebody takes out a subscription with WeWork, there is global access.  We suggest we can do the same with Abodoo because we have all 200 on our platform.  We need to advance the technology to facilitate subscriptions.  That conversation can be taken to the large enterprise and foreign direct investment companies.</p> <p>  There was reference to the national talent heat map.  We are ready to go.  We just need the green light for the provision of some funding.  We achieved what we did quite economically in Wexford and leveraged all of the local public relations and marketing channels available through the council.  It was affordable and we got a buy-in.  Members will have read that many commuter studies have been carried out and I have spoken to five or six local enterprise offices about their commuter studies.  They were great to help to create momentum, but they did not give the detailed and granular skills data that we needed for the finance companies who were seeking finance people in the south east, for example.  The beauty of Ireland Inc. becoming involved in national talent mapping is that we would be able to demonstrate the peak or clusters of skills available in finance, for example.  They could be available in Waterford or west Cork, when there is connectivity.  They could be available in County Offaly.  Companies could make decisions based on how they would land there.  It is ready to go and no policy is needed.  It is just a question of backing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.830" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Christal" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019022000002#H01100"><p>I absolutely agree with the point made about the collaboration needed.  With this initiative, there must be collaboration between the public sector organisations, including the local authorities, Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise offices, IDA Ireland and chambers of commerce.  That is really important.  Whatever we do, we must ensure we engage and develop approaches that will be meaningful from the perspective of a small and medium enterprise.  The typical Enterprise Ireland client has 20 or 30 people who are time-limited.  Companies have faced many challenges.  Whatever systems or policies we put in place need to be attractive and practical from their perspective.</p> <p>  The issue of skills has been mentioned by a number of people.  It is something on which we are very focused.  We have a programme, Spotlight on Skills, aimed at helping our clients to identify their skill needs and put them on a path towards engaging with training and education providers to get a response in meeting those skill needs.  We have approximately 160 companies throughout the country that have engaged in the programme and are working with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to facilitate these companies in engaging with education and training providers.  They have also engaged with private providers to procure responses.  A number of points mentioned could be built on.</p></speech>

Often in committees such as this we bring in representatives of agencies who, with the greatest of respect, often work in silos.  There is co-ordination but only to a certain degree.  Who leads the collaboration and steps up to say they will lead this and make it happen?  It should be the likes of Enterprise Ireland, but I am not saying it has a budget to do so.  We need to identify some agency that works on behalf of the State to co-ordinate all of what goes on.  Could Enterprise Ireland do it within current structures and if it cannot, could it make a pitch to the Department or the Minister?  If there are new work patterns, could Enterprise Ireland assist by devising a national strategy to co-ordinate co-working, smart hubs or whatever we might call it?  I know that Enterprise Ireland is doing this in individual spaces, but I am talking about taking the lead and bringing all of what we have heard today and in the past together.  Is it possible it could do that, for example?</p></speech>

Irrespective of how it is led or who leads it, there is a wide range of stakeholders and enterprises involved and there must be collaboration.  We have mentioned local enterprise offices, foreign direct investment and IDA Ireland.  We have a client base.  I have also mentioned chambers of commerce and the Small Firms Association.  There are myriad enterprises and our enterprise base is so diverse that irrespective of who leads it or how it is driven, the collaboration is absolutely essential.  I take the point made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.833" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Tobin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019022000002#H01400"><p>The question of who leads the process is key.</p><p>I echo the Senator's point and agree that if the funding and a team were put in place, Enterprise Ireland should be the body to lead it, but I also acknowledge that funding may not necessarily be available in the current structures.  It needs to be a dedicated team.  Myriad organisations are involved.  The committee has heard from Grow Remote and Abodoo and there are individual organisations representing hubs throughout the country.  It needs to be one co-ordinated approach and it should not be over-complicated.  It is actually quite simple and the issues are obvious.  For example, within the SME sector in Dublin there is a huge drain on staff and SMEs are in serious competition with larger organisations to retain them.  This would be a win-win.  It is very simple to organise once the funding is put in place.</p><p> I want to touch on a couple of the questions raised.  It is good to acknowledge that for policy makers there is an element of catch-up in this scenario, but it comes down to the key collaboration that needs to happen with those already in the space and policy makers.  It should be done without over-complicating things because it is very simple when we break it down.</p><p> Should a specific Department be involved?  The answer is definitely "Yes".  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation needs to be involved and take a lead role because it is already in contact with all of the organisations.</p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny mentioned connectivity and one of his constituents not being able to take up a role with eBay.  We had a similar issue in County Kerry where remote working opportunities with Amazon came our way.  Some 60 positions were advertised in the first round, but we could fill only 40 of them because of the problems with broadband in some parts of the county.  There are opportunities.  Again, these things could be fast-tracked using local Internet service providers who would fast-track the service using a wireless system.  In Listowel we have proved it can work in using the coverage provided by local Internet service providers.  It is demand-led, but it is further reaching and quicker to get off the ground than investing in the provision of long-term infrastructure.</p><p> In regard to regional towns, the framework document for town centre renewal was published a number of years back, but it has not yet gone far enough.  There is a collaborative town centre health check programme as part of it and 12 towns have completed the programme, which was step one.  Step two is to formulate funded town teams, but, unfortunately, most of the 12 towns have not yet got to that stage.  However, there is a framework document and we just need to go one step further.  As the Deputy said, it is not always about infrastructure but about vibrancy and sustaining local businesses.  It is about the pub, the shop and the restaurant.  That is what we need if we are to attract back the younger generation of workers when they graduate from colleges.  We do not want them to head off to Dublin.  We want to keep them in the regional towns where they went to college.  Senator Coffey mentioned this in the case of Waterford.  It is the same in the case of Tralee Institute of Technology which is in the battle to retain staff.  If we do not have a vibrant town for them to stay in, of course, they will head off to the city.  There is a framework in place.  We just need to go one step further.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Michael Collins.  As I married a Bantry woman, I empathise with those living in south-west Cork.  However, there is a lot more that could be done in such areas; it is not just about the regeneration fund.</p></speech>

I just find this way to be more effective.  It is important that the delegates furnish the committee with information on the progress made in that regard.  When we talk about things, we are talking about them in the round.  We have talked about the interaction and collaboration between the different agencies involved and the different resources that are available.  To me, fibre optic cable is a huge resource that presents an opportunity in the west.</p></speech>

We can no longer afford to work in silos.  I know that there is a certain degree of collaboration, but this is vital.  This is the biggest thing to happen in the west for a long time and will mean that the highest speeds will be available.  Another cable is due to be brought through shortly, as well as another from Iceland.  Unless we take advantage of them and plan ahead and work closely on such developments, we will never maximise the potential available in the west and rural Ireland.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the connections of the various agencies with Eir.  I work remotely on the days I am not in Leinster House and never know in the morning if I will be able to send an email.  It is admirable that some of the delegates think there is a wonderful broadband picture, but I can tell them from personal experience that is not the way it is.  Another problem with Eir is that I do not know if I will be able to make a mobile phone call.  Perhaps five or six times during a conversation it will cut out and then I cannot get through to Eir.  Have the agencies represented sat down with Eir to discuss the problems with mobile phone coverage, for instance?  It is a fairly basic requirement of any business or operation in working from home.</p></speech>

I also want to ask about the Enterprise Ireland's interaction with the LEADER programme.  I concur with the audit skills report.  However, many of these reports were carried out in many counties and I would not want us to reinvent the wheel or waste resources.  Such audits were carried out when I worked with the enterprise companies.</p> <p>  Other natural resources are used in creating employment and developing enterprise.  Seaweed is one such natural resource, from which many good products are made.  What interaction does Enterprise Ireland have in licensing the use of some of these natural resources?  How much of the funding from the disruptive technologies innovation fund was allocated outside the main urban areas?</p><p>I am aware that 27 projects, involving &euro;70 million in funding, were approved.  How many of those went into the more rural areas outside Cork, Dublin and Galway?  When applications are being assessed, the criteria can be very narrow at times.  We need to weight them in favour of rural areas.  This is not to say that they would not meet the criteria but if, for example, we have a successful company in Belmullet, we need to ask how we can support it because 20 jobs in Belmullet or Erris can mean the same as 2,000 in Dublin.  When the innovation, technology and so on are in place, we need to harness, encourage and support that with resources provided directly to the people who are making a difference in these communities.</p><p> I would have the same concerns about centralisation and privatisation of services but centralisation in terms of hospitals and medical services will prevent people moving to and remaining in the more rural areas.  Education is connected to that as well, even in terms of school transport.  People may relocate to particular areas and set up their businesses only to discover that there are no places on the school bus for their children.  All of these matters are connected.</p><p> On the curriculum, how do our guests believe they have changed the curriculum in primary or secondary schools in terms of matching the skill sets with existing and future jobs, particularly in the context of technology?  Are the software and hardware available?  Has the curriculum been changed?  I have always found that the curriculum is slow to be changed.  Has it changed in terms of languages?  How many schools are teaching Mandarin?  I refer to some of the markets that were opened up heretofore.  Are schools still teaching the languages we did 20 years ago?  I have put many questions but I have to be in the Seanad for the Order of Business so I will not be asking any more.</p></speech>

I will call Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v once our guests have taken the opportunity to address some of the questions.  I do not believe they are in a position to provide answers to many of the questions the Senator asked, which ranged from seaweed to school transport and beyond, but they might do their best to address some of them.  I call Ms Dwyer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.853" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rowena Dwyer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019022000002#K00300"><p>I thank the Senator for the questions.  I will address some of the points raised and some others not so specifically.  The key point she made relating to enabling infrastructure in terms of broadband and so on is critically important.  Everyone here recognises that.  One of Enterprise Ireland's roles is to sit on the National Competitiveness Council.  It is our role to identify and to hear from our clients the issues that are outside our direct mandate and control but that are impacting on their ability to develop and so on.  We influence and impact through that, and these are the type of issues that are very pertinent to our clients and to enterprises across the country.</p> <p>  On the disruptive technologies innovation fund, I do not have the exact breakdown but it is important to know that the criteria for that fund specifically required collaboration that included SMEs.  It is a criteria that can and will be mirrored in other collaborative funding programmes into the future.  That is critically important that what we see between large and small companies is the ability to maximise spillovers and allow SMEs to compete and be able to achieve growth in this area.</p> <p>  Regarding other areas, to go back to what was mentioned earlier about the skills needs and so on of enterprises, it is critically important that SMEs are supported, which is what we are doing through the Spotlight on Skills programme in identifying their skills needs and, following that, assisting them to engage and have a voice with education providers.  When the Senator talks about curriculum it is that our education providers know the needs of our SMEs, not just those of larger companies, and that education providers in regional locations are responding to skills needs in that area in particular sectoral clusters.</p></speech>

There are 31 broadband officers across the local authority network and they are playing a significant role between the providers and the funders.  They are identifying the different black spots both for broadband and mobile phone coverage.  They are involved in many different pilots and funding applications.  They are developing regional and local digital plans also.  They are accessing funding independently and feeding in to the national picture.  They are doing a good deal in that area.  For example, they are working with LEADER-funded community hubs as well as Enterprise Ireland and different agencies and providers around the region.  We work very closely with LEADER.</p> <p>  In terms of curriculum, from our point of view, the LEOs are heavily involved in the delivery of entrepreneurship programmes through the student enterprise programme.  It is the largest programme throughout the country in terms of involvement with students.  It is something we would like added to the curriculum.  We are in discussions with the Department of Education and Skills on that.</p> <p>  To refer to the questions and comments on collaboration, it must be remembered that a number of the newly launched regional enterprise plans contain strategic objectives and supporting actions regarding remote working.  The groups working on the regional action plans are completely collaborative across all areas and stakeholders, including enterprise, all the agencies and related bodies.  That is very useful.  Even in Offaly, in terms of being part of the midlands one, there are different initiatives to improve the remote working connectivity between the hubs and also to look at a campaign to approach companies in Dublin to encourage remote working and to determine the interest in coming back and setting up in the midlands.  What might be useful in terms of overall co-ordination is the sharing of information on best practice among the different plans across the country.</p> <p>  The promotion of remote working to the larger employers would be very useful.  We sent details on that.  In the LEO in Offaly we are organising a half-day conference during enterprise week on practical insights and guides for both employers and employees.  There is definitely a growing momentum for remote and smart working but it would be great to have additional education and learning around it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.857" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019022000002#K00700"><p>Yes.  Our guests are very welcome.  I managed to listen to some of the presentations when I was in my office.  The hubs are the key practical action that can be taken.  That needs to be done now because in five years time we may not have half the demand for them.  I had hoped we would have ubiquitous fibre broadband connected to every building in this country.  I have to put my cards on the table and say I will not rest easy until we have put fibre broadband into every building in this country.  If we were able to put in electricity, water and all those basic services, fibre broadband should be seen the same way.  I do not believe that fibre technology will date.  There will be better wireless technologies but they will never match fibre technology in fixed locations.  It is a tiny bit of a cable that provides the necessary in terms of television, business and so on.</p><p>My understanding of the co-working hubs is that they currently have two functions.  First, they provide broadband connection where none is available.  For example, where I live, 100 houses have a fibre broadband connection and 300 houses are without broadband.  Approximately 20 of us have a 60 Mbps or 70 Mbps service and the rest are on 5 Mbps or nothing.  The people who are outside that have a big problem.  I live in a very rural area with 100 houses.  If a business is directly linked, it will not use a hub.  It will use it <i>in situ</i>.</p><p>However, even if the national broadband plan contract is awarded next month, I would imagine that it would be three, four or five years before it is rolled out fully.  Eir has not stuck to its targets regarding the roll-out of the previous one.  It will be well into the middle of the year before the 300,000 houses are connected.  We are now getting into more difficult terrain involving a further 500,000 houses.  One can figure out the timescale.  The first need is what I have outlined.</p><p> There is a socialisation issue regarding the second need.  In other words, some people could work from home but they like to be able to go into work and interact with others.  What I imagine will happen is that if everybody had fibre broadband in the home - and every Deputy works from wherever he or she is located at any given moment - most people will not just work neat eight-hour days.  I imagine that they would sometimes go down and work in the hub while much of the time, they will work from home.  They will work from places such as airports at other times.  We need to look at the matter in that context.  Therefore, the need for the hubs will continue but it will change and it might not be for as many hours.</p><p> I compliment &Uacute;dar&aacute;s an Gaeltachta, which is missing from this particular feast, because it has many buildings around the Gaeltacht, it systematically looks at empty buildings and it puts in gcomms or hot desks.  This policy has proven very positive.  Listening to our guests from Enterprise Ireland, an issue I can never get my head around is that when IDA Ireland was split up into Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, all of the buildings in rural Ireland were left in the ownership of the latter.  So, from a foreign direct investment perspective, IDA Ireland owns properties in Roundstone in County Galway and all sorts of bizarre places.  It seems that there is no co-ordinated approach regarding the full portfolio of IDA Ireland properties.  How many buildings are there, how many of them are in full use and how many of them could be translated into gcomms just as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has done?  My question to the representatives from Enterprise Ireland concerns whether the agency has discussed this matter with IDA Ireland and asked the latter is willing to make its buildings, or parts of them, available.  A factory located in the area in which I live includes a self-contained unit that has a few rooms, a place for making tea and toilets.  A person can go in the front door and need not interfere with the rest of the factory building that, unfortunately, is empty at the moment but would still be available for letting.  If IDA Ireland has factories, most of them have suites of offices that could be used.  My simple question concerns whether there has been any joined-up thinking here between Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  I will extend the question.</p></speech>

I apologise for having to leave early.  I must meet the CEO of Vodafone so I will bring up many of the issues raised today.  More than 20,000 people have registered so it is not just a couple of hundred or 2,000 in Wexford.  In excess of 20,000 people and over 500 companies have registered.  The demand for smart working is there.  Obviously, regarding the 200 co-working, we are engaging with the 31 LEOs so we are slowly bringing it together.  I will mention one thing about skills because it is fundamental.  With the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning, what will become key for humans involves our soft skills - our cognitive learning and ability to connect.  We are building technology in the background to be able to match people because many of us will have multiple career paths.  If members have not already seen it, Abodoo and Vodafone carried out a national survey regarding the appetite for smart, or remote, working that is an interesting read.</p></speech>

On the wider question, has there been any discussion about transferring all of the rural properties that will never be used for classical foreign direct investment to Enterprise Ireland?  Most of the successful industries around rural Ireland are actually indigenous, not foreign.  Anybody who is big enough to come here is likely to want to be near a city.  There is enough talent in this country to create significant employment in rural Ireland.  A far more likely market consists of people who might have worked in the foreign direct investment sector in the past or who are just smart and have ideas.  There is a lot of employment near where I live that involves very smart local people who got the job done.  That is a question.</p> <p>  I am focusing big time on the physical aspect - the national roll-out of broadband and hubs - because my experience is that without any of the soft supports, an endless amount of people are looking for it tomorrow.  They were looking for it at the last election as we canvassed the houses one by one because there is a significant cohort of people who work in cities and commute who could reduce their commute to two days per week if they could work from home.  They could be at home at mid-term, do all the family-friendly things we want people to do and still keep the work going if they could work from home.  This is a significant market for facilitating rural living.  It might also solve some urban traffic problems.  Driving into Galway on Monday morning was fantastic.  I could not believe it.  I got there in jig time during rush hour.  It was only then that I suddenly realised that it was mid-term, half the parents in the country were off work and all the schools were closed.  This is multifaceted but, funnily enough, I do not think we have to do much to educate the people about this.  They are saying "Yeah, it's a great idea but I don't have broadband or a facility to access broadband in my village.  Will you just give it to us?"  We already have an awful lot of businesses and houses in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  Perhaps the rural broadband officer could answer my next question.  Have we any idea how many people in areas with broadband now work partially from home?  This would allow us to extrapolate how many people in the 600,000 houses that do not have commercial broadband would work from home without any further soft supports because the people already doing it in areas with broadband did so off their own bat.  It involves just getting the physical thing there.  It is great to have all the supports but we would be encouraging people to use something that does not exist.  As I often say, when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he had no marketing survey but once a good idea took hold, the rest was history.  That took a fair while but holding a constituency clinic always fascinated me after somebody invented the mobile phone.  When I first came up here, mobile phones were the size of bricks and as scarce as hen's teeth.  Once the smaller version came out and they became relatively cheap, everybody was coming in with them.  Some of my constituents who would come in would not be technologically savvy.  When I asked them for their phone number, they would pull the phone out of their pockets and it would be written on the back of it stuck on with a bit of sellotape but they still used the phone for every purpose for which they wanted it.  I find that very few people nowadays come in to see me without a smart phone and they have that because they are using apps.  People adopt a technology.  They are smart.  There is significant interaction involving people in this country.  This is small little country.  We are a very strange people.  The problem we have is the physical availability.</p></speech>

One of the key issues for any work environment is people being able to enhance their skills in their employment environment.  Are there challenges in respect of remote working because one will not have 50 people working together?</p><p>It comes back to the point that a person may be partially or fully isolated from his or her work colleagues.  What means exists to address that?</p><p> Second, regarding the issue of hubs, one of the most successful hubs I know is a food hub in Drumshanbo.  There is also a technology hub in Manorhamilton.  Key to the development of those hubs were individuals who had an idea and ran with it.  There is despondency about such development among people in many areas in that people do not have a broadband connection or they do not have this or that support.  There are too many elements that people do not have for people to have confidence to be able to run with such an idea.  I would like Mr. Christal to tease out what needs to be done to develop the capacity within communities to lift themselves out of all of that.</p></speech>

First, as he rightly identified, the responsibility for the property portfolio lies with IDA Ireland.  It is mandated to manage it and it is best placed to talk about the full range of properties that are available to support foreign direct investment.  However, I stress and reassure the Deputy there is ongoing collaboration between ourselves and IDA Ireland at national level and regional level on this and a number of other initiatives.</p> <p>  In terms of the development of co-working spaces we have supported, as I mentioned and as stated in our submission, &euro;64 million has been invested by ourselves in the community enterprise centres.  In addition, with respect to regional accelerators, for example, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, recently launched the enterprise development plan from the PorterShed in Galway, which is a good example of collaboration between ourselves and the IDA Ireland in those sorts of hubs and facilities and also the business innovation centres.  We have the remit for the development of high potential start-up companies and we collaborate with IDA Ireland on how we can develop those and to use the facilities that are in place.  Another area on which we collaborate with IDA Ireland and on which we are focused is our agenda around second sites, which relate to Enterprise Ireland companies that are establishing and expanding their presence in regional locations as opposed to city or urban locations.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, we have responsibility for the food direct investment, FDI, agenda.  While IDA Ireland has the agenda for the wider sectors, we have responsibility for food FDI and we collaborate very much with IDA Ireland on available properties and the appropriate properties to support that sector.</p></speech>

It considers all its properties because they are all in one portfolio and it can identify where there is space in properties.  We have a latent demand.  We are talking all the time about the person who is at the door but there is a latent demand there for g-tech or digital working hubs.  We have the buildings.  We just need to ensure there are tea making facilities, fibre connected to the properties, toilet facilities in operating order, security in the properties and a key access system to enter them.  As I have pointed out since I was elected to the D&aacute;il, there is only one Government in this country but all the agencies seem to operate as if there were 50 governments here.  I do not care whether it be Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland but would Enterprise Ireland consider examining what &uacute;dar&aacute;s is doing and for it and IDA Ireland to take a leaf out of its book and get on with the job?</p></speech>

That is happening and that training opportunity is open to tenants of a co-working hub who may be working there only one day a week and spend the other days working with a business in a larger city.  I referenced a new hub we will be establishing, STREAM Create Suite.  As it will deal with big data, we are linking in with courses on data analytics provided by Athlone Institute of Technology, Trinity College, some of the Skillnet courses and other groupings, including some in the private sector.  That will be a strong aspect of that new hub.  Other hubs are doing similar things.</p> <p>  Many of the libraries are working on developing e-platforms.  They have many new journals, reports and materials online.  I know from talking to the head of library services in Offaly that their usage has increased 70% in the past year.  That linked in with the open library systems feeds in very well with the area of remote working.</p> <p>  Regarding the difference between working in a co-working hub and working from home, even if broadband access was available at home, we have clients who tell us that their businesses have specified that they need to be working from a co-working hub and not from a converted room at home.  Plenty of people feel they need the discipline of working in a hub and there is also the social aspect.  Social interaction and engaging with people from different backgrounds at different levels of business have been very beneficial to people working in hubs.</p></speech>

I would need to talk to the broadband officers of the network.  I am not aware if research has taken place on that or the outcome of any such research.  I do not know if anybody else has that information.</p></speech>

I know many people get mad at me when I am honest enough to admit this, but I am going to say it again, during the last election, the main issue we heard when canvassing at the doors was not that of post offices but that of broadband connectivity.  Straight and simple, broadband was the main issue for people, and that was across the board.  It was not as age-specific as one might think but it peaked among the 30 to 45 age group, comprising working parents and so on.  What we need to find out is that where there is broadband connectivity how many people use it for their business, part time, full time or for whatever number of hours.  People could be asked if they use broadband for their business three hours or 20 hours a week, or full time.  We need to get that information.  I accept the point Ms Martin made about social interaction.</p></speech>

I am very familiar with the hubs.  However, I would express a note of caution.  I am aware of a number of community-led hubs that have been established through various funds which are still lying idle.  All investment into these hubs must be demand-led or at least have an avenue with respect to who will fill them.  There is no point in making commitments to local communities saying that we will put a hub in their region and provide broadband access but then no one goes to work in it and there is no economic benefit to that town.  This is an anecdotal example.  I am very aware of hubs that are vacant because either the infrastructure was not right or there was no demand for those hubs or there was not an avenue and a connection with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to provide this as a landing pad solution for companies that are interested in those locations.</p><p>It is not always about developing hubs.  In some cases remote working might be a better home working solution for those rural towns where we can enable people's homes so that they can work from home.  I accept the point about the isolation of working from home.  I did it for 18 months and it is what drove me to set up our hub.  Some 30% of the people in our three hubs are remote workers.  Some are there one or two days a week just to make that connection with other people.  Some of them would have come from large city offices, for example, where they were surrounded by hundreds of people and are now in their house that is 20 miles outside the nearest large town.  I get the point about isolation but urge caution with regard to the development of hubs because it is a waste of investment in those towns if there may be a better solution to provide employment to those towns.</p></speech>

We have been joined by Deputy Rabbitte who is very welcome.  I am aware that she is very much involved with a hub in Portumna.  The Deputy made a very valuable contribution at the last meeting of this committee.  The floor is hers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.885" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019022000002#N00300"><p>I will be short and sweet.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to ask a few questions.  I shall direct one question to the witnesses from Offaly County Council and its local enterprise office, LEO.  I have looked at their Facebook and web pages which, as Mr. Tobin has said, is where a lot of business-led hubs would need to have the anchor tenant.  Enterprise Ireland might be interested to hear that I held a discovery day some weeks ago in Portumna where we had a number of employees from a particular large financial institution based in Limerick.  We learned that this company's employees make up 30 cars going across the bridge every single morning.  The company has a capacity issue: it wants to expand but does not have car parking facilities.  An ideal location would be the sort of idea that we are referring to, where one can expand from.  From there I went into the website to see where the local employment office gets right in behind it.  I thought the web page was fantastic and it gave me a good steer around Offaly and what it is about.  One of my questions at the last meeting was about the roll-out of the LEOs and the support role they play.  Do the LEOs meet bi-monthly or half yearly to share information from one LEO to another?  During the earlier contributions I heard that &euro;34 million is available to the LEOs to support businesses and so on, but the sharing of the information is also important so that every county council is on the same platform.</p> <p>  How do we get the idea of the change concept into the schools?  Reference was made to the library.  The library is absolutely a valuable tool, be it in second or third level education, when one needs to finish a project.  It is possibly not for the high end aspect of attracting business.  I do not agree with libraries in that context, but they are definitely valuable to the second and third level students who want to complete their projects.  Is there a plan with LEO or Enterprise Ireland to deliver that model and to educate children to use different units that are available, as opposed to them spending their weekends in Galway, for example, because they cannot get broadband in Ballinakill?  If, however, one was to go down the road to Abbey or Killimor there is a library available.  Would the witnesses agree that we need to train children how to plan their study patterns a little differently?</p> <p>  How will the representatives from Enterprise Ireland engage with the banks and businesses that have capacity issues around accommodation for their businesses and employees? They sometimes cannot get the accommodation because premiums for space are so high.  Are the representatives looking to the wider sphere such as the one hour commute? The Portumna region, for example, is one hour from Galway, one hour from Limerick and one hour from Athlone.  The Chairman's area is no different.  We need to look at these commuter towns.  When I speak about buildings I mean those places such as the Dowager House in Portumna - which is owned by the Office of Public Works, OPW and is completely kittled out.  As opposed to having the businesses buying why are we not re-using the properties that are available?  What engagements do the witnesses have with other Departments and agencies - such as the OPW - that have very good buildings that are not being used?  These premises may have car-parking spaces and other facilities, and their use could keep towns alive.</p></speech>

The heads of the local enterprise offices meet about six or eight times a year.  Other teams within the local enterprise offices meet a number of times a year also.  It is all about information sharing, the sharing of best practice, looking to see what works in some regions and what might be replicated.  We also meet on a regional basis to drive actions through the regional enterprise plans and so on.  That is happening.<br/><br/>With regard to the libraries, we find that people use the Work Matters library programmes where libraries have put in a lot of supports for people who are setting up their own businesses.  They aid in patent searches and searches on Vision-Net.  We link in with these businesses at what we term &quot;pre start-up&quot;.  We have also run schemes where students are working on student enterprise projects.  The LEO has offered opportunities for the students to meet with some of the design experts in some of the co-working spaces who have given some of their time <i>pro bono</i>to help the students on projects.  We have facilitated student groups working for European youth entrepreneurship competitions, one such being through The Junction Business Innovation Centre.  This sort of initiative is being replicated with other LEOs throughout the State.</p></speech>

I will add to what Ms Martin has said around the links to education, the schools and the structures the council has in that regard.  Through the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g system the council has a significant amount of projects and initiatives, a number of which are around entrepreneurship.  The Offaly Comhairle na n&Oacute;g has done a significant programme on entrepreneurship.  It links into the student schemes.  They have entered into national competitions and have performed well.  Our broadband officer - who also works with our IT department - made a successful application under the digital innovation fund for a robotics project with primary schools.  That innovative programme is kicking off currently with the first few schools in last week.  This is a new area where we are looking at new technologies and linking into the fabric of the county with the scientific aspect such as with the I-LOFAR radio telescope project in Birr and the STREAM Creative Suite.  We are also developing around new technologies and we have plans with regard to the funding streams available under the digital innovation fund.</p> <p>  On students utilising the libraries' service and new forms of study patterns and mechanisms, the open library system was piloted in Offaly and has now been rolled out around the State.  It has been very successful in utilising off-peak times for students.  It allows them access to Internet provision and provides resources for them.  A number of initiatives are held in libraries with the primary and second level schools at weekends and in the evenings for students around developing health mental skills such as Healthy Ireland and the Lego programme, among others, to try to encourage children to utilise the available services and resources for education and research. </p></speech>

With regard to the co-ordination of the LEOs, significant effort goes into ensuring shared learning across the local enterprise offices.  Enterprise Ireland has a dedicated team based in our Shannon office, which we call the LEO centre of excellence.  The team's job is to work with Ms Martin and the respective LEO managers, and to bring the 31 LEO heads together, to share information and best practice.  We are very much supported by the local authorities in that agenda.  We also have a national steering group, of which Ms Delaney and I are members.  This group shares ideas and best practice at a policy level.</p> <p>  On the issue of property, and hopefully I will not repeat some of the points I raised earlier, we work with IDA Ireland to collaborate as best we can around property needs.  The development of second sites is a key objective for Enterprise Ireland.  Second sites is when Enterprise Ireland companies are growing or expanding and we work with them to identify sites.  If they are based in Dublin or Cork, for example, we see if they would consider expanding their business into a rural location as opposed to expanding in their current location.</p><p>We have some really good examples of that including Abtran last year, as well as Carne.  They are really good companies which have developed second sites in regional locations and brought a lot to those regions.  The regional enterprise development fund, REDF, covers the 42 projects we funded.  Many of those projects were to develop existing facilities.  It did not focus on new builds or new entities.  It was to see what exists in rural locations and what we can do through the fund and the partners involved in those projects to develop those facilities in those locations. </p></speech>

There is a budget of over &euro;100 million to maintain some of the Office of Public Works, OPW, sites.  Garda stations have been closed down.  Huge sums of money have been invested in various houses down through the years and they are of a high standard in central locations.  Is Enterprise Ireland liaising with the Minister to access some of these buildings, which would need very little investment to bring them into use?</p></speech>

It is something we need to reflect on.  What drives our engagement on property and property development is the needs of our companies, the ones which are expanding and growing.  That is the key driver.  Where those properties come from or what they look like is influenced by the needs of the company in its sector.  We could consider and reflect on that.</p></speech>

A city with a third of the population in it would be a hell of a city.  There is one, Dublin.  We keep noticing that.  Rural Ireland is predominantly outside the towns and villages.  No matter how long, and how often, and how strong the feeling in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and planning and planning and planning is, Irish people are very attached to their non-nucleated villages.  I live in one of those places that is highly enterprising.  We get literature telling us we think better when we are in the city but I do not find I think any better up here than I do down below.  I did not find that when I migrated to the west I became less creative.  I actually became a lot more creative because necessity does that.  I do not find my local population any less creative and I defy anybody to say, given the suite of lack of infrastructure over the years, that they have not been incredibly creative in overcoming that.  We do not seem to understand that there is an Ireland out there that has been written out of the geography and most people expect that Ireland to travel.  What this does is allow that Ireland to stay at home and work from where it is.  It is a pity that all the documents we get seem to talk about towns as if that third did not exist.  We do exist.</p> <p>  I keep pointing to one interesting thing.  I know Killarney eventually got the better of Mullinalaghta but it was David and Goliath.  Pound for pound, however, they put up a hell of a battle for a population of 400 against the whole town of Killarney and its hinterland, as they call it.  St. Thomas's is still in the shake.  I think it is up against Ballyhale Shamrocks. </p></speech>

The other interesting point is that the final finalist is Corofin and there is not a town in sight.  Corofin is a tiny village.  I would say there would not be two players who come from the village.</p> <p>  This committee is a rural one.  Towns are part of rural Ireland but they are not rural Ireland.  We have to keep remembering that.  It is tiny.  There is not any geographic problem in servicing all of rural Ireland.  They had a dream in Australia that was a little bit ambitious of putting fibre into every house there but in some places in the outback it might be necessary to go 10, 20 or 30 miles to find a house.  I know of nowhere in Ireland that is impossible to service with water or electricity.  We have done it for the electricity.  One thing that does disturb me is that the State seems to have just grasped that fibre is like electricity.  It is just a case of sticking in and doing it without having to depend on private people or ingenious LEADER companies or whatever to create a basic resource.  Thanks be to God we did not do that with electricity.  Early in our history we decided that every house was to get electricity and to just do it, get it done, and that was it.  That is my view on this whole fibre thing, just get it done. </p></speech>

I thank the witnesses from Enterprise Ireland, the Offaly LEO and the chief executive of Offaly County Council, Ken Tobin from HQ Tralee, and Abodoo, which is a very progressive private company.</p> <p>  The committee is putting together a report on remote working and smart working.  There is a lot of work being done in this area.  There is a massive movement towards remote working using co-working places.  I compliment Offaly County Council and wish it well with its conference on 8 March.  I thank it for communicating with our committee and for taking this opportunity to come here today and for presenting so well.  </p> <p>  There is a need for co-ordination and collaboration as Deputy Martin Kenny has mentioned, and bringing everyone together on the one hymn sheet.  There are many different ways to draw down funding.  Mr. Tobin referred to the town and village renewal or the fund that was there in Enterprise Ireland, the rural regeneration programme.  There seems to be a need for a more co-ordinated approach, possibly that is what Senator Coffey said about a national plan for remote working.  That should involve different stakeholders such as a private company.  Grow Remote was fantastic when it was here, for the voluntary work it does encouraging communities to set up chapters.  I attended one in Clarecastle.  There is a meeting tomorrow night in Ennis and I compliment everyone involved there.  From that people can grow and develop a shared working space and address the issues Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has raised about congestion in Dublin, the need to rebalance our country and get away from commuting and congestion, and the stagnation in Dublin where there is a housing crisis, to areas where there is not such a demand.</p><p>Our researcher is here today and she has taken note.  We hope to be in a position to present a report.  We will be in touch with the witnesses and they should feel free to stay in touch with the committee.  I again thank them for attending.</p></speech>

T&aacute;im anseo ar mo shon f&eacute;in agus ar son an Aire sinsearach, Teachta Madigan.</p> <p>  A no-deal Brexit would be highly disruptive and would have profound political, economic and legal implications, most seriously for the UK, but also for Ireland and the rest of the EU.  In light of the ongoing political uncertainties in the UK and the Brexit deadline of 29 March, the Government agreed in December of last year to give greater immediate priority to preparations for a no-deal Brexit. </p> <p>  As part of our Brexit contingency action plan, on 24 January the Government published the general scheme of the omnibus Bill.  While the ratification of the withdrawal agreement is still the Government&rsquo;s preferred outcome, this publication is part of a series of measures that the Government is taking, both nationally and in conjunction with the EU, in preparation for the possibility that the UK fails to agree a deal for its departure from the European Union on 29 March.  The omnibus Bill covers the issues in primary legislation that need to be addressed immediately in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  This Bill focuses on protecting our citizens and supporting the economy, enterprise and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors.  It also contains a stand-alone provision to facilitate the transition period as provided for in the withdrawal agreement.  Given the emergency nature of this legislation, the Government took the decision that progressing this through the Houses as an omnibus Bill is the most sensible way to ensure that we have the necessary legislation enacted before 29 March. </p> <p>  A number of measures across the general scheme, in particular in the areas of healthcare, transport, education and energy, will support North-South co-operation arrangements.  This co-operation brings tangible benefits to the daily lives of people in the Border region and contributes to economic opportunity and development.  It is also a very practical outworking of the peace process, which allows for the normalisation of relationships between people across the island to mutual benefit.  Since the collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive in January 2017, the North-South Ministerial Council has been unable to meet and bring the Government and Northern Ireland Executive together to oversee ongoing North-South work and further develop co-operation, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.  This is a most serious absence, and particularly so at a time when the council should be continuing the work it commenced in 2016 to deal with the challenges of the UK's exit from the European Union.  Nevertheless, there is a wide variety of activity ongoing under the formal institutional areas of co-operation by the North-South implementation bodies and in other areas.  The Government has consistently affirmed our unwavering commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and our determination, as a co-guarantor, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions, including the North-South Ministerial Council. </p> <p>  As the members may be aware, the Department has not identified any legislative measures for inclusion in the Bill itself.  However, both the Department and those bodies under its aegis are subject to the challenges posed by Brexit and will, in the event of a no-deal scenario, benefit from the practical measures contained in the Bill.  In the meantime, the Department continues to participate in the Government&rsquo;s preparations for Brexit, which are being co-ordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Contingency planning is under way in respect of all aspects of the Department&rsquo;s remit.  The two North-South bodies, Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga, are particularly impacted by Brexit and I am especially pleased to note the agreement with the UK in relation to the retention of the common travel area which will benefit cross-Border workers in both jurisdictions.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Madigan, speaking last month at the Equity Ireland and UK conference in Belfast, emphasised the importance placed by the Government on the contribution of culture and creativity to our overall social and economic well-being.  While recognising the challenges posed by Brexit, the Minister highlighted the role of the Creative Ireland programme, launched at the end of 2016, and the culture component of Global Ireland - Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025, published in May last year, in ensuring that artists and other creative workers are properly supported to allow them to continue to operate in the cultural sector on a self-sustaining basis.</p><p>Our key message remains that regardless of the outcome of the Brexit process, we remain committed to engaging through culture across the island of Ireland with our friends in the United Kingdom, partners in the European Union and globally.</p><p> Support by state bodies, North and South, for culture and creativity provides a significant boost to the sector.  The Arts Council, An Comhairle Eala&iacute;on, and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland support arts practitioners to engage in North-South touring and jointly fund all-Ireland arts organisations and other arts organisations engaged in co-production, co-presentation and co-operation between the two jurisdictions.  The Department also has an important role in environmental regulation and the preservation of our built and natural heritage.  Officials continue to engage with colleagues in other Departments and at EU level to ensure the necessary provisions are in place to address any issues arising from the emergence of regulatory divergences after Brexit.</p><p> &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has also undertaken a number of initiatives or measures to safeguard its exposed client companies from a no-deal Brexit.  These include the introduction of the B&iacute; R&eacute;idh scheme, which is similar to the Be Prepared scheme being operated by Enterprise Ireland.  In addition, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s client companies continue to be updated on the other State support available by way of the Brexit loan scheme being provided by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.</p><p> I trust that this brief overview will have provided some reassurance to the committee in respect of the extent of Brexit contingency preparations under way across the Department.  I also assure the committee that I would be more than happy to bring concerns to the attention of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Josepha Madigan, or to my colleagues in the Government as appropriate.  I thank members for their interest in the matter and I will try to address any particular concerns that members may wish to raise.</p></speech>

I refer to artists' mobility and how the possible loss of British visitors will have an impact on audience numbers.  I also refer to cross-border mobility with respect to co-productions and co-funding arrangements, as well as whether EU bodies may refuse to fund such co-productions.</p> <p>  Artists and performers regularly travel to the UK and work with the British industry.  Travel may also be more costly and there could be changes to VAT.  A weaker sterling may also have an impact on Irish artists performing and touring around Britain.  It would be wise for us to diversify audiences to take account of a lower number of British visitors, as have already been recorded.  I have a note on data protection regulations and the sharing of personal data with non-EU countries, which could make collaboration difficult.  Has the Department sought clarity on the future of Creative Europe funding when British subventions cease?  What impact would that have on Irish artists applying for Creative Europe funding?  The Arts Council also asked the Minister to lobby Europe in 2017 on this.  Does the Minister of State have any comments on mobility, the possibility of lower audience numbers, co-funding arrangements and whether the EU will refuse to continue funding?  There is also the data protection issue and whether the Department has done any work on Creative Europe funding.</p></speech>

I assure him with respect to artists' mobility that the common travel area is very important and predates our membership of the European Union, going back to the 1920s.  The agreements signed with the United Kingdom mean the common travel area will be maintained in all circumstances.  This will allow Irish citizens in the UK and British citizens in Ireland to have the right to reside, work, study and access healthcare, social security and public services in each other's countries.  The common travel area and its associated and reciprocal rights and privileges will be maintained after Brexit, which is very important.  This was agreed very early and highlighted in the pre-referendum discussions and lobbying.  It was also highlighted by all member states as being important and I am thankful the United Kingdom has agreed it is important because it predates membership of the Union.</p> <p>  With respect to personal data transfers, the Department is undergoing extensive preparations to ensure measures are put in place for personal data transfers to continue in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The Department and agencies have collectively identified where personal data is transferred to the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and where such transfers are to continue after 29 March, and the Department has consulted the General Data Protection Regulation and identified appropriate transfer mechanisms under Articles 45 to 49 in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Although the European Union has given assurances that discussions concerning the UK's adequacy decision, or Article 45 of GDPR, will commence quickly following Brexit, this may be a lengthy and complex process.  As such, the Department and agencies will continue to transfer personal data to the UK, including Northern Ireland, under the transfer mechanisms outlined in Articles 46 and 49 of the GDPR regulations.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned tourism and the possible impact on audiences.  This is a very important area and we still cannot assume what will be the economic shockwaves, both in this country or the United Kingdom, when it comes to bottom lines and the financial wherewithal to travel from the UK to Ireland.  It is clearly a concern and we do not know the impact on sterling exchange rates or people's ability to travel.  It is clearly something of which we are conscious.  We increased funding for the Arts Council in the last budget and we remain committed to full co-operation within the arts sector with the United Kingdom.  We are promoting Ireland worldwide and not just in the European Union.</p> <p>  There are a number of areas that may not fall within the legislation but they have been identified with respect to continuing promotion of the arts.  They include the issuance of licences for the exporting of cultural goods.  The Department will decide applications once processed in that respect.  The possibility of an inability to borrow items from the national cultural institutions of the UK was raised early and there have been bilateral discussions with partners in this respect.  There has been investment because of concerns in the film industry arising from currency fluctuations etc.  We have seen increased investment under the national development plan and the audiovisual action plan.  There will be continued support with the section 481 tax credit system.</p> <p>  Many of these areas were identified from an early stage and mitigation measures were produced within the Department.  As I said, none requires legislative change under the Brexit omnibus Bill, although that is not to in any way lessen the importance of the matters and the fact that there has been preparation and work done within the Department and agencies over a long period.</p></speech>

If there are opportunities for Departments or agencies to draw down European funding, obviously, they need to be explored.  I am not personally aware of what opportunities are not being availed of but that is an issue that can be explored with the Minister at another time.  Generally, we have a good reputation across Government and across successive Governments in regard to drawing down funding.  If there are opportunities, we will be happy to explore them.</p></speech>

Some people, although not the Minister of State, might find it tiresome to be here because we might have very little to offer, very little influence and very little to ignite, to acknowledge or to enlarge.  Maybe we are not even worth listening to.  I have a feeling somewhere in the back of my head and I did not get that feeling out of the ether; it is there and it is very cloying.</p> <p>  I want to say something the Minister of State might be able to pick up on, and I mentioned it in the Seanad earlier in the week.  Northern Ireland is at an impasse in regard to the Border, although not in regard to its people.  However, there is also the history of literature, drama, music and the visual arts, and, like naming the cats, we could point to MacNeice, Friel, MacLaverty and Mangan, at the great Heaney, at Wilde, Beckett, William Trevor, Basil Blackshaw and Derek Hill - I could go on and on.  Nobody is mentioning this at all.  I understand that all of the arguments are political and economic, and concern the Border, but I am not hearing about this from any quarter.  Has the Minister, Deputy Madigan, spoken specifically anywhere about the power of the arts and culture across our two islands?  Has she brought a voice to that aspect - to the artistic, cultural voices?  I am not hearing those and I think there may be a place to hear them.</p> <p>  What I am hearing, and which Friel wrote about, is the language of conflict and a kind of tight, strained language - the language of territory.  I can write the speech for the Minister.  If there is one thing the arts can do, it is to lift things out of territories and bring territories together.  It has done it all over the world through music, dance, visual arts, drama and poetry.  However, I am just not hearing it.  Maybe people think that is naive of me but I can tell them it is not.  Once people start talking about territories and strain, and about "This is my place and that is your place, and never the twain shall meet", we have no fresh breeze in under the door.  I wonder are there any thoughts around that in the Department.  I often see an artist or a writer on "Newsnight" but I am not seeing or hearing it on Irish radio and television.  I am not getting the artist's viewpoint, the musician's viewpoint, the writer's viewpoint.  Maybe people do not think that is political but, trust me, it is.  We might want to be economic and look at tourism, which Senator Warfield referred to, even at a crass level of how much money we are going to lose, which is a brilliant point because the artist also loses.  However, I cannot understand why there is not a strain about this, why I am not hearing it and why Ministers are not standing up and speaking about it because it is so important for children and elders right through our lives.  Let us look at what Northern Irish heritage is to us and ours is to them, and let us look at our music and our architecture.</p> <p>  We need to emphasise this.  I do not know how the Minister would do that but she could be very subtle about it in speeches.  It should be done.  If I was the Minister, and I am not and never will be because I would not get the votes in my area, I would be hammering that home.  If there was any piece of advice to give - all we are really looking for is communication and not to tell people what to do when the Government is doing it very well - I think there might be something there that would bring others who are in the background, without a voice, towards an energy.  It is about an energy and about an energy being dissipated.  It reminds me of the egret, a wonderful bird with very long legs, with its huge feet in under the sand, trying to find the razor clams.  The Minister of State must feel that himself.  There is a moment where it is turning into territories, and this is a way of bringing it back.  Maybe that could help but I do not hear it.  I would like the Minister of State to comment.  It is not an accusation; it is a suggestion that maybe we have something to offer.</p></speech>

She does a number of speaking engagements and, as I noted in my opening remarks, she spoke at the Brexit event in Belfast recently in regard to the contribution of culture and creativity to our overall social and economic well-being.  She spoke in London at the recent Barbican event and at the Global Ireland 2025 conference in Dublin Castle, she recently announced new cultural ambassadors and she was recently in New York as well.  At all stages she promotes the relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom, which is very important.  As the Senator said, whatever politics goes on, the arts has always been able to transcend political difficulties.  There is an artistic family on each island and they both work very closely together.  The overall importance of the sector is clearly evident in the work that has been done and the continued co-operation in terms of cultural exchanges and different forms of culture and heritage value.</p> <p>  In regard to the language, An Foras Teanga, which includes Ulster Scots and the Irish language, will still function on both sides of the Border.  As I said, the common travel area will ensure the workers who may work on either side of the Border are able to continue to work and live on either side of the Border.  Some of these bodies have offices both North and South and, therefore, staff will be moving between Belfast or Derry and parts of Donegal or Dublin, which is important.</p> <p>  The Minister attempts at all times to get the message out there about continued co-operation across the islands in regard to the Creative Ireland programme and all that goes with it.  She has at all times put a focus on that.  I will certainly ask her to read back on the Senator's contribution to see if there is anything else she can add.  She might be able to respond to the Senator directly.</p></speech>

I will ask him a few questions as we have three reports to deal with immediately afterwards.  The Minister of State addressed some of the questions I intended asking on the common travel area, CTA.  As a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA, I was one of the authors of a report on the common travel area.  We were in the middle of producing the report when the referendum on Brexit was held and we had to insert a caveat at the end as a result.  It is to ensure that nothing in our legislation undermines the standing of the common travel area and that, regardless of what happens on 29 March, nothing will undermine that status, especially given the cross-Border institutions and the industries for which people regularly cross the Border or that straddle the Border.  That has obviously been the intent of the Government and all of the parties here.</p> <p>  Specific questions have not been addressed.  The EU habitats directive has major implications for Ireland and I do not know what Britain's view of it is or what it will be in the future if Britain extracts itself from the European project.  The directive has had a major effect on us in Ireland.  We have had major debates on issues and changes of practice have resulted.  As an island, it would be detrimental to us if such directives were not complied with or were not acknowledged in the Six Counties and in this State.  Obviously, this State will abide by the EU directives but we do not know what will be the position in Britain in the future.</p> <p>  On Waterways Ireland, I have been on the waterways in some of the boats that go up and down the canals.  Will travel documents be required in future when crossing the Border on a waterway?  It is still a common travel area but when will separate insurance documents be required once one enters waterways in a different jurisdiction in future?</p> <p>  This other issue I raise is bizarre and one I have not heard discussed.  It is st&aacute;ideas an teanga but n&iacute; an Gaeilge.  I refer to the status of the English language within the European Union.  On the basis that England was in the European Union, English had working language status.  Whereas the French were never happy with the dominance of the English language, is there a danger in the future that the status of English will be reduced?  This would pose difficulties not only for us, but also for countries on the outside and for Britain trading with the European Union in the future?  Has there been any discussion about the standing of the English language, even if I would like the status of the Irish language to be raised?  It is one of those strange debates that came up a few months ago and I have not heard anything about it since.  Sin an m&eacute;id uaimse.</p></speech>

The general scheme, as published on 24 January, reflects Ireland's commitment to the CTA, including through legislative provision to ensure the agreed CTA rights and privileges in health, education, social protection, justice and security are protected under any circumstance.  One will see some of those in the Brexit omnibus Bill that will be published this week and also in some of the motions that were passed last week on a social security agreement between the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and her counterpart in the UK.  Those rights will continue.</p> <p>  The Chairman made an interesting point on the English language.  I understand English will continue to be a working language in the European Union.  There may be advantages for Ireland because, as an English-speaking country, we will be able to provide interpretation facilities and so on.  There may now be more opportunities in terms of interpretation within the European Union for Irish citizens given that they are able to speak in English.</p> <p>  On the habitats directive, this is an area that has been identified.  The island of Ireland and Great Britain form a distinct geographical area.  Rivers that flow from the North to the South will not know what Brexit means and do not know what a border means.  Clearly, after the UK's departure from the EU, enhanced dialogue bilaterally with the UK and Northern Ireland will be required on matters of nature conservation and protection.  One could argue there is currently a risk that the UK could acquire competitive advantage should it operate in a more relaxed regulatory framework than would be required under EU nature directives.  I imagine there would also be a counter move within the United Kingdom to ensure that it complies with the standards that the European Union forces on member states.  Clearly, in relation to climate change and the value of nature and all that goes with it, there will be a campaign in the United Kingdom. While there is a risk over time of diverging standards and what might happen 20, 30, 40 or 50 years from now, there is a clear understanding of the need to continue dialogue between both jurisdictions.  As I said, there is a cross-Border dimension, whether it be in respect of mountain ranges or special areas of conservation, that span different counties.  We have to acknowledge that wetlands, rivers, peat bogs and so on can cross jurisdictions.  Any reduction of standards in the North could have an impact on the South.  For example, any works that will have an impact on a peat bog in Northern Ireland could hypothetically have an impact on local rivers and the Shannon system.  We have to be conscious of these issues.  When the North-South bodies re-establish, this is an area on which we will need to focus post Brexit.</p></speech>

Parts 11 and 12 of the Bill fall within the remit of my Department.  I appreciate the time and engagement of the committee as we bring forward this Bill with the hope of addressing a range of critical issues that may arise in the context of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>There are only five weeks remaining until 29 March.  The Government and the European Union remain committed to securing a negotiated Brexit outcome.  My Department and I have been planning for many scenarios for a very long time.  In light of the uncertainties in London and the Brexit deadline of 29 March, the Government decided at our meeting of 11 December last that immediate priority must be given to preparations for a no-deal Brexit and that Government Departments and State agencies should urgently take forward work on that basis.  That is what we have been doing.</p><p>This is a very wide-ranging Bill but, given its emergency nature, the Government took the decision that progressing it through the Houses as an omnibus Bill is the most sensible way to ensure that we have the necessary legislation enacted before 29 March.  The Bill covers the issues in primary legislation that need to be addressed immediately in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Measures relevant in the case of a no-deal Brexit were identified following a detailed examination by all Departments of legislation currently in force.  The Government published the general scheme of the omnibus Bill on 24 January.  The draft Bill contains 16 Parts, addressing primary legislative issues which would require immediate attention in a no-deal scenario. </p><p>Since the publication of the general scheme of the omnibus Bill, intensive work has been carried out between Departments and the Office of the Attorney General.  On the basis of this work there have been some updates and amendments to parts of the draft Bill.  The Government discussed this proposed legislation during our meetings in January and February.  Its provisions were also the subject of intensive and daily engagements between Departments and the Parliamentary Counsel.  The Bill will underpin the common travel area, CTA, and ensures that the associated rights and entitlements of Irish and British citizens under this long-standing arrangement will continue in any circumstance.  This is one of the Government&rsquo;s four key Brexit priorities.</p><p>I will outline the purpose of Parts 11 and 12 of the Bill in turn.  Part 11 sets out amendments to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 in order to maintain the <i>status quo</i>in the common travel area.  My key area of concern, which is one shared by this committee, is the impact of Brexit on current reciprocal arrangements for social insurance, which includes our pensions; social assistance, referring to our means-tested schemes linked to residency rights; and child benefit between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland.</p><p>There are approximately 132,000 people in receipt of a UK state pension living in this country and approximately 1,000 customers receiving child benefit payments from the UK for children residing in Ireland.  There are 28,760 people residing in the UK who are in receipt of a contributory state pension from Ireland.  Some 840 people residing in the UK are in receipt of full-rate child benefit payments from my Department.  These payments are in respect of 1,830 children, 95% of whom reside in Northern Ireland.  A further 920 people residing in the UK are in receipt of child benefit supplement payments from my Department in respect of 2,010 children, 97% of whom reside in Northern Ireland.  We want to ensure the continuation of these payments and that is what we are doing with this legislation.</p><p>My objective is to ensure that the reciprocity of social welfare rights and entitlements which currently exists for Irish and UK citizens moving within the common travel area is safeguarded and maintained.  Ireland and the UK share a long history of co-operation and reciprocity in social security matters.  The principle of reciprocity has been reinforced in bilateral agreements and arrangements on social security between the two countries since 1924.  That reciprocity is underpinned by the principle of equal treatment so that Irish citizens enjoy the same benefits as UK citizens and <i>vice versa</i>.  These rules are designed to protect people moving and working between each State and to minimise any disadvantages they might experience.  From a social welfare perspective, maintenance of this <i>status quo</i>through safeguarding and preserving that very reciprocity is of critical importance to me and the Government.</p><p>Owing to the unique nature of the common travel area and the associated rights and privileges which it will continue to provide for Irish and British citizens in each others' countries, it was agreed that Ireland and the UK would formalise the pre-existing common travel area social protection arrangements in a legally binding agreement.  That agreement was signed on 1 February and is now subject to ratification processes in both Ireland and the UK.  Under the terms of the agreement, all existing arrangements with regard to recognition of, and access to, social insurance entitlements will be maintained in both of our jurisdictions.  This means that the rights of Irish citizens living in Ireland to benefit from social insurance contributions made when working in the UK and to access social insurance payments if resident in the UK are protected and <i>vice versa.</i>As part of the ratification process, the agreement was laid before the Houses on 7 and 8 February and it was the subject of a motion in the D&aacute;il on 12 February.I will discuss it with the Chair and my colleagues at the Select Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection tomorrow, 21 February.  The ratification process in the UK is also under way.</p><p>While I am confident that the ratification will be completed in both jurisdictions before 29 March, I want to be absolutely certain that export and payment of benefits between Ireland and the United Kingdom and <i>vice versa</i>can continue, even if all the necessary steps in the ratification process are not completed by that date.  That is the overall purpose of the amendments in Part 11 of the Bill.  </p><p>The draft heads as published in the general scheme were intended to provide the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection with power to make regulations relating to a range of issues such as the treatment of events of facts occurring in the UK; the taking account of social insurance contributions paid in the UK; the habitual residence condition; the avoidance of multiple payments; arrangements in relation to the absence from the State provisions; arrangements regarding frontier workers, where the frontier crossed is that between Ireland and the UK; the exchange of information; and arrangements to ensure the maintenance of the current arrangements <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the UK as the current arrangements governed by the EU regulations are more expansive than the existing bilateral arrangements with the UK.</p><p>There have been a number of changes made to Part 11 as the drafting process progressed, although it is important to note that the overall aims and outcomes remain unchanged.  During the drafting process, a more streamlined approach emerged which effectively allows the Minister - in this case, me - to make an order to provide for the implementation of a signed agreement which has not yet been ratified where he or she is satisfied that the other party is in the process of ratifying it.  An order has also been drafted to give this effect if required.  As a result, most of the provisions initially envisaged are not required as they were intended to achieve the same ends.  As such, the Bill as published will look quite different from the general scheme in this regard.  In addition, the regulations which were envisaged by the initial draft heads should not now be required.</p><p>Other amendments insert specific references to the UK into a number of sections of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act so that the same rules will be applied with regard to the treatment of the UK under these provisions when the UK is no longer covered by existing references to member states in those provisions.  These amendments will ensure maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>with regard to social welfare payments in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>Part 12 amends the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984, which provides for the insolvency payments scheme.  The scheme covers wage-related entitlements of employees who are employed in Ireland by an employer who has become insolvent in Ireland or another EU member state, which currently includes the UK.  Once the UK leaves the EU, employers in a state of insolvency under the laws of the UK will not fall within the scope of the Act.  That means employees of those employers who work and pay their insurance in Ireland would no longer be covered by the protections set out in the Act unless the amendments set out in this Part are made.</p><p>The purpose of the amendments in this Part is to ensure that those employees will continue to be covered by the scheme, after a no-deal Brexit.  To achieve this, the amendments in this Part provide for updates to existing definitions of terms such as &ldquo;competent authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;relevant officer&rdquo;;  for employees who are employed or habitually employed in Ireland whose employers are made insolvent under the laws of the UK to continue to be covered by the scheme; that the date an employer is made insolvent under the laws of the UK will continue to be the date an employer will be regarded as having become insolvent for the purposes of the scheme; that amounts certified by an actuary or a person performing a similar task in respect of employers made insolvent in the UK, where the employees are habitually employed in Ireland, will continue to be covered by the scheme; and that information can be exchanged, in line with the provisions of the general data protection regulation, with a relevant officer appointed to an employer which is in a state of insolvency under the laws of the United Kingdom.</p><p>In the economic uncertainties which may prevail in a no-deal scenario, it is vital that we continue to provide this kind of protection to workers in Ireland and that is why I am introducing these amendments.</p><p> The timetable for the Bill is that we expect to publish the full omnibus Bill on Friday, 22 February.  It is our intention that it will go before the D&aacute;il for Second Stage from 26 to 28 February, inclusive, and will go through Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il from 4 to 8 March, inclusive.  It will then go to the Seanad for Second Stage between 11 and 12 March, inclusive, followed by Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad on 13 and 14 March.</p><p> This legislation is an essential part of our whole-of-Government preparations for Brexit and I genuinely appreciate the co-operation of this committee, and the entire D&aacute;il and Seanad to ensure that this Bill will get past all the relevant Stages between now and the dreaded date of 29 March. </p><p> I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for allowing me to outline the legislative details and processes so far and I thank members for their attention.  I will be happy to hear their comments and to take any questions they may have.</p></speech>

My understanding is that we are one of the last countries in Europe to be discussing this type of legislation.  I do not understand why this was not done much sooner.  Basically, what we are asked to do here is pass legislation in the hope that there may not be a no-deal Brexit, and there may not be any reason for ever implementing that legislation.</p> <p>  The way we are doing it now is rushed.  It is a last-minute job.  We will come right up against the date of 29 March, as outlined by the Minister in her reply to the Chairman.  I think that is regrettable.  </p> <p>  The Minister has also mentioned that the social welfare section of the omnibus Bill will underpin the present legal arrangements for the common travel area.  The Minister will be aware that doubts have been expressed about the legal foundations that presently exist for the common travel area.  Is this agreement, which the Minister has signed with the British Government, designed to deal with those doubts which were quite legitimately raised?</p> <p>  It is regrettable that we should be here today legislating in this way and staring a no-deal Brexit in the face because of the fact that a campaign was conducted in another country which was utterly misleading; because we have a Parliament in another country which has become the laughing stock of the world; and in view of the fact that we have a Prime Minister in another country who is more interested in keeping her own party together than in the welfare of the people.  It is very regrettable that we are staring in the face of the possibility of a hard border, tariffs which will wipe out our agrifood industry and general disruption.  That is where we are so I presume we have to get on with it.  We will not, of course, be opposing the Bill, but I regret that we do not have more time to consider it.</p> <p>  The main questions I will be asking concern the amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and whether the Minister covered every possible angle there.  I notice that in the definition of the Act referred to, the 2005 Act, the definition of social assistance does not include, for example, domiciliary care allowance.  Maybe there is a good reason for that.  </p> <p>  The other question I wish to ask the Minister is how long will it take to produce those regulations?  As far as the 2005 Act is concerned, the Minister is giving herself the power to produce regulations.  How long will it take to produce those regulations?  Will these regulations amend existing regulations and if so, could she indicate which regulations they are amending so that we can have a look at them?  On the assumption that the UK is going to crash out of the EU without a deal on 29 March, what is the position as regards reciprocal arrangements for social welfare if the regulations have not been put in place at that stage?  What happens in the interim period?</p> <p>  I also want to ask the Minister about statements that were issued yesterday by a number of leading pension providers, namely, financial institutions who pay pensions in the UK, that have expressed the opinion that Irish people in receipt of those pensions will no longer be able to receive the payments into their own bank accounts.  Presumably, these payments are coming into their Irish bank accounts at present.  The view of these - one of which deals with a major part of these payments of private pensions to Irish citizens - indicates that people may have to open a sterling account in the UK, which will be quite unacceptable.  The suggested solution to that particular conundrum was some sort of a banking agreement or arrangement to be agreed between the two countries at some time in the future, presumably before 29 March.  </p> <p>  I presume we can go into the details of the heads of the Bill later, on which I have a few questions, but these are general questions to which I seek responses now.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.956" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019022000002#C01000"><p>As I definitely would, I thank the Chairman and appreciate that.</p> <p>  I am not sure why the Deputy thinks that we are very late in the day with regard to this, given that I have described in detail the amount of work that has been done by the Department with regard to the convention that started at the beginning of 2018.  I have said a number of times on the record that I travelled to London last year to meet my then counterpart, a lovely lady called Esther McVey.  We both had similar intentions, which was that after what hopefully would have been a deal, that is, an exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union with a ratified agreement, we were going to have as part of Protocol 20 a bilateral arrangement as regards the reciprocity of both of our social security arrangements.  That deal was signed on 1 February and comes into play once it is ratified here, hopefully on Thursday, with regard to the Irish contingency.  It is currently in a 21-day resting period in the United Kingdom.  When that deal is ratified by the UK Parliament and Irish Parliament, which will most likely happen on 19 or 20 March, there will be no need for this legislation because the commitments that we made to each other as the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland will come into legally binding force.  I am preparing this legislation on the basis that, maybe, something will happen in the United Kingdom which will not allow it to ratify that deal within the 21-day period.  I believe we are being incredibly prudent. </p> <p>  I have also discovered since drafting this particular section 11 of this Bill that I really do not need to draft the legislation to ratify that because I have within our gift currently a regulation that we could sign on the basis that the United Kingdom is in the process of ratifying the Bill or the bilateral agreement, as both it and we are currently doing.  We could extend the legal arrangements that we currently have until that Bill is ratified.  This legislation is really in the case of absolutely everything else and throwing the bucket and the kitchen sink at it going wrong.  The intention for many months of both the United Kingdom's Parliament - I am now working with the second Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, a lovely lady called Amber Rudd - and our own Department and Government has been that we will do absolutely everything to ensure that the reciprocal arrangements that Irish people and British people have enjoyed in each other's nations for donkey's years will continue on and after 29 March and that is what we are going to ensure.  </p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned that there were some doubts legally.  I am unsure from where he got that information.</p></speech>

There have been suggestions that the legal underpinning is pretty shaky and that it would need more comprehensive legislation.</p><p>There have been a number of academic papers and a certain amount of public discussion on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.959" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019022000002#D00200"><p>I think that may have been true insofar as when we tried to find a legal definition of and legal arrangements for the common travel area, which has been enjoyed for many decades, there probably was not a very sound legal basis.  However, we now have a bilateral agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom on the reciprocity of all our social insurance and social security arrangements, so there is absolutely no doubt but that it has a legally binding underpinning in both legislation as a convention in Ireland and now as a convention in England, once both conventions are ratified by both parliaments.</p> <p>  Again, as I suggested to Deputy O'Dea, the regulations will not need to be drafted if and when the convention is passed in both the Irish Parliament and the UK Parliament.  Again, I cannot be sure the kitchen sink will not be thrown at something.  The Parliamentary Counsel is drafting regulations for all the Departments involved in the miscellaneous Bill, and we will be well within the 29 March deadline.  As I said to the Deputy, I am very positive, as is Amber Rudd, that both our conventions will be signed, will be legally binding and will be ratified by our Parliament and that of the UK long before 29 March.  When I say "long before", it might only be seven days before, but seven days is a long time in politics around here these days.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.963" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019022000002#D00600"><p>I thank the Minister and commend the multi-strand approach that has been taken, which is prudent and appropriate.  The primary concern, as she herself said, is to ensure continuity for those who are very much reliant on their social protection payments and that whatever the concerns might be or if it is the case that we end up having a hard Brexit, we try to bridge that scenario.  That will be important.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is probably the Department that shows more than others that people will continue to have histories, families and relationships and everything else that spans across both territories.  Some of the measures we are proposing to put in place here will ensure that those families, which are the basis of our relationship with our neighbour, are supported.</p> <p>  I have a few specific questions and concerns which the Minister might address.  I note she is looking to make regulations, and the habitual residency condition is mentioned.  It is very loosely worded here.  This is an issue in respect of which a number of other issues are pending on the habitual residency condition that have been raised in the past - for example, the extent of its relationship with child benefit and so forth.  Is there perhaps scope within those regulations, even if not now, to address some of these issues?  That is one issue.  The issue of ensuring we have that comprehensive cover was already raised.  I refer to all assistance payments and entitlements.</p> <p>  The Minister might address the issue of paternity, maternity and parental leave.  I am conscious that we have parental leave legislation that may almost dovetail with the entitlements, so it is a matter of ensuring compatibility between those allowances.  We are moving out of the simple area of payments and into the area of payments and rights and entitlements.  Perhaps the Minister could say whether those issues have been addressed.</p> <p>  This brings me to the fact, which she rightly pointed out, that there has been a long history of social co-operation on these areas since the 1920s.  We also have the Good Friday Agreement and the rights pillar within it.  Social welfare payments in respect of disability and certain other areas are in a way part of the way in which we vindicate that rights component.</p> <p>  There are a number of areas where we are giving regulations in respect of third countries.  Perhaps it is a question of how this fits with the UK versus other third-country parties and how we balance that.</p> <p>  Data protection concerns are addressed somewhat under head 7, which concerns the exchange of information.  It notes that it will be compatible with the GDPR, but perhaps the Minister might expand on this a little.  She knows we have discussed this issue in the past.  I am keen that we have a system that functions but how can we ensure there is clarity on the purposes for which the information is exchanged to ensure that the Bill is robust under the GDPR, particularly in respect of EU citizens based in Ireland?  While every Irish person is an EU citizen, I refer to citizens of other EU countries and so forth.  I am just conscious that we must plan to address the issue of people who may effectively have triple-part pensions.  There may be those who have a pension from Germany, the UK and Ireland, for example.</p> <p>  Regarding head 12, under which the area of employment is dealt with, I recognise and I think it is positive that there are measures regarding frontier workers, how they are defined and the question of the employment rights in the case of any decision.  However, what wider provision is made in this regard?  This relates not only to this Bill, but also to what we all hope will happen, which is an agreed Brexit, and employment standards, which are within the Minister's remit.  These are two very specific, small employment issues that are addressed, but there are a number of other employment issues - for example, situations in which British companies are contracted under public procurement and may have contracts with the State.  How do we ensure that employment standards are maintained and that anyone who has been paid by the Irish State - in a five-year contract, for example - does not see any diminishment of employment standards?</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the anomalies the Senator thinks exist, the way in which habitual residency stands and is operated today, warts and all, is exactly how it will operate on 30 March.  We have not changed it or deviated.  What we have done is literally mirror exactly every single operation that occurs between Ireland and the United Kingdom and between the United Kingdom and Ireland today in the convention.  Therefore, nothing will change in the way in which we administer the habitual residency clause, both in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It will be exactly the same.  We have gone through every single scheme.  I acknowledge I have probably continually focused on our pensioners and recipients of children's allowance because they are the largest numbers of people but there are other people on different schemes, which again will be exact mirror images.  Whoever is entitled to be on a scheme today, whether one is in receipt of a payment in Ireland or in the United Kingdom, because of transfers of data between our countries and work practices and residency, the position on 30 March will be exactly as it has been, and that includes paternity and maternity benefits.</p><p>Parental leave is not on our Statute Book, and we cannot have a convention for something we might do in the future because I have no idea whether we will ever get around to passing legislation on parental leave, given the precariousness of matters at present.  However, if and when the parental leave Bill is passed - please God, at the end of this year - we will then discuss extending the bilateral arrangements with the United Kingdom on that basis.</p><p>Again, the whole aim and our initial wish from many months ago is for the United Kingdom and Ireland to have an agreement that reflects the practices of the common travel arrangements that have been in place for donkey's years in our future relationship.  That is what is in the convention.  We will not effectively treat the United Kingdom as a third country because it is now a part of the new bilateral convention.</p><p>As for the GDPR, it is already stated in the convention that we will continue to share data.  Both Ireland and the United Kingdom are adhering to the GDPR of the European Union to which both of us must adhere.  That will not change on 30 March.  What will also not change on 30 March is what Senator Higgins referred to when she spoke about employment standards.  Ireland's laws will be Ireland's laws; the United Kingdom's laws will be the United Kingdom's laws.  English companies coming over and working contractually in Ireland will continue to be obliged to work under our laws and, <i>vice versa</i>, if Irish companies go to the United Kingdom for contracts, they will continue to work under the United Kingdom's laws.  In the main, our laws are exactly the same at present.  We are probably about to adhere to and adopt Regulation 883/2004 on Friday, and the United Kingdom will still be very much a member of the European Union on Friday.  When the United Kingdom leaves, therefore, both our regulations and our laws will be exactly the same.  Someone would need to make a change to them for us to start deviating.  I am not proposing in this legislation or in the convention to try to impose new regulations from an employment perspective on the United Kingdom's companies other than what already exists on the Statue Book in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is important we had an opportunity to discuss this Bill with the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, who I thank for her attendance and her presentation.  It is regrettable that we are here at all.  I say that with reference to what Deputy O'Dea said.  However, we have to deal with the hand that is being played.  I compliment the Minister and her officials on the work they have done in this area, in particular the Minister's work with her counterpart in the UK.  There is a great deal of concern among people in regard to the security of their entitlements.  I welcome that the Bill underpins the common travel area and ensures that the associated rights and entitlements of Irish and British citizens under this long-standing arrangement will continue in any circumstance.</p> <p>  Will the Minister outline what payments are covered by the agreement signed on 1 February 2019?  Will she also confirm that pensioners in Ireland will continue to receive their UK pensions into their bank accounts and that the all-Ireland free travel scheme will not be impacted by Brexit?</p></speech>

The payments covered include the State pension (contributory), carer's benefit, health and safety benefit, illness benefit, treatment benefit, adoptive benefit, maternity benefit, paternity benefit, invalidity pension, partial capacity benefit, widow's, widower's and surviving civil partner's contributory pension, guardian's payment contributory, occupational injury benefit, widowed or surviving civil partner grant, jobseeker's benefit and family benefits, including the back-to-work family dividend, child benefit, guardian's payment non-contributory, domiciliary care allowance, one-parent family payment and working family payment.  The corresponding UK payments are reciprocal to Irish citizens.</p><p>With regard to the free travel scheme, the all-Ireland free travel scheme was introduced in April 2007 through the programme for Government based on agreement with the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Assembly.  It is not subject to EU legislation and, therefore, it will continue to operate unchanged after Brexit.  We are currently reviewing the contractual arrangements with Translink, the company contracted to supply the senior smartpass card which is based in the UK, in Belfast and Hull, to ensure that we have full compliance with the data protection obligations under GDPR.  This work is well advanced and necessary and it will be completed before B-day.</p><p>On the pensions question, the manner in which people currently receive their payments will continue on and after 29 March.  There will be no change.  </p><p>In regard to Deputy O'Dea's earlier reference to the article in this morning's edition of the<i>Irish Independent</i>, that relates to private pensions, which has nothing to do with my Department.  I am aware that there are negotiations taking place between the private pension companies and the Central Bank with regard to a banking licence, which, again, has nothing to do with my Department.  Irish people in receipt of an Irish pension and living in the UK and UK people in receipt of a UK pension and living in Ireland will continue to be paid in the same manner.  There is no reason to change banks or to worry in any way.  </p></speech>

It is important that these reciprocal rights are reflected in law and bilateral agreements.  They must be enshrined and anchored in primary law to ensure that everybody's entitlements are protected.  It is unfortunate that Brexit has precipitated this move but it is probably a good idea anyway to enshrine these rights and entitlements in law.  I am assuming that Brexit of some description will happen, unfortunately, but in any event we are proceeding with legislation to ensure that the reciprocal rights are enshrined.  It is probably a good idea to take a belt-and-braces approach to enshrining these rights in legislation.  This probably should have happened many decades ago.  As I said, Brexit has precipitated this move.  When can we expect this to happen?</p></speech>

There is great merit to it.</p> <p>  On employment rights, we can all be satisfied that the protections that Irish laws provides to workers will be afforded to British people working here.  They will enjoy the same rights and entitlements and protections as any other posted worker under the principles of the posted worker directive.  This is very positive and provides people with reassurance.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to elaborate on the arrangements regarding frontier workers.  I am assuming that arrangements regarding frontier workers relate to residents living on one side of the Border or the other and working across the Border and so on.  There are several thousand people who are so affected.  Many people I represent in north Louth have concerns in this regard.  Crossing the Border a number of times a day is taken for granted by people living in Dundalk and working in Newry or living in Drogheda and working in Newry.  The Minister is well aware of the issue.  This Bill gives legislative expression to those protections that are already enjoyed.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on the issues she has encountered in this area and the protections that will be reflected in the legislation.</p> <p>  I welcome the move by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Minister to amend the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984.  Insolvencies occur all too frequently and given the activities of British business here and that of related companies such as parent companies and so on, this is very important.  People will be reassured that those protections that are currently enjoyed around insolvency legislation will be applied to anybody who is made redundant in an insolvency situation, if employed by a UK parent company.</p></speech>

It is not until one seeks out the legal underpinning for this area that one realises it came up short.  We have signed the convention and, hopefully, it will be ratified here in the next couple of days.  I will briefly outline what happens in the UK.  We both signed the convention on the same day.  The UK has a 21-day cooling period, which we do not have.  We have both laid the convention before the respective Houses.  I think it was laid before the D&aacute;il last week, with the motion to come to committee tomorrow morning.  The United Kingdom is slightly different.  It has a 21-parliamentary-sitting-day cooling period, during which parliamentarians in the UK can make observations or suggestions on the convention.  They do this through a privy committee, which is due to sit on 13 March.  The cooling-off period ends on 19 March.  I genuinely hope that by 20 March, the Parliament in Westminster and the Parliament here will have ratified the convention on behalf of both nations.  We were instructed in December to draft this miscellaneous Bill in preparation for a no-deal Brexit to replicate everything from my Department's perspective that is in the convention.</p><p> The convention was part of the withdrawal agreement, Protocol 20.  In the event of it not being ratified we were going to ratify the legislation on how we will protect Irish citizens and all the payments that are made to them.  However, we discovered during drafting it that once the convention had been signed and the intent and goodwill of both parliaments were ongoing, which they are, we did not necessarily need to pass the legislation and that we could pass a regulation to continue doing what we have always done on the basis that the goodwill exists for both parliaments to pass and ratify the protocols.  That is true of section 11 of the Bill but not of section 12 because it is not included in the convention.</p><p> I will continue to pursue section 11 of the Bill because nobody knows what can happen on any day.  However, because of the interactions and the intentions of both of the Secretaries of State for Work and Pensions I have had the pleasure of working with over the last 18 months, I am very positively disposed that the convention will be signed and that what we have enjoyed, from a security perspective, in the common travel arrangements for many years will become subject to a bilateral agreement and then will be subject to law.</p><p> With regard to frontier workers, the common travel arrangement is a long-standing arrangement and it means that most Irish citizens can move freely to live, work and study in the UK on the same basis on which UK citizens come here.  The rights and entitlements include access to employment, healthcare, education, social benefits and the right to vote.  Frontier workers, being persons who pursue an employment activity in one state and reside in another, returning there daily and at least once a week, are provided for in the agreement signed on 1 February in the same manner as they were under European Union rules of social security co-ordination, as provided for in Regulation EC 883/2004.  The arrangements we have enjoyed under that directive that we all signed in the European Union in 2004 are enshrined in the bilateral convention.  Again, with fingers and toes crossed that all goes well on 20 March, frontier workers will continue to work with the same rights, privileges and responsibilities they have always enjoyed since the European directive was established in 2004.  It means people who are employed in Ireland but living in the UK and people who are employed in the UK but living in Ireland will have access to all the family benefits that are available to people in Ireland for family members who are residing in the UK as if they were residing here.  It will not matter where one lives and works as long as one lives and works within the two countries.</p><p> In addition, the existing arrangements for frontier workers who become unemployed will remain.  If a frontier worker becomes wholly employed, the person's contribution record in the state of the employment, for the sake of argument people from Louth who are working in Newry, will remain recognised by Ireland as it is today.  There will be no change.  That will be ratified within the convention on whatever date it is in March.  However, I will pursue the legislation in section 11 of the miscellaneous Bill just in case.</p></speech>

Many of the questions I had intended to ask have been asked.  I welcome the anchoring of the common travel area.  I congratulate the Minister on the huge amount of work her Department has done, given the huge concerns among the public.  When one considers the figures for pensions and child benefit, a huge amount of work has been done.  Will there be any delay on payments if there is no deal?  Will there be paperwork on both sides for pensioners or those in receipt of child benefit if there is no deal?  What about the provision of information to citizens?  Much of the time no information comes to them and they are left in the dark at the last minute.  Does the Minister expect an increase in unemployment as a result of Brexit, especially in Border areas?</p> <p>  We are going into the unknown here and the Government and the Department have done a good job over the last three months.  Unfortunately, we might see Britain go over the cliff on 29 March, which will be very sad.  I am worried that Britain has introduced legislation, which not many people know about, providing that when skilled workers come to Britain from other European countries after Brexit they will be allowed to stay for five years while unskilled workers will be allowed to stay for three years.  That has been passed by the British Parliament.  I cannot understand why there has not been uproar throughout Europe about it.  It is in place.  However, that is a matter for another day.</p></speech>

We have the convention of the bilateral arrangement.</p> <p>  Regarding the concerns people might have about delay and paperwork, the ambition is that Irish people living in Britain and who are in receipt of an Irish contributory pension or child benefit payment will not notice that it is 30 March at all and that there will be no changes whatsoever.  The same will be true if one is a British citizen living in Ireland or Northern Ireland and receiving any contribution towards a payment under the schemes I listed earlier.  One will notice no difference.  I can say that comfortably for two reasons.  Either the ratification of the convention we signed on 1 February will have taken place and will become a legally binding international bilateral convention that is recognised and becomes law or, in the event of that not happening, with the co-operation of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad we will pass this lengthy miscellaneous Bill, which will allow me to continue to make the payments that we are currently arranging.  There will be no delay or exchanges of paperwork other than the information that flows between the UK agencies and Irish agencies with regard to social security that happens now.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct that we probably have not yet told citizens exactly what will happen.  If I were to absolutely guarantee today that people do not have to worry about anything and everything will be fine, as sure as eggs are eggs something will happen next Tuesday and I will not be able to guarantee.  However, our intention and the intention of the two Secretaries of State for Work and Pensions I have worked with over the last 18 months is that when somebody wakes up the day after the United Kingdom leaves, whenever that may be and it might not be 29 March, the arrangements for social security and all the schemes I outlined earlier will be exactly as they were the day before.  In addition, the common travel arrangements we have had with regard to education, healthcare, work and social security will be exactly as they were for many generations.</p> <p>  On the Senator's last question, there is no such thing as a good Brexit.  I believe I heard a Deputy earlier this week call it a stable Brexit.  I do not agree.  I do not believe there is anything that could be called a stable Brexit.  This will not be good for any section of Irish society or, in my opinion, for society in the UK.  Given the impact it will have on businesses throughout this country I have no doubt that it will have an impact on the live register figures.  We have started analysis and we will be starting detailed preparations as to what we can expect and how to provide supports for the people who will be impacted negatively arising from what may happen in the next few weeks.  Our contingency plans are to ensure that we minimise as much as possible for the Republic and that we have activation measures and supports for industry in place to ensure the least worst Brexit outcome that is possible for Irish citizens.</p></speech>

You saw the paper today which referred to the fact that legislation would be introduced to ensure people would receive their payments and so forth.  It is important that you and the Department have a communications strategy in place.  You might say it is premature now because neither the convention nor the legislation has been passed, but people are still concerned.  Many people have no concern because they have never left the country and their payments will remain, but people who have been abroad for a number of years have concerns.  The Department must ensure it has a satisfactory communications strategy in place before something happens rather than afterwards.</p></speech>

It will look exactly the same.  We should not have all our eggs in one basket.  In an ideal world, where people have common sense, the ratification of the convention that was signed on 1 February would be something we could guarantee will pass.  We obviously want it to be ratified.  The UK parliament will go through its normal process, involving a 21-day cooling period and applications being made to the privy committee before it is passed.  With respect, however, to Members of the British Parliament, I cannot find myself in a position, on 29 March, where this is not passed in Westminster.  I have an obligation to the 132,000 pensioners and the thousands of other people I mentioned earlier, which is why we will pass the legislation that empowers me, from a legal perspective, to continue making those payments.

I expect the UK to have ratified this by 20 March, but for argument's sake - I hate saying things out loud because sometimes they come true - if it does not happen because, for example, everyone gets bird flu and is off for two weeks, and ratification cannot occur until 9 April, this legislation gives me the ability to pass, draft or sign a regulation which would allow us to continue to pay what we are currently paying until 9 April or whatever date it is passed.  The intention of the Minister at the Department of Work and Pensions in the UK, and indeed our intention, is to continue to do what we set out to do a year and a half ago and pass this convention before 29 March.</p></speech>

Take, for example, an Irish gentleman who has worked for some time in Ireland, in London and in Berlin.  When he retires his pension contributions will be an amalgamation of the contributions made in three countries.  The Irish system will pay him, and the information will be shared through the social security arrangements we have.  The UK will continue to give us the details it holds on the contributions the man made in London, and the Berlin social security system will give us the details of the contributions he made in Berlin.  We will then determine what the pension is and pay it accordingly.</p></speech>

We do not want a situation where regulations are made on the basis of the omnibus Bill and we do not have a sense of when they will be reviewed or when the nuanced work we would ideally like to do will be carried out.  </p> <p>  My last point is related to the legislation, and concerns exceptional needs payments.  They are likely to be separate payments, but a number of persons will become vulnerable post-Brexit.  Are there plans in place within the Department to look at allocating more resources to exceptional needs payments, or for a potential review of the issues that might arise in that area?  </p></speech>

Nobody wants a no-deal Brexit, so we are still working incredibly hard to avoid it.  If we get a deal, whether on 29 March or some other date later, this particular Bill becomes redundant.  A large body of work has been done in this area, but one would almost be saying a novena in the hope it becomes redundant.</p></speech>

I am ensuring that the law, if the UK becomes a third country, would not relate to employees.  I do not want to be disrespectful to employers from the UK, but the only people I am concerned about are the employees, who would most likely be Irish resident employees of UK companies.  The scheme currently does not pay out where there are assets.  It only kicks in where there are no assets.  Other legislation relates to the governance of the particular issues the Senator mentioned.  The current legislation governing insolvency arrangement is with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></speech>

The State refuses to leave employees with nothing.  If we did nothing, the United Kingdom would become a third country and would not be subject to this Bill, and the Irish employees in UK companies would not be protected.  We are extending the provisions in the Bill to ensure that the UK, if it becomes a third country, will be subject to the Bill.  It is a safety net, and we hope that it will be used relatively rarely.</p> <p>  There is no extra provision in our exceptional needs budget because it is entirely driven by demand.  I may look for a supplementary budget, as could happen any year, but it is the same as disability provisions and jobseeker's allowance.  If anything happens to scuttle the budgets we agreed we will have another conversation at a later point.  We certainly will not be turning anyone away.  </p></speech>

I apologise.  We have a Getting Ireland Brexit Ready website, on which the information is detailed, but the Chair has made a very good suggestion.  Given that we know who will be affected we should perhaps not put the willies up everybody and should deal directly with the 130,000 people involved.  It is a very good point, and I have taken a note of it.</p></speech>
