We are delighted to be here.  On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, I thank the committee for providing the time for us to debate the Bill.  The Bill is an important step on the journey of strengthening of the Government's framework for the HSE.  It is a priority for Sl&aacute;intecare and this Government.  </p><p>The public appointments process has taken place and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane and eight other members of the new board including deputy chair, Professor Deirdre Madden, have been selected.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019022000002#B00700"><p>I will speak to amendments Nos. 1, 8 to 15, inclusive, Nos. 18 to 20, inclusive, Nos. 22 to 24, inclusive and 26 to 28, inclusive together.  The substantive amendments are amendments Nos. 8 and 18 and are concerned with strengthening the roles and responsibilities of the board and CEO.  The other amendments are consequential amendments.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 8 which gives new functions to the board.  First, the board must be satisfied that appropriate systems, procedures and practices  are in place to further the HSE's object.  This is critical as, under the Health Act 2004, the HSE's object is to use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p> <p>  Second, the board must ensure that appropriate systems, procedures and practices are in place for internal performance management and accountability.  These systems must cover how the HSE performs its functions under the Health Act 2004, how the HSE achieves its objectives in accordance with the its corporate plan and how the HSE delivers health and personal social services in accordance with the Health Act 2004.  These will also cover how the executive enables compliance with Government or ministerial policies, whether set out in codes, guidelines or other documents. </p> <p>  Amendment No. 18 provides for the CEO's role.  The CEO must ensure that these appropriate systems, procedures and practices are in place.  The board's requirement to satisfy itself that appropriate systems are in place is therefore mirrored by the requirement on the CEO to ensure that the systems are put in place.  The intention under these amendments is in this way to situate roles and responsibilities appropriately.  In addition to the provisions I have outlined, amendment No. 8 will also place a responsibility on the board to ensure the establishment and implementation of appropriate arrangements to manage the CEO&rsquo;s  performance. </p> <p>  Amendments Nos.  9 to 15, inclusive, and Nos. 26 to 28 are technical amendments to the Bill arising out of amendments proposed to the functions of the board.  They amend section references.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 1 and  22 to 24, inclusive, are also consequential to the substantive amendments.  Where referring to Government or ministerial policies, the language in the amendments refers to policies whether set out in codes, guidelines or other documents.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 22 to 24, inclusive, are consequential amendments from the wording in amendments Nos. 8 and 18.  The aim of these amendments is to ensure consistency of language throughout the Health Act 2004 where reference is made to ministerial or Government policies.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019022000002#B00800"><p>I refer to amendment No. 18 and proposed subsection (b)(ii)(III), which inserts the words "delivery of health and personal social services in accordance with this Act".  I am open to correction but that strikes me as something of a shift in responsibility.  It seems to shift a great deal of responsibility from the shoulders of the Minister and onto the CEO or director general.  I am concerned about that as it conflicts with Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare seeks to maintain or shift much more responsibility towards the Minister.  I am concerned about this and will oppose amendment No. 18 purely and simply because of that line.  The Minister of State should correct me if I have misread it.</p> <p>  Will she go into more detail to explain why amendments Nos. 22 to 24, inclusive, are necessary?  There seems to be some duplication.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019022000002#B00900"><p>The HSE is responsible for operational issues and the Minister is responsible for policies.</p> <p>  The CEO must ensure that appropriate systems are in place and the board must satisfy itself that the systems are in place.  Strategically from a policy perspective, the legislation will now require the CEO to put in place systems and procedures for internal performance management and accountability for the HSE.  </p> <p>  This is a new legislative requirement, which will ensure that the HSE puts in place not just the performance management framework that monitors the implementation and delivery of the corporate plan and services, but also set out what accountability system it will put in place to ensure senior management answerability regarding the achievement of these plans.  </p> <p>  The aim of some of the amendments is to ensure consistency of language throughout the Health Act 2004 when referring to Government or ministerial policies.  Policies are polices whether set out in codes, guidelines or any other documents or combination of documents.  </p> <p>  The need for these technical changes arise in section 7 of the Health Act 2004 in respect of the object and functions of the HSE, section 29 of the Act in respect of the corporate plan, and section 31 of the Act in respect of the service plan.  </p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 22 and 24 are drafting amendments to the corporate plan and services.  They add text to the description of how the policy can be examined, for example, documents or codes.</p><p>I have nothing further to add on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019022000002#C00200"><p>If I could go back to amendment No. 18, I am not trying to be awkward but it seems to be in conflict with the stated aim of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The amendment refers to ensuring "appropriate systems, procedures and practices are in place" for the "internal performance management and accountability of the Executive".  This appears to shift some responsibility from the Minister, where it should lie, and place much more responsibility on staff who do not set ministerial objectives but are left holding the can if they are not achieved.  Much of this is resource dependent.  The amendment strikes me as unnecessary and runs counter to what we are trying to do with Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

This is an unusual use of language.  Does that mean with the prior approval of the Minister or with the approval of the Minister post the decision?</p></speech>

I thank the committee for facilitating discussion on these amendments.  Health systems across the world are faced with rising demands for health care, increasing inequalities in health and limited resources to address these needs.  If, as envisioned in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, we are to improve population health planning and deliver more effective and integrated care, we will need to premise the design and delivery of new models of care on best national and international evidence and make appropriate use of all of the available data sources which can inform service planning and provision.</p><p>A health needs assessment is a systematic method of identifying unmet health and healthcare needs of a population and identifying the changes required to meet those unmet needs.  The intention of the health needs assessment amendments is to provide for a more strategically targeted, beneficial and ambitious approach to such studies than is currently the case.  Their use will ensure that the health system becomes more responsive to the dynamic and changing nature of our population's healthcare needs and ensure, as proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, that addressing the social determinants of health becomes a guiding principle in the design of our healthcare system.</p><p>The amendments provide for ministerial directions to be issued to the HSE which will require it to conduct evidence based scientific, statistical or other systematic analysis with a view to bringing about change beneficial to the health of the population.  The scope and timeframe for conducting any such assessment will be included as part of the direction.  Provision is also made for the development of guidelines which will inform how assessments are to be conducted and for supplementary directions to be issued in circumstances where the content of an assessment report may need to be improved prior to publication.  The findings of assessment reports will be published by the HSE on its website.</p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 2 is to include provision for the issuing of ministerial directions for the conduct of health needs assessments within the ambit of section 10 of the Health Act 2004, which covers ministerial directions more generally.</p><p>Amendment No. 4 provides for a new section to be included in the Bill, which inserts a new section 10AA in the Health Act 2004, addressing the details of how the ministerial directions relating to health needs assessments will operate in practice, the implementation of such directions and related matters.  Subsection (1) provides that a direction relating to health needs assessments that is issued by the Minister must include details as to the specific requirements to be taken into consideration by the HSE when conducting the assessments that is the subject of the direction.  Subsection (2) provides details as to the types of requirements that might be taken into consideration for inclusion in a direction.  Subsection (3) provides for consultation by the Minister with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and any other person, as appropriate, prior to issuing a direction.  Subsection (4) provides for the submission of a report on the findings of a health needs assessment by the HSE within such timeframe as the Minister may specify within the direction.  Subsection (5) provides for the approval of any such report within a period of one month after its receipt or for the issue of a supplementary direction to address any defects in the content of the report after it has been submitted.  Subsection (6) provides for publication of the report on the Internet.  Subsection (7) provides for the development of guidelines by the Minister with a view to facilitating the conduct of health needs assessments by the HSE.  Subsection (8) defines the term &quot;health needs assessment&quot; for the purposes of the new section.</p></speech>

If I understand the Minister of State correctly, the amendment provides that the Minister will issue a directive to the HSE to conduct an annual health needs assessment - which sounds sensible - and these are some matters which the Minister may decide to include in that directive.  If that is a correct understanding, then subsection (2) seems redundant.  It goes without saying that the Minister may include whatever he or she wishes to include.  If it is not advisory, should the word "may" be replaced by "shall"?  I would not support that change, but I do not understand the point of the subsection otherwise.  I would include consideration of issues around gender and equality of access, for example.</p></speech>

It is almost a by-the-way suggestion that these are some things which the Minister may consider.  Primary legislation is not the place for that.</p> <p>  The idea of an annual health needs assessment is welcome.  However, it is not currently carried out by the HSE and, therefore, it will require very significant new capabilities.  The HSE will need healthcare econometricians and a significant amount of new data that do not currently exist, are not collected very well or are not comparable between regions.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that when the Bill is passed, the HSE will be able to comply with it and will have the resources, personnel and training to do so?  When is it expected that the HSE will start crunching the numbers on this issue?</p></speech>

Has the HSE identified how many people it needs to hire or what kind of skill sets will be required?  If we pass this into law, the HSE will be obliged to do it.  It is not a simple desktop exercise.  It is very complex for any healthcare system to begin doing this and to do it right.  Have any staff been hired thus far?  What total complement will be required?  Is a new team being set up?  What resources will it have?  Has it been budgeted for?  Is it in the healthcare budget for this year?</p></speech>

Let us assume it will not happen properly this year.  I acknowledge the Minister of State is reading out the answers with which she is provided, but her answer would not fill anyone with confidence that the process will be in place this year.  If the HSE is not sufficiently resourced to do it this year - and it does not seem that it will be - and we pass the Bill into law, thus requiring the HSE to do something for which it is not equipped, what will happen if it does not complete it properly?  What penalties would the HSE face for not being legally compliant once the Bill is passed into law?</p></speech>

I took on the health brief this time last year.  It was shocked when I looked at the executive team of the HSE, and, as it had been for the previous few years, only recently had a clinical lead been added to the senior team, which is extraordinary for a healthcare system.  Just as worrying, there was no patient advocate at all at a senior or junior level.  If there is anything to be learned from what has gone on in healthcare over the past while, it is there must be strong patient representation and advocacy at the highest levels throughout the organisation.  There must also be senior clinical representation, as one of the major failings of our healthcare system is that there are not enough clinical leads or clinicians' voices for doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals across the board.  They are rendered largely silent.  It is interesting that at joint committee meetings there may be eight or nine people in front of us from the HSE and one might be a doctor.  We hear almost nothing from the level of senior management representing nurses and midwifery, allied health professionals and so forth.  That error is being replicated in this Bill putting the board back in place.</p> <p>  The amendment is important, as it would mandate that one of the board members would be a patient advocate.  This does not mean that as well as other duties in a job, that person would happen to do some patient advocacy on the side but rather that the person would be a patient advocate or the voice of the patient on the board.  I would like there to be two clinical experts on the board.  I considered having one from the specialist register as a consultant and another representing nurses and midwifery but that is probably too specific for the legislation.  I have provided for two clinical experts in order that the clinical community would be represented and not just doctors.  Doctors need to be represented but there is a useful opportunity here, for example, to appoint somebody who represents nurses and midwives to the board.  The final board position I would like inserted into the legislation relates to financial expertise for all the obvious reasons.  We need serious financial oversight.</p> <p>  I looked at the Minister's appointments to the board but I will not comment on individuals.  They are pretty mixed, however, and I took a look at the background and expertise of everybody that will be on the board.  Some of the people have relevant expertise for the board of the HSE but some, to be frank, do not and I have no idea what they would be doing on the board.  It is not a well-balanced board and it does not have the requisite financial expertise or clinical representation, including that of doctors, nurses and midwives.  It does not have sufficient provision for patient advocacy, as one of the board members would have patient advocacy as one of a long list of responsibilities.  The person in question is not there solely to represent the voice of patients and the advocacy is just one descriptor in a long list.</p> <p>  We need to mandate the membership.  We cannot leave it to the Government, because we have done so and we can see the board that will be put in place.  I am sure they are all fine people and they will do their best on behalf of the HSE but it is not a balanced board.  Regarding some of the appointments, one would have to wonder what was driving their placement on the board other than politics.  Some nominees are extraordinary.  It is important to mandate clinical representation, financial expertise and, critically, patient advocacy on the board.  I would be very much obliged if the Minister of State accepted the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019022000002#E01400"><p>The Bill provides for a ten-person board, specifically the chairperson, the deputy chairperson and eight ordinary members.  The amendment would require the eight ordinary members to include a patient advocate, a financial expert and two clinical experts.  I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s thinking on this amendment but the view of the Minister is that the best approach is as set out in the Bill as it stands.  Members appointed by the Minister to the HSE board must be people who, in his or her opinion, have sufficient experience and expertise relating to matters connected with the HSE's functions to enable them to make a substantial contribution to the effective and efficient performance of those functions.  The Bill provides for patient advocacy experience or expertise on the board.  This meets the recommendation made by Dr. Gabriel Scally in his scoping review.</p> <p>  In line with the 2014 guidelines on appointments to State boards, vacancies on the board are advertised through the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  The particular requirements required for membership of the board are set out in the PAS campaign.</p><p>The recent campaign for membership of the board sought candidates with experience and expertise in a number of areas including corporate governance, clinical governance, quality assurance and patient safety, strategic planning and change management or business management skills, financial planning and management, patient advocacy, strategic human resource management and public communications. </p><p> A key role of the chair of a State board is to identify the needs of the board for new skills, competencies or experience to ensure that it can effectively perform its role.  It is desirable that board members have a mix of competencies rather than specific competencies.</p><p>The amendment proposed is, therefore, to the Minister's mind, not required as there is a process to ensure the required skill set and competencies for the board of the HSE.</p></speech>

The board does not currently have the correct skill mix.  Members have been appointed to the board who have zero experience in healthcare.  It is beyond me what they are doing on that board.  There is no mandated position for a patient advocate.  One member has patient advocacy listed as one of his or her responsibilities.  There is a bunch of scientists.  One and, perhaps two scientists, is fine but the clinical expertise is not there.</p> <p>  The board has been appointed.  We know what will happen without this clause because a board has been appointed.  Which member or members of the board represent the clinical community, that is, doctors, consultants, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals?</p></speech>

The board is the governing body for the HSE and we should not be too prescriptive in this legislation.  I do not intend to get into the details of individuals and the board members.  Board members do not represent groups.  They are brought to the board because of their skills.</p> <p>  The Seanad amended the Bill to specifically provide for patient advocacy.  There is no requirement on the board to have one individual who will just represent patients.  Other people on the board also have skills in that area.</p></speech>

In his opinion, some of these people are unqualified to be on the board.  The Minister has appointed these people and I am assured by him and the Department that these people have adequate skills to deal with all the issues that will be presented to the board into the future.</p> <p>  Board members do not represent any particular group.  They are individuals with specific skills who have been appointed by the Minister.  They do not have one individual skill.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 6 provides for a nomination from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, which is a broad representative group, while the HSE is the largest employer of the state.  It will be no surprise that I propose this given my background.  Deputy Donnelly's amendment and mine, taken together, are not intended to comment on the board - I do not want to put words in anyone's mouth - but the intention is to ensure the board is the best it can be.  With the greatest respect to the Minister of State, we believe that the more guidance that is inserted in the legislation to assist the Minister, the better the board will be.  The board has an important function and Sinn F&eacute;in sees a clear role for a representative of workers generally, but specifically from within the HSE.  We were clear to ensure that the amendment provides for that person to have sufficient experience and expertise relating to matters connected with the function of the executive to enable him or her to make a substantial contribution.  It is not somebody who would be there keeping a seat warm, but who, in the Minister's view, by virtue of their nomination by ICTU would make a substantial contribution to the board.  We do not seek to point fingers at anyone who might be on the board but to ensure that the Minister, and his successors, have sufficient guidance to ensure that the board is representative.  I will support Deputy Donnelly's amendment for that reason but I also believe that the ICTU, as a broad and representative body, has, and should have, a role in ensuring that workers are represented on the board of the HSE, which is the largest employer in the State.  Too often in this State we have seen the consequence of ignoring workers when they try to bring issues of concern to the fore.</p></speech>

The Minister appreciates that the amendment states that the nominee should have sufficient experience an expertise to allow him or her to make a substantial contribution to the performance of the HSE's functions.  However, in establishing the board, we need to move away from the concept of nominations by a stakeholder group, however well suited to the role the nominee may be.  In the case of the HSE board, the Minister's view is that nominees by individual organisations would not be good practice and would lead to calls from other bodies to make nominees.  I do not, therefore, intend to accept either amendment.</p></speech>

My views on the composition of the board have been on the record for a long time.  This is not criticism of the Minister or any members of the board or my colleagues.  However, I strongly believe that for a board to work, its composition should be drawn from the country at large.</p><p>Individually, they should have the required capacity and direct experience in the delivery of the services at local level.  The problem the HSE has faced for as long as it has been in existence is its inability to connect with the troops on the ground and to connect them to management.  Individual service providers would tell one that.  They feel isolated.  General practitioners, nurses and consultants would say the same.</p><p> Clinicians, as a group, should not have all that much influence.  We need to examine where they are coming from as opposed to who they are and how much influence they exert at board level.  The approach could well be very dangerous.  During my previous incarnation, there used to be long battles between members of the health boards and the consultants, for example, at one level or another.  The question was who dominated whom.  There should be no domination.  There has to be an agreed push forward in the delivery of the health services.  As long as there is friction and competition between the two demands, there will always be unease, controversy and gaps in the system that cannot be bridged.</p><p> It was alleged by clinicians that politicians should be removed completely from anything to do with the delivery of the health services.  That was achieved but it did not create a better system.  As a matter of fact, the reverse is the case.  By the same token, I have long believed we need a regionalised system and a national board &mdash; this board we are talking about now &mdash; drawn from the three or four regions.  Everything else has been tried but this has not.</p><p> My belief, based on what I have seen over more than a few years looking at the attempt to deliver a comprehensive health service that enjoys the confidence of the general public and practitioners within the system, be they doctors, consultants, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists or others, is that we have gone away completely from what is desired and tend to rely on expertise.  This is not a criticism of the amendment before us.  There is a need for expertise and provision has to be made for it but we are missing the crucial point, which concerns the representational value of the individuals on the board, where they are coming from and who they represent.  General practitioners on such a board have to represent their clients, and they should.  They have first-hand experience of this.  If this is not the case, there is second-hand experience.  We see headlines all the time about diminishing numbers of personnel in various areas, including rural areas.  The general practitioners have direct knowledge and experience of delivering to their clients.  My hope and belief is that, within five to seven years, there will be a change.  There will need to be a return to the old system.  I do not believe the system we have now will work, and I do not believe the revised system will work either.  This is my view but it is not a criticism of anybody.  We need a wholly committed health service.  That commitment requires the inclusion of those who are delivering the services on the ground at board level in one form or another.</p></speech>

Let me refer to one of the documents I have been given by the Minister's office.  Potential board appointees come through the Public Appointments Service process.  The competencies sought in respect of board appointments are advertised, which allows candidates to be put forward for appointment based on the skills and experience they bring.  The Minister does not intend to accept these amendments.</p> <p>  I know one board member.  I do not know him personally but through an organisation, Barnardos, with which he worked.  I am not sure whether I can comment on the individual expertise of the board members.  Although they do not represent one particular group, they have expertise in other fields as well.  I am not in a position to accept amendments from either Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-20a.112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2019022000002#G00500"><p>We have made the argument.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State has been asked to step in at the last minute and perhaps did not know she was coming in today, so my remarks are no reflection on her.  She has been asked to come in by the Minister.  However, I believe that, in a discussion on legislation to reinstate the board of the HSE, it is pretty extraordinary that the Minister did not turn up.  This is an important conversation.  The Minister of State does not have the briefing and even if she did she would not be in a position to make any decisions because she is not the line Minister and not a member of Cabinet.  It is extraordinary that the Minister is not here to debate the issues about the reinstatement of the HSE board.  Deputies O'Reilly, Durkan and Murphy O'Mahony and I were talking about whether anyone on the board of the HSE should have a medical background.  That is a pretty important conversation to have.</p> <p>  I have considered the board membership and am open to being wrong but my understanding is that not one member has a medical background.  If that is correct, it is pretty extraordinary.  The Minister should be present to explain why, in his opinion, he is comfortable that no one on the new board of the HSE has a medical background.  That is pretty astonishing.</p> <p>  We have rehearsed all the arguments.  I will be pressing this amendment because I have heard nothing that gives me any confidence that, without these amendments, the HSE will have the requisite experience it needs.  How any Government could try to tell the Parliament that the board of its health system has the correct blend of skills and experience when not one of its members has a medical background is absolutely extraordinary, yet that is what we are hearing today.  I will leave it at that.  I will be pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

As the guy said to someone looking for directions, "If I were going there, I would not start from here."  By the same token, I am just a little worried about one of the points made by Deputy Donnelly.  One member of the board could have a medical background but it could be tilted in the direction of one particular profession, which might not necessarily be of any great advantage to the board at all.</p><p>It could skew the authority of the board in a particular direction.  I would be worried about that.  It would not be truly representative, which would not be good.  One might be as well off to have persons who do not have a particular bias.</p><p> My own strongly held view is that members of the board should represent those who are delivering the services on the ground directly.  That would not necessarily enlarge the board to any great extent.  I spoke about this during the Sl&aacute;intecare hearings and on many occasions.  Nobody agrees with me, the Chairman will be glad to know, and not for the first time.  My view is based on long experience of listening to various boards associated with the health services over the years.  We can never achieve a seamless delivery of health services unless we have such mixed representation from all of the staff - the nurses, the GPs, the consultants and pharmacists - who are involved in delivering the health services.  It achieves the following aim.  It creates an equilibrium within the deliverers of the service that one cannot get otherwise.  Otherwise, one has a "them and us" situation where staff resent what they are being asked to do on the basis that those who are asking them do not have the necessary experience.  It often happens that way.</p><p> I reiterate that my views are not the same as my colleague, Deputy Donnelly, but I hear what he is saying.  If we were delivering a service to some executive, that would be a different story.  We are not; we are delivering a service to the people.  The people's practitioners on the ground need to have some access to that board, be represented on that board or have a representative on the ground from the board to keep the dialogue going in both directions.  I have said it all before.  I do not expect anybody to agree with me and I will not cry all the way home if nobody agrees with me.</p></speech>

We could debate all day how every one of us wants the right people to end up on the board.  We are all as one on that, albeit we may have different views about how the right person will end up on the board.</p><p>Recently, we saw the appointment and reappointment of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  We have had many discussions on that and what constitutes a competency-based board.  When an issue arises with the board and with the HSE, we tend to have to raise that with the Minister, but there is a role for the Oireachtas in hearing from persons who are proposed by the Minister so that Deputies can discuss the approach they would take in their role and help us understand how they intend to approach their role on the board.  We would like to have some involvement in that engagement.  One might say that I would say this, but this is a sensible proposal.  In the interests of transparency I hope that the Minister of State, notwithstanding what was previously indicated, is in a position to accept the amendment.  If she is not able to accept it, perhaps she might recommend that the Minister give it consideration.</p></speech>

There is no requirement in the code of practice for other members to appear.  The amendment proposed places this requirement in legislation on the chairperson and on the other members of the board - the deputy chairperson and ordinary members.  The Minister's view is that it is part of the role of the chair to lead the board and it would not be advisable to bestow the same function on all members.  In addition, the Minister does not believe that matters of this nature need to be provided for in the Bill.  The system for proposed chairpersons to come before committees works well in practice and these provisions are not normally in legislation.  The Minister does not therefore propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

We have already discussed the fact that the Minister of State is not in a position to accept any amendments so I could make the most persuasive argument of my life and it is not going to be accepted by her.  I do not suggest I was about to do that.  I might have been but it does not make any difference because the amendment is not going to be accepted by the Minister of State.  I do not mean this disrespectfully, but it is a pity that the person who could accept the amendments did not see fit to attend this meeting.

The board does not have a role.  However, given that the CEO is appointed by the board and the board will be managing the CEO's performance, the Minister has given this further consideration and proposes that the board should determine terms and conditions for the CEO.  The board will need the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is the process in many other Acts.</p></speech>

I want to see whether the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is still included.  If I understand it correctly, section 21A(3) of the principal Act would read that the CEO shall hold office upon and subject to such terms and conditions as may be determined by the board with the approval of the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Is that right?</p></speech>

It appears that it is.  The Bill states that the CEO shall hold office subject to terms and conditions determined by the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is what it currently states but it is being changed to read that the terms and conditions will be determined by the board as opposed to the Minister for Health.  This is a policy change.  What is the rationale behind it?</p></speech>

In practice, the board would work on appropriate terms and conditions for the CEO, determine the terms and conditions and put these to the Minister for the Minister&rsquo;s approval.  The consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would be needed before approving the terms and conditions.  This arrangement is found in other Acts such as, for example, in the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.</p></speech>

Will it give the board more latitude regarding the terms and conditions than the Minister might have?</p></speech>

It is rather unusual use of the English language.  I have not seen it before.  What does it mean?  Does it mean the prior approval of the Minister?</p><p>Does it mean the prior approval of two Ministers?  Is it Minister or Ministers?  It could be worded as "given the approval of the Minister" but "the approval of the Minister given" is something I have never seen before.  I do not know why it has been drafted in that fashion or in parliamentary draughtsman's language.  Perhaps my education has been greatly neglected along the way.  I just want to know if it means something of which we are not aware.  The phrase is used twice and I do not know what it means.  If necessary, will the Minister of State examine the wording and clarify it on Report Stage?  That would be fine.</p></speech>

It seeks to ensure that the chief executive officer of the HSE should not hold any additional office.  We saw that the previous director general had a role in another company.  Running the HSE is a big job and it should take up all of the time of the post holder.  We should be absolutely sure there is no scope for any conflict of interest or any suggestion of a conflict of interest.  It is not appropriate for the CEO to have another job or to sit on boards.  His or her focus should solely and entirely be on running the HSE.  There should be no division.  This amendment proposes to leave the wording, &quot;The chief executive officer shall not hold any other office employment or carry on any business&quot;, and delete the subsequent words, &quot;without the consent of the Board and the Board shall inform the Minister in writing of any such consent given.&quot;  The previous holder of the position informed the Minister he had an additional role outside the HSE.  I am not suggesting there was anything untoward about that but it is not a good idea.  This latitude was available and given previously.  We need to remove it and ensure the person in charge of the HSE is focused solely and entirely on that job.</p></speech>

The Minister must be informed of any such decision by the board.  The proposed amendment would prevent the CEO from holding any other office, under any circumstances.  This issue arose during debate in the Seanad and the Minister&rsquo;s view was that it was not possible to foresee all circumstances and that there may be situations where holding other offices may be justified.  The legislation as it stands allows for this, while giving the safeguard that the board&rsquo;s consent is needed.  The board will be the decision maker.  If it believes it is not appropriate, the CEO cannot undertake the work in question.  It is not, therefore, proposed to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

I cannot think of any such roles.  I appreciate the Minister of State's response and note the debate in the Seanad in which the Minister said it is not possible to envisage all circumstances and such a scenario might arise.  The person in charge of the HSE should be focused solely on that role and I cannot think of any scenario where that person's membership of another board or employment by another company would be appropriate or beneficial to the running of the HSE.  The Minister may have had in mind a specific scenario that could be beneficial or at least have a neutral effect on or cause no harm to the role of the CEO in running the HSE.  I cannot envisage such a circumstance.  The CEO of the HSE is a big job and incredibly time consuming.  I do not know where he or she would find time for other roles.  It would not be appropriate for him or her to have to find the time to carry on other work or business.</p></speech>

The issue is that it not possible to predict all situations and there may be a valid reason for the CEO to hold some other office.

I have a difficulty with the person who is the head of the health service having other jobs or calls on their time.  My amendment seeks to ensure that the focus is solely and entirely on the role as the chief executive or director general of the HSE.  We saw previously where additional roles were approved by the Minister but that does not make it right.  It means that it happened.</p></speech>

The paragraph relates to the chief executive coming before the Oireachtas, so mainly to this committee, I imagine, and probably the Committee of Public Accounts.  There is a get-out clause, which says that the chief executive officer &quot;shall not be required to give an account before a Committee of any matter relating to the general administration of the Executive which is, or has been, or may at any future time be, the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal in the State&rdquo;.  That provision pretty much gives carte blanche for the chief executive officer to just never appear.  Deputy O'Reilly's amendment is spot on and does not try to delete the paragraph.</p><p>One cannot have a situation where the head of the health service says, &quot;I am not coming in because at some point in the future somebody may take a case over&quot; whatever.  Almost everything that this committee has discussed in the past year could lead to legal cases in the future.  The amendment is very good and I am inclined to support it.  Perhaps the Minister of State has a solid legal reason the provision must be included.  In the absence of a solid argument by the Minister of State, I do not see why one would give that sort of <i>carte blanche</i>to any executive officer.</p></speech>

It gives the chief executive officer of the health system the ability not to appear before any Oireachtas committee to discuss any issue which may at some stage be before the courts.  That rules out pretty much everything in the healthcare system.  I can understand the committee not bringing in a chief executive to discuss a matter before the courts which I think is covered by Standing Order 50 which is specifically about court sittings in which there is a jury and where it might be influenced by a conversation in the Oireachtas.  It is not that the Oireachtas cannot discuss matters that are before the courts; we can and do all the time.  The matter of CervicalCheck is before the courts, but we still discuss it here.  This is an extraordinary level of protection for the chief executive because any matter this committee, or the Committee of Public Accounts, may decide to address can be deemed to be before the courts.  I still do not have an answer to the question as to why such an extraordinary level of protection is being granted.  The Minister of State said it was to protect future court cases, but I do not understand how discussing things here would jeopardise them.  If that rule was applied, it would shut down Parliament.  Maybe the Minister of State might expand on the matter.</p></speech>

The question is a direct one.  Extraordinary protection against parliamentary accountability is being afforded in the paragraph to the chief executive officer of the HSE.  The rationale the Minister of State has given is that it is to avoid jeopardising future court cases.  I do not understand how discussion at this committee will jeopardise future court cases and I am worried that, if we accept that logic, we will have to ask if we are allowed to discuss anything at this committee.</p></speech>

Effectively, we will be neutered and precluded.  Like Deputy Donnelly, I cannot understand how this will work in practice because all the chief executive officer or the director general will have to do, if asked to come before the committee, is respond to the effect that the matter could be the subject of a court case.  He or she would be right in saying so, as anything could be the subject of a court case.  This will give the person in charge a veto.</p> <p>  I have withdrawn my amendment on the basis that I will re-table it, but in the intervening time it would be helpful to have a note on this issue.  We say the Minister of State is giving the director general a veto in deciding if he or she should ever come before the committee, but she is saying she is not doing so.  The reasons this provision does, effectively, amount to a veto were very well outlined, but the Minister of State insists that she is not giving one.  Perhaps she might ask the Minister to outline for us, in some detail, why he believes this will not operate in such a way.  The Minister of State says she will not accept amendments.  While I will do my very best to accept her explanation, she should not be surprised if I do not accept it.  I ask for a note to be provided well in advance of Report Stage with an explanation of how this provision will not act as a veto.  To my mind, it clearly will.</p></speech>

I support Deputy O'Reilly in the matter.

It states the chief executive officer shall cease to be qualified for office and shall cease to hold office if he or she is convicted of any indictable offence.  Could very minor offences such as speeding offences be included in that regard?  Such offences could be committed, but they may not mean that a person should be fired.  I am looking for clarification on what is an indictable offence.  Is it a serious offence or could it refer to something unrelated to the role of being a good chief executive officer?</p></speech>

I am not condoning speeding, but it would be good if the Minister of State could give us a note on what is included as an indictable offence.  Paragraph (4) states such a person shall cease to be qualified for office.  This is black and white.  It is not that an issue could be raised by the board and considered in the round.  Once it happens, the chief executive officer will be gone.</p> <p>  At the start of the section 21A, it states the board shall, as soon as practicable, appoint a person recruited in accordance with the Public Service Management</p> <p>(Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 as CEO.</p><p>Will the Minister of State run through what that means in practice?  Does it mean that the PAS, the top level appointments committee, TLAC, or some other group will come up with a shortlist and the board will choose?  Will the board be offered the chance to say "Yea" or "Nay" to one person?  How will it work? </p></speech>

This section makes amendments to section 40H to take account of the move to a board governance structure, for example, providing that the audit committee is appointed by the board rather than by the director.  The Bill currently provides that audit committee membership is to comprise the board members and no fewer than four external members.  However, the Minister has considered this further and believes that some amendments should be made.</p><p>As the HSE is now to have an independent board, it is important in terms of good corporate governance that board members are now further represented on an audit committee as part of the audit planning and insurance process.</p><p> Amendment No. 25 therefore changes the composition of the audit committee.  The amendment provides that not fewer than three members of the new HSE board will be on the audit committee.  The audit committee will continue to have not fewer than four external members.  In summary, this will mean that moving forward the audit committee will consist of not fewer than three board members and not fewer than four external members, with the relevant skills and experience.</p></speech>

Perhaps I am misunderstanding the amendment, but the essential function of the audit committee is to be independent and external auditors.  Maybe I am wrong, but if that is the case, does it give the board too much say on a body that might be looking at the activities of the board?  Maybe I misunderstand the role of the audit committee, but that is my concern.</p></speech>

This seems peculiar.  One of the core functions of the audit committee is to provide financial advice to the board, including on activities of the board.  If three of the seven members of the audit committee are drawn from the board, is there not a conflict of interest or at least a lack of independent oversight given that it would only require one of the other four members to side with the board members on an issue?  It does not feel sufficiently independent and removed.  Is the Minister of State saying that the audit committees of other State bodies, for example, the National Transport Authority, would also have three members drawn from the board of the body in question?  Is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guideline?</p></speech>

If half the members of the audit committee are on the board of the HSE, the board is advising itself.  The Bill provides that the board may at any time remove a member of the audit committee.

I am confused as to why the Deputy would have a problem with three of the members from the main board sitting on the audit committee because there will not be an imbalance, if that is the point he is trying to make.  My understanding is that four external members and maybe more as well as an independent chairman would outnumber any members who are also on the HSE board.  I am not sure why the Deputy is pursuing this avenue around the board members.  The amendments provide that not fewer than three members of the HSE board will be on the committee.  It could be less.  If there could be more external people on the board, I do not understand the Deputy's point.</p></speech>

The board members are there, but it is a sub-committee of the board which can bring on additional expertise.  Let us say it wants to avail of the services of actuaries or corporate lawyers, that is okay.  We already have a board and the board is talking to the chief executive all the time.  Essentially, the board's job is to hold the chief executive to account and to set the strategy for an organisation.  Those are two of the big issues.  Separate to that, one has an audit committee, which is giving financial advice on the functions of the board.  It is giving governance advice on the structures and it is giving financial advice to the chief executive.  If the objective is for that to be essentially independent of the board, and providing a second pair of eyes, if it is full of board members then that does not happen.  It is essentially the board reporting to itself about its own functions.</p></speech>
