This is important as they cause interference for our broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.</p><p>Today I am delighted we will have engagement on alliance building to strengthen the European Union with Ms Aingeal O'Donoghue, director general of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Mr. Joe Hackett, Deputy Permanent Representative of Ireland to the EU.  I welcome Ambassador Hackett and Ms O'Donoghue here today to discuss alliance building to strengthen the European Union.  </p><p>The joint committee remains convinced of the importance of ensuring that Ireland plays its full role within the EU at all levels, that we continue to develop our understanding of situations and priorities of other member states and build strong coalitions.  We will have a visiting delegation from the Portuguese Parliament later today.  Today's engagement is an important part of our consideration of alliances by looking at the Government's overall strategy and approach and what that looks like on the ground in Brussels.</p><p>I want to remind everyone of the rules on privilege.

If they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular subject and they continue to do so, they are only entitled thereafter to qualified privilege in respect of the evidence they give.  They are directed that only evidence concerned with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against an entity or a person either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I will first ask the Director General, Ms O'Donoghue, to make her opening statement.  She will be followed by the ambassador, Mr. Hackett.  I am sure the committee members and I will have questions and comments for both of them and I again welcome them and their delegation.  I also welcome everyone in the Gallery.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-17a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aingeal O&rsquo;Donoghue" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019041700002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee for the invitation.  The question of alliance building and building to strengthen the European Union is crucial.  I am joined by the ambassador, Mr. Joe Hackett, Ireland's Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU, and by two colleagues from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, namely, Ms Ciara Delaney and Ms Claire Callaghan.</p> <p>  Working closely with a range of EU partners has always been important for Ireland but, as the committee has rightly pointed out, some of the changes occurring this year provide further impetus for this work.  These include the European Parliament elections in May, the appointment of a new Commission and European Council President, national elections in a number of member states, the adoption of a new strategic agenda to guide the work of the Union and, of course, Brexit.  </p> <p>  We are all well aware of the unprecedented challenge that Brexit poses to the European Union as a whole and Ireland in particular.  The solidarity shown by member states has been remarkable, much appreciated and a key strand of our engagement with partners in the period since the Brexit referendum.  As a committed and engaged member of the Union, we also want to share perspectives and develop common approaches on the full range of issues on the EU agenda.  This is not only a matter of pressing Irish priorities on others but also of listening to friends and partners to hear and understand their concerns and perspectives.  </p> <p>  While we have always worked closely with a broad range of member states, the United Kingdom has been an important partner for Ireland on many issues in the European Union.  This is true not just for Ireland but for a range of like-minded countries.  It has been clear to us that the loss of the UK as an EU partner would be significant and we have undertaken a comprehensive review of our alliances and engagements within the European Union with a view to strategically strengthening and diversifying our relationships.  Our approach is multifaceted but it is important to stress that it takes place against a backdrop in which we are intensifying engagement with all member states.  As for our priorities and focus, the Nordic-Baltic countries, together with the Netherlands, are a key group with which we share a common approach in areas such as EU trade policy, the Single Market, the further development of the eurozone and the ambition of the digital Single Market.</p> <p>  Another key strand is deepening our relationships with larger member states and the European institutions in order to explain Ireland&rsquo;s policy positions across key policy areas including sensitive areas such as further developing the economic and monetary union, EMU, taxation, defence and migration.  Strengthening contacts with key eastern European member states is also important, particularly with the eastwards shift of the EU centre of gravity.  The final strand of our engagement is deeper work with a range of member states on an issue-by-issue basis, whether as part of a group or bilaterally.  </p> <p>  Ireland works hard to influence the policy and legislative agenda of the EU, to safeguard our interests and to make a positive contribution towards the future direction of the Union.  Let us be in no doubt but that this is challenging and requires sustained effort.  We do it through effective engagement with the EU institutions, increased capitals-to-capitals engagement at both political and official level, through our permanent representation in Brussels, which has officials from across all Departments, and through mobilising our network of embassies in every capital across the European Union.  These efforts are supported by colleagues working across Government at home and underpinned by deep political engagement, including a sustained increase in the range and intensity of political and official level visits.  </p> <p>  Excluding the UK for a moment, in 2018, for example, there were over 50 outward visits to the EU member states involving the President, the Taoiseach, the Ceann Comhairle, Government Ministers or Ministers of State and approximately 30 high-level political visits inwards to Ireland.  A key element of those outward programmes often involves engagement with parliamentary committees such as this one.  Last month, Ministers visited all 27 EU capitals as part of the Government&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day programme.  Such visits not only offer the opportunity to celebrate our national culture and our diaspora, but also to build and deepen relationships at a political level and to raise broader awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s priorities through engagement with local media, parliamentary committees and think tanks.  </p> <p>  The 50 outward engagements I mentioned did not include attendance at EU Council meetings where Ministers also regularly meet their colleagues in the various sectoral formations, whether that is agriculture, trade, competitiveness or foreign affairs.  As the T&aacute;naiste has said, taking part in the formal discussions and decisions is essential but these meetings are also an opportunity to build strong relationships with new and established colleagues, both individually and as part of wider groups.  Before the March European Council, for example, the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Rutte of the Netherlands participated in a Nordic-Baltic group meeting.  The Minister for Finance now meets regularly with his Nordic, Baltic and Dutch colleagues before each ECOFIN Council and the T&aacute;naiste has hosted the same grouping of Ministers in advance of the Foreign Affairs Council.  </p> <p>  The more Ireland engages with other member states on the key European issues, the more we will enhance our capacity to shape and influence the future.  We therefore actively participate with a range of partners through a number of like-minded groups linked to particular issues.  Mr. Hackett will speak more about this during his presentation.  </p> <p>  Ireland is already, by some way, the smallest country with an embassy in every other member state.  This has been an invaluable asset in fostering support for our concerns in the Brexit negotiations and in advancing our interests on key issues on the EU agenda.  Since the referendum in the UK, we have added senior officials to our embassy teams in the permanent representation in Berlin, Paris and London.  This year we are increasing our diplomatic representation in Madrid, Warsaw and Rome and reinforcing a number of other embassies, notably our single diplomat missions.  </p> <p>  Last year, the T&aacute;naiste published a comprehensive review of Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with Germany.  It included 23 recommendations for widening and deepening our footprint in Germany.  We are working on implementing these, including the opening of a new consulate in Frankfurt later this year.  The T&aacute;naiste has similarly requested a review of our relations with France with which we already share vibrant links and we are also doing a piece of work on our relationship with the Nordic countries.  </p> <p>  Building our relations with the European institutions to ensure that Irish positions are understood and taken into account is critical.  As the committee is aware, the Taoiseach was the first speaker in the European Parliament&rsquo;s series of debates with Heads of State or Government on the future of Europe.  In a multilingual address, he set out Ireland&rsquo;s positive vision for the future of the European Union.  Engagement with the European Commission takes place at every level.  Ministers engage with Commissioners and officials, from either the representation or the full range of Departments, meet their counterparts in different EU Directorates General.</p> <p>  We have also developed a programme of ministerial engagement at plenary sessions of the Parliament.  Irish officials, working at all levels within the EU's institutions, have also made invaluable contributions and are an important link between the institutions and Ireland.  However, in recent years, the number of Irish staff working in the institutions has been declining, largely due to retirements.  The Government has made it a priority to address this demographic cliff including through the EU jobs campaign.  Over the past month, for example, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, addressed students in Trinity College Dublin, the National University of Ireland, Galway, Maynooth University and University College Dublin to encourage them to consider a career in the EU which would help to put us at the forefront of shaping developments that affect the daily lives of citizens across the Union.</p><p>Our high-level objectives are to increase the number of Irish candidates applying for and being successful in these competitions.  We work across Government to ensure that a range of officials are seconded into EU institutions from Departments.</p><p> Deepening our alliances to further strengthen the European Union is exciting work but it is also challenging for a small member state such as Ireland.  It requires a whole-of-Government approach with all Ministers and officials across Departments actively engaging with their counterparts around Europe.  The Oireachtas too has a crucial part to play in building this network.  I compliment the Chairman and this committee on their openness in engaging with ambassadors from all the EU member states based in Dublin, and for hosting meetings with visiting parliamentary committees.  This is a critical part of how we build these alliances.  Visits and meetings by the Ceann Comhairle, by the interparliamentary friendship groups and, in particular, by this committee, all play a role in deepening and strengthening our engagement with other member states.  I would be interested in hearing the committee's reflections on how this can be developed further.  I thank the Chairman for the time.  I will hand over to Mr. Hackett to share his Brussels perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-17a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Hackett" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019041700002#C00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet it.  It is an honour and a privilege for me to have this opportunity.  I thank members for their strong interest in exploring Ireland's alliance building within the EU, especially in a post-Brexit context.  Ms O&rsquo;Donoghue outlined the Government&rsquo;s strategic approach and the strong leadership provided in this area by the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Ministers.  I echo that and her remarks on the positive role played by the Oireachtas and this committee in deepening our engagement across the Union.  I hope to complement her presentation with some practical perspectives from my role in Brussels.</p> <p>  I have a straightforward message.  Ireland's success in Europe will depend on remaining highly connected and engaged both in Brussels and across each of the other 26 remaining member states.  In my role as permanent representative at the committee of the permanent representatives of the member states to the European Union, the COREPER 1 committee, my team and I cover a wide range of sectoral issues, including the Single Market and competitiveness, transport, climate, agriculture, fisheries, energy, social and employment, the digital economy, research, health, education, culture and sport.  Coherence and effectiveness abroad depends on coherence and joined-up thinking at home.  It is a particular privilege for me to have the opportunity to work with colleagues from every Department, whether they are based at the permanent representation in Brussels or at home.</p> <p>  There is considerable legislative activity on the COREPER 1 side and, crucially, almost all legislation that comes to the committee is prepared for the Council of Ministers and agreed through qualified majority voting, QMV.  As members know, decisions taken under QMV require the support of at least 55% of the member states, representing 65% of the EU's population and a blocking minority requires more than 35% of the population and at least four member states.  Given these maths, Ireland cannot achieve good outcomes in the legislative process without a sustained proactive approach to building both strategic and tactical alliances as files progress.  We are not unique in this.  Alliance-building is an essential requirement for all member states operating within the EU, especially when operating under QMV.  Even well-established geographic alliances such as the Benelux, Visegrad and Nordic-Baltic, can be fluid and often evolve and shift as a particular legislative file progresses.  These groups provide important political coherence for their members but the component member states are not obliged to share the same position on legislation and regularly take different positions on different files.</p> <p>  As Ms O&rsquo;Donoghue has stated, Ireland has consistently engaged in a wide range of issue-based alliances.  I believe that this practice has served us well and we are usually satisfied with the outcomes and reassurances achieved in negotiations.  We have voted against legislative proposals at final stage on only two occasions since January 2017.  However, while it may be relatively rare for most member states to oppose a file at final stage, QMV considerations are always to the forefront of the tactics of the rotating EU Presidency, the Commission and member states.  They are always in the background when we are making calculations about how likely it is that amendments will be accepted.  Small member states are under constant pressure to demonstrate that they have broad support for their particular concerns.  A Presidency is most unlikely to take on board an Irish amendment or proposal unless we secure good backing in the room and, ideally, little opposition.  Building and maintaining the support of as many member states as possible is an ongoing core activity for myself and the attach&eacute;s based at the permanent representation.</p> <p>  There are a number of recent examples which demonstrate the advantage and necessity of issue-based alliances.  Ireland has been a leader within a group of like-minded states which support the deepening and strengthening of the Single Market and digital Single Market.  There is a strong crossover in both like-minded groups with the Nordic and Baltic states, ourselves the Netherlands and Czech Republic.  In 2018, Ireland, along with Finland, the Czech Republic and Denmark, focused attention on the remaining obstacles to completing the Single Market in services through the Copenhagen Economics study, which was commissioned by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and launched by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, in Brussels.  This core group of member states was successfully expanded in advance of the March European Council when 17 Heads of State and Government, including the Taoiseach, agreed a joint position on current priorities in this area.</p> <p>  On the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, ECOFIN, side, our main focus has been on the "Nordic-Baltic plus", colloquially known as the new Hanseatic League.  This group was established in 2017 and has been meeting almost monthly at finance minister level.  The countries include Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ireland and the Netherlands.  From time to time, finance ministers from Germany, France, the Czech Republic or Slovakia have attended and engaged in discussion at ministerial level meetings.  The core group has published joint position papers on the future of economic and monetary union, the capital markets union, and strengthening the role of the European Stability Mechanism.  As Ms O'Donoghue mentioned. the Nordic-Baltic-Ireland-Netherlands formation has also met twice at Heads of State and Government level.</p> <p>  During the divisive negotiations in the last couple of years on the reform of mobility, posted worker and haulage sector rules, Ireland was aligned with a number of central and eastern member states, including Hungary, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Slovakia, as well as those member states that faced similar challenges to us on the geographic periphery, such as Finland and Portugal.  On the key climate files on carbon dioxide emissions from cars, vans and heavy duty vehicles, Ireland formed an alliance in 2018 with a number of ambitious member states and those, like us, who are technology takers in this important area, such as Luxembourg, Denmark and the Netherlands.</p> <p>  As this committee would be very aware, with regard to agriculture and the ongoing negotiations on the reform of the CAP, we have worked closely with France and those seeking to ensure a fully funded Common Agricultural Policy, such as Portugal, Spain, Greece and Finland.  There are many other examples that could be provided, but these help to indicate the considerable number of issue-based alliances where we are active and need to be active, as well as the wide range of member states involved.  We have co-operated with every member state over the last period.</p> <p>  The UK has been an important partner in Brussels for us on many issues.  Its departure will deprive Ireland and several like-minded groups, including some that I have mentioned, of considerable political and voting strength.  This will be particularly true on Single Market and digital economy matters.  The numbers make this clear.  At present, Ireland's percentage of the EU population for QMV purposes is 0.95%.  This will increase to 1.08% after the UK leaves.  The total population of the Baltics, Nordics, Ireland and the Netherlands for voting purposes will amount to 11.06%.  This is far short of the number required for even a blocking minority.  By comparison, France and Germany will see their combined voting strength rise to 33.54% from 29.22%.</p><p>This change matters because the Presidency, the Commission and the member states are heavily influenced by the likely voting strengths as files evolve.  Becoming strongly linked with a grouping like the Nordic or Baltic states is important in building our political influence.  However, given the numbers, this must be augmented by a deep level of engagement with all other member states, particularly the larger member states.  Ms O&rsquo;Donoghue has outlined the steps we are already taking to do so.</p><p> Several conclusions can be drawn from this experience.  First, I refer to the need to regard engagement as a shared responsibility and opportunity.  While the Government has primary responsibility for managing relations with other member states and the EU institutions, the challenge of expanding our connections and level of engagement across Europe should be viewed as a collective one.  The Oireachtas, civil society, our business and farming communities and youth, education and cultural sectors all have a vital role to play in a national effort to deepen Irish engagement both in Brussels and across the member states.  This includes understanding the issues that are important to each member state, the local political factors at play and the nature of member states' relations with non-EU or third countries.  The support we have received from all member states during the Brexit process is a graphic demonstration of the benefits of such sustained engagement.</p><p> Second, we can change domestic perceptions about our influence in Brussels.  In the past, perhaps due to our size and geographic location, the EU was often regarded as a phenomenon that happened to us rather that an organisation that we could actively lead and shape.  However, we bring a pragmatic problem-solving approach to issues that is very much recognised and appreciated by other member states.  The Taoiseach outlined an ambitious vision for our role in Europe during his address to the European Parliament.  We can and do act as a bridge across some of the ideological and geographic fault lines.  Embracing this role will help increase our influence and effectiveness in the post-Brexit European Union. The new strategic agenda and incoming Commission and European Parliament present an ideal opportunity to do so.</p><p> Third, we can be clear on our EU legislative priorities and take a lead role in establishing like-minded groups on these files.  Given the reality of qualified majority voting, QMV, after Brexit, we must continue our efforts to build support with the larger member states and with the key players in the European Parliament on these priorities.</p><p> Fourth, Ms Catherine Day recently advised the committee that our engagement with the Commission, the European Parliament and other EU institutions should be strengthened.  This is undoubtedly true.  They should not be places we only visit when we have a problem.  Instead there must be ongoing engagement to shape and influence policies and legislative proposals before they are published.  The programme of ministerial visits to the European Parliament has been an important additional element in this regard.  I stress that early anticipation is vital.  Again, this is not a task to be left to Government alone.</p><p> I thank the committee and look forward to its members' views and questions.</p></speech>

There are statements on the European Council in the D&aacute;il Chamber at 3.45 p.m. and I may have to attend.  I mean no disrespect by this.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for the work they are doing.  Our diplomats serve us well.  Ireland punches above its weight as a nation state.  We should not take anything for granted and we need to work on all the issues that have been outlined.  The UK leaving the EU is a big setback for the EU and for Ireland in particular.  We have lost an ally on several issues.  That is the challenge we face.  We want to be at the heart of Europe and this is the work we must now undertake.</p> <p>  I will ask two questions which I hope are not too political for the witnesses.  They can answer them in an academic way if they wish.  I see two major fault lines in the European Union.  The first of these is the threat to liberal democratic values, especially in Hungary and Poland.  Is that a big threat to the European Union?  Will it be a fault line, with member states taking sides?  That is linked to the issue of migration and the rise of populism.  There is some apprehension about how that might manifest itself in the forthcoming European Parliament elections.</p> <p>  Second, there are reports that the French President, Emmanuel Macron, was especially difficult at a meeting called to discuss an extension to Brexit at the recent European Council.  He was not in favour of a long extension and he held out on that issue.  He has put forward his vision for the European Union, and it is welcome that somebody is putting forward their vision as we formally discuss the future of Europe.  He is calling for greater integration, a eurozone budget, closer defence co-operation, tax harmonisation and so forth.  Some of these issues would pose challenges for Ireland.  Will there be a major fault line between the nation states that want much closer integration, particularly in tax harmonisation, defence and so on, and those that do not?  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on both of those potential problems.</p></speech>

I compliment them on their success in recent years, especially regarding Brexit and the degree to which they have deployed themselves throughout all the member states of the European Union.  They have successfully managed to transmit a message of the importance of Brexit, the threat it presents to us and the threat it presents to the European Union.  They have done a tremendous job and we owe each and every member of our diplomatic service a debt of gratitude.  They deserve to take a bow.</p> <p>  Brexit presents a huge challenge but it also presents opportunities.  I am aware that our diplomatic service is availing of every opportunity to identify and establish the grounds on which we as a smaller nation can continue to prosper in the European Union, not alone but alongside similar and like-minded countries.  This is a new phenomenon.  We always recognised that within the European Union each of the member states had the opportunity to align themselves with others, not for destructive purposes but for the purposes of promoting the EU project and maximising the benefit for each of the member states.  That continues.  It is a good thing.  Our diplomatic service has done exceptional work in that area and it is to be congratulated.</p> <p>  The question of tax harmonisation raises its ugly head fairly regularly.  We need to set out a couple of parameters in respect of that.  The suggestion that we have somehow achieved a preferential position within the European Union, to the exclusion of all others, is incorrect and should be rebutted at every possible opportunity.  Of course there will be people who will seek to promote the suggestion that this is so.  The fact of the matter is that our 12.5% tax on corporation profits applies to every cent earned in this jurisdiction.  There is a serious difficulty if it is expected that we should become tax collectors for other countries within or outside of the European Union.  I would like to hear the opinions of experts in that area.  I cannot see other European or non-European countries wishing to become tax collectors in respect of profits earned in each other's territory, nor should that be the case.</p><p>We have enough obstacles to circumnavigate at present without taking issues upon ourselves that have a possible destructive element.</p><p> There is something else we need to learn.  We are not at the centre of the European wheel, as it were, at the moment, and because we are not at the centre, the emerging situation presents us with a number of challenges, and possibly a number of opportunities, although that remains to be seen.  The fact of the matter is that, on the mainland of Europe, it is possible to drive around the Continent.  It is possible to deliver goods around the Continent of Europe, and to receive goods from all four corners of the EU.  It is possible to trade within the Single Market without ever having to get out of a truck or aircraft.  It is possible to travel around, and that is a huge benefit in terms of exporting countries.  It is a great benefit to those of us within the EU who depend on trade with our neighbours and other non-EU countries.  I hope that is going to be borne in mind in the course of any discussions that take place.  I have no difficulty in having discussions about potential levelling of the playing field where that is required.  However, it should not be done on the basis of false information, nor should it be done on the basis that we have in some way been negligent in the past in enforcing the rules insofar as they apply.  We have already dealt with the double Irish issue and the various other issues that have arisen in recent years.  We have also had to deal with a very serious economic challenge following the economic crash, and we did so with the help of our colleagues within the EU, but with no thanks at all to those who would seek to exploit the situation for their various benefits.  We should keep that in mind in the future.</p><p> We are part of the Single Market, and that Single Market should apply in Dublin, Kildare, Cork, Kerry, Donegal, Monaghan and every part of this country, the same as it applies right at the centre of Europe.  The concept of that is accepted.  However, it may not be as commonly known that in the area of medicines in this country, for instance, we have never really got the benefit of the Single Market because we seem to pay a premium.  Why that should be, I do not know, but the fact is we are still within the EU and the Single Market.  We distribute goods to this country, and while that does not come free, we are entitled to the same price benefits as other European countries, large and small, throughout the EU, in respect of all of the goods and services we receive, and all the goods and services we deliver.  Despite what some people might think, this is not all one-way traffic.  We sell and trade well above and beyond our size and weight compared with most other countries.  We are the UK's fifth-largest trader, trading to a greater extent with the UK than it trades with India and China combined.  We have shown in the past that we are at the head of the posse when it comes to taking risks and taking on challenges, and while there are suggestions in some quarters that we are recalcitrant in some way, we are not.</p><p> There are many challenges in the modern Europe, some of them discordant, and there are some who seek to exploit the benefits of swings to the hard right or hard left.  The history of Europe should remind us, and we can revisit that at any time because it is readily available, that the cost is huge.  Those who suggest these things will never happen again are wrong.  They have happened before, more than once or twice, and in fact many times.  That they have happened repeatedly shows the inability of current generations to recognise the mistakes made by previous generations and, more particularly, to recognise the cost to their own nation and people.</p><p> There is an issue that we need to look at carefully in modern Europe.  The Balkan wars happened in the past 20 years, when we saw thousands of people fleeing from whatever it was they were fleeing from.  It was not from wealth, health or happiness they fled.  Thankfully, nobody put up barriers to stop them or impede them.  Nobody suggested they should stay at home.  Nobody built walls, and God knows we have had enough experience in Europe with wall-building.  Nobody put up razor wire to impede them.  The reason was that we understood they had a reason for going the way they went.  It is no good challenging people and saying to them that they are a threat to us.  Everybody is a threat to everybody if that is the case.  It is important, however, that we recognise that there is more to be gained from cohesiveness and a united approach.  While I am not suggesting for a moment that we should have an open door in respect of immigration, we do have responsibilities.  The civilised world has responsibilities, and if the civilised world does not accept and recognise those responsibilities, then civilisation will pay a high cost.</p><p> I am sorry for going on so long.  This is my favourite subject, I am afraid to say.  I thank our guests once again and wish them well in the work they have undertaken and still have to undertake.  I compliment those who are engaged in supporting that work, and our colleagues throughout the EU, the 27 member states, who have stood solidly together with us in the course of the past two years when it was not always popular to do so.</p></speech>

The joint committee's last engagement was with Ms Catherine Day, who spoke very well on the issue of Ireland's alliance building and who gave the joint committee a lot of food for thought.  She suggested that Ireland needs to do more to understand the positions of other member states and to offer more support to them on issues that are not necessarily important to us.  Are there policy issues with which either Ireland or the Oireachtas have not traditionally engaged or on which we should do more?</p> <p>  The joint committee is interested in how alliances can be built, not just at ministerial and governmental level but also at a parliamentary and civic society level.  The Houses have been active in this area.  Are there areas where additional parliamentary input could be beneficial?</p> <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has also prioritised trade and business links in its Global Ireland strategy, proposing expansion of our agencies abroad such as Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, and Bord Bia, all of which do great work.  Are there any other existing networks we can utilise to build bilateral relations?</p> <p>  When in Brussels or travelling with Ministers, are there things about Ireland that the witnesses feel are not always understood and that we should try to explain better?  Should we be showcasing or selling ourselves and highlighting all the positive attributes of Ireland and our society, such as our business acumen, our exports, and the intelligent young workforce that we have to offer?  In my humble opinion, we are way better than anybody else around the rest of the world or the rest of Europe, but in selling that and selling all the positive aspects of Ireland, are we doing enough?  Do the witnesses find in their roles that there are ways we fall down?  The only way we can get better is by raising the bar at all times and trying to push ourselves further, be that as parliamentarians or at ministerial or governmental level.  While we can have all the political debates we want here, I am of the belief, and people of all political parties and none would know this about me, that while all of the Brexit negotiations are ongoing, every single person in the Houses of the Oireachtas should be working together.  It is not that we all have to be blindly supportive of what the Government is saying on the issue, but I really believe it is not a time for us to be critical of ourselves or of the work that is being done.  It is a time to row in and say that we are all in this together, that we are all working to achieve the best deal we can for Ireland, and to ensure that the peace process, our trade, and our international reputation will come out of this as best they can.</p><p>Politically, as serious and sensible politicians, we have to row in.  I have always complimented the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and all of the officials involved, and I will continue to do so.  We must remember that in many cases the politicians are at the forefront and they are the people who are seen on the nine o'clock news and on the world stage, but there is excellent work being done by permanent representatives in the different Departments who are trying to get us prepared for whatever eventuality we have to face.</p><p> Looking at us in a critically positive way, are there things the witnesses believe we should be doing that we are not doing?  If there are, I would like to hear about them, and I am sure my colleagues would also like to hear them.  I will hand the floor back to representatives and they can treat this response in whatever casual way they prefer, by answering informally or in whatever way suits them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-17a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aingeal O&rsquo;Donoghue" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019041700002#F00200"><p>I thank the Chairman.  Between us we will address the various points that were made.  I will certainly be delighted to pass on the committee's positive words about the work of the diplomatic service, especially on Brexit but not just on Brexit.  It genuinely is a huge whole-of-Government effort and across all parties.  I will certainly pass on those words.  As one of the officials involved in the Brexit omnibus Bill, I again express our appreciation for the huge cross-party effort by the Oireachtas to get that Bill through in a very short time.  As the T&aacute;naiste has said, it is to be hoped it can continue to sit on the shelf.<br/><br/>I will turn first to the questions.  I put it to Deputy Haughey that they were a little political but I will try to respond.  Deputies Haughey and Durkan spoke on the rise of populism in the form of the hard right and the hard left.  The T&aacute;naiste has spoken about this issue, so I will very much draw from him.  Obviously it is a concern for all member states to different degrees.  We see it in all member states.  We should not be too pessimistic, however, because there are also some positive trends.  I was struck by the recent election of the first woman President in Slovakia from a very strong, open and liberal agenda.  It moves in those directions, but because the EU is often a target for some of this populism, part of what we have to do at EU level is to be very close to our citizens in terms of explaining what the EU is and what it does and delivers.  The citizens' dialogue led by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, last year was very important in this regard, but so too is the Oireachtas and this committee in particular.  Voices articulating clearly what it is the EU can and does achieve are very important in this.  The EU is complicated, and one of the challenges around populism is this tack to very simple messages.  It is harder to talk about the complicated things but we need to do that.  We need to give strong support to the EU in that sense, and all voices need to be around that.  It is important for us.  Some of the issues arise from mistaken or misunderstood perceptions.  Some have validity, for example, around the differing impacts of globalisation on different parts of the community and on different economic sectors, and these need to be addressed at EU and national levels.<br/><br/>Deputy Haughey referred to particular countries, namely, Hungary and Poland.  The Deputy will be aware that they are involved in what we call the Article 7 procedure, which is a rule of law procedure at EU level with Commission and Parliament-led views on issues relating to the rule of law in both of those countries.  There have been extensive discussions at the General Affairs Council on those issues, in which the Department and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, have participated actively, stressing very much the importance of the rule of law and the centre it gives us in managing our affairs domestically and at EU level.  That process will continue.  There are also efforts around finding other pathways to address the issue.  For example, the Belgian and German governments have proposed a different and more informal peer review process.  The important thing is to continue to engage, which we are doing, including formally at the General Affairs Council.<br/><br/>Reference was made to the tensions around more or less integration.  The pace at which it moves and how we move forward together has always been part of what the EU is about.  It is always critically important that the direction of travel be a shared one.  President Macron was mentioned, and from our perspective some of his vision would go further than we would currently be.  In our case, it comes back to the ambassador, Mr. Hackett's comments that we are a pragmatic member state.  Where it makes sense to work together at EU level, we will want to do that, while protecting certain core national interests and national responsibility such as taxation, as mentioned by Deputy Durkan.<br/><br/>The Chairman had some very clear questions, some of which we may need to go away to think about a bit more.  Catherine Day's point about not just engaging on our issues but to do so more broadly is very important.  It goes back to Mr. Hackett's comment on not going to the Commission just when Ireland has a problem and to be part of the positive agendas.  Ireland does quite a bit of this already in areas such as the Single Market and the digital Single Market, where we very much take part in the creation of the positive agenda.  It is the case that this is not just about finding like-minded groups and working with them.  This is also about deepening our understanding of the perspectives of other member states.  This is why the issue-based work that goes on in Brussels is very important with regard to the legislative proposals.  From accompanying the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, on visits around Europe, we can see that the engagement in another country by a Minister gives us a depth of understanding that, as a country, we might not otherwise get.  It is very important.  We are also trying to do that at official level with a lot more EU dialogue with key countries.<br/><br/>With regard to what the Oireachtas and Parliament might do, I am sure the committee members have far better insights on that than I do.  Clearly, however, the parliamentary strand is very important because it brings us beyond Government into the range of political opinion in any given country, which is very important, and it ties back into the first point.  Parliamentary visits, both outward and inward, are very important around key agendas, especially when one considers that some of the Parliaments have very strong roles <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>EU issues.  They are also important in terms of our strategic interests and the priorities we have outlined, for example, with some of the Nordic and Baltic countries.  To map a parliamentary engagement complementary to a government-to-government engagement is very valuable.  I can pass over the Mr. Hackett if there is anything else.</p></speech>

I have some queries and I apologise in advance if colleagues have touched on these.</p><p>My first question is for the director general, Ms O'Donoghue, and relates to the interparliamentary aspect of building new alliances.  Can we do more?  Before the abolition of the dual mandate, and even further back before the introduction of direct elections to the European Parliament, one of the EU's great strengths was that domestic parliamentarians were engaging with other domestic parliamentarians on a European level about European issues.  The main outlet for this debate currently is though the regular <font color="#2F2F2F">Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC,</font>meetings that some of us attend and the COSAC chairpersons' meeting.  Is there a way to increase that engagement across the sectoral basis so that it is not just a biannual COSAC meeting and it reflects, for example, agricultural issues prior to the Agriculture Council meetings to nail it down?  I appreciate that this would require a level of commitment and investment from member state national parliaments.</p><p>MEPs are great but they have a distinct role in the European Parliament and, to some extent, they leave their domestic constituencies behind.  Member state parliamentarians engaging with others on issues at a European level would increase awareness of the debate and the importance of that debate at a domestic level.<br/><br/>I did not disagree with anything that was said on the EU jobs aspect but I want to pick up on two issues, one of which I raised with Catherine Day at our last meeting but to which she was not too receptive.  We have our derogation for Irish and that is being rolled out to an extent but when the UK leaves the EU, Ireland and Malta will be the only English speaking countries, although neither of us uses English as our first language at EU level.  We accept that English has been the working language of the EU since 2004 but how can we ensure that English is given that level of importance and how can Ireland maximise that?<br/><br/>The EU jobs campaign in third level institutions here, the work of the Council of Europe and the work the Kings Inns does with lawyer-linguists is brilliant.  Mr. Hackett might have a more contemporary view on this but there is a population of Irish people in Brussels working in the private sector, trade associations, not-for-profit organisations or in political roles who are turning down work in the Commission or the other institutions because they are intimidated by the application procedure, not because of money, circumstances or interest in the work.  How can we identify and work with people who have committed to life in Brussels, Luxembourg, Strasbourg or wherever it may be and say to them that now that they have been working half a dozen years for, say, a trade association in the private sector it would be much more rewarding on many levels for them to be in the Commission, the Council, the Parliament or the secretariat?  How do we target that audience?  I stand corrected but I believe many people are in that space.  When I went over to do my <i>stagiaire</i>very few of the people who stayed on are in the Commission, the Council or the parliament.  They are in non-institutional roles but they are still in Brussels.  They may have married people from other member states and have committed to spending their lives there but how do we get them to buy in?<br/><br/>I refer to the role of a permanent representative in particular.  It was a great shame that, post Presidency in 2013, we de-scaled to an extent the permanent representation.  I hope we learned the lesson that we should not do that again and that we should maintain not just the size of but the commitment to the permanent representation post Brexit regardless of what happens.  We have seen the benefit of having a very strong presence in Brussels from the institutional focus.  <br/><br/>Mr. Hackett went through the presentation in so much detail I put a strike through many of the questions I had intended to ask.  I refer to many of the policy areas that are vitally important when we talk about new alliances but one area in particular brings that together, that is, the overall approach to the budget and the MFF.  I am concerned that due to ongoing delays with the Brexit negotiations and everything else we are behind the curve when it comes to the MFF negotiations, we are coming at it late and we are leaving too short a period for the negotiation, be it at parliamentary level, in the European Parliament, or at Commission or Council level.  I fear we may be trying to pass a European budget in such a truncated time that easy and quick decisions will be made.  How do we work with allies to make sure that we do not simply get tired at the end and that a process that we might have given 18 months to but, due to circumstances, we will only be able to give 12 months to will still be as thorough and as detailed in the atmosphere of competing interests and certain member states wanting to cut the budget and move from investment to the CAP perhaps to further security and defence?  How can we ensure our alliances protect that?<br/><br/>Moving from the wider EU perspective but staying with the European context, I am delighted about the further opening of a consulate in Frankfurt but we need to go beyond Frankfurt and look at a second French city, be it Lyon or Nice or Marseille, in the south.  We should be looking also at Barcelona in Spain and Milan in Italy, among others.  We should be looking at the commercial centres as well as the administrative centres.  That is where there is an opportunity.  It is difficult at times for politicians to justify spending on diplomacy and on our reach abroad.  Much great work has been shown in terms of the value of having a strong diplomatic corps, particularly in the past two or three years, but we should ask about the return on investment.  We are investing in consuls and in Ireland houses.  We are bringing in Enterprise Ireland and the other State agencies, including Bord Bia and IDA Ireland.  These are not just serving the Irish population abroad or handling intergovernmental queries.  They are bringing serious investment to Ireland and to Irish people.  When we look at the commercial centres around Europe, that is as important as everything else.<br/><br/>That brings me to my final point regarding the United Kingdom.  I very much welcome the reopening of the consulate in Cardiff but in terms of the aim to open another consulate in the UK, is it easy to identify that that should be in the northern powerhouse region of Manchester or, moving away from the economic aspect, is there a diaspora consular approach to the midlands, be it Birmingham or Coventry?  I would appreciate Mr. Hackett's opinions on that.</p></speech>

I am involved in legislation before the Seanad so I will not take up much of Mr. Hackett's time but I wanted to take the opportunity while he was here to thank him for his service and for what he has done for this country in Brussels and abroad.  The volume of work put in by our people on the ground throughout Europe and the effort that has been made to keep Ireland&rsquo;s needs out in front has not gone unnoticed.  It is amazing how a small little country like ours can have such an impact.  The staff working at all levels need to be assured of our gratitude for the work that is being done.</p> <p>  I have a brief question and I will not be present to hear the answer but I will follow up on it.  As we lose the UK, alliances will become important but they will be mixed.  In the agriculture sector, for example, we might look towards France.  In the financial services sector, we might look towards Germany.  Have we assessed each member state to see where the strengths or the commonality exist?  Have we got a checkerboard, so to speak, now whereby if an issues comes up we can say we need to talk to A, B, C, D and E on that particular issue and move across the alliances as we need them?  I am sure the work is being done but I would like to hear Mr. Hackett's perspective on it.  Sadly, I will have to read the reply.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance and please forgive the way we bob in and out of the meeting.  I know it was discussed in the media recently that people pop in, ask a question and leave but the nature of the job requires us to do that.</p></speech>

They can proceed now at a casual pace with the rest of the Bill.</p> <p>  I welcome the director general, Ms O'Donoghue, and her colleague, Ambassador Joe Hackett.  I welcome also the Portuguese delegation to the committee and all the representatives of embassies in Dublin.  It is a great turnout for our meeting because there is great solidarity among all of us in regard to the work in Europe.</p> <p>  I share the compliments expressed about the work of our permanent representatives in Brussels.  Some time ago, I was the designated Minister in respect of the Single European Act.  I would get an enormous brief on a Sunday night and we would deal with every issue at the time.  I had a great ally in John Redwood, who I believe has defected to the Brexiteers, and we worked very closely together.  It is very important that the UK knows we are not happy that they are leaving the EU.  We have no choice in the matter.  It is a matter for them but at least they know we are friends and we will continue that friendship in Brussels where the UK will have a permanent presence.</p><p>I very much welcome the expansion plans of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade up to 2025.  I am delighted that it is called the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  When I was Minister of State with responsibility for trade, there was a lack of appreciation, particularly among some longer serving ambassadors, that trade issues were part of their portfolio.  They felt that they were answerable to the President and that there role was mainly diplomatic but trade is essential.  I am very much in favour of the expansion plans.  While sometimes costs can be prohibitive, at other times they can be quite keen.  When we have ambassadors located in a country, we then have the ear of the government and of Ministers.  We have access to trade ministers and to businesses.  When an ambassador invites people to the embassy or residence, there is always a tremendous response and respect for such an invitation.  The State agencies, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia, are also important.  Embassies are a gateway.  It is lovely to be invited to an embassy.  Indeed, I am looking forward to going to the Portuguese embassy this evening.  One respects such an invitation and that has always been my experience.  I have been in Japan, the Islamic Republic of Iran and elsewhere and had the same experience in every country I worked with as Minister of State.</p><p> In terms of alliances, I am anxious that we promote the expansion of Europe rather than its contraction.  I prepared a report for the Council of Europe on Montenegro, which is available online.  In that report, I recommended that negotiations on membership of the EU should move forward.  We published a post-monitoring report, which represents a step forward.  When I was in Montenegro as a representative of the Council of Europe, I explained that it was not necessary to join NATO in order to join the European Union.  I stated that Ireland is a member of the Union but is not a member of NATO.  We must build relationships with countries such as Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina.  We must work with them through the diplomatic service so that they know that they have a friend in Ireland.  We will also have friends in them, of course.</p><p> I visited our embassy in the Islamic Republic of Iran where there are currently plans for expansion.  I would not be deterred by the views of other countries on the Islamic Republic of Iran.  The country has enormous respect for Ireland.  We have a good relationship with that country.  I am anxious that diplomatic contacts be re-established as quickly as possible.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-17a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Hackett" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019041700002#H00300"><p>I will try to cover as many of the comments and questions as possible.  Ms O'Donoghue has covered some of Deputy Haughey's questions on the rule of law and I fully agree with that.  The simple rule of thumb is that the EU positions itself as a world leader for the promotion of the rule of law, democracy and multilateralism abroad, outside the Union's borders.  That objective is inevitably undermined unless we uphold those values within the European Union itself.  That is why we have adopted the position as set out by the T&aacute;naiste.</p> <p>  Deputy Haughey mentioned French leadership and ambitious programmes.  The EU and Ireland need an ambitious France.  We need a President of France who has a clear vision for Europe.  As the Taoiseach said when he visited Paris recently, we agree with many of President Macron's ambitions, including on climate, agriculture and the promotion of democracy and the rule of law.  Of course, there are things on which we have a different approach.  Tomorrow the D&aacute;il will debate the strategic agenda of the EU for the next five years.  France will come to the European Council with its vision for the strategic agenda and Ireland will do likewise.  Member states will then agree a way forward.  That is the way we do business and it is something that should be welcomed.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan raised a number of issues, the first of which was taxation.  I fully agree with the views he set out.  I agree with his reasoning and that our long-standing position on corporate tax in particular has been good for this country.  This has been recognised by parties across the Oireachtas and by our people.  Ireland's position on corporate taxation is well known among member states and in Brussels.  It is recognised that it is one of our strong interests.  Every member state has a strong interest in different issues and they advocate those as strongly as possible.  Successive Governments have done so and we continue to do so in Brussels.  It is an area that is covered by unanimity but it is also an area on which we are not alone.  In fact, it is a good example of how new alliances have worked well.  The so-called Hanseatic League of Nordic and Baltic countries and the Netherlands has worked quite well among finance ministers.  There was important political support for the position taken by our Minister for Finance at a recent Council on digital taxation, for example.  That is an example of alliances working well.  That said, Deputy Durkan is correct that we must continue to be vigilant in this area.  </p> <p>  I fully agree with the points made regarding the Single Market, which is arguably the greatest economic achievement of the European Union.  However, it is not complete.  Ireland is one of the member states that continuously advocates for the completion of the Single Market.  That is why we have taken a leading role on services.  As Deputy Durkan said, because of our geographic position, we face mobility challenges but we have reflected those and formed alliances to try to tackle some of them.  I strongly agree with the Deputy on the issue of the EU being, at its core, a peace project and a place of welcome for those who are fleeing persecution or deprivation.  We must always remind people, particularly younger generations, that the EU is, at its core, a peace project and I welcome the fact that the Deputy highlighted that point.  I will not stray into the migration issue other than to say that a large number of members of the Defence Forces have spent recent years as part of Operation Sophia.  The particular remit of our contingent was search and rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea and Ireland can be proud of the role it has played.</p> <p> One of the questions asked was whether there were areas to which we were not attentive in the past.  Collectively, we need to be more aware of, and engaged on, issues of importance to other member states.  It is understandable that every member state is focused on the areas of most importance to it.  However, I am often struck in Brussels by issues on which other member states are very focused such as the eastern partnership agenda and energy.  Inevitably, Ireland has a different perspective on such issues based on our geographic position but it is important that we know the position of other member states and that we understand why these issues are important.  The reform of something called the posted workers directive and laws governing the haulage sector are in the top three issues for countries such as Bulgaria and Romania because they are politically sensitive for them.  We just need to know that so that when we go to those countries, we can engage with them on their position.  It is not a criticism that we have not been able to do that up to now.  It is just something of which we need to be aware.</p> <p>  I agree with the points made about the narrative we need to sell about Ireland.  Across member states and in Brussels, more needs to heard about the importance of our indigenous SME sector and about the innovations taking place in the farming and agriculture sectors.  More needs to be said about the smart and creative things that rural communities are doing.  We can be a role model for other member states in that regard.  It is not always just about taxation, foreign direct investment and multinationals.  Our economic story is much more rich and complex than that.</p> <p>  Ms O'Donoghue touched on some of the more practical things that the Oireachtas can do, as referred to by Senator Richmond.  The more that one can meet and connect with people, the better.  It is a simple rule of thumb and we are good at that in Ireland; Irish people are good at it.  I know that committee members have busy schedules but the more they can travel to member states and meet their counterparts, the better.</p><p>There is a role for us in making sure that all of the committees, wherever they go, focus on their area and also make sure that we can add value to that by having shared messages on priorities for Ireland and for the member states that members visit.  Being more systematic and joined up in our engagement as a country is something that we are getting better at but we have to continue with that.</p><p> Senators Leyden and Richmond touched on our strategic engagement and placements and those questions are more appropriate for the Department so Ms O'Donoghue will take them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-17a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aingeal O&rsquo;Donoghue" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019041700002#J00200"><p>I will be brief because I am conscious that the Portuguese delegation is present.  Senator Richmond made an interesting point on the target groups for potential success in EU competitions.  Those who have experience of the EU in other ways are a rich target group.  One of the ways to complement the general awareness raising opportunities in the EU is to look more clearly at what are key target groups are because, as the Senator said, the competition process is elaborate, lengthy and challenging.  We have done some work on supporting people through that and giving them advice, both with sessions in the permanent representative's office and in Dublin but there is probably scope to do more.  We recognise that we need to constantly refocus on how we are getting as many people as possible into the institutions.  I was interested in that thought.</p> <p>  The critical point about the permanent representative's office is the number of staff and it has representatives from almost every Department.  It is quite unlike any other Irish embassy or mission.  It is by far the largest but it is also a whole-of-Government office.  We are constantly recalibrating in the Departments precisely what the range of people they need there is in terms of the key matters on the legislative agenda.  For a Presidency, that is clearly ramped up in a different way but what we have seen, thankfully in the context of Brexit, is more of an engagement and a ramping up both in Brussels and in our other missions.</p> <p>  The other point Senator Richmond made related to a concern that Brexit was occupying the agenda so much that we did not have the capacity to focus as much as we needed to on other key issues, notably the MFF.  Going back to the point about when people travel to other capitals, Brexit is not at the top of the agenda in many other capitals and so they are very much focused on the MFF and other key issues.  In that sense, the EU is collectively focused on it.  It has taken its own rhythm.  Initially there were urgings from the Commission that we would agree the MFF quickly and in advance of the European Parliament elections.  As member states, we collectively felt that was too rushed and so it is moving forward at a pace.  Within our system, we have tried to preserve clear policy and capacity.  That includes my colleague in the Department, Ms Delaney, but it is led by a core group from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Trade and Finance, which is focused on the MFF.</p> <p>  Senator Richmond also asked about opening consulates in other cities so I will happily take that lovely list of cities that he mentioned back to the Department.  We always need to look at the overall Irish footprint.  It is not just the embassy or the consulate; it is also the agencies and we need to look at what the right mix is.  For example, a number of the agencies are based in Milan and Enterprise Ireland has announced the opening of an office in Lyon so when we talk about Ireland's global footprint it is the full global footprint.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on the point made by a number of members on what role parliamentary engagement can play and how that might be augmented.  It is encouraging to hear the openness and the positivity from members on what role they can play at the parliamentary level.  It is critical and we will be happy to continue that dialogue with them, either directly or via their clerks.  The role of national parliaments is greatly important for the democratic legitimacy of the EU.  It is both about building alliances and engaging with other parliamentarians and members' national role in terms of the democratic legitimacy of the EU.  It is a critical complement to the role of the European Parliament.  I very much welcome the positive signals here today and I am happy to follow up with members.</p></speech>

On the discussions that take place in Brussels, including at the General Affairs Council, we are one of the positive voices around the table in support of enlargement, recognising the value that EU membership has brought to us and to other member states and wanting to ensure, providing that the necessary conditions are met, that the opportunity is there for other member states.  In her time as Minister of State at the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy McEntee has travelled to the region twice, including most recently in a joint visit with her Finnish colleague, which is an interesting example of both alliances and the enlargement agenda so it is very much part of our thinking.</p></speech>

I will be brief.</p> <p>  As members know, the Bill is very short.  Its main purpose is to give members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  When enacted, it will allow members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to avail of the broad suite of WRC services, including mediation, conciliation and adjudication, as well as those of the Labour Court in the event of an industrial relations dispute involving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  The Bill forms part of the ambitious four-year plan for implementation of the recommendations outlined in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Accordingly, it recognises the Garda Commissioner as the employer, instead of the Department of Justice and Equality.  As such, for the purposes of the Bill, the Garda Commissioner will have lead responsibility in engaging in discussions on pay and conditions.</p> <p>  As I said, the Bill is very short.  It contains just five sections and makes a small number of legislative amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  The amendments primarily affect sections 3 and 23 of the Act which include certain definitions such as those of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a worker and an employer.  The Bill also extends the concept of what constitutes a contract of employment in the context of trade disputes involving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p> <p>  A schedule to the Bill seeks to actively disapply certain provisions of industrial relations legislation, particularly as they apply to the ability of garda&iacute; to take industrial action, engage in strike action, etc.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for allowing me to make some introductory remarks about the Bill.  I welcome whatever contributions Members may have to make on the Bill.</p></speech>

Garda&iacute; are hard-working front-line public servants who have been in a somewhat unique position in industrial relations policy to date which has been a challenge both for them and the State.  It is important that they be recognised.  The issue is addressed somewhat in the Bill.  It is a positive step which we support.  Godspeed in its passage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-17a.60" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1327" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019041700002#A00700"><p>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for coming.  As he is probably aware, my colleagues Deputies David Cullinane and Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh introduced a Bill in April 2017 to allow members of the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be classified as workers under legislation and give them the option of forming trade unions.</p><p>The purpose of the Trade Union (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces) Bill 2017 was to allow the representative associations in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces to reconstitute as trade unions, if they so wished, thereby giving them full access to the State's industrial relations mechanisms, while making it illegal for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces to engage in strike action for reasons of public safety and national security.  Rulings made by the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe, the increased level of industrial action engaged in by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the continued negative treatment by the State of members of the Defence Forces in their pay and conditions were among the reasons Sinn F&eacute;in introduced its Bill.  The continued ban on trade unions within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces is in violation of international agreements and the fundamental rights of those employed in the sector.  </p><p> The Bill which has been brought forward by the Minister of State has a similar, albeit considerably more limited, aim.  It seeks to amend the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to allow members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their representative associations to access the State's industrial relations mechanisms, namely, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Garda&iacute; have been waiting too long to be allowed access to the industrial relations mechanisms of the State.  Internal disputes within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na escalated owing to the unavailability of a forum in which to address conflicts at an early stage.  While long overdue, the Bill is very welcome.  </p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in believes members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces should be allowed to join a trade union, if they so wish, and that members of the Defence Forces should also be allowed to access the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court in the same way garda&iacute; will be permitted to do under the Bill.  Will the Minister of State clarify if there is a particular reason members of the Defence Forces are specifically excluded under the Bill?  As I said, while the Bill is very welcome for the changes it introduces for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is far more limited than what is proposed in Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill.  We intend to bring forward amendments to the Bill on Report Stage to strengthen the rights of garda&iacute; and members of the Defence Forces.  </p><p> I would like the Minister of State to address the following questions.

The purpose of this morning's meeting is to discuss the issue of regulation and control of the gambling sector.  We shall first meet with the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, for an update on the Government's legislative plans in this area.  After that, we will be meeting with Dr. Crystal Fulton of UCD.  I welcome the Minister of State and his officials here this morning and I will shortly invite him to make his opening statement.</p> <p>  I must remind members and the Minister of State that they should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members should also bear in mind that the Minister of State must leave us at 9.45 a.m. and to therefore keep their contributions short.  Following the Minister of State's departure we shall continue our engagement with Dr. Fulton.  I now invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-17a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019041700002#A00400"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I am very happy to have the opportunity this morning to inform the joint committee of the Government&rsquo;s efforts and intentions on regulation and control of the gambling sector.  I apologise for having to leave, but I would be quite happy to come back at any time to engage with the committee and to hear its views on this very important issue.</p> <p>  Gambling activity is of considerable economic importance in Ireland.  In 2017, the returns from the 1% betting duty and sales of national lottery ticket sales alone suggest an industry with a turnover in the order of &euro;6 billion annually, and it might be even more than that.  There are no figures published for revenue from online gaming, gaming in arcades and private members&rsquo; clubs, bingo, or the thousands of local community lotteries and raffles in the State.  It would not be unreasonable to estimate the turnover of the Irish gambling market annually as being between &euro;6 billion and &euro;8 billion.  As members of the committee will be aware, the Government's efforts to bring about reform were signalled by the publication in 2013 of the general scheme of the Gambling Control Bill.  That scheme was examined by the justice committee at the time, but unfortunately did not progress.  Since assuming responsibility for this area in 2016, I was determined to review the provisions of the 2013 general scheme to take account of the complex and ever-evolving nature of the gambling environment, both domestic and international.  Increasingly, gambling is an activity that is moving to an online environment, and traditional gaming arcades and other places are diminishing in importance.  As the gambling industry changes, so must the State&rsquo;s licensing and regulatory approach.  The development of modern, fit-for-purpose legislation is necessary and is a priority for the Government.  A modern regulatory approach will enhance consumer protection in all forms of gambling, increase the protection of vulnerable persons and potentially increase Exchequer revenue from the gambling industry.  Incremental change is not a viable approach to this reform.  Effective reform will require fundamental and significant change.  This will take some time to develop and it is essential that significant resources are committed to support the reform. </p> <p>  The Inter-Departmental Working Group on the Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling was established in January 2018 to review the provisions of the general scheme of the Gambling Control Bill 2013, and to determine if they remained fit for purpose in the light of the significant developments in both the domestic and international gambling industries in the intervening period.  The Government approved the working group&rsquo;s report and published it on 20 March.  I hope that members of the committee have had a chance to examine it since, as there is a lot in it, and it is quite detailed.  Critically, the report recommended that all future responsibility for licensing and regulation of all forms of gambling be vested in a proposed new gambling regulatory authority.  The working group also proposed the following measures - the rationalisation of the lengthy list of licensing categories for gambling activities recommended in the 2013 scheme, given the increasing move to online gambling; that significant background checking be required in determining applications for gambling licences; that all gambling licences should have appropriate terms and conditions attached to protect consumers and vulnerable persons, and for assisting in combatting fraud and money laundering; a range of possible options on the future approach to regulating advertising, sponsorship and promotion of gambling products, taking into account impacts for related sectors; and an improvement of the current minimal protection for consumers of gambling products to ensure fairness for all parties involved.  An alternative disputes resolution, ADR, mechanism should be developed to settle disputes.</p> <p>  The working group was conscious of the issue of problem gambling in Irish society, which can involve severely negative impacts for the person involved as well as his or her family.  It considered that the approach taken in the 2013 general scheme towards the protection of vulnerable persons remained broadly valid.  This included establishment of a social fund, funded by levies on licensed gambling operators, to assist with research and information campaigns and to support dedicated gambling addiction treatment by those professional and expert organisations involved in this field.  Since I assumed special responsibility in this area, my guiding principle has been that we must license and regulate the many legitimate gambling pursuits in which many citizens choose to participate in a modern, transparent and proportionate manner.  In doing so, we must ensure the best possible enforcement of the law and compliance with licensing conditions, increase revenue to the Exchequer, improve services to the consumer, and support the optimal protection for persons who may be vulnerable to addiction.</p> <p>  The main element of the Government decision on reform of 20 March 2019 was approving the establishment of a new gambling regulatory authority as an independent statutory body.  The Government is clearly of the view, and I hope it is one that can be shared by the committee, that without the establishment of a new gambling regulatory authority, modern effective licensing and regulation cannot be achieved.  Independent regulation would mirror the situation in most EU member states.  Our current legislation does not provide for a coherent licensing and regulatory approach to gambling activities.  Responsibility for licensing is shared among a number of Departments and agencies.  This fragmentation does not facilitate a consistent and effective approach to ensuring consumer protection and the protection of vulnerable persons, including underage persons.  Committee members will appreciate that effective modern licensing and regulation will require significant additional resources, primarily for the operation of the new regulatory authority.  The working group agreed, however, that any new regulatory authority should, to a large degree, be ultimately self-financing, with income from licence fees, fines imposed on operators, and other duties.  The group also examined the issue of advertising, sponsorship and promotion of gambling products, and looked at a range of possible options on the future approach to these activities.  These matters have attracted much public interest and comment.  Suggestions of potential restrictions in this regard must be carefully considered, targeted and be effective.  Sectors of Irish sporting activity depend heavily on gambling advertising and sponsorship and would risk being very negatively impacted by restrictions. </p> <p>  The committee wished to be informed as to the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill 2019.</p><p>I am pleased to report that yesterday evening in the Seanad we launched the Second Stage debate on this Bill, which amends the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  Second Stage was completed in the Seanad yesterday evening.  That Bill contains the existing provisions governing the permit and licence approach to gaming and lottery activity.  The Bill provides for the modernisation of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 by bringing clarity to the permit and licensing approach to small-scale local gaming and lottery activity, updating certain stake and prize limits and standardising the minimum age for engaging in gambling at 18, along with other provisions.  The Bill further provides for an amendment to the Totalisator Act 1929 to introduce a minimum age of 18 years for betting with the Tote.</p><p> I must emphasise that this Bill is very much an interim reform measure pending the development of comprehensive reform of the licensing and regulation of all gambling activities.  The amendments to the 1956 Act will help the promoters of local gaming and lottery activity, primarily sporting clubs and community organisations, by bringing greater coherence and clarity to the application process for permits and licences.</p></speech>

I know he is genuine in his attention to the regulation of gambling.  As previous Chair of this committee he provided some oversight of the past Bill.  I am somewhat disappointed that three years into his tenure in the Department of Justice and Equality we have had no action, no legislation and no progress.  Around Christmas I was surprised when the Minister of State announced his intention to establish a regulatory authority not this year but some time next year.  Unfortunately this D&aacute;il will fail gambling addicts when it comes to regulation because we will not succeed in advancing legislation that was first published in 2013.</p> <p>  While I recognise that technology has advanced to some extent, I note that people had apps on their phones and technology was a serious matter in 2013.  It is not as though there was a new invention in the past five years.  There should have been progress on that.  Waiting six years before deciding to establish a regulatory authority is not good enough and it has failed the people who are really vulnerable in this space.  We must put that on the record.</p> <p>  As a party, we sought to reintroduce the general scheme that had previously been published in order to facilitate and help the Department of Justice and Equality to progress this issue.  We have had more reviews and reports, but the metric now is delivery.  While I acknowledge the Minister of State's intentions, his Department has not been active enough in this legislative space.  He is the responsible and accountable one in that respect. </p> <p>  What engagement has the Minister of State had with the Department of Health on addressing gambling addiction?  What funding does the Government provide for people with gambling addiction?  </p></speech>

Even in jurisdictions with very strong regulation there is still problem gambling and addiction.  Establishing a regulator will help and will bring as much fairness as possible to the industry and activities involved.  If someone has a gambling addiction it is primarily a health matter and that person needs treatment.  I have met people who have had gambling addiction issues and have had treatment.  As with any addiction they can sometimes relapse.  The issue of addiction is primarily a health matter.  As part of the authority we propose to establish a social fund to help fund that.  However, these matters are primarily for my colleague, the Minister of State and the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  I am working on the issue of regulation.</p></speech>

That is just a nonsense argument.  The Minister of State is operating within a Government system where there should be co-operation around all the issues.  He is responsible for the regulation and licensing of gambling.  While we have had no legislative activity in this space, I have raised the issue with the Department of Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  There has been absolutely zero progress in policy or funding to help people with gambling addiction.  It is not good enough to silo the Department of Justice and Equality away from any responsibility there.  The lack of regulation and the lack of a social fund is one of the reasons we do not have funding for addiction.  There should be impetus coming from the Minister of State to ensure that Deputy Byrne takes this seriously and funds addiction services.  At the moment there is a two-tier approach, as with a lot of other things in healthcare.  If someone has money he or she can access private addiction services, but someone who needs State support is left vulnerable.  He or she has no ability to get treatment and the gambling companies target people.  While the legislation is delayed, there is no excuse for the lack of Government funding for people suffering from problem gambling and addiction.  It is not good enough for Departments to operate in different silos.  Members of the Government have collective responsibility.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the open and illegal gaming going on within Dublin city and other places.  Is the Minister of State concerned that Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 is being blatantly flouted?  In this city and elsewhere there are open illegal operations to which our own statutory authorities turn a blind eye.  Does the Minister of State have any thoughts on that?</p></speech>

At the risk of being criticised again by Deputy Chambers, I would like to point out that the Department of Justice and Equality is not responsible for the licensing and regulation of gambling.  A lot of people do not appreciate this.  The revised legislation will deal with issues of self-exclusion.  It is not our area of responsibility, and-----</p></speech>

I remind Deputy Chambers of the appeal I made at the start.  We only have the Minitser of State until 9.45 a.m.  Some four other colleagues wish to ask questions.  I do not want to interrupt Deputy Chambers' line of questioning, I am only reminding him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-17a.104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019041700002#B01600"><p>I will yield to my colleagues because they might have similar questions.  I get a sense that Ministers comment on lots of things.  There has been a lot of investigative journalism identifying blatantly illegal operations within our city and other places, which has significant implications for Revenue and for the State.  Licences issued by the District Court are breached and a blind eye is turned.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners have recently engaged in some token sampling, but the fact that the Minister of State is unwilling to comment demonstrates a worrying shadow cast by this powerful industry.  Ministers frequently comment on many issues.  It is a bit like saying that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, does not have responsibility for the FAI because it is a charity.  However, he was happy to comment yesterday when that matter was in the public spotlight.  The issue of illegal gaming operations involves blatant breaches of the law, but the Minister of State is refusing to comment, which shows the very worrying shadow cast by a powerful industry that wants to stay out of the spotlight and does not want to be regulated.  It is unfortunate that the committee only has 45 minutes in which to discuss this matter.</p></speech>

It is regrettable that the Minister of State will only be before the committee for a short time to deal with this.  Having heard the comments of Deputy Chambers, I am even more worried about this issue than I was before the meeting because the Minister of State seems to be hiding behind interdepartmental responsibilities and is failing to address what everybody knows is a fact about blatant illegality in this area.  Our concern arises from the fact that the Minster of State has been floating the general scheme of a Bill since 2013.  The working group was set up and has reported, but we now have this sort of technical Bill that has, in some ways, wasted the time of its drafters and the Department, while the type of gambling control Bill that is required is nowhere to be seen.  I ask the Minister of State to provide a bit more information on that.  Is that because of lobbying and push-back from the industry?  What is causing the delay?  The answers given so far by the Minister of State did not really address those issues.</p></speech>

Nobody has told me - or, as far as I know, the Department - that they do not want a regulator.  There is an acceptance that we need a regulator and I am very anxious to have one.  However, that is proving far more difficult and technical than I envisaged.  I would love to have a regulator in place tomorrow.  The report of the interdepartmental working group illustrates the complexity of the issue.  We have spent the past year working very hard to analyse every aspect of the matter.  I am sure members have read the report, which is very detailed and complex.  I am willing to return to appear before the committee to discuss this matter at any time.  Before Deputy Clare Daly came into the room, I apologised for the fact that I can only attend for 45 minutes this morning.</p> <p>  I am interested in the constructive views of the committee and any help it can provide us in bringing this work forward.  We are where we are.  I accept the criticism that the process has taken a long time.  I wish it had not taken so long.  It took a year for the report to be put together.  It involved a significant amount of work and much interaction and research.  The Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill is not just a technical Bill.  It does far more than may initially appear to be the case.  It will help in many ways to regulate some of the current practices.  On lobbying, personally speaking, we have not come under any pressure.  The people want this and I want it as well.</p></speech>

The briefing notes provided by the Minister of State pitch it as a minor and technical issue, but he stated that it is far more than that.  There is a contradiction between the written supporting material and the comments of the Minister of State.</p> <p>  The private members' clubs have stated that the Bill is an effort to shut them down.  Is that the intention of the Minister of State?  I do not have skin in this game.  Is that the intention of the Minister of State or is it an unanticipated side effect of the Bill?  The clubs state that under the Bill they will be obliged to get a gaming permit, the conditions of which are so stringent that the clubs will be put out of operation.   They argue that it will drive people who currently go to private members' clubs underground.  Although online betting is licensed, online gaming is not.  According to the clubs, online gaming is far more dangerous than such gaming in clubs, where restrictions may be put in place.  Is it the intention of the Minister of State to shut down such clubs?</p></speech>

The Bill brings clarity to the area of local lotteries such as those in which many sporting clubs and community organisations partake.  In 1956, there was much emphasis on circuses, carnivals and so on, but the position in that regard has totally changed.  The Bill focuses more on what is happening now.  It also updates legislation in respect of stakes and prizes, a measure which was sought.</p></speech>

Obviously, all of the games that operate in these clubs fall into that category.  As that is a feature of the games, effectively, the legislation will shut down the clubs while allowing free rein online with far fewer checks.  I ask the Minister of State to address that section.</p></speech>

The section referred to by the Deputy is not changing the law as that provision is also contained in the 1956 Act.  In any event, the private members' clubs are not licensed under the 1956 Act.  I hope that there will be an opportunity shortly after Easter to bring the legislation before the committee for these issues to be further teased out.  The Bill is currently before the Seanad and I do not wish to pre-empt the debate there.</p></speech>

Fair play to him for the work he has done on the issue.  In reply to Deputy Chambers, the Minister of State stated that he is not legally responsible for the flagrant ignoring of the law by gaming operations in places such as Westmoreland Street and O'Connell Street.  I do not understand that.  These places have completely ignored the fact that these practices are illegal under the 1956 Act.  The Garda has turned a blind eye to them for years.  It was my understanding that the Garda falls under the remit of the Minister of State.  I understand that the Revenue Commissioners do not, but they are probably doing more about the issue than is the Garda, which seems to have turned a blind eye to it.</p> <p>  The Licenced Gaming Association of Ireland, which represents licensed operators, including those in Courtown in my area, estimate the loss to the Exchequer of tens of millions of euro per year.  Why does that not register with the Minister of State?  In February of last year, I asked the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, about the enforcement role of the Garda in regard to unlicensed gaming activities and the availability of gaming machines in locations in which gaming is prohibited.  He told me that he would request a report on the matter from Garda authorities.  That report was not produced.  I asked him twice more about it.  In January of this year, in response to my final parliamentary question on the matter, the Minister completely ignored the fact that a report on the role of the Garda in this matter had been promised.  I presume we will never see that report.  It is mad that the Minister for Justice would need to ask the Garda for a report on its enforcement role when that role and the powers of the Garda are fairly obvious under the 1956 Act.  Why has the Garda ignored or not carried out its enforcement role in terms of seizing gaming machines which are prohibited under Part III of the 1956 Act?  How can the Minister of State be sure that the Garda will enforce the provisions of the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill?</p></speech>

I cannot comment on whether a particular practice is illegal.  For me to do so would potentially prejudice events that may take place afterwards, as we have seen in the past.  I cannot state that a certain practice is illegal.  I am not a judge and, with respect, neither is any of the committee members.</p> <p>  Neither the Minister nor I directs the Garda what to do.

Politicians cannot tell the Garda what to do.  I am sure the Deputy understands this.  We cannot direct the Garda  to do "X", "Y" or "Z".  The Commissioner makes those decisions.  It is the same with the Revenue Commissioners.  They are independent, as they should be.  If I came in here and told the Deputy that I directed the Garda Commissioner to do "X", "Y" or "Z", I am sure the Deputy would be the first man jumping off the fence and saying that I cannot do that and that the Garda should be independent.  I am sure the Deputy's comments this morning are being noted.  This is why this hearing is useful.</p></speech>

First of all, as Deputy Chambers noted, the Gambling Control Bill should have introduced long before now.  If it had been, we probably would not have this problem.  However, because the Government has been lax in its approach to this area, somebody will lose out.  Is that not a fact?</p></speech>

Since then, we have looked at it again.  As I said at the beginning, we looked at what has happened in almost all other EU countries.  They have an independent statutory authority with the teeth, power and resources to really get to grips with this.  We are of the view that an office in the Department of Justice and Equality would not do the business.  This is why we have changed it completely, which is why it has taken this long to get to where we are.  The report has been published and the next thing is to bring forward heads of Bill, which we will send to this committee for members' comments.  As I said earlier, I am very anxious to move on this as quickly as I can.  I am frustrated that it has taken this long.</p></speech>

In February, I asked a parliamentary question about the amount of funding allocated to gambling addiction services in each of the years from 2015 to 2018.  Strangely, I was told by the HSE that apportionment of funding dedicated solely to gambling addiction services cannot be extracted from overall funding, which I do not really understand.  Has the Department ever sought this information from the Department of Health or the HSE?  Surely knowing the amount we spend on gambling addiction services would be useful and inform the Department's policy?</p></speech>

Another one is ongoing and we hope to be in a position to produce it at the end of this year.

Again, I must stress that even countries with strong regulators still have problem gambling and addiction.  That is a health matter and the expertise resides there.  We can work to make it fairer for people who get involved in gambling activity but if it is a health matter, it is the remit of the Department of Health and the HSE.</p></speech>

I echo the frustrations expressed by other members.  There has been a lack of action.  From what the Minister of State says, there is a consensus regarding the need for regulation yet we are in the same space we were several years ago regarding the lack of a regulator.  This is a significant issue that affects a significant amount of people.  I know about the lack of data, which has been touched upon, but according to the Institute of Public Health in Ireland, 1% of the population, or 40,000 people, is affected by problem gambling.</p> <p>  I will group my questions together.  Is the Minister of State determined to ensure that fixed odds betting terminals do not make an impact in this jurisdiction, do not develop any roots and are not tolerated?  What is the Minister of State's attitude to the separation of gambling and alcohol to ensure that as far as possible, the two things are regulated separately and do not take place on the same premises?  Reference has been made to the strength of the gambling lobby.  Many of the big gambling firms would make much play of their efforts to tackle gambling.  I would have my doubts.  One comes across examples, particularly in the case of online gambling, of the ability of some of the big firms to ban somebody for four or five profitable bets.  These firms can spot a pattern in terms of a profitable gambler for want of a better word yet they seem to have great difficulty in identifying somebody who has a clear problem and is a problem gambler.  These firms have an awful lot of information to hand.  Are they using it to the best of their ability to identify people who are gambling too much and have developed problem gambling habits?  I think they could do a great deal more.  I will leave it at that.  I might have more questions for later speakers.  It is unfortunate.  I know the Minister of State and the committee are restricted in terms of time but I would have preferred a more substantial debate.  Hopefully, we will have more opportunities in future.  </p></speech>

Any constructive comments or suggestions are most welcome when it comes to this very complicated area.  The Deputy spoke about banning profitable betting and information.  It is envisaged that in respect of banning profitable gambling, the revised Bill will include conditions on licences and consumer protection to take that into account.</p><p>The Deputy pointed out the industry has an awful lot of information and data and he is right.  This is developing by the day and getting more and more complicated.  The separation of gambling and alcohol will certainly be considered in the revised Gambling Control Bill.  It will be included.  Fixed odds betting terminals will not be allowed.  The stated Government position is that we do not want them.</p></speech>

The Minister of State said it is a priority for the Government but clearly it is not.  We know what priorities for the Government look like and how they operate.  The Government decided the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was a priority and three years later it is still meandering its way through the Oireachtas eating up a large amount of resources.  The reason no substantive legislation has been introduced is that it is not a priority for the Government.  We regulate many types of behaviour in society and it is astonishing that, to date, we have not regulated gambling, which has such a negative impact on people's lives.</p> <p>  We all agree there needs to be a regulatory authority but when will the heads of the Bill be published?  When will it be introduced in the Oireachtas?  What type of regulatory authority is the Minister of State looking at?  Will it be something like the Legal Services Regulatory Authority?  Unfortunately, with gambling we need a body, a group of people or an entity, working on this every day of the week, rather than circumstances in which the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, sometimes looks at the issue, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, sometimes looks at it and the committee sometimes looks at it.  We need a regulatory authority working on this matter every day of the week coming up with its own rules that would be made statutory instruments.  This is not happening.</p></speech>

We have commissioned research to inform us on the best way of structuring an authority and what type of governance it should have.  Should it have a board, a commission or a chief executive format and what various sections should it have internally?  We should have the information from the research by the summer.  As the Deputy said, we want an authority that will be fully active, fully engaged and independent of the Government and Minister of the day so that any perception of pressure or lobbying will not arise.</p> <p>  The next task we have is to publish the heads of the Bill.  We will be building on the 2013 Bill, the Fianna F&aacute;il Bill and, crucially, the interdepartmental working group on the licensing and regulation of gambling that we introduced last March.  It took a great deal of work, time and effort to put it together.  I hope we will have this legislation.  The Taoiseach has indicated the whole process will take 18 months to complete.</p></speech>

That is what he said.  It is a priority for the Government.  I have been pushing it as hard as I can to get it over the line.

We have looked at the UK, Malta, France, New Zealand and other countries.</p></speech>

It is appropriate to commend Deputy Jack Chambers on the work he has done in this area.  I am probably the only person here who was a member of the previous Oireachtas justice committee.  At that stage, the then Chairman, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, did a body of work in this area.  I know of his personal commitment.  Sometimes when dealing with the Government there are pressing priorities.  The Minister of State has been shouting extremely hard.</p> <p>  The Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill passed Second Stage in the Seanad last night and will move on to Committee Stage pretty quickly.  This is an avenue we can use to deal with some of the concerns.  I would welcome the Minister of State's return to the committee when we could discuss further his views on a gambling regulatory authority.  I would prefer this to be done right over 18 months, using best international examples to merge what works well in other countries into one authority that can be among the best in the world.  Gambling is an addiction and is becoming an even bigger problem.  It is very difficult to regulate given that much of it is now online.</p></speech>

As the time has now concluded, I thank members for their co-operation in restricting their contributions.  There is no question that we need to address this more substantively.  It is unfortunate we did not have the opportunity to do so this morning.  I would like to add one thing in response to an earlier point.  The Minister of State said that constructive comments would be welcome and all would be noted.  I emphasise that all of the contributions we have had this morning were constructive.</p></speech>

I welcome Dr. Crystal Fulton, associate professor at the school of information and communication studies at University College Dublin.  I will shortly invite her to make her opening statement but first I must draw her attention as a witness to the situation regarding privilege.  The same did not apply to the Minister of State because he is a Member.  It applies to non-Members presenting before the committee.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  All that said, I invite Dr. Fulton to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

The issue of potential harm through gambling is a topic of international concern.  Harmful gambling may have wide-ranging social impacts with the risk of negative effects not only for the persons who gamble but also for their family, friends and communities.  A gambling problem can have extreme and negative consequences for the gambler and for that person's social connections.  Harmful gambling often has a significant financial impact on individuals and their families.</p><p>This may lead to shame and stigma which may contribute to social isolation.  Understanding gambling behaviour and the social outcomes of this activity may contribute to the development of social policies in the area of gambling and addiction, with particular attention to policies which protect those vulnerable to the negative effects of gambling.  In turn, the development of appropriate policies may help minimise the array of social, health and economic costs associated with a gambling problem.  Participants in this study spoke of financial devastation, as well as social isolation.  Both problem gamblers and their families also reported feelings of shame, stigma and social isolation resulting from a gambling problem.</p><p> The purpose of our research was to examine the social impact of gambling in Ireland and to understand the issues from the perspective of those affected.  In 2015, with funding from the Irish Research Council and support from the Department of Social Protection, we completed the first national study on the impact in which we spoke to the major stakeholders, including addiction service providers, recovering gamblers, the families and friends of gamblers and the gambling industry.   In December 2016, with funding from the Minister for Justice and Equality, we updated our literature review and invited stakeholders to comment on developing legislative issues around gambling in Ireland.</p><p> Addiction service providers were located throughout Ireland and included any counselling service that worked with gamblers or their social connections who had experienced harm.  Recovering gamblers and their social connections came from diverse backgrounds.  They were located across Ireland.  They were from different age groups and came from various socio-economic backgrounds.  Recovering gamblers had also suffered addiction to different forms of gambling, for example, one or more of casino games, fixed odds betting terminals, lottery tickets and scratch cards, betting on horses or dogs, etc.  Some had pursued land-based games while others had followed online gambling.</p><p> Importantly, the first-hand accounts of individuals affected by gambling offer critical information about the social impact of harmful gambling.  For those affected by gambling, this research provided an opportunity for those often unheard, vulnerable groups to have a voice, creating an important foundation of public experience to inform policy development.  Our research explored perceptions of gambling in Ireland, the problems associated with problem gambling and opportunities for treatment and prevention.  Owing to the stigma around problem gambling, it is often very difficult for gamblers and their social connections to discuss gambling issues openly.  Stigma increases the hidden nature of a gambling problem and complicates recovery.  This research made it possible for those affected by a gambling problem to take a step past this stigma to discuss the impact of gambling on them.</p><p> The research has led to multiple findings.  However, participants agreed on three major social measures.  They identified open discussion and educational initiatives, approaches at national level to facilitate those affected by gambling and legislative measures as key requirements for addressing the risk for harmful gambling in Ireland.  Today, we would like to highlight some of these needs identified by participants.  The first is their desire for open discussion and education.  Participants expressed a need for open discussion about gambling and the risk it can pose to individuals and their families.  Today's public forum helps to support that open conversation.  Participants also spoke of a need for education.  Some proposed education along the lines of life skills in the curriculum from primary education through to university level education.  While participants connected advertising with triggers for gambling, some suggested using advertising for positive impact to warn the public about the potential for harmful gambling.  For instance, they suggested that advertising could be used successfully to help educate people and create awareness, similar to recent campaigns to increase public awareness and understanding of social issues such as mental health. </p><p> With respect to participants' views on approaches to harmful gambling, participants in our study have identified the need for multiple supports to treat and prevent problem gambling.  There is an urgent need bring together people and information to create a unified, transparent approach to facilitate those affected by problem gambling.  A national strategy that encompasses government and charitable and volunteer bodies is needed to address causes and outcomes of problem gambling in Ireland.</p><p> The framework for the general scheme of the gambling control Bill 2013, intended to update legislation in Ireland, provided for the establishment of a social fund, paid for by licence holders in the gambling industry, for the purposes of promoting responsible gambling and assisting those affected by gambling.  Under the draft framework, the Office for Gambling Control Ireland, in consultation with an advisory committee on responsible gambling, consisting of "a nominee of the Minister for Social Protection, the voluntary/community sector, a representative from the HSE [Health Services Executive] and two representatives from licence holders", would recommend distribution of the social fund for purposes such as education.  This is in keeping with practice in the UK where the Gambling Commission requires gambling companies with UK customers to contribute money to fund research and services around problem gambling.  Our research outcomes included a recommendation that the social fund included in the general scheme of the Bill should provide significantly for public education about gambling and should do so neutrally without the influence of gambling operators.</p><p> Participants also noted the existence of services in the form of counselling and treatment centres to assist gamblers in recovery.  However, study participants noted a lack of services to help family and friends affected by a loved one's addiction.  They called for action around harmful gambling to become a social priority and for the development of additional and expanded services to help those affected.</p><p> With respect to specific legislative needs, first, participants in our research identified the passage and, importantly, the implementation of new and updated legislation around gambling as essential Government tasks to protect the public.  Second, our interviewees suggested a variety of measures they wanted the Government to include around regulation.  In particular, they wanted regulatory measures to provide a framework around gambling to protect those vulnerable to gambling addiction.  Some of the specific measures frequently noted involved regulation in respect of advertising; increased taxation and licensing for gambling operators; maximum spends; measures to avoid underage gambling; numbers of particular gambling establishments; online gambling; opening hours for gambling premises; removal of fixed odds betting terminals; and standards around the gambling industry's obligation to alert the public to the risks of gambling.</p><p> Of particular concern to participants was the risk of gambling to young people.  Underage gambling was a common theme among recovering gamblers in our research.  They frequently spoke of the early age at which they first saw gambling.  The legal age to gamble in Ireland is 18.  However, our participants reported collecting gambling winnings for relatives while they were underage and sometimes under the age of ten years.  They also reported an initial exposure to gambling as seeing adults gambling, both adult relatives and adults related to friends.  From there, participants reported their initial gambling experiences as often occurring while young and often underage.  As their gambling continued, a number of recovering gamblers in our study reported that they progressed from land-based gambling opportunities to forms of digitised gambling, including digital gambling machines and online gambling.  </p><p> This brings me to the relationship between technology and gambling.  Participants in our research, including gamblers, family members and addiction counsellors, identified technologies that enabled digitised access to gambling as potential factors in harmful gambling.  They referred to gambling via the Internet, computers, mobile phones, slot machines, casino games and machines, virtual races on screens at betting shops, television, social media and tablet computer applications or apps.  They described smart mobile devices such as iPhones as particularly convenient because these devices enabled gambling anywhere and at any time.  In particular, technology now enables hidden gambling on phones, online, etc.  Our work has revealed the digital space, which is continuously changing, is a critical point to address regarding gambling, particularly with regard to young people.  Young people are often considered more digitally literate and routine users of technologies and this familiarity with technology may make them more vulnerable to online gambling, especially if they play social casino games in which micro-transactions are completed to unlock additional play features.</p><p> Our second report found technology continues to feature in gambling, with online gambling and social media popular means of doing this.  The mobile phone is shown in research to be a particular access point for gambling, just as participants in our study spoke of the attraction of mobile phones in gambling.</p><p> The technological area of gambling is constantly changing.  Recovering gamblers in our study spoke of technology as accelerating and deepening the effects of gambling because the technology enabled secret gambling.  Our review found that responsible gambling measures can include self-exclusion and set limits on their gambling.  However, research and our gambling participants have identified issues around self-exclusion measures, for example, the complexity of self-exclusion agreements; the inability of exclusion agreements to exclude from multiple venues simultaneously; gamblers' using multiple accounts; the shame felt when inquiring about self-exclusion; an unwillingness or inability to admit the existence of a gambling problem; and a lack of awareness about self-exclusion programmes.</p><p> In addition, our research revealed that social media are common forums for gaming opportunities.</p><p>Since social media have developed rapidly and continuously, gambling operators can make sophisticated use of these technologies to interact with current and potential customers in new and evolving ways.  Significantly, there is a blurring of lines between online gambling and social media games that simulate gambling.  Importantly, social media may expose children to advertising and promotions on these platforms.  While a range of age verification processes have been employed in various jurisdictions, there are technical and legal difficulties with online age verification, which have led some to argue that parental responsibility and user education are critical.</p><p> Since our work in 2016, additional technologies have arisen.  Examples are loot boxes or loot crates.  They comprise a gaming feature in which the player can purchase random content through video games.  New technologies pose a new challenge for regulatory bodies, not only in Ireland but also the EU as a whole.  </p><p> The gambling landscape offers significant challenges for legislators, but they are challenges that participants in our research viewed as important to address.  Participants described harmful gambling as having a profound, life-changing impact on them, whether gamblers or their families and friends.  Significantly, they believed the Government could, and should, act to protect them and those at future risk of a gambling problem.</p></speech>

She said children as young as ten are collecting winnings and are heavily exposed to gambling.  How can this be rectified through the updating of the law?

Insurance, for example, might cover them only for alcohol addiction so they might have to present as having an alcohol addiction as opposed to a gambling addiction.  This is going on in the background.</p> <p>  With regard to funding, participants wanted to see more services.  They asked specifically that services be put in place everywhere in the country.  One of the points that emerged was the business of family and friends feeling excluded.  Participants wanted more services to help family and friends because they are deeply affected by their loved ones' gambling.  There are very few services in the country that administer to people whose families have been affected.  For families, there is the RISE Foundation but it is located in Dublin.  Not everybody can come to Dublin.  It does not matter whether one is really well off or not when suffering from a gambling problem.  It is a level playing field at the end because no one has any money.  Without money, how does one come to Dublin for treatment?  Participants wanted services to be spread to all the regions in the country.  They want more of them.  They wanted specific services to help families and anyone affected by their gambling.</p></speech>

Young people, and all of us, are attracted to social media.  There is a blurred division between games and the area that leads into gambling and grooming for gambling.  It is difficult, and I appreciate that.  It has to be addressed in some way.  With any luck, it should be possible to address everything that happens around online gambling.</p></speech>

I have just one point.  I am told there are about 45,000 people suffering from gambling addiction in Ireland.  Ireland ranks third in terms of gambling losses <i>per capita</i>, after Australia and Singapore.  Significantly, Ireland is first in terms of losses <i>per capita </i>from online gambling.  This legislation will probably expose customers to an additional risk associated with playing online.  While online betting is licensed, online betting and online gambling are still unregulated.  The lack of regulation in Ireland means there is absolutely no obligation to offer self-exclusion or time-out facilities, or a facility for new customers to set maximum spending limits when opening an online account.  Does much more need to be built into legislation to address the problems we are facing?</p></speech>

The difficulty we have is that she has given us very good research to add to the debate on why we need legislation.  However, the person whom we could question about the legislation did not have enough time with us.  Dr. Fulton is in an unfair set of circumstances in which we are just asking her to confirm the evidence she has given us.  The person with whom we need to tease out the issue in order to implement some of the recommendations is not here to answer our questions.  If we do not have many questions, it is just that Dr. Fulton has given us many of the answers.  She will have heard the Minister of State earlier.  To me, he hid a little behind, or used the excuse of, interdepartmental responsibility for this issue and the crossover between health and justice.</p><p>The figures from the Institute of Public Health demonstrate the significant health and social cost of gambling which far exceeds any income generated, aside from the human cost.  In that context, what immediate steps must be taken?  We heard a little about the delay in the legislation but improving, say, addiction services does not require legislation.  What priority steps could be taken now that do not require legislation?  Developing more points on the idea of a dedicated gambling addiction treatment service would be one option but what are Dr. Fulton's thoughts on advertising?  Should there be a significant, high-profile, Government-led campaign on advertising?  Has much study been done on the impact that might have?  </p><p> The lines have blurred.  People traditionally thought of gambling as a fella going to the pub on a Sunday while waiting for the wife to make the dinner and popping into the bookies.  Now it seems as if everybody gambles and it is done through mobile phones and online.  Should the Government be advertising the impacts?  Is there evidence available, or are there other steps the Government could take in the meantime if the legislation is so complex?  That is not to say I buy the argument of legislation being complex.</p></speech>

Many of my comments reflect those answers.  In addition, one of the major recommendations of the report was that there should be a unified plan and national strategy to deal with problem gambling and the harm that it causes not only to individuals but the much wider impact it has on families and communities.  We recommended that.  It would mean that Departments work together to facilitate addressing this problem.</p> <p>  Advertising is a much debated topic internationally because it provides a major means of promoting gambling opportunities and it was identified across our participant groups as a problem.  They referred to the negative effects of multiple forms of gambling advertising.  For someone in recovery from gambling addiction - and such a person might always be in recovery - he or she may be unable to extract gambling from the process of watching sports on television because he or she always associated them with each other.  The ads on television and pop-up ads online were noted as things that made gamblers think about gambling, acted as triggers, hindered recovery and were problematic.  Advertising could pop up online even when the recovering gambler was not looking at gambling sites so that needs to be considered.</p> <p>  Advertising of gambling on TV and in newspapers, especially where free bets are advertised, was considered problematic.  Seeing the racing page in the newspaper or advertising on TV could trigger gambling behaviour for our participants.  They had strong views on advertising in our study.  They were very worried about young adults and people.  They deemed gambling advertisements as potentially harmful to gamblers as well as recovering gamblers.  The people who have the addiction and are trying to recover and others are at risk.  Our participants were worried about both of those groups.</p></speech>

It is an addiction.  It is put out there as a harmless bit of fun but once people are in that trap it is hard for them to get out.  What would be the impact of a Government-led public health campaign?  On the one hand, there could be the restriction of advertisements and, on the other, a public health campaign.  Has analysis been conducted of the impact that might have?  Has such a Government-led initiative been undertaken in other jurisdictions similar to the anti-smoking campaigns or whatever?  Have there been studies on the impact of the combination of a curtailment of advertising the product with a public health campaign?</p></speech>

As I said in my original comments, our participants proposed using advertising to promote a positive message, to help people and perhaps prevent them from getting into trouble in the first place.</p></speech>

What about the Government's efforts to control the gambling issue and proposals in that area?  Many large companies operate their servers offshore and thereby make it more complicated for the Government to control.  Other countries operate IP blocking for unlicensed online operators and taking such an approach here would mean that companies would have to get an Irish licence to be used by Irish customers.  In that sense, the customer could be protected by whatever regulatory regime is contained in the Gambling Control Bill when we get it.  Has Dr. Fulton any thoughts on that?  It might be outside her remit and, if it is, I am sorry, but has she done any detailed research as to how a regulation could be implemented to tackle online operators?</p></speech>

We spoke to people in ten different organisations and then conducted a snowball sample.  We put out a call for people who wanted to talk to us about gambling.  They could have come to us if they wanted to just talk about gambling.  Every gambler who came to us was at a different stage of recovery.  It was a matched pair design so they needed to nominate a family member to participate.  It is such an isolating activity that our volunteers do not always have such a person, because that family might be gone, so they could bring a friend.  We interviewed both so, in the end, we had 22 recovering gamblers matched with 22 people who interviewed alongside them as family and friends.</p></speech>

Gambling is so secretive that it can take a long time for a problem to surface and there is usually a crisis.  For example, a mortgage bill that has not been paid for several months is intercepted or a bailiff comes to the door wanting the keys to the house, the car, or whatever.  There is some sort of financial and emotional crisis point.  Spouses of recovering gamblers in our study talked about thinking that they had a marital problem because they did not realise what their partner was doing.  Their partner was leading a double life.  A gambling problem comes to light in different ways and over time.</p></speech>

They spoke of it being a mental health issue where there is an emotional change that one is looking for.  One is looking for that kind of good feeling hit by gambling.  It is not even necessarily the loss at the end of it; it is the anticipation leading up to that moment when one finds the outcome.  We sometimes assume we understand gambling harm, but we do not always.</p></speech>

In the end, they might be chasing losses.  They are chasing the losses because they do not want to tell anybody that they lost that money.  Gamblers will always talk about the wins they had.  They do not want to share that other unseemly part.  The chasing losses comes when they keep losing money and they keep trying to get it back and then ends up being a vicious cycle.</p></speech>

There were not as many women in my study.  It is difficult for women to come forward.  In Ireland, it is difficult to say that one is female and one has a gambling problem.  Three of the recovering gamblers were women, also of different age groups and different socioeconomic backgrounds.</p> <p>  They come from different backgrounds and genders.  There would always be this point, regardless of who it was, that this gambling was discovered.  This puts a significant strain on their relationship with their partner, their family or whoever.  For children, they might witness their parents fighting a lot.  We had examples of children, by which I mean adult children, telling us that their memory is of their parents fighting about money.  Then there were the spouses who, as I said, thought they had marital difficulties, and really what was going on is the husband or partner would start an argument so that he could go away and be left alone in isolation to gamble.  It is a lot more complex than we realise.</p></speech>

Those are comments that came up a lot.  Those are some of the main issues that arose.</p> <p>  Sometimes they were not sure exactly how legislation could fix it but they knew they wanted it to fix it.  I refer to regulation of all of these matters.</p> <p>  They want to make sure that others are safe.  They are concerned.  It did not matter whether people were involved in land-based gambling - some people did land-based gambling only - or whether they were online gamblers, they where all worried about young people's exposure to gambling and young people starting gambling, potentially underage.</p></speech>

I am interested in hearing Dr. Fulton's views, specifically, on the language that we use.  From what I have researched and what I have come across, we are being told that we should be talking about problem gambling, not necessarily gambling addiction.  If it is interfering with one's capacity to be able to put food on the table, the threshold for addiction might be quite high but problem gambling is what we need to tackle.  It is not only a full-blown addiction.  I am just wondering, as I have read conflicting views on this.  I try to use the term "problem gambling" rather than "addiction" because it says more about what is going on and what the impact is.</p></speech>

When I spoke to addiction counsellors, they spoke of addiction and of problem gambling.  A term that is coming more into the arena now is "harmful gambling."  Any gambling that causes harm is a problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-17a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019041700002#J01900"><p>We need to be careful of the language we use.  If one confines it to addiction, one sets the bar quite high and one will miss many people.</p> <p>  The results of the drug prevalence survey from 2014-15 was published recently.  It conflicts with results from the North.  For example, in Dundalk, the rate of problem gambling is 0.8% but 15 miles up the road, in Newry, it is 2.3%.  It is ludicrous to suggest that there is such a considerable difference between those towns separated by a couple of miles. The Government has underestimated its figures substantially.  Gambling is something that does not happen necessarily out in the open, particularly online.  Why is there such a disparity between those figures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-17a.207" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Crystal Fulton" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019041700002#J02000"><p>I cannot speak to those figures.  I did not conduct the study.  The Deputy needs to speak to those who gathered that data.  That would probably be the most helpful.</p></speech>

It does not make any sense to suggest, for people who live so close together, that it would be a problem across the Border and not a problem on this side of Border.</p> <p>  Dr. Fulton spoke of the need to prevent targeting, particularly of young people.  That is something that we must incorporate into this legislation to try to make it robust.  It will not be possible to capture every scenario.  I do not know if she is aware of the fast food outlet rolling out a Monopoly-style competition at present.  One has to be over 16 to collect the prize but one does not have to be over 16 to play.  I have seen the advertisements on the television.  It is an attractive form of gambling, particularly for young people.  There is a risk and reward element because not every scratch gets one a prize.  There is an age restriction, in that this company has to apply to the District Court for a lottery licence, but it is virtually unenforceable.  In terms of framing the legislation, can measures be put in place to prevent children being targeted specifically and is there an example of international best practice that we could look to?</p></speech>

It will be difficult, but we have to make the attempt.</p> <p>  In terms of what is done internationally, the playing field changes every day.  Researchers are looking in depth at the issue of advertising, at games, and at the whole culture of gaming and its psychological impact.  There is a lot more involved than just saying "Yes" or "No" to a game.  Psychology is involved and the matter must be looked at from the perspective of health.  What is possible technologically must also be considered.  It is quite a complex avenue.</p></speech>

Is there anywhere outside of this wee island to which we could look because it has made a good start or has got some of this right?  The technology is evolving, quite possibly more quickly than the legislation will be able to keep up with.  One often hears that from people.  People say we will never be able to regulate this area and almost suggest that we should not try.  In respect of this issue, and young people affected by it in particular, we have to try to introduce the highest form of regulation we can.  Is there some point from which we could start?</p></speech>

It is not appropriate to shelve the issue.  Research around advertising is being done in places such as Australia.  A lot of work is being done in different areas.  The first step towards addressing the issue of advertising is bringing all of this work together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-17a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019041700002#K00400"><p>I thank Dr. Fulton for her presentation.  This is an area which is getting an increasing amount of focus and which has a substantial impact on many people's lives.  It is a difficult addiction to tackle.  It is invidious and very often hidden from view, even hidden from loved ones, until, as Dr. Fulton has identified, one reaches a crisis point - the involvement of a bailiff, an unpaid bill or so on.  The advent of the huge range of opportunities to gamble online has made it much easier to become addicted.</p> <p>  I have a few specific questions, which are similar to the questions I asked the Minister.  Does Dr. Fulton have a view on the separation of gambling and alcohol?  I am instinctively inclined to believe the two should be kept separate and that they should be separately licensed and regulated.  Obviously the presence of one makes the other potentially more dangerous or harmful.  On the other hand, there are those who would argue that there is no harm in one having a drink during a game of cards in a private members' club.  My instinctive view is more towards the former but I am curious as to whether Dr. Fulton has a view on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-17a.213" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Crystal Fulton" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019041700002#K00500"><p>The participants in our research did not necessarily have a problem only with gambling.  Some participants also had problems with alcohol or drugs.  There is a kind of co-addiction.  It was often the case that people talked about having a problem with one thing or another, going for treatment for that issue, and then discovering that they also had a gambling issue which did not come out until they were in therapy and trying to get well.  It is hard to separate in that sense, but I appreciate the Deputy's comments about the differences between the two.  If somebody is having a problem with alcohol or drugs there is an immediate physical response which can be identified.  One can see that somebody is in some way intoxicated.  When gambling one is not putting a substance into one's body to change one's mood; one is using gambling to do that.  The outcome is different.  Any of us sitting here could be gambling right now and the others would not necessarily know.  If one of us was drinking to excess or taking drugs, the rest of us would potentially know.  There would be observable physical signs.  That is a big difference.</p> <p>  In addition, as I mentioned, when a person seeks help it is not always flagged as a person seeking help for gambling.  We were asked earlier how we determine how many people are asking for help.  It is quite difficult to count because some people may be presenting for alcohol problems so that their insurance company will cover the treatment when really they have a gambling issue.  This is again quite a complex space.  There are a whole lot of things going on.  I see the Deputy's point about dividing them, but I can see how there is overlap.</p></speech>

That is more the question I was asking.  It is about the legislators' response.</p></speech>

Age verification is a very tricky area.  It is desirable but difficult to implement in practice.  It is vitally important.  Does Dr. Fulton have a view on the existing policies of the big online bookmakers?  Does she have a view as to how age verification might be best achieved or as to how the process can be improved?</p></speech>

I do not consider myself an expert on how it should be put together.  It is another complex area.  It involves looking at the technology but also at how to get around it.  People in my study commented that it is not difficult to get around certain things that are in place.  It is a space to watch.  I know that it is possible to circumvent some systems.</p></speech>

The first is on a related area.  It is about restricting access, particularly online.  I touched on this in my previous contribution.  There are policies but they can be weak.  There are ways around them.  Should there be a uniform sort of exclusion that carries right across several companies?  I am not sure how that would be managed technologically.  If people have been identified as having difficult patterns, should there be a way in which they could either exclude themselves or be excluded from the various companies right across the board?  Can that be explored?  What is Dr. Fulton's view based on her experience of the major bookmakers?</p> <p>  I have doubts as to whether these companies are using all of the information available to them.  One can contrast how bookmakers deal with people who lose vast sums online or in person and how they deal with people who have placed four or five bets, made a small sum of money, made some profit, and beat the odds, many examples of which can be found online.  I do not mean to cast any of these people as folk heroes or as virtuous, but there is a contrast between the lengths to which some bookmakers will go to ensure their profits are preserved and to reduce the ability of people to make money and the lack of restriction on people who lose vast sums of money and display very problematic patterns and behaviours.  Does Dr. Fulton believe that the gambling companies are using all of the information at their disposal to ensure that people do not develop problematic behaviours?</p></speech>

I do not know exactly what information is at the disposal of the companies and I am not able to comment on what they are using.  I will say that participants talked about self-exclusion and the problems with it.  A person might self-exclude from one company and then place a sneaky bet somewhere else.</p><p>I may be excluded with one company but not with another.  There was this kind of blanket exclusion.  It becomes a tricky space as to how one achieves this across venues for an individual who has a very serious problem, the handling of which needs in-depth exploration.</p></speech>

Is that an area that Dr. Fulton believes needs legislative restriction?  I welcome that the GAA has voluntarily introduced a ban on gambling companies sponsoring teams.  Does she believe that there is a need for restrictions on gambling firms for that kind of advertisement of sport teams?</p></speech>

Advertising is something that needs to protect the vulnerable and children especially.  There is a lot that legislation can do to protect children in the same way that children will be protected in other venues.  It is possible to do this.</p></speech>

I had some younger people across age groups among my participants, 18 years of age or older.  They could speak of their gambling before they were 18 years of age.  They were at a very tender age, from 18 to 21, and in recovery.  They would say that there needs to be more regulation around what the Deputy is talking about.  The problem with gambling is that it does not always work the way we think it will.  It can take a long time to develop a problem.  Online gambling can accelerate that development because it draws a person in more quickly, and one can play immediately and for a lot longer.  There is no closing of the doors and being told to go home.  The process of addiction can vary.</p></speech>
