No apologies have been received.  In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, I ask that all those in attendance wear face coverings if not engaging with the committee.  The service requests people to continue to wear face coverings when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others and to be respectful of other people&rsquo;s physical space.  I ask people to adhere to any other public health advice.</p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of the Parliament.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.</p> <p>  This morning we will engage with officials from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  The meeting will be suspended for an hour at 12.30 p.m.  When we resume at 1.30 p.m., we will engage with the Policing Authority to examine the appropriation account for Vote 41 for 2020.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room this morning by the following officials from GSOC: Mr. Justice Rory MacCabe, chairperson; Mr. Hugh Hume, commissioner; Ms Emily Logan, commissioner, who has been here many times previously in a different role; and Ms Aileen Healy, director of administration.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask those who are attending remotely to put their microphones on mute when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty, as Cathaoirleach, to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  Mr. Justice MacCabe is very welcome.  As detailed in the letter of invitation, he will have five minutes for his opening statement.  Lean ar aghaidh.</p></speech>

As members are aware, the main functions of the commission are to investigate complaints concerning Garda conduct and incidents where it appears that Garda conduct may have resulted in death or serious harm to a person.  The commission can also investigate matters relating to Garda conduct when it is in the public interest, even if a complaint has not been received.</p> <p>  The Commission is structured as a non-commercial State body.  The commission prepares accruals-based annual financial statements.  These are presented together with a governance statement and statement on internal control, as required under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The commission operates under the aegis of the Department for Justice and its income is derived from the justice Vote.  The commission&rsquo;s income in 2020 was &euro;11.3 million, while its expenditure was slightly higher at &euro;11.4 million.  Two thirds of the expenditure relates to staff costs and the commission had 127 employees at the end of 2020.</p><p>The bulk of the other expenditure comprises almost &euro;1.7 million related to rent, upkeep and overheads of premises, and &euro;1.4 million in general expenses, much of which relates to information technology costs.  I am glad to report that I issued a clear audit opinion on the 2020 financial statements.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justice Rory MacCabe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.  This is the first occasion that GSOC has had the opportunity to address this committee.  I am accompanied by Hugh Hume and Emily Logan, commissioners., and Ms Aileen Healy, GSOC&rsquo;s director of administration.  There are additional members of the staff of GSOC also in attendance as observers.  Commissioner Hume has a background in policing at a senior level in the Police Service of Norther Ireland, PSNI, and also served as deputy chief inspector in the Garda Inspectorate.  Commissioner Logan was Ireland&rsquo;s first Ombudsman for Children and also served as the first Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.</p> <p>  GSOC was established under the 2005 Act and commenced operations in 2007 to provide independent oversight of policing in Ireland.  It is a vital interface between the people and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Our work is challenging and results depend on the skill and dedication of our staff, each of whom carries a heavy caseload.</p> <p>  GSOC operates seven days a week and 24 hours a day.  We deal with complaints from the public concerning the conduct of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether criminal or disciplinary.  We conduct investigations into matters referred to us by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Minister for Justice and the Policing Authority, as well as into matters we judge to be in the public interest to investigate.  We make recommendations arising from the results of our investigations.  We do not conduct prosecutions, which are a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, nor do we or impose or enforce disciplinary sanctions, which are for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, following the recommendations we make.</p> <p>  GSOC&rsquo;s budget allocation for 2021 was &euro;11.272 million.  This paid the salaries and covered the normal day-to-day running costs of the organisation.  We have a staff of 135 at present.  Our headquarters are in Dublin and we have offices in Cork and Longford.  In the course of the year, GSOC sought and received an additional allocation of &euro;300,000 to cover unanticipated additional costs relating to a number of particularly complex investigations that require intensive and extensive resources.</p> <p>  There has been a notable increase in the volume and complexity of our cases year on year.  In 2021, there was a 12 % increase in complaints received and a 40% increase in statutory referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where death or serious injury occurred.  It is to the credit of the staff that last year saw a 21% increase in the number of cases that were closed, even in the face of the pandemic, the increase in complaints and referrals, and the loss of some key personnel.</p> <p>  By their very nature, some investigations are straightforward and others are not.  Some can be dealt with quickly and others require a commitment in terms of staff, resources and time that we know can be frustrating for all concerned.  This is understandable from the point of view of complainants, who are anxious as to the outcome, and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na whose careers can be, in effect, on the line.</p> <p>  GSOC is bound by the principle of due process and human rights legislation.  These apply to complainants and those we investigate so we cannot and should not prioritise speed at the expense of rigour in completing our investigations.</p> <p>  Some of the challenges we face arise from the mandate under which we operate.  This is likely to change by dint of the broad reforms proposed in the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill.  Another related challenge is resourcing.  When I came to this job in January, I took the opportunity to be briefed on staffing, resources and on the details of all cases so that I could be sure that cases were being given proper priority.  We have engaged with our teams in Dublin, Longford and Cork.  As a commission, we took the opportunity to visit our teams on the ground in Longford and Cork.  It was apparent that our staffing complement, particularly our complement of investigative staff, falls well short of what is required.  High caseloads and staff turnover, including loss of experienced staff due to retirement or normal civil service mobility, have made this worse.</p> <p>  We secured additional funding in 2022 and this will allow us to recruit some additional staff.  I sought immediate approval to recruit 22 additional staff and this was granted by the Department of Justice without hesitation.  Recruitment is, however, not a fast process, particularly with such a range of regulatory organisations fishing in the same pool as we do.  All our staff require special skills to investigate and analyse complaints of negligence or wrongdoing.  </p> <p>  The Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill proposes sweeping changes in the law and will change the composition and mandate of GSOC.  The commission will have additional powers and functions, which will, by definition, involve more work and more staff if that work is to be carried out properly.  It is my belief that the Department and the Minister are alert to the ongoing resource issues faced by GSOC and will support us.  We welcome this draft legislation.  It fills a clearly defined and long-signalled gap in Ireland&rsquo;s policing accountability.</p> <p>  My responsibility, working with my commission colleagues and staff, is to oversee the work of GSOC and the transition to whatever new organisational structure is mandated by the committee members and their Oireachtas colleagues.  I hope that when they do this, they will be mindful that nothing as complex as investigating wrongdoing in the modern world we inhabit comes cheap.  I hope the committee also recognises the service the staff give and the importance of the work they do.</p></speech>

I ask from the point of view of a member of the public's concern.  Maybe there is no need for concern, but I am just asking the question.  Is it the case that garda&iacute; are given a complaint and go off and investigate it but they are unsupervised by anybody?  Is it they who look into the cases individually and make decisions?  Is that how it works?</p></speech>

When those 1,332 complaints are admitted, we make a number of determinations as to what happens with each complaint.  The first thing we do is look for criminality.  GSOC retains any allegation of a criminal nature.  Such allegations are never passed on to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate.  There were about 557 such allegations last year.  We retain and investigate those through to their completion.</p></speech>

That is a lower level complaint, perhaps failure to investigate a road traffic collision with no aggravating factors.  We send that to the Garda Commissioner to appoint a Garda senior investigating officer, SIO.  The Garda SIO is required to conclude his or her investigation within 16 to 20 weeks.  SIOs are at superintendent level and are required to conduct investigations of matters that have been presented to them and to make determinations.  They report back to GSOC on their findings, and the complainant then has an option to have that determination or the investigation reviewed by us.  The Garda superintendent will then make a decision as to what sort of discipline, if any, is required.</p></speech>

At the week ending 3 April 2022, there were 354 unsupervised investigations within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and 73 supervised investigations.  At this stage we are not in a position to say definitively what impact that has had in terms of a delay because the SIOs have 16 to 20 weeks to investigate.  Forty Garda SIOs have written to say they were unable to progress cases due to the dispute.  We can say definitively that 77 unsupervised investigations and four supervised investigations were affected.  However, we do not know the impact of any delay because we were not contacted in every case by the Garda SIOs to understand the delays.  It will not be until these cases work through the system that we will be able to identify that delay.</p></speech>

We did not and do not see ourselves as party to that dispute.  In answer to the Deputy's question as to whether staff work on call, as a relatively new commissioner I would say the organisation is a very dynamic one.  Our investigators do not sit beside a desk or at a desk where they do their work.  They are a very active group of people.  The legislative framework to which they operate is our Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Regarding Commissioner Hume's comments on death, when there has been a fatality or serious harm, a group of our investigation teams go out and they are on call at any time, 24 hours a day.  In fact, some of our teams have been called out on five occasions in the space of one week.  They do everything from managing and preserving a scene and its forensic evidence to trying to support and interact with families who are distressed or traumatised.  It is not only the investigatory nature of what we do that is important but the pieces around that too.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's original question about the public perception of GSOC, we are very sensitive to the current legislation and the perceived question as to who is carrying out investigations in the organisation.  What I will say, as somebody who was an ombudsman for 12 years, is that the dynamic in GSOC is quite different.  When we get to the final phase of an investigation, the commission actively participates in the direction an investigation takes.</p><p>We are not sitting in some ivory tower but have very close proximity to the investigation teams.  We are regularly briefed in our supervision of what is going on.  We also have policies which recognise, both for ourselves and for our investigation staff, that there may be an occasion when any of us might have a conflict of interest.  We have policies to support our staff in making those decisions and we ourselves make decisions where it may not be appropriate, with reference to the Deputy's earlier question, for people who may have a policing background in this jurisdiction, to be involved in certain investigations.  That is given very significant consideration.  The Deputy's question about the public is something that is constantly on our minds.</p></speech>

There are many moving parts in some of the scrutiny of this and it can be difficult to understand the pathway that we are following here.

We saw a large increase in the number of queries handled but I am trying to understand this from the numbers provided to us.  The way that the information was delivered to us were those complaints that were determined to be admissible or inadmissible and criminal investigations opened.  It is hard for me, however, to glean from that 2021 number of 4,615 how many of those have led to a complaint being upheld and actioned or a prosecution.  Is that data available?</p></speech>

If the commission, having reviewed the investigation, decides that it may amount to a crime, we will send it then to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who may or may not decide to prosecute.  If that office decides to return the case to us having decided not to prosecute, because it is the Director of Public Prosecutions who prosecutes not GSOC, then we may make a decision to go on to investigate that as a discipline matter.  That is part of the convoluted legislation under which we currently operate.  That can-----</p></speech>

First is the pathway of the complaints and the legislation will simplify that.  We have to make a decision when a complaint comes in on whether it is a civil or a criminal matter.  Let us take, for instance, Mr. Hume's comments on a criminal matter.  We undertake an investigation, we make a decision as a commission and it goes to the DPP.  The DPP returns it to us, we have to wait for that decision about whether to prosecute and only then can we sequence a disciplinary investigation if it is required.  The Deputy can see how extended that pathway and investigation are.  The new legislation allows us to examine and make that decision at a different stage.  It means that people on the receiving end of it, who are members of the Garda, are not in a situation where they are immediately under criminal investigation, which is significant.  The second difference is in search warrants.</p></speech>

That is an internal matter within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to superintendents' pay, which as we mentioned, we are not at liberty to discuss.</p><p>We were informed that a number of the discipline investigations were unsupervised and were not being progressed as a result of that issue.  These are only unsupervised investigations.  No criminal investigations were passed to Garda investigations.  This issue was dealt with solely within GSOC.  At that time there were 285 unsupervised investigations and 109 supervised disciplinary investigations in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A total of 40 Garda superintendents contacted us to say they were unable to progress cases due to the dispute.  We know of 77 unsupervised cases and four supervised cases that were delayed.  We do not have the full picture because not everyone contacted us.  We are now working our way through that system.</p></speech>

We had to place a notice on our webpage.  It will have an effect on the reputation of GSOC.  It will undermine the confidence of the complainants who are potentially being told their investigations have been delayed.  We cannot tell at this stage what the actual outworking is of the delay in investigations.

A case that stands out for me and on which we get queries from time to time is that of George Nkencho.  People ask us what the timeline is.  This is the type of case that is in the public domain.

The time is determined by the circumstances we find.  In many cases, we deal with issues very quickly.  When the Garda Commissioner informs us, through a superintendent, that there has been death or serious harm and he believes a garda's conduct is likely to have been a factor, the Act requires that we "shall" ensure those cases are investigated.  In all 59 cases, there was an investigation.</p> <p>  The first thing we do, in what is called a section 91 investigation, is to examine the circumstances of the case.  We may get a referral from the Garda stating someone had died or been injured as a result of actions by garda&iacute;.  We may quickly find there is no criminal or disciplinary issue and we can resolve the situation within a matter of days.  In one case outlined in our report, garda&iacute; interacted with a man who was intoxicated.  They decided to keep an eye on him.  He went around a corner.  They followed and found he had fallen and hurt himself badly.  The case was referred to us.  We were quickly able to establish there was no fault on the part of the garda&iacute; &ndash; in fact, they had probably saved his life &ndash; and we were able to close that case down quickly.  Such cases are at one end of the spectrum, but there is a full range and, unfortunately, some take a long time because of their gravity and the criminal allegations involved.  I cannot give the Deputy a median time.  Some are dealt with very quickly but, unfortunately, others take a long time.</p></speech>

We have a remit over value for money and ensuring adequate expenditure of the public moneys allocated to our guests' organisation.  It goes beyond general checks and balances and, as Deputy Murphy alluded to, involves a consideration of the length of time investigations take and the results that follow on from them.  We cannot do that without reflecting on some of GSOC's previous investigations.  The investigation I am a little familiar with is the one that occurred subsequent to the death of Shane O'Farrell.  If I understand it correctly, there were two different investigations.  What was the distinction between how they operated?</p></speech>

At that point, GSOC brought them all under one umbrella and conducted a criminal investigation in respect of 56 separate allegations that had been made.  Those 56 allegations were investigated and a determination was made that there was no case of criminality.  There was then a disciplinary investigation, to which my colleague, Ms Logan, has alluded.  That is a process we currently have to go through where we have to reset and start looking at the case again with a view to potential disciplinary matters.  That disciplinary investigation examined 13 separate allegations and a recommendation was sent to the Garda Commissioner, who I believe took some action on the matter.</p></speech>

That is effectively a further hurdle that has appeared on this particular long road.  The Deputy would have to address his query to Judge Haughton and his inquiry in that regard.</p></speech>

GSOC carried out the investigations.  GSOC concluded two reports.  In respect of the section 101 report, the family have received summaries, not the full report.  My understanding is that the same is the case for the section 97 report.  These are reports in GSOC's possession.  Whatever Judge Haughton is doing in relation to his scoping inquiry, he needs to be let do that but that does not prevent GSOC from providing those reports to the family.  In fact, the Garda Commissioner is on the record as saying that these reports have been compiled by GSOC and that publication relates to Mr. Justice MacCabe's organisation alone.  My question is, will GSOC provide those reports to the family considering they are the instigators?  As Mr. Hume correctly said, they are the most important part of this procedure.</p> <p>  Following this case, I am aware of some of the details and most of the revelations about the fact that the person who killed Shane should have been imprisoned at the time, had been in breach of multiple bail conditions, and had received a custodial sentence that was never pursued and that he never served.  While he was supposed to be signing on at a Garda station on a daily basis for a period of that time, he was in custody north of the Border.  It is a litany of failures.  The real answers and the causation of all of those failures have never been revealed.  GSOC, the organisation that one would have hoped would have been part of finding those answers, instead was subjugated to a significant delay during which time every other actor in this process refused to answer questions.  The then Minister for Justice and Equality, the then Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda, the DPP and the Courts Service - everybody who was responsible for failures in this case - stated for almost eight years that they could not answer questions because GSOC was carrying out an investigation.  Now GSOC is coming in here and stating that it cannot provide information because there is a scoping inquiry taking place.  My question is, when the scoping inquiry is concluded what will be the excuse for refusing to provide this family with answers as to why their son was killed by a man who should have been imprisoned at the time?</p></speech>

In general, the delay in GSOC's ability to investigate often has a compounding impact on people who perceive that they are victims.  In some cases, it will be proved that they were victims.  It is hard to say but sometimes people would say that the delay in GSOC is a harder hit than the original incident because they have already been let down by one section of the State and the body responsible for ensuring that that does not happen also lets them down by virtue of the length of the delay.  Does GSOC appreciate the impact that has?  Is this down to resources?  Is this something that we should be going to Ministers about and saying that they need to be giving GSOC more resources?</p></speech>

It is hard to accept the view that it is unacceptable to have these delays without seeing GSOC respond and say it needs X number of staff.

It must be very frustrating not to get an answer, but I can give an example of the reality of the situation.  We have a vacancy in a senior position in the organisation since last September.  The recruitment process began as soon as that vacancy arose and it will not be possible to fill that until the end of next month.  One is looking at a nine-month delay in recruiting one person.  The regulatory business in Ireland in both the public sector and private sector has blossomed or exploded, as it were, over the past few years.  When we are looking for investigative staff because those are the crucial people - they are not the only people, but they are the crucial people - we are looking for expertise in a very limited pool, and other people are fishing in this pool.  To be perfectly honest, we cannot compete with the private sector.</p></speech>

When the witnesses are before the committee again and if there are similar delays, it will be harder to accept their response if they have not made a clear request to the Minister, the Department and the system.  I will leave it at that.</p> <p>  I am anxious to talk about children, cases GSOC deals with that involve those under 18 years of age.  I am anxious because any type of attack or assault on a child is utterly unacceptable in society, and for it to be perpetrated by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is particularly unacceptable.  First, is there a specific policy or piece of work GSOC has done which includes assaults by members of the Garda on children?  Second, are there different procedures for dealing with children in investigation cases?  Third, I have heard some reports that children who are making a complaint are questioned with no advocate present.  There is no member of their family or no solicitor, yet the person about whom the complaint is being made would obviously have somebody there.  For a young person under 18 years of age, I would imagine that it is very intimidating to be alone in that situation and I would be surprised if that is a procedure GSOC has for a complainant.  Perhaps it might be different for somebody who is the subject of abuse or in that area, but this is a complainant about an assault.  This relates to children and I apologise that the witnesses have only three minutes to reply.</p></speech>

At 7.30 every morning we get a list of all the complaints that have come in.  We have a dedicated team monitoring every complaint that comes in so we immediately pick up any case that relates to anybody under 18 years of age.  We investigate and we have special procedures for interviewing children.  Only staff with a certain level of specialist skills can interview children.  Our general policy is to interview children with an advocate.  Most often in the complaints, children are either victims or are witnesses to a crime.  Most often those complaints are made by their parents, and occasionally they are made by a third party.  Occasionally we have children who are in the care system, and that is where things get a little more complicated.  They may not be-----</p></speech>

To be clear, in the context of a section 2 or section 3 assault when a young person has been assaulted, it is very important, and Mr. Justice MacCabe made the point earlier, that the rigour of our investigation will stand up in court.  If we are going to do our job properly, the investigation must be rigorous.  We must be able to withstand the questioning from a defence lawyer in a court, so anything that we do must have that rigour.  If we have the internal capacity and our investigators have that level of expertise, that is our preference.  On the occasion when it does not happen, yes, there are garda&iacute; there.

A total of 658 disciplinary investigations were opened in 2019 while 752 were opened in 2021.  GSOC corresponded with the committee last year and sent us figures for 2020 last July.  If we look at the criminal investigations, we can see that 557 were opened.  The total figure for criminal and disciplinary investigations is 1,309.  This is heading for 10% of the workforce.  If we remove senior management, who would be desk-bound, we are probably looking at a figure way in excess of one in ten of people working in the service. I presume those figures are accurate.</p></speech>

Are there any such figures for the 572 in 2020?  When I saw the figure of 572 last July after GSOC sent us that letter, I was really taken aback.  The figure flattened off last year at 557 but given the fact that 557 criminal investigations and 752 disciplinary investigations were opened in 2021, we can see 1,309 Garda officers are under criminal or disciplinary investigation.  That took me by surprise.  Regarding criminal investigations in 2019 and 2020, the figure for 2019 is 485 while the figure for 2020 is 572.  How many involved prosecutions?</p></speech>

The commission met with them the other day.  They are a very engaged and caring bunch.  They received all these 2,189 complaints.  Last year, they decided that 1,332 were active complaints.  The first thing they look at is whether it is a crime.  Is there evidence of a crime?  Has a member of the public said a Garda hit him or her?  Has he or said that a Garda has stolen money from him or her?  Is there a crime in the allegation?  They send that to our senior management team composed of our deputy director and director.

That is good.  I do not expect the witnesses from GSOC to comment on the Garda dispute because it is outside their remit but in terms of its effect on the work of GSOC, on 20 March 2022, a total of 355 cases were referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - this is from GSOC's briefing - under section 94(1), that is, unsupervised.  There were 73 relating to section 94(5), that is, supervised.  When the dispute commenced in July 2021, the figures stood at 285 and 109, respectively.  A member asked about the effects of that dispute.  If matters were held up from July 2021 until February 2022, that is a delay of seven months so there is a delay at the start of it.  In terms of cases held up, if GSOC calculates the figures it has, adding 355 cases to the 73 that were referred to supervised investigations gives a total of 428.  As of March 2022, the cases stand at 285.

GSOC is very much dependent on the co-operation of the Garda.  I do not want to go back into the case because the GSOC representatives went through it at length with Deputy Carthy, but because GSOC depends on that level of co-operation and assistance from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it would seem that it is possible in some cases for the hands of its staff to be tied.  In other words, Commissioner Hume used the term on a number of occasions that something was &ldquo;beyond our control&rdquo;.  Due to the fact that the people involved in a lot of this are one reach away, they could actually hold GSOC staff up and tie their hands if they were minded to do so.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

Shortly after I came in, I had a one-to-one meeting with the Commissioner.  I found him open and candid.  In addition, the commission had a meeting with senior officers, including Deputy Commissioner Coxon.  The sense I have is that there is an anxiety that there should be co-operation.  There is a cultural change happening within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that is being driven by the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner Coxon.  We have a shared interest in that.  Certainly, Commissioner Harris indicated to me that he would welcome regular meetings on a one-to-one basis between the two of us, as well as regular contact.  I would like to think that will clarify issues and perhaps deliver a message to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it is in everybody&rsquo;s interests that there should be co-operation.</p></speech>

I take it from what he has said about cultural change that until reasonably recently - perhaps two or three years ago - there were difficulties getting that level of co-operation.  Most observers would concur with his suggestion that a cultural shift is happening.  Perhaps up to the fairly recent past, there would have been many difficulties.</p></speech>

It was outlined earlier that the Commissioner has described the new proposals as "draconian", but Mr. Justice MacCabe disagrees with that.  Would he say that all of the powers proposed in the new Bill are necessary for GSOC to be able to function properly and more?  There may even be amendments required.</p></speech>

I have a few questions.  According to the briefing note, there is a case management system.  I assume it is possible to capture how long it takes to conduct investigations and GSOC would be able give an analysis.  It is absolutely essential that this is the case in order that it can properly estimate what its needs will be.  Is that case management system sufficient to do that work?  Is GSOC happy with the case management system that it has or does it need augmentation?</p></speech>

The kinds of questions that we have been asked today cannot be elicited from the current system that we have.  As part of our transition, the project we talked about starting last year, one of the big things that we will be doing is investing time, effort and money into a new system.  We are talking to sister organisations about how best to do that.  That includes everything from equity of access up to some of the more complicated questions about cases, prosecution, disciplinary cases and all of the questions that we have been asked today.  It is fair and frank to say that we are not getting the definitive information that we need from the existing system and we need a new system.</p></speech>

It might be something we have been made aware of, such as through social media.  In theory, we might see an incident that is of significant public interest and that we feel warrants investigation, or it might be something that comes into us as part of a complaint and, although the individual is not complaining about it, when we identify it, we feel it is something where we would wish to open an investigation.</p></speech>

I am not sure the public fully understands.  We have the same problem here in the Committee of Public Accounts, whereby people may believe that if an issue does not fit somewhere else, they can send a letter to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Sometimes it is more about public accountability than public accounts.  In the context of understanding GSOC's role and the public understanding of the role, I see, for example, that 855 complaints were determined as inadmissible.  In many cases that may well be people inappropriately directing complaints to the commission rather than being vexatious complaints.</p></speech>

A Garda superintendent may contact us and say he or she wants to bring something to our attention, for example, some very bad behaviour where a prisoner has been assaulted by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The prisoner has not made a complaint and the prisoner has not suffered death or serious harm.  At that moment, we would have no investigation, but under section 102(4) there may be CCTV from the station or there may be another Garda who would make a statement.  We could then open that investigation without a complaint and say it is clearly wrong where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assaults somebody.  That is a very generic example for the Deputy.  When it comes to our attention, either from the Garda, from social media or from some other format, where we see clear and blatant wrongdoing but there is no complaint from a member of the public and there is no death or serious harm, then we would use the section 102(4) prerogative to open an investigation.</p></speech>

I welcome the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission before the Committee of Public Accounts today.  I want to develop a better understanding of the work they all do.  Obviously, GSOC is a statutory independent body that is charged with overseeing the Garda, but when it comes to dealing with complaints, does GSOC have any capacity to investigate activity within the Garda on its own suspicion or information that something may be going on within the organisation that is worrying?  Does it always have to be as a consequence of a report from members of the public?  I open this question to either of the commissioners, Ms Hogan or Mr. Hume.</p></speech>

This may come about.  We have spoken about protected disclosures and we have the powers to open investigations under the protected disclosure legislation also.  Even where a member of the public has not contacted us, we may receive information from Garda management, Garda members or other sources and we may open a complaint in the public interest if we believe it is warranted.</p></speech>

When it comes to the costings of undertaking the work GSOC is supposed to be doing, is there an issue of parity when it comes to that?  Looking at the charts available to the Committee of Public Accounts, a very significant portion, which is well over 60% of resources, is spent on staffing.  Does this include the legal costs of the work it is undertaking?</p></speech>

That is the people who, day to day, outside of hours, go to fatal traffic collisions, do the interviews, receive the calls inside the building, and supporting us through legal and corporate services.

This would relate to engaging external counsel, in addition.  That figure was for 2020.  Expenditure for 2021 was closer to &euro;90,000 or &euro;100,000.  It changes from year to year.</p></speech>

Those numbers sound quite low.  I am not being overly critical.  The commission has its own in-house legal team.  From an external point of view, however, 127 staff sounds a small complement for an organisation that is charged with oversight of the Garda.</p> <p>  The Garda Commissioner was before the committee last week and a number of important issues were raised with him.  Respecting the separation between the Garda and GSOC arose.  "Without referring to any specific case, there is a degree of concern about the culture of leaking within the Garda.  There seem to be a consistent issue with leaking within the organisation.  What work has GSOC undertaken to try to bring about reform and change in order to deal with that issue?  It is causing concern for GSOC.  There are a number of investigations under way.  I am not asking our guests to comment on those cases but I am asking them to comment on the culture of leaking confidential information, relating particularly to PULSE files.  Is GSOC doing anything to actively shut that down and maintain people's data privacy?</p></speech>

There are ongoing investigations in that regard.  We have in the past made recommendations of criminal and disciplinary consequences for the misuse of such information.  Systemic recommendations have also been made to the Garda Commissioner around the access of information on PULSE.  A number of other bodies have conducted reviews of the Garda and identified the ways in which the PULSE system has failed to be an effective management system.  The Garda Commissioner has accepted a recommendation to change certain aspects of PULSE to allow for a more proactive capability to monitor leaks.  Work is ongoing to procure such a system.</p></speech>

Many of the cases undertaken by GSOC are extremely controversial.  Is there anything that can be done to address the length of time it takes to investigate controversial cases?  An investigation in Templemore has been going on for five years, which is an awfully long period.  It is difficult to understand why that has taken such a long time.  Are there, in general within the organisation, resourcing issues?  Is there a shortage of legal personnel to do that work?  The primary question I asked earlier related to budgeting for legal costs and external assistance.  Is that something that needs to be worked on within the organisation?</p></speech>

We must look at both those issues in determining how to allocate staff.  At the moment, we have a fixed number of case workers and investigators.  We have sanction to recruit an extra 22 staff.  An investigation begins once the case is admitted for investigation and resources are then allocated.  Some investigations take wing and others do not.  Some can be resolved relatively easily although they still consume time and resources.  Some cases are like peeling an onion.  When you peel off one level of skin off, there is another level beyond it.  It is probably a truism to say that members of the Garda who are being investigate are well resourced and familiar with the system.  They are better resourced than the people who would ordinarily be investigated by the Garda.  They are aware of the rights to which they are entitled.  We must respect due process.</p></speech>

It is uppermost in all of our considerations.  How much of a backlog of investigations has GSOC at the moment?  Is there an issue in terms of investigations that have been held up?</p></speech>

Our staff are entitled to be mobile within the overall operation.  It is often difficult to replace the key members of staff we lose.  People who are recruited do not become effective until they have been properly trained.  I have already dealt with the difficulty in recruiting people who are trained.</p></speech>

On the issue of mobility, and on a positive note, the people we are losing are in the main being promoted.  That is a sign of the expertise within the organisation and the quality of the staff we have.  The people we are losing are not generally disenfranchised.  The majority are going because they are being promoted out of the organisation.  That is not good for us.</p></speech>

Our guests have outlined that they welcome the Bill because it will help GSOC to be more independent and will strengthen the organisation.  At the moment, what one power that it does not have and which it most needs to be able to do its job will GSOC have if the Bill, as it is drafted, passes?  Are there one or two such issues on which our guests could put their fingers?</p></speech>

We have already made that submission to the Joint Committee on Justice.  We are generally happy with the Bill.  We have certain reservations about two particular matters that I raised with the Minister some time ago.  One of those relates to search warrants.  We believe it would be more appropriate that search warrants would be issued under judicial oversight rather than by a member of the commission.  There is also a proposal in the Bill that GSOC would have the power to review its own decisions, and I believe that proposal should be reconsidered because it may prove vulnerable to challenge on the basis that an organisation should not be reviewing its own decisions.  That is a complaint that has been made in the context of a perception that garda&iacute; should not be investigating garda&iacute;.  It is the same situation, as far as we are concerned.</p></speech>

In those circumstances we have clear protocols around ensuring the court with jurisdiction over the matter has all information, whether it is sitting in GSOC or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We exchange information regularly to ensure we both know what stage we are at in an investigation.</p></speech>

We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the organisation: Ms Helen Hall, chief executive; Ms Margaret Tumelty, director; and Mr. Cormac Keating, director.  They are all very welcome.  As usual, I remind those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are either on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, for the benefit of this afternoon&rsquo;s witnesses, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference they may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are again reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The primary role of the authority is to oversee the performance by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its functions relating to policing services.  The authority comprises a chairperson and eight members, who are supported by a staff that numbered 36 whole-time equivalents at the end of 2020.</p> <p>  The Policing Authority functions as one of the central Government offices, funded directly by the Oireachtas through its own Vote.  The chief executive, who is not a member of the authority, is responsible for the presentation of the annual cash-based appropriation account, which records the financial transactions associated with the authority&rsquo;s activity.  The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 41 recorded gross expenditure of &euro;2.8 million.  This was almost identical to the gross expenditure in 2019.  Almost 75% of the expenditure was related to payment of salaries, wages and allowances, which totalled &euro;2.1 million in 2020.</p> <p>  All of the Policing Authority&rsquo;s expenditure is classified as administration expenditure, presented under standard subheads used across the Votes.  At the end of the year, the amount of the budget provided that remained unspent was &euro;615,000.  This full amount was liable for surrender.  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account.</p></speech>

The Policing Authority is an independent agency established by the enactment of the 2015 Act and we commenced functions on 1 January 2016.  Our key role is to oversee the performance by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its functions relating to policing services.  The oversight approach of the nine-member Policing Authority, supported by the executive, prioritises meaningful engagement with the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda personnel through regular public and private meetings as well as a comprehensive programme of fieldwork and stakeholder engagement.  They all inform policing performance oversight across a wide range of themes.</p> <p>  Our net estimate provision in 2020 was &euro;3.3 million and a net surplus of just more than &euro;615,000 was returned.  Having conducted his annual audit, the Comptroller and Auditor General issued a clear audit certificate in respect of our 2020 appropriation account, with no findings or recommendations issued in respect of that year.  The year 2020 brought challenges that no one could have foreseen.  The authority recognised early in the pandemic that policing and its oversight held huge importance during this time of increased Garda powers, and it responded with agility to the Covid-19 crisis.  It was a very full and demanding year with more authority meetings than ever before, 63 senior Garda appointments, and a programme of oversight work engagement to inform oversight across a range of topics, including anti-corruption, the adult cautioning scheme, the Garda review of DNA samples, and the policing of children and youth.  Members will find a one-page overview of our work and achievements for that year in their briefing pack.</p> <p>  At the request of the Minister for Justice in April 2020, the authority embarked on what would be a series of 16 reports published across 2020 and 2021 on policing during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Since we recognised that the proportionate use of powers through the graduated approach adopted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was very important for public confidence, the authority&rsquo;s executive attended at checkpoints and met with community organisations, NGOs and statutory organisations throughout 2020 to listen to the lived experience of policing during Covid from those being policed, as well as from Garda members.  This informed our engagement with the Commissioner and senior management, which continually emphasised the need for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respect the human rights of those it was policing, while exercising the new powers afforded to it during the emergency.</p> <p>  It is the authority&rsquo;s position that restrictions to our rights must be shown to be necessary, legal, proportionate and non-discriminatory.  It is also important for public confidence that the policing service is held to account for the use of these powers.  An ongoing challenge to the authority and to the Commissioner is knowing whether policing during Covid or at any time is non-discriminatory in the absence of information about the distribution of policing or, in other words, who is being policed.  For example, because ethnic indicators are not collected or recorded, one would not know whether members of a particular community were policed or restricted during Covid to a greater extent than others.  This requires legislative change and remains of continued relevance to our work.  The authority recognised the importance of this consistency and engaged continually with members of diverse communities to enrich our reporting to the Minister.  These 16 reports were considered by the Cabinet and provided information and, at times, assurance, as to the manner in which the Garda was using its increased powers.</p> <p>  In 2020, we saw the emergence of an issue concerning the inappropriate cancellation of 999 calls.  The independent report to the authority from phase 1 of this work was published in November 2021 and we are currently overseeing the implementation of the recommendations arising.  Phase 2 is currently planned and is intended to take place in late May.  It continues to be dealt with as a high priority matter for the authority and provides an example to the committee of how the authority&rsquo;s proactive oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has brought transparency to an issue that is crucial to public confidence in the policing service.  It stands along other critical issues we have dealt with that have arisen in the lifetime of the authority, such as mandatory intoxicant or alcohol tests, commonly known as breath tests, fixed charge notices, governance in the Garda training college in Templemore, youth diversion, and the review of homicide investigations.</p> <p>  The 2015 legislation that established the authority was intended to make a difference.  We believe that it has, in that it has created a public, independent, external oversight arrangement for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where none had ever existed before.  The legislation also sought to, and did, create an appropriate distance between politics and policing through the creation of a greater structural distance between the Department of Justice and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>In 2018, the Government published A Policing Service for our Future and the Department of Justice is currently drafting legislation to implement that report.  Under this plan, the existing Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate will come together to form a new body, the policing and community safety authority, in the coming years.  We welcome this development.  It is our intention to work to ensure that any changes in our functions brought about by this new legislation will not in any way diminish the robust public, independent, external oversight that has been provided by the authority to date and which the Oireachtas saw fit to establish in 2015.  We have identified some potential risks in the new legislation that may slow and inhibit, rather than support and encourage, the programme of change to which the authority and the Garda Commissioner are committed.  These have been shared with the Department of Justice to facilitate its further development of the legislation.  Until such time as the new policing and community safety authority is established, the Policing Authority&rsquo;s existing statutory functions will continue, along with policing performance oversight that is robust, proactive and independent. </p><p> In conclusion, I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, and his colleagues for the work that they do each year.  I also thank committee members for taking the time to listen to this opening statement.  We look forward to providing any further information that might facilitate the committee&rsquo;s consideration of the 2020 appropriation account. </p></speech>

Even with the 15 minutes, I have a lot of areas I would like to cover so I hope Ms Hall will excuse me if I cut across her every so often.  It is inevitable in these sessions.</p> <p>  I will begin with the issue of the computer-aided dispatch, CAD, incidents.  I am aware that the review process is not complete but, of the 2,316 incidents that have been reviewed for invalid closures, it was found that 134 crimes had not been recorded.  Is Ms Hall satisfied that this is a fair and reasonable reflection of the level of unrecorded crimes in the context of what we know about domestic violence, when you may be going back to people many days or weeks after an incident has occurred?  Is she satisfied that the figure of 134 represents a true reflection of the impact of those CAD calls?</p></speech>

The review looked at a certain period and the number of calls within that period was 1.4 million.  Of that number, 200,000 were cancelled.  As it was not possible to look at 200,000 cases, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rightly looked at the priority 1 calls or emergency calls as the top issue.  Emergency calls involve a threat to life and priority 1 calls involve other very serious threats of harm.  Things like domestic violence fall into that category.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na took the category of priority 1 and emergency calls as the first piece.  Within that, there were approximately 23,000 or 24,000 calls that needed to be looked at.  It then rated the calls for risk and looked into those 23,000.  Health calls, domestic violence calls and missing persons were taken.  These amounted to approximately 5,000 calls, which were then looked at.  Of that, it was found that approximately 3,000 were inappropriately cancelled, which represents quite a high percentage.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na then looked at those calls for further information and drilled down.  That is where the figure of 134 has come from.  To answer the Deputy's question, no, I am not satisfied.  There is more work to be done.  While the approach was appropriate, it involved looking at a subset of the 200,000 cancelled calls.  If you look at Mr. Penman's report, you will see that there are still unanswered questions and that, while we do not want to tie An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na up with looking into these 200,000 calls for the next ten years, we have to ask how much we have learned and focus on what will happen in the CAD call room tonight and in the future.  That must be the approach.  Having said that, there are still questions in my mind.  What about the other priority 1 calls?  What about looking at the other 175,000 priority 2 and priority 3 calls?  Are we sure they are classified properly?  You are never going to get to a point-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.439" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Hall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#AA00600"><p>Last year, the authority said it needed to get an independent expert to look at the process because we were not going to try to second-guess every single case.  We did that and, if you look at Mr. Penman's report that was published in November, you will see that he was satisfied with the process An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na undertook so, yes, the authority is satisfied that this might be the number of items that were not crimes.  Let us go back to the residual concern.  What are we concerned about here?  Of course, crimes may not have been recorded but the bigger concern and my personal worry, particularly in the context of domestic violence, is that, if something does not get into the system, that may have an impact on the ability to record on the system a risk against a woman who is potentially in danger.  It also means evidence is not being gathered for barring orders and so on.  That is not being built up.  There are other adverse impacts outside of crime not being recorded and prosecutions not getting across the line.</p> <p>  However, I will say that An Garda is very seized of this matter and that it is investing a lot of time in trying to remedy it.  We are dealing with 13 recommendations as part of phase 1.  We also had a concern about the tone of the responses given to people.  We hope that will be the next phase.  There has been a little bit of a legal difficulty in that.  We hope that will be resolved and that we can do that next phase towards the end of May.</p></speech>

I am now going to move onto another topic.  At the end of February 2022, there were 227 sworn members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the rank of superintendent or higher.  Of these, 38 were women while 189 of their counterparts were male.  The Policing Authority is responsible for carrying out selection competitions for the senior ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What efforts are being made to address that imbalance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.441" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Hall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#AA00800"><p>We carry out the appointment and selection processes for superintendents, chief superintendents and assistant commissioners and are part of the Public Appointment Service's process in respect of deputy commissioners and the Commissioner.  At the very senior ranks, women are reasonably well represented but we do have concerns, particularly with regard to the rank of superintendent.  You cannot force a decision but, looking at the statistics on our website, we have found that, when women do apply, they perform.  That is common to many organisations.  Women perform a lot better if they can be encouraged to put applications in.  That is the first step.  During the last competitions that were run, in 2021, we spoke to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about encouraging people to put their names forward.  However, there is a larger issue with regard to the culture of the organisation that needs a lot of work.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.443" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Hall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#AA01000"><p>Yes, you need to see it.  It is absolutely more difficult.  We have done a number of things.  I believe Deputy Commissioner Coxon was before the committee last week.  She and the acting director are looking at a gender strategy and have talked to the authority about that.  It is something that we and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are seized of.  We are not seeing results coming through yet but the situation has improved.  Some 28% to 30% of the entire service is female and the percentage at the senior level is even higher at 40%.  Is that good enough?  No, it is not good enough.  Correcting that will help to change the culture by increasing diversity.  It is not necessarily just about gender.  We have another concern about the wider situation.  While we do not run the competitions at the more junior level, we have a responsibility to oversee them.  I refer to the new Garda competition and promotion competitions for sergeants and inspectors.  We are constantly asking An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na what it is doing to encourage people from diverse communities to apply.  I refer to socioeconomic diversity as well.  It is not just about gender, although that is also a problem.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#AA01100"><p>That answers my question.  I am glad Ms Hall cited that issue.  I am a Deputy for an inner-city area and we have lots of new communities in Ireland.  It would be fantastic to see more diversity.</p></speech>

An interim programme was brought in this year.  Is it enough?  One of the things we often say, which is borne out if you look at the matter, is that the best way to encourage people to apply for a position in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to ensure their experience of the service as either a victim of crime or a potential suspect is positive.  One of the things we saw through our oversight role during the Covid pandemic was that young people, as a cohort, did not really experience the great improvement in policing.  We have brought this to the attention of the Commissioner.</p><p>Attention has to be given to how the service provided across the organisation to people who are young, that is. children and young people in their 20s.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#BB00200"><p>In my remaining time, I will move on to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform spending review and the key performance indicators, KPIs, in policing.  It is something that might not be especially exciting to talk about but it is incredibly influential in both decision-making and policy-making.  It would be helpful for the authority to set out what it considers when it sets annual policing priorities and performance targets for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will also bring data collection into that discussion.  Looking at the information before us, there has already been consideration of quantitative reviews or KPIs that are more about activity than outcomes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.448" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Hall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#BB00300"><p>Definitely.  I will also ask my colleague, Ms Tumelty, to speak on this in a moment.  Looking at spending first, the role of the Policing Authority in legislation is relatively limited in terms of the money given to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Our role is really just to advise the Minister annually.  We do not have a very strong role.  That said, we have nudged our way into trying to be more influential in that.  We have been pressing the Commissioner to cost the policing plan and say what can be done for the money.  It is difficult.  There are very few police services that do that sort of activity-based thing.  I do not think any do.</p> <p>  The second is clear from some of our performance reports, which we do twice a year.  We have found that historically there has been a real lack of investment in the management information system in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that would allow the Commissioner, or even the head of finance, head of HR or senior garda&iacute; to have at their fingertips knowledge of where people are and what the cost is of deciding to engage in a particular operation.  That is just not there.</p></speech>

My time is nearly up, and I want to hit on the data issue a little.  I think it overlaps with the KPIs perhaps, but I am trying to understand how and why we collect certain data.  I might submit a parliamentary question and the response that comes back is that the Department does not have that data or does not know the information.  I am wondering what the process is.  Who decides what we measure?  Is there a process in the Policing Authority, for example, where there is a new undertaking?  I will give an example.  Last year An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na formally established the organised prostitution unit.  Sex work in general is a matter that I am very interested in.  It would be interesting to have information regarding violence against sex workers.  It seems that data is very hard to get.  At what stage does the process kick in?  Who decides what we measure and how do you get things measured?  Does the authority have a role in saying that we need to have certain data?  I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Health.  Access to disaggregated data in health is also a major issue in this State.  Is it something that is on the Policing Authority's horizon?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.456" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Hall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#BB01100"><p>It is front and centre to what I would see as our role.  We approve the priorities each year.  We approve the policing plan.  Within policing plans there are quite specific performance indicators, some of which would require the collection of specific data.  We have a role there.  Every month, we receive reports from the Commissioner as part of our holding the organisation to account for the performance of those.</p> <p>  Returning to the specific question, all the data to which the Deputy refers would be housed within the PULSE system.  It would be a matter of getting the appropriate data fields in there.  That can take a little time but we have made a change in some of the requirements.  For example, hate crime has started to be recorded.  We are also demanding, and the Garda are very positive, things in the area of sexual assault.  There is a lot of data that can be gathered and we are pressing for that.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Tumelty to talk about some of the KPIs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.457" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Tumelty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#BB01200"><p>Since 2016 there has been an iterative process with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to look at its policing plan and see what it is setting as targets and how does it know it has been successful.  There has been a mix of crime statistics, milestones for the achievement of individual pieces of work and a public attitudes survey.  These are very useful, but on their own they do not give a full picture.  Crime statistics can be affected, as happened during Covid when the number of burglaries went down.  That was not because of any action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, however.</p> <p>  Similarly, with milestones, it is a question of whether an activity or an input happened but also whether either of these had an impact on someone's experience of policing on, for example, any given Wednesday.  I do not know the answer to that.  While useful, the public attitudes survey arguably does not hit enough people in particular cohorts in order to be able to give a real sense of what their experience is.  This year, we have been pushing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and having really good engagement around having new reporting that would place better emphasis on outcomes for people.  This is something we are doing in our engagement work.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned sex workers.  We met with the sex worker organisations twice in the past year, because it is about the lived experience.  The policing plan does have a tick beside whether a certain policy has been implemented.  We will then go out and listen to garda&iacute; and ask them if a policy has been rolled out.  Have they the resources to do it?  What is their experience at station level?  We will then go and talk to the domestic abuse organisations and ask if it is happening in practice.  Those things in concert give a picture.  The big emphasis in what we are trying to do is see what is of value to the public in terms of people's confidence in the police service and confidence to report.  If I am in a certain part of Dublin, say, will I report?  If I am a member of a particular community, have I any confidence in reporting my crime or that I will get a response?  The tone of policing is important to people, as is how it is done.  It is also in terms of legitimacy.  Is there corruption in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  What about the recording of the use of force?  We are trying to recognise that those tangible, quantitative measures have a place but so does bringing in the lived experience of policing and what people tell us is impacting them as suspects, as victims or as people who just engage with the police.  That is what we are trying to do.  We are trying to talk to garda&iacute; about how they are listening to communities and how do they know they are being successful.  What are their measures of success beyond the quantitative?  There has been really positive engagement on that in recent months.  We hope that reporting will have good outcomes.</p></speech>

We did a particular piece of oversight which ran across 2016 to 2019, namely, the homicide review.  At the end of that, there was a residual question around Article 2 and the right to life, but, more particularly, the right of those left behind to have a death appropriately investigated.  The report stemmed from the homicide investigations.  The authority wanted legal advice on the position around what would be expected for the future in terms of the safeguards to make sure that the Garda had the right things in place.

It is not a report, as such.  It is legal advice and it is not our intention to publish that.  We published the homicide review which is available on our website.  It details overall recommendations arising from the review, of which there are a number.  That is part of our ongoing oversight.  A number of recommendations still have to be implemented and we will follow those up with the Garda Commissioner this year.</p> <p>  Some of them relate to changes that need to be made to the PULSE system.  One of the important things in homicide, for example, is to have peer reviews and double check whether everything has been looked at.  We are anxious for peer reviews on homicides and to have the right support in divisions to look at homicides going forward.</p></speech>

That would need to be clear because, as I understand it and as Ms Hall has said, the Policing Authority has shared it with the Garda Commissioner.  I expect that is in the expectation that the Garda will then adhere to the advice, as it pertains in the document.  There needs to be a way for the public to know whether that happens.  The Government cannot, if it does not know the proposals of the report suggest.</p></speech>

What is her view on the status of crime statistics?  It is incredibly important that if a policing plan is to be put together, it considers the very many elements that are required, including the crime statistics.</p></speech>

First of all, even in our very early days, when we first got our functions in 2016, we thought that information and data were incredibly important not only for public policy but also for the oversight of the Garda.  This goes back to Deputy Hourigan's earlier questions about indicators and so on.  We are responsible for appointments of very senior Garda staff as well as other Garda members.  We recommended the appointment of a chief information officer, who has been in place for a number of years.</p> <p>  As for the matter of homicides I was talking to Deputy Carthy about a few moments ago, some of that came to light initially, back in 2016 and 2017, through the classification of homicides as to whether incidents were being appropriately classified and whether that had an impact on the quality of investigations.  That was an element of it and it was a very concerning one.  We had a deeper concern about the quality of the investigations.  The argument is that if a sudden death is not treated as a homicide, will it get the resources it should get in respect of investigation?  The matter of homicides was a critical part of and a really important link into the data.</p> <p>  We meet regularly with the CSO.  Going back to the Vice Chairman's original question about whether we are concerned about the reservation, I think the Garda has made a significant number of changes and improvements in the past three or four years, particularly on data.  It has invested heavily in the Garda information services centre, GISC.  It receives the data in Ballina, records the data on PULSE and owns the quality of that, taking some of the burden off garda&iacute; who are out in the middle of the night.  They can dial into GISC.  That is one area where we want to make sure there are sufficient resources.  I think it will take a number of years for that reservation to disappear, but our interaction with the CSO would indicate that it is quite satisfied that the Garda is making good progress in the right direction.  Something like the CAD 999 issue last year might push things back a little because there are concerns there about classifications and things not getting on PULSE.  If I were sitting in the CSO, that might make me a little wary.  I will ask my colleague, Ms Tumelty, to chip in on this.  The plan, as I understand it, is that the CSO, before it lifts that reservation, will do a detailed review of quality.  Could Ms Tumelty add when that will happen?</p></speech>

There is a data quality improvement plan between the Garda and the CSO.  As Ms Hall said, the CSO has expressed satisfaction with the pace and the investment the Garda has been making.</p> <p>  As for calls having to go through GISC, it has review teams there now.  There have also been merger teams because there was an issue with multiple identities on PULSE.  Another key part is the Garda's information technology vision, which is very much not about kit and hardware but about how we deliver information that will allow for information-led policing.  The Garda knows its data reach.  The difficulty over the years has been the ability to rely on those data, to access those data and to generate the type of reporting that can improve policing.  There is a lot within that vision.  I refer to the mobility project and the improvement in accuracy achieved through garda&iacute; being able to put fixed charge notices, FCNs, directly into their mobile phones.  Data quality comes up across most the big areas we have dealt with.</p></speech>

Part of the reason I have been interested in them is that I have looked at the distribution of resources, which of course is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.  If you do not have a sufficient number of garda&iacute;, you get a reactive type of policing.  It has a real impact.  There are particular types of crimes that do not show up if road checks and things like that are not being done.  I was looking at the ingredients of the policing plans over the years.  I looked at them before and after the most recent census of population.  We have just taken a new census of population.  I do an update every couple of years on the distribution of resources.  I raised this with the Garda Commissioner last week.  The same pattern keeps on cropping up and has cropped up for the past 15 years, and that is only since I have been looking at this.  The pattern is that the areas that are growing rapidly in population consistently have a lower ratio of garda&iacute; to population.  It is important then to factor in things such as the reliability of data because population will not be the only metric.  There will be crime statistics, but can you rely on the crime statistics?  Then the Garda is not detecting some crimes, so the crime statistics are lower than they would otherwise be and you are almost at a kind of revolving disadvantage.  Does the Policing Authority address that resourcing issue, or can it address it, with the Garda?  Does the authority look at the policing plans?  The quality of the public experience was mentioned.  The quality of that experience relies on visibility as well as everything else.  Having a sufficient number of garda&iacute; is important, but garda&iacute; also have to be safe in their workplace rather than going out to do their jobs on their own as opposed to in pairs.  There is the reactive element, safety and so on, but what does the Policing Authority do in interrogating those policing plans in respect of the distribution of garda&iacute;?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.526" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Hall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#DD00500"><p>We have a very direct role in that in respect of, first of all, the adequacy of resources, on which we advise the Minister, but also in respect of effective policing.  That people experience is the bottom line of the service, as the Vice Chairman rightly said.  I share some of her questions about the distribution but, obviously, that is a matter for the Commissioner.  Sometimes you hear local joint policing committees, JPCs, or local councillors say they do not want a reduction in the number of garda&iacute;, but that should be a moving thing because it should be dependent on need, priority and, as the Vice Chairman said, population.  That is important.  I tend to be an optimist.  One of the big things I see as positive is that the Commissioner introduced in late 2019 - it has got a little delayed due to Covid but it is getting back on track - the biggest change in the structure of the Garda since 1922, which is what is called the operating model.  That is changing the way the Garda will resource and manage the organisation.  Where there were 98 districts which rolled up into 28 divisions, now there will be 19 divisions.  Some divisions will cut across two counties.  They will have their own resources but it will be on a needs basis.  That is looked at.  The decisions around those divisions were made based on population, crime and things like youth and socioeconomics.  There was a whole decision on that.  I think that will help because if a district is run by just a superintendent and the resources are not shared across the division, that becomes a little tricky.  That is one positive thing.</p> <p>  I go back to Deputy Hourigan's point about having the data.  One of the things we have been concerned about and one of the things we have pressed in our advice to the Minister is that there needs to be significant investment in IT.  It is hard sometimes.  This is an organisation of 18,000 people, and the Commissioner needs to know at his or her fingertip where people are, what they are doing and what they are assigned to in order that some of those operational decisions can be made and the force is not, as the Vice Chairman said, being reactive but planning ahead, looking at particular areas that have, for example, population explosions and therefore more young people, looking at the risks in that regard and the socioeconomic indicators and saying we need to take garda&iacute; away from certain areas.</p><p>Those are hard decisions that will also not be popular politically, but they are necessary at times.</p></speech>

I assure the Vice Chair that high on the list is the appropriate allocation of resources to ensure it is based on evidence-led and information-led decision-making.  Ms Tumelty mentioned this earlier.  It is a work in progress, though.</p></speech>

Several retirements are due at the same time.  We talked to the Garda Commissioner about this matter last week.  It is not an ideal situation from the perspective of workforce planning or institutional memory, etc.  I asked the Garda Commissioner about another aspect where he said he was not seeing a pattern.  Anecdotally, however, I am hearing about people retiring before they are due.  Additionally, there have been some cases where people have been suspended and they have retired in that period, before their retirement date.  Is the Policing Authority examining this aspect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.533" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Hall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#EE00700"><p>Yes, to some extent.  Workforce planning, certainly, is central to the work we do.  The running of the senior grade competitions is our responsibility, so we must constantly have an eye on this issue.  One of the concerns the Vice Chair might be alluding to is that this time next year seven of the eight current assistant commissioners will no longer be in place.  We are very much aware of this issue and a competition is ongoing to fill these posts.  Therefore, we are aware of this issue in respect of the competitions we are responsible for.  We also approve the numbers of Garda staff and make the senior appointments.  If the Vice Chair looks back at some of our reports, she will see that workforce planning has been an issue we have been like a scratched record on.  I refer to getting workforce planning details from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This subject again goes back to some of the systemic aspects, but progress is being made in this area and we await a current workforce plan.</p> <p>  Concerning things like discipline and suspensions, we do not get involved in the detail of individual cases.  We would, however, want to see that such matters are being dealt with appropriately and independently and that they are being appropriately referred to GSOC.  We do not want to see themes arising from complaints that might indicate the presence of systemic issues we should be following up on from an organisational oversight perspective.  Therefore, we certainly would be cognisant of these matters.</p> <p>  On early retirements, we think this is common and we factor it in.  One provision of the contractual arrangements of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is that they can retire after 30 years' service, in contrast to those working in other sectors, and probably rightly so.  This means that there are people who could continue to work until they are 60, but who choose to retire at 50 because they can.  Personal choice comes into this context, but this arrangement has also always been a feature of the force.  Those of us who have friends and family members in the force, or who know garda&iacute;, know that some choose to go and have a different career, while others wish to continue their service up to the maximum permissible age.  It is an aspect that must be factored in and it makes Garda workforce planning a little difficult, but no more than any other organisation facing issues with retirement dates.</p></speech>

One of the longest suspensions was for eight years, which seems extraordinarily long.  The people suspended have issues in this regard, but, equally, there are also questions here regarding what kind of a process would allow something to go on for that long.  It seems like an inordinately long suspension, although there were much shorter suspensions as well.  If it is not possible to resolve issues of this kind in a timely way, that screams out to me that there is a problem here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.535" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Hall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#EE00900"><p>The Policing Authority has an oversight role in this regard, but the system deals with these individual cases.  Obviously, I would not even have the information to comment on an individual case.  I am concerned as well that something is up here.  To be fair, there has been a recognition in the Department of Justice, GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that significant work needs to be done and there must be an improvement in this regard.  I heard some of the interactions with our GSOC colleagues this morning, when they were talking about this aspect and the new legislation.  A change is needed to the disciplinary regulations, and it is something the Department of Justice is considering.  This is overdue to simplify the system.</p> <p>  One of the areas we examine, and one of the areas of emphasis for our work this year, concerns what the Garda do.  Talking in the broadest terms possible, I refer to any information or third-party recommendations that come to the attention of members of the force and how they would act on them.  Deputy Commissioner Coxon is doing some work from the Garda's perspective on how the force can be assured that things are happening fast enough in this context.  I refer to something like a complaint or a grievance, and whether that is being handled.  I comment on this point because we had concerns, in the context of our clearance processes over the years, that sometimes the handling of internal procedures was inefficient.  Much work remains to be done in this area.  We want attention to be given to this matter, and we have already discussed with the Garda Commissioner how this aspect can be improved.  That said, we would not know sometimes if a person undertakes a judicial review of a process, because that is his or her prerogative, and it can take time.  I point that out just to be fair.</p></speech>

It is not always straightforward.  Turning to the Policing Authority itself, it is holding another organisation to account.  To do that, the Policing Authority's own board must have the authority to do that, and that is why is it important that it is above reproach.  Late last year, there was an issue with a board member concerning the handling of a disciplinary issue in Northern Ireland in respect of an individual who had a degree of protection in the workplace and then that protection was removed.  Regret was expressed about the handling of that matter at the time.  Is that sufficient?  Has what happened undermined the Policing Authority?  How can that kind of situation be avoided in future?  I think it is the Minister who makes the appointments.</p></speech>

I may not get this completely right, but it is the Minister who makes the recommendations and then the appointments are made by the Government.  Ratification by the Houses of the Oireachtas then follows.  I certainly do have anything to do with the appointments to the Policing Authority.  Equally, the focus of some of the members of the Policing Authority at the time was very much on, and our focus now is on, ensuring appropriate treatment in respect of domestic sexual assault and any matters of that kind.  It is front and centre.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on appointments to the Policing Authority.  It would also be inappropriate for me to comment on something that went on in another jurisdiction.  I do not, however, think it undermined the Policing Authority.</p></speech>

What happens in that process or what is the role of the Policing Authority in this regard?

It is important that the plan is published.</p><p>Then members of the public can see the Commissioner being questioned on the performance, challenges and targets.  Anybody who is accountable for performance will know that one may not always get 100% green, but the conversation about what went wrong and having that conversation in public is also important.</p><p> As Ms Tumelty mentioned, we do this every year so we learn.  For example, if we say we did not do something for a particular reason, we are going to be asked again and there would be a different target, so if that did not work, we could refine that.  I would say it is very much a co-creation, and that is important, because the work the Garda does is extremely challenging and difficult.  It is about making sure what is signed up to by the Commissioner - it is his public commitment to all of us as to what he is going to do in a year - is agreed as being appropriate.  That does happen, there would be a little bit of a discussion on it, and even the fact that discussion happens in public is important.</p></speech>

As long as we maintain our independence and, at the end of the day, we are establishing the targets as an authority, you do not really want to impose something, and yet there have been times when we have said something is very woolly.  Those discussions happen and there are tough discussions around it.  That independence piece is very important and then looking into the so what, as it were.  We do a critical assessment twice a year, which is published, and then there are changes to the plan for next year or a challenge as to why something should be remediated and questions relating to that.  Is there anything else Ms Tumelty might want to add?</p></speech>

We would see if that policy is in place, if it has been resourced, if it is actually happening in stations and if that is the experience of people.  That is what I talked about a bit earlier.  There would be good robust engagement on that.  In the Garda annual report, it would report on the progress against the various milestones.  Also, in our twice yearly report, we would have quite robust commentary at times as to where failings have been.</p> <p>  What we have also done this year, because we have a statutory obligation to determine the targets, in addition to what is in the policing plan, is to take the policing priorities and put our targets in there because we want the Garda to see this is what we expect.  When we say, for example, the first policing priority this year is around protecting and supporting victims when they are vulnerable, we would expect to see at the end of this year increased reporting, increased detections, the recommendations on the child sexual abuse report in place, the maintenance of the service in terms of domestic abuse that was established over the past two years, increased cybercrime capability to address the existing backlog of devices, and consolidation of the divisional protective services unit.</p> <p>  We have been very clear that there are targets in the policing plan to do with public attitudes, measures or crime statistics but we want to see these outcomes.  Those targets have been put in with the policing priorities this year to make it very clear it is not just a list of priorities but tangibly this is what we need to see in order for us to say the force has been successful.</p></speech>

We are trying, as best we can, to challenge that so what, as it were.  There has been learning on our side as we are a relatively new body, but it is a challenge to the Garda now as well, and Ms Tumelty referred to the fact the Garda, I believe under Deputy Commissioner Coxon and Deputy Commissioner McMahon, is looking at trying to get more towards being outcome-based and dealing with the so what.  It is both.  One wants to do several things but ultimately it is a question of whether it makes a difference.</p></speech>

Is it through particular sessions of justice and policing committees, JPCs?  How will the authority communicate with people experiencing the policing?</p></speech>

In doing the Covid reports over the past two years, we met more than 50 different organisations, which ranged from family resource centres to those representing different minority groups.  We met sex workers and commercial entities.  We also maintained the relationship, so it was not a one-off talk.  We met them a number of times and, by talking to them, we built up relationships and trust.  In some cases, for example, we would have had two or three communities where groups of people said they wanted to bring more to the meeting.  A number of our board members sat in on those meetings on a few occasions as well.</p> <p>  These are listening exercises.  We are not trying to present them as mad scientific things.  They are the particular, so we are not trying to make generalisations, but they are still very valid as the particular.  If an inner city group tells us what is happening for them, we bring that back.  It helps us to have a more informed conversation with Garda management but also to feed back to them and say that while they are saying it is one thing, this is what we heard in this area.  There was a good geographic spread.  We did not explicitly state at those meetings or within the Covid reports that it was a group from a specific place, so I think that gave people confidence as well.  We would have said we met a group representing Travellers, students or migrants, an inner city group, an urban group or a group representing young offenders in a particular area.</p></speech>

Another area on which we have done a little bit of work is getting research done.  We have recently advertised for some research to be done on the way diverse communities experience policing, and I give a little shout out for that.</p></speech>

We try to triangulate information and we have done that since the very beginning.  As Ms Tumelty said, we have learned during Covid how the particular can lead to a very meaty question, so that it can be said, while there is a diversity strategy, what we are hearing from young people or young black men is as follows.  It is very interesting.</p></speech>

I know, in the short time in which the authority has operated, there has been a discussion around the relationship with Garda representatives.  How is that relationship right now?  Does that kind of work pose issues?  How is that working out?</p></speech>

We have a very direct productive relationship with the Commissioner and his senior team.  I have nothing but praise for the access we are given and being able to go wherever we like.  Somebody asked a question about unannounced visits and that sort of thing.  Certainly in recent times, there has never been a constraint put on the information we get.  Sometimes it takes time, and that is frustrating, but in terms of the relationship, I would say it is positive and appropriately robust.</p></speech>

I would not say we are the most loved, but then is anybody who is overseeing loved?  Do we love, for example, when the auditors come to us?  Mr. McCarthy would probably share the same pain.</p></speech>

The relationship is appropriately robust but yet productive, so I have no cause for complaint in that regard.  Sometimes there is an expectation, in relation to the representative bodies, that we are somehow a conduit to the Commissioner.  I suppose we have resisted that because we believe the relationship is between the unions and associations and their employer, the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>That is not a popular position.  We do try, however, and it is funny the way these things happen.  Covid taught us a lot.  We have done a lot of engagement within the service.  For example, when we were going out to assess how people were experiencing policing, we went to checkpoints back in May 2020.  I stood at the side of the road myself and we talked to members of the Garda about the fear, about the difficulty of these regulations and about their own personal situations.  It was about understanding.  Maybe we have not done enough of that.  It is something I would like us to do more of in terms of that engagement with the Garda service.  We have not been restricted in any way and we have had nothing but positivity from the service throughout.  I commend the committee on its comments last week about using the word "service" rather than "force".  It has been there since 2005 but it is not a Garda force or a police force.  It is a police service.  I like that kind of language from the committee.  It is very welcome.</p></speech>

That kind of senior-level turnover can affect business continuity.  What role does the authority have in ensuring continuity and a continuity of skill sets?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.569" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Hall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#GG00300"><p>Statutorily, we are the ones who make the appointment, and that is our primary role.  We focus as best we can on there being no gaps and I think we have done a very good job of that.  For the last five years there have rarely been gaps, whereas in previous times there might have been vacancies for months or years.  For example, with regard to the seven assistant commissioners who will be gone, our priority will be to try to get them in place, or at least put a panel together that the Commissioner can have at his disposal.  It is about encouraging good workforce planning.  A lot of good work is being done but we are not yet there.  I can think of a particular example where the Commissioner asked us to do an early appointment to allow for a handover and that kind of continuity.  The authority acceded to that even though there were a few months of overlap, because it was important.  We try to be as helpful as we can, where it is within our remit.</p></speech>

I thank the Vice Chairman for her leeway.  We spoke to GSOC this morning about the new legislation coming through and the expansion of some of its remit.  One of the areas of expansion is the inclusion of the laypeople and non-Garda people who work in Garda stations.  Will that change the way the Policing Authority operates, or will it have any impact on the work it does?</p></speech>

Those who are at the disposal or in the service of the people should be a coherent workforce.  It should not matter whether somebody is a sworn Garda member in uniform or a Garda staff member doing analysis, photographing a crime scene or doing tests on things.  There has been a huge shift in the Garda in the six years we have been overseeing it and we have encouraged that.  It is moving towards the professionalisation of certain areas that could be covered by non-sworn members and it is prioritising that and giving funding and positions to it.  There are a now a little over 4,000 Garda staff members.  We have several very senior people enrolled in areas like finance, HR, ICT, which were previously garda roles.  That is a positive thing,  A cultural shift is beginning to happen within the organisation to accept those people as peers.  However, it is only beginning; it will take time.</p> <p>  Going back to the operational model, the chief superintendent having a senior person at his or her disposal who will look after all the business services is crucial.  They can work together with a superintendent who is involved with all the serious crime across the division, not just silos in each district.  It is about having somebody who is looking at the performance and accountability and somebody who is really focused on community policing.  That is potentially a game changer and should be encouraged.  It is a change.  The idea that Garda staff members are not just typing up the notes and making the tea but are sitting peer to peer is a huge cultural change.  I know the Commissioner feels this as well.  There are policing roles that can be undertaken by Garda staff.  Do not tell me a 25-year-old cybercrime expert is not just as much a part of that policing investigation team.  The Garda members value that now.  It is about that mingling.  We have a role in that workforce mix, in encouraging diversity and having the right people in the right places.</p> <p>  The one thing the public, and the committee as Oireachtas Members, can do is not to automatically say they want more garda&iacute; in the street.  A lot of crime now comes into private spaces.  It comes in behind closed doors in the form of violence, child sexual abuse happening online or elder abuse happening online.  Having a garda walking down the street may not solve that.  It may be somebody sitting behind a computer with the right skills.  As a public we need to be careful and acknowledge that.  The committee should not get me wrong; there is an element of visibility making people feel safer.  That is also important but that is not the only thing and it is not always about more boots on the street.  It might actually be better to invest in the ICT that could save time so that when those boots are on the street, they are much more effective.</p> <p>  The Garda has made considerable progress with the mobility devices it has put into the hands of members but it is not just a question of handing someone a phone.  It is a question of the ICT and the stuff behind that, which costs money.  Our latest resource advice to the Minister related to this issue.  We sent a second letter in 2021, so seized was the authority of the matter of investment in ICT.  It is critical.  It needs to be ring-fenced, invested in and prioritised above all else.  I have no doubt it is a hard political decision to say we will not bring in 800 garda&iacute; this year but will bring in 600 and use the extra 200 worth of money to do something else.  These are hard decisions that will need to be made.  That non-visible policing has to happen if we are going to keep pace with the crime that is actually happening behind closed doors.</p></speech>

On the 14% of emergency calls that were not responded to, were the automatic recordings preserved?  Was the Policing Authority able to listen to those?</p></speech>

There were some legal impediments to Mr. Penman listening to those calls.  That fact is in the public domain.  We have said this already.  We are hopeful now that that will happen towards the end of May.  That is the second phase and that will happen.  The Garda is very positive about allowing that to happen.  We are positive that is should happen but there are some steps that need to be taken.  A lot of that hinges on data protection and assuring the privacy of the individuals that one might be listening to.  That will happen but it has not happened yet.</p></speech>

It is one thing to remember when members are thinking about the new legislation.  It will be critical to make sure the new policing and community safety authority, PCSA, is beyond doubt in terms of what information and data can be accessed by it.  This has been a big issue across 2020 and 2021 and it still endures, in terms of our oversight..  I have concerns about the 200,000 cancelled calls, which I expressed that earlier, and there is still more work to be done there.  However, it is important to clarify that it is not that the 999 calls were cancelled or knocked off.  When a call comes in, a computer-aided dispatch, CAD, incident needs to be created.  Some 200,000 of those were cancelled.  That will often happen and there are perfectly valid reasons for cancellation.</p><p>For example, if five of us see a road traffic accident and we dial in, there will then be five CAD incidences.  It would be appropriate to delete four of those and have just one so that double-counting does not take place.  That being said, the bigger concern is around where there is a domestic violence call that should have had a response.  I am not diminishing the issue but I am just saying that in respect of the numbers, there were still a great number of them that should not been cancelled.</p></speech>

It takes courage to make such a call.  It used to be the case that people would not come to a public representatives with issues of domestic or sexual violence but that is not the case anymore.  People will come forward.  Very often, they lack confidence and not having confidence in a service that is responding has really doubled down on-----</p></speech>

He talked about this and Deputy Carthy or perhaps Deputy Hourigan talked about the 100-plus cases that were criminal matters.  I have a concern that goes back to what the Vice Chairman has just said, which is that if I have taken the courage to ring and I do not get a response or feel I have got one, will I ring again?  That is an adverse impact, which is just as serious as it not being recorded as a crime.</p></speech>

If one does not have, for example, those four calls to the Garda about this incident and this particular premises, it may make it more difficult to get a protection or a barring order or anything else.  It is not just necessarily about the crime that has been committed.  One of the things that we are encouraging An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do is on that adverse impact, which is wider than just the prosecution.  It is about the follow-up, as the Vice Chairman has correctly said, but is also whether the person would be happy to call the Garda again, if that person had already managed to pluck up the courage to dial 999.</p> <p>  Another residual concern on this is that many people in rural areas do not dial 999 but dial their local Garda station.  That is one of the challenges for An Garda in that we may not know, as the Garda stations are not linked into the CAD 999 service.  That is another risk that we know the Commissioner is looking at and is trying to resolve in a way that will reduce the incidents where somebody dials into their local Garda station and it is not then recorded.  A great deal of work has to be done on our side and on the Garda side in that regard.</p></speech>

We will take a note of that point in respect of the legislation because we are likely to be making a report on this and that kind of detail is of value.</p> <p>  On the legislation, we have seen at the committee over the years mergers and amalgamations and very often systems do not talk to each other.  Mergers are more complicated than anticipated, sometimes, and the preparation for it is not there.  What work is going on at the moment before that merger that would make it work more smoothly?  There is obviously some degree of overlap, in any event, and the last thing that we need is duplication and a lack of boundaries as to who does what.  Has the authority identified such issues?</p></speech>

From the beginning when the Commission on the Future of Policing made its report in 2018, and it was one of the things it noted.  To be fair, it was an issue we had been trying to do in any event, and we decided that on an administrative basis that there would be plenty of scope for us and the inspectorate to work closely, without needing to have legislation in place.  Myself and the chief inspector, Mark Toland, have been working closely together over the past number of years.</p> <p>  I will give the committee examples of such work as in anti-corruption, where the inspectorate would have done the report, would have kept us informed of what it was, and we would have then been pressing the Garda on implementation, would have had a public meeting on that, and would have received briefings from the Commissioner.  There has been a great deal of close working.  We have taken some of the reports, such as the report on child sexual abuse, and I will defer to Ms Tumelty on that, where we have worked quite closely with the inspectorate.  The recent custody report that was published by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate was taken at our meeting last week.  That work is a first step.</p> <p>  The second and more practical step is that the inspectorate is an office of the Department of Justice and the authority has been set up as an independent agency with its own Vote.  Myself and the chief inspector have already recognised that there will be some easy ways to do a merger in respect of this aspect.  We will start the talks and I am aware that the Department is leading out on that this year in looking at a stream of the things that are needed so that we are ready for much of it.  When we were developed in 2015&ndash;16, much of the legwork was done in creating an agency and in having just the basics such as having the lights on, an office, and all the financial statements.  We have started conversations on those issues but it is more important to look at ways in which we can work together in respect of the staff of both agencies.  </p> <p>  One of the positives is that we are both relatively small agencies.  Our staff number is 39 in total and the inspectorate has ten to 12 staff.  The organisations are not very big and I hope that that will make it a little bit easier.  Talking to people and planning for that is ongoing and is top of our business planning for this year.</p></speech>

That is the timeline that we are working to and we are trying to get many of our ducks in a row this year so that we are ready.

We have the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, for example, which will become new agency, the Corporate Enforcement Authority, CEA.  There are members of the Garda embedded there and there is a memorandum of understanding to position members of the Garda within the new authority.   There has been a great deal of criticism from the ODCE in respect of the non-provision of members of the Garda and delays in respect of inquiries, and so forth.  This is an area of policing but it does not have the same kind of oversight.  Should that area come under or is it even one that is considered to come in under the remit of the body such as the Policing Authority?</p></speech>

As I understand this, and I will not comment on another agency, but the CEA will be about corporate crime and company law.  It has Garda members on secondment to the authority but they work under the director of corporate enforcement.  I understand that the interaction mentioned is about getting sufficient Garda members and having them there, which is one piece of this issue.</p> <p>  There are also the areas, which are directly under our oversight, of serious crime, fraud, economic crime and cyber crime.  There is also the review carried out by Mr. Justice Hamilton, which is something that we are also overseeing.  I will go back to something that I said a little earlier, which is this is very much a case in point of having the right technical and professional resources at the disposal of the Garda Commissioner.  One might actually want forensic accountants rather than garda&iacute; in uniform for something like that, or, again, to go back to those ICT specialists.  That sort of crime is quite complex.  There will be a pass-over between the CEA and something that then comes into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but there is a line for that there, which is the economic crime, the fraud, and the elder abuse which the committee has discussed earlier is financial crime and is directly within the remit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has its own resources.  Is there enough of these?  The answer from the Hamilton review is "No, not yet", and that is something that there has to be a plan for.  Part of the workforce planning is getting the right skills in there to support both investigation and prosecution.</p><p>Is that helpful?</p></speech>

Forgive me if I go over areas that have already been covered.  I was caught on some other issues during the day.  I thank Ms Hall for her presentation, which I have read.</p> <p>  I compliment the Garda on the work that has been done from 2020 onwards in dealing with the issue of Covid and the way in which it worked with local communities in providing help and support, especially to people living on their own.  It was an extremely important contribution.  The Garda also worked with other people, getting them to assist as well.  As for the issue of policing and the work of the Garda, I wonder about community involvement.  I have seen it in my area.  I do not live that far from University College Cork, and there is very good co-operation between the local community and local garda&iacute;.  However, in areas where we have a high level of drug use and where cocaine and other drugs are now more prevalent - I suppose that applies everywhere but it is higher in some areas than in others - do the witnesses think a lot more could be done to have more garda&iacute; at street level than is currently the case?  Do we need to focus a bit more on policy and getting more garda&iacute; to areas where that is prevalent?  It is about getting garda&iacute; more involved with the community and working to resolve those issues.</p> <p>  The other issue I want to deal with is the challenge we face of having a growing elderly population and how we can change mechanisms.  I know it is not the responsibility of the Garda to provide the level of support it provided during Covid, and it went way beyond its call of duty in that regard.  It is about getting more co-ordination between the relevant State authorities, including the Garda, in dealing with issues like this.  Has that been looked at?  Have we looked at other jurisdictions in respect of that issue?</p></speech>

I may ask my colleague, Ms Tumelty, to chip in as well.  I could not agree more with the Deputy that the idea of multi-agency co-operation is key.  I echo what he has said, and other Deputies have said the same.  The job the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does for us in the middle of the night, in very difficult circumstances, is not to be underestimated.  Sometimes garda&iacute; deal with issues of addiction and mental ill health in the middle of the night.  They are the ones left trying to deal with that.  The new legislation is predicated on community safety.  It is in the Bill.  The new policing and community safety authority will have a role in overseeing that.  One question I have about the Bill is whether it goes far enough in delivering on the ambition of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which was about requiring real inter-agency co-operation, working in inter-agency teams, but also that there would be money for that in order that it becomes real at a community level.  That is one potential for the future.</p> <p>  We have spent quite a bit of time on drugs policing in respect of oversight because we hear about that from communities suffering from the effect of dealers on the streets they are living on, with their children not being able to go out safely.  That feeling is not just a feeling of a lack of safety; they are not actually safe, and there is a sense and a concern that the Garda cannot resolve that for them.  There have been a lot of discussions with the Commissioner and his team about the fact that the Garda has made very good inroads at a very senior level in cracking organised crime gangs, but does that make a difference to the communities on a day-to-day basis?  One of the strategies the Garda has is to try to look at that.  The other thing that is important is the new emphasis on community policing.  That is a really important part and should not be considered a softer end of policing.  The Commissioner and the team are giving a new emphasis, and that is something we will be pressing for and encouraging.  There are things in the policing plan to ensure that that happens apace.</p> <p>  As for rural crime and people feeling safe, we have joint policing committees and there are some pilots out there for what will happen under the new legislation.  They are the community safety partnerships.  It is a matter of making sure that the initiatives that come from those community safety partnerships, or indeed the joint policing committees, truly come from the needs of the community and that they can see that as a way for them to be able to hold not just the garda&iacute; but also perhaps the local authorities or the local health service to account, looking at how, as a public or a community, we can encourage and engage the multidisciplinary piece.</p> <p>  I do not know if Ms Tumelty wishes to add anything.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.601" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Tumelty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#JJ00900"><p>I will just echo what the Deputy said about the experience of policing during Covid for an awful lot of communities.  We talk about Garda visibility; they talked about Garda presence.  Very often, having large numbers of garda&iacute; does not actually guarantee a sense of presence of garda&iacute; in one's community.  I remember one conversation in an inner-city area outside of Dublin.  The person talked about how the Garda station was within 100 yards but many of the garda&iacute; had never come into their community unless it was for enforcement reasons.  The person said that to have the garda&iacute; interacting with them on a positive basis was a very new thing and something they relished.  There is also the tone of policing.  We heard phrases such as "Community policing got back to where it should have been".  The operating model will be important in that regard and for the community hubs.  The community policing framework is being rolled out at the moment.  Our emphasis in overseeing that is that it cannot be just an allocation-of-numbers job; it must be asked whether presence is being delivered for communities.</p> <p>  As for drugs, we have heard very strongly from communities that they know that work is going on where there are large hauls of cash, guns and drugs but that this is not impacting their existence from Monday to Friday or from Monday to Sunday in their communities.  This year the Garda located drugs policing not in the section of the plan that typically deals with organised crime but in the community.  It is interesting that this can be seen as a small administrative thing or something that actually has meaning.  We have had a great deal of engagement with the Garda Commissioner and his team over the years on the need for the drugs policing side to look at the impact on communities.  We were hearing very strongly that, in respect of the type of policing, the emphasis on guns and tonnes, which is a phrase we have heard, was not necessarily delivering impact for people in terms of their fears about drugs and intimidation of their kids.  We heard from those communities that what we need is good, solid community policing, that garda&iacute; need to be in the community, not just for enforcement, and that they are needed to develop relationships with the young people.</p> <p>  To come to Deputy Burke's point about multi-agency work, that affects not only drugs policing but also elder care.  What has come across strongly from our talking to the organisations that work with the elderly is that the garda&iacute; are very often the first people to encounter the vulnerability and have the job of trying to discern where there is risk but that, after that point, there needs to be that multi-agency working and that safeguarding in respect of elderly abuse.  During Covid, we heard of people signing over permission to their relatives to collect their pensions.  Was that ever signed back?  Where was the safeguarding in that regard?  The Garda cannot do everything.  That is where the multi-agency competence and capability have to come in.  The community safety partnerships offer a way of doing that, but it is also a matter of that development of multi-agency working at a local level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.602" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022040700002#JJ01000"><p>I will go back to the multi-agency approach.  I was involved in a project in Blackpool, Cork, with the local garda&iacute;.  This is going back 15 or 18 years, when local garda&iacute; worked very closely with the community, such as, for example, in respect of instances where young people dropped out of school.</p><p>When we did a survey of the people who had come through the training schemes there, we found that 70% of them were in full-time employment five years later.  It was the garda&iacute; who initially started it in getting them into the programme.  The people might have committed a minor offence and the garda&iacute; could have taken them through the court the system or try to put them through the centre.  Putting them through the centre was a far more effective way of getting the young people back onto the system so that they could earn a living for themselves.  I am wondering whether we are doing enough of that especially for young people who, for some reason or other, do not fit in to the educational system and end up on the street, starting illegal activity.  Should we be doing more on that?  In my area, the garda&iacute; are doing a huge amount of work and I wonder if we are doing enough in other areas in that regard.</p></speech>

We would have seen it in our own work in overseeing the youth diversion programme, where there were some difficulties with there not being a consistent referral of people, and the importance of diverting people into precisely what Deputy Burke is talking about.  Sometimes we hear from the garda&iacute; and communities that it actually needs to go further and extend to primary school children in some areas because the organised crime gangs are becoming more directed at and are targeting younger children, particularly those who cannot be prosecuted, to do some of their running.  Children need to be diverted and I would say that the garda&iacute; are doing an immense amount of work.</p> <p>  During Covid some of the youth services closed, which in a way is a learning.  In the second phase of Covid lockdown, they were considered more of an essential piece because there were some children who were not getting into those sort of programmes.  They were stuck at home in situations where they should not have been.  That is where I see the ambition of the new Bill in terms of community safety and trying to get people much further upstream.  Why is someone in the court now?  Is it something that could have been addressed by investment in education or investment in the poverty situation he or she is in?  It is a complex issue but if agencies work together they could support children who are quite young and divert them into education before they ever get near that, or support a family so that they do not live in poverty.  Much more is involved.</p> <p>  The garda&iacute; are picking up the impact of some of the societal pieces downstream.  Going back to the Bill, the multi-agency piece could be a very significant change.  Personally, I do not believe it fulfils the ambition for community safety that was envisaged by the Commission on the Future of Policing but - going back to me being an optimist - I believe it will help.  When looking at the Bill, it is something to keep an eye on.  Is that powerful enough to make the sort of changes the Deputy is suggesting?</p></speech>

For instance, when I was chair of the board, I remember having to spend a lot of money that I did not have and being rapped on the knuckles for spending it.  It was costing us approximately &pound;600,000 at the time to provide services for about 50 young people.  If four of them were in custody, that &pound;600,000 would be spent to keep them in custody over a 12-month period.  Sometimes we do not measure that, whereas we were looking after the 50 young people.  I am not sure whether we have grasped that issue yet, especially for young people who have dropped out of the system.  We might be better off spending much more money at an earlier stage to make sure they can be accommodated-----</p></speech>

The legislation will be important there to have the true multi-agency piece.  The Deputy is right.  One can save when looking at the cost of probation services, prison services and court services.  If they are measured against an investment at preschool, it would be a no-brainer in terms of cost benefit.</p></speech>

For the first, we have an engagement in public with representatives of AkiDwA, the Men&rsquo;s Development Network and Safe Ireland to discuss the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality regarding domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  When that session has concluded, we will go into private session to deal with committee business.</p> <p>  I warmly welcome our stakeholders who are here with us this morning.  I thank them all for coming in and I thank those who are joining on Teams also.  First, I welcome from AkiDwA Ms Uruemu Adejinmi, chair; Dr. Salome Mbugua, CEO, who I have known very well for many years; and Dr. Caroline Munyi, migrant women&rsquo;s health co-ordinator.  From the Men&rsquo;s Development Network I welcome Mr. Se&aacute;n Cooke, CEO; Mr. Colm Kelly Ryan, head of programmes and advocacy; and Mr. Kenny Doyle, project development officer.  From Safe Ireland I welcome Ms Mary McDermott, CEO, and Ms Lisa Marmion, national services manager, who is joining us via Teams.  I welcome all of our witnesses and thank them for their time and engagement with us.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting who are in locations outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which participation is covered by the absolute privilege with statutory nature.</p> <p>  Having given those formalities, I will now call on each group to make its opening statement.  I ask them to keep their opening remarks inside of ten minutes and as concise as possible, if they can, to allow more time for questions and answers.  After a representative from each group has given their statements, we will then open the floor to members for questions and answers.  Again, we are very grateful to the witnesses for giving their time.</p> <p>  I call Dr. Mbugua to make the opening statement on behalf of AkiDwA.</p></speech>

This morning I am joined by AkiDwA representatives Ms Uruemu Adejinmi, chairperson, and Dr. Caroline Munyi, co-ordinator of migrant women&rsquo;s health.  Our organisation welcomes the establishment of this Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality and views it as an opportunity to advance gender equality in Ireland.</p> <p>  Akina Dada wa Africa, or AkiDwA, which is Swahili for sisterhood, is a national network of migrant women living in Ireland.  Established in 2001, AkiDwA&rsquo;s mission is to promote equality and justice for migrant women, with a vision for a just society where there is equal opportunity and access to resources in all aspects of society: social; cultural; economic; civic; and political.</p> <p>  For AkiDwA, the term "migrant women" includes not only recent immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees, but also migrant workers, spouses of Irish and EU citizens, students, trafficked and undocumented women.  It also includes those who have acquired Irish citizenship but who still consider themselves to be outside the mainstream society in terms of their linguistic, racial or cultural backgrounds and who therefore still define themselves as migrants.</p> <p>  Today our presentation is focused on recommendations 37 to 41, inclusive, made by the Citizens' Assembly and mainly on how AkiDwA believes they can be advanced.</p> <p>  Domestic violence happens in families in all regions and from all social, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, regardless of age or disability.  However, some members of society face additional barriers in accessing services and getting to safety.  Migrant women indeed have certain vulnerabilities which need to be taken into account, which characterise the abuse that they suffer and their pathways to safety.  Ireland&rsquo;s response to domestic violence needs to be aware of these vulnerabilities and build cultural sensitivity into this framework.</p> <p>  Since the beginning of the pandemic, rates of domestic violence have increased substantially in Ireland.  In AkiDwA between 2020 and 2021, we dealt with 123 cases and our office remained open to support women.  As noted by the Immigrant Council of Ireland, the number of domestic violence cases experienced by migrant women increased to 12% in 2021 compared to the previous year.  According to Women&rsquo;s Aid's 2020 report, 941 women who called its helpline said that they were members of a minority group.  Some 93% of these were migrant women.</p> <p>  AkiDwA asserts that domestic abuse of migrant women in Ireland is an expression of power and control, which can further be aggravated by issues of culture, tradition and immigration.  It can be made worse for migrant women living in Ireland because they are far away from their home countries.  Most have no extended family support, due sometimes to family reunification barriers.  Some face difficult residency status situations that could be contingent on a husband&rsquo;s residency, cultural or religious factors, isolation from support networks and discrimination, and others may have language barriers affecting their access to services.</p> <p>  Recommendation 37 states that all Government action to prevent and counter domestic, sexual and gender-based violence should be co-ordinated by a Cabinet Minister with direct responsibility for immediate implementation of the national strategy.  AkiDwA supports this recommendation and additionally highlights the importance of including all forms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, including female genital mutilation, FGM, early and forced marriages and trafficking in the national strategy to reflect diversity and lived experiences of women living in Ireland today.</p> <p>  According to AkiDwA's research and reports, there are 5,975 women who have been subjected to FGM living in Ireland.</p><p>Some 6,000 girls under 15 years old who are born or are living in Ireland but who originate from FGM-affected countries are at risk of female genital mutilation.  AkiDwA and those who have been following the news know that Ireland witnessed the first FGM prosecution in January 2020.  This case reaffirms the need to address this issue fully to ensure children from affected communities are fully protected.  I will return to this issue later.<br/><br/>While the issue of early and forced marriage is under-researched in Ireland, it has been happening.  According to a report by <i>thejournal.ie</i>in October 2016, over 400 minors were married in Ireland between 2004 and 2015.  The report pointed out that the Garda National Immigration Bureau was investigating several cases of forced marriage involving migrant children as young as 12 years old where the girls were typically trafficked into the country and coerced into marrying older men.  In 2019, the <i>Irish Examiner</i>reported a case of a father who supported his 16-year-old daughter's marriage to a 29-year-old man against her wishes.<br/><br/>Trafficking of women for sexual exploitation and prostitution remains a major issue globally and in Ireland.  According to a Ruhama report on its provision of support in 2018, out of the 251 women supported by the organisation, 201 were migrant women.  We recommend that the national strategy include all forms of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, including FGM, early and forced marriages and trafficking, to reflect diversity and the lived experiences of women living in Ireland today.  FGM as a form of gender-based violence should be included in all the goals of the national strategy on DSGBV and should be highlighted in awareness-raising, training and education.  The Ministry or agency working towards the implementation of the national strategy with the Minister should have advisory members with representation from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>With regard to recommendation 38, time and again we hear from migrant women, particularly women applying for international protection, that they hesitate to report domestic violence out of fear that involving the authorities would make them be seen as troublemakers and that it would negatively affect their application for international protection or citizenship.  It is therefore imperative that a positive initiative is taken to educate migrant and refugee women on their rights in targeted information campaigns on recognising the signs of domestic violence and assurances that protection from domestic violence is available to all and will not affect immigration status.  Article 13 of the Istanbul Convention provides that states shall promote or conduct, on a regular basis and at all levels, awareness-raising campaigns or programmes, including in co-operation with national human rights institutions and equality bodies, civil society and non-governmental organisations, especially women&rsquo;s organisations where appropriate, to increase awareness and understanding among the public of the different manifestations of all forms of violence covered by the scope of the convention.  Under Article 19, states are to take necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that victims receive adequate and timely information on available support services and legal measures in a language they understand.<br/><br/>The impacts and harms caused by domestic violence are many for those involved, including the children.  For example, in the area of female genital mutilation, survivors are left with psychological, physical, social and sexual consequences.  <font color="#212100">Current supports available to victims and survivors of FGM are not sufficient, as there is currently only one clinic targeting this cohort of migrants.  Supports can be considered in the following areas.  Regarding physical supports, the impact of FGM on women range from being unable to do or enjoy intimate activities with their significant others to difficult labour and childbirth, among others.  In terms of psychological supports, one of the adverse impacts of FGM is on women&rsquo;s psychological health.  This group needs culturally appropriate services to help them cope with the trauma caused by the mutilation.  We also need wrap-around supports.  The need for these supports is essential and long overdue.  We would be failing if we say that women suffering from FGM are not victims of other forms of violence such as domestic violence.  Due to the difficulty</font><font color="#212100">to engage in intimacy, women who have undergone FGM suffer domestic violence in their homes and many times they have no one to whom they can disclose what they are going through.  I can offer an example of a woman who has gone through that.  However, due to time I will move to recommendation 39, to support justice for victims and survivors.</font><br/><br/>While other women have a choice of whether to avail of the safety and protections in place, migrant women often find themselves trapped by laws, policies and administrative decisions.  Immigration legislation impacts greatly on the lives and choices of migrant women, increasing their physical vulnerability and distress in situations of domestic violence and severely curtailing their options, particularly when social welfare restrictions apply.  Although the introduction of independent residence permissions was and still remains a welcome feature and a positive development in the work of combating domestic violence among the migrant community, there still remain gaps in the protection of migrant women.  Neither the domestic violence guidelines nor the policy document on non-EEA family reunification has a legislative footing.  Instead, access to independent status is based on ministerial discretion.  A more forward-looking approach is contained in Article 59 of the Istanbul Convention.  That article introduces the possibility of granting migrant women an autonomous residence permit if they are trapped in an abusive relationship because their residency status depends on that of their abusive spouse or partner.<br/><br/>There remain administrative barriers that hinder victims to fully exercise their rights and to avail of the current avenues in place, given that the domestic violence guidelines set out that the immigration status granted under the arrangements would be &quot;at the same level as that which was previously held as a dependant&quot;, normally stamp 3 holders.  This would not enable women to become economically self-sufficient and could act as a disincentive to women seeking independent status.  While it is known to service providers that it can be possible to obtain a stamp 4 with permission to work, this information is not stated in the policy.  Second, in cases of non-EEA migrant women, they are required to register or re-register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  Following a successful application for the independent status, a fee of &euro;300 has to be settled before one can be issued with a certificate of registration.  This registration fee may prove prohibitive for women in situations where they are highly financially dependent on the perpetrator and not in receipt of any other payment.<br/><br/>Ireland should opt-in to the EU directive on family reunification and introduce implementing legislation which provides for autonomous residence permits.  In addition to this, the protection of undocumented women from domestic violence should also be regarded as a priority in immigration reform.  We must place the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, guidelines on victims of domestic violence on a statutory footing, removing ministerial discretion and replacing it with a clear legal framework and a process.  We must clarify the position on stamp 3 permission to work, with clear guidelines for holders and employers.  Where granting independent status to a recognised victim of domestic violence, consider granting full access to the labour market to allow her to work to support herself and her family.<br/><br/>I will go to reviewing and reforming the courts system.  AkiDwA welcomes this recommendation because it is badly needed.  Front-line services and other service providers need to take up training, in particular on cultural competence, which AkiDwA has produced, to empower professionals and front-line staff who are working in this area.  AkiDwA agrees with introducing tougher sentences and with providing specialised, confidential healthcare.  AkiDwA emphasises the importance of language support, translation and access to legal support, which have been major barriers.  Most women do not understand the system in Ireland at all.  Ireland only has one clinic specialising in FGM, as I mentioned earlier.  There is a lack of specialised domestic violence refuges and support services for migrant victims of intimate partner violence.  Women&rsquo;s Aid has an interpretation service available for women presenting at its services.  However, in most services, especially in rural communities, there is a lack of resourcing for the general population, which has a knock-on effect on migrant women.  AkiDwA also agrees with recommendation 39(e).<br/><br/>I will proceed to recommendation 40.</p><p>Although the immigration guideline is a welcome feature that enables victims to apply for independent immigration status &mdash; I mentioned this area &mdash; migrant women may experience additional barriers to accessing support and safety in circumstances of domestic violence, especially where their immigration status is a problem.  I deal with this in my submission where I refer to the habitual residence condition.</p><p> The habitual residence condition is a qualifying condition for social welfare payments that was introduced in 2004.  Women who leave their partner because of violence and who do not satisfy the habitual residence condition may find themselves and their children destitute.  Even if they check into a refuge, given that its service is temporary and that those availing of it are not entitled to any payment while there, the chance of them or their children, or all of them, remaining there is quite slim.  In most cases, victims find their way back home to the perpetrator.  We ask that the habitual residency policy be examined, along with its impact on the lives of women.</p><p> Recommendation 41 relates to the area in which AkiDwA specialises: female genital mutilation, FGM.  FGM is a form of gender-based violence that affects women and girls in Ireland today.  Almost 6,000 women living in Ireland have undergone FGM, although the actual number may be higher because we did not get statistics from the CSO on some of the relevant countries.  AkiDwA produced the statistics from UNICEF 2016 and World Health Organization guidelines.  We have repeatedly called on the Government to establish an interdepartmental working group to co-ordinate the response to FGM to prevent it from happening to young girls and to provide adequate support to survivors.  In 2020 we saw Ireland's first case concerning this human rights abuse.  This sends a strong message that FGM will not be tolerated in Ireland, but we need to take steps to prevent girls from being cut.  We have outlined key policy steps that the Government should take to prevent such a crime from happening again.  These include the establishment of an intergovernmental working group that includes the relevant Departments, civil society, front-line services and representatives from affected communities; the development of a national action plan on FGM outlining and co-ordinating the response of Government agencies, with funding to support anti-FGM programmes and key targets and indicators to measure progress on elimination; and the establishment of funding for a network of community health ambassadors who would work with affected communities, including youth, religious groups and men, to change attitudes to FGM at a grassroots level.</p><p> AkiDwA welcomes recommendation 41 wholeheartedly.  AkiDwA has called for FGM to be recognised as a ground for asylum many times.  It has made attempts that include undertaking research into the gender component of asylum claims made by women in Ireland, particularly in relation to claims of gender-based violence, though without success due to a lack of data.  In 2011 and 2012, AkiDwA held meetings with the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, on this matter.  We have been advocating for gender asylum guidelines, which I will now explain.</p><p> The threat of FGM provides strong grounds for claiming asylum, yet many women are not granted protection.  According to the 2013 UNHCR report, 29 female applicants in Ireland between the ages of 14 and 64 are likely to be affected by FGM.  This is 44.6% of the total number of female applicants from FGM-practising countries of origin.  The figure is from 2013, so it may now be higher.</p><p> The primary responsibility for protecting women and girls from FGM lies with each country.  However, if a woman or girl in genuine fear of being subjected to FGM flees a country where such protection is not provided by the state and arrives in Ireland, it is vital that Ireland fulfils its legal obligations and provides adequate protection.  Gender asylum guidelines allow decision-makers to examine women's asylum claims in a way that contextualises their experience and recognises the influence of gender inequality on perceptions of persecution.</p><p> In 2009, the UNHCR established guidelines on how to treat claims for refugee status relating specifically to FGM.  These state that a girl or woman seeking asylum because she has been compelled to undergo, or is likely to be subjected to, FGM can qualify for refugee status under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.  Women and girls applying for international protection in the State should be interviewed in a gender-sensitive manner to ensure they have an adequate opportunity to identify the types of harm they fear as relevant to the protection process.  The 2013 UNHCR report Beyond Proof: Credibility Assessment in EU Asylum Systems, also known as the CREDO report, notes this.  Hence, gender-sensitive interviewing is essential to ensure the facts of a claim are brought to light and can be appropriately assessed by the decision-maker.</p></speech>

The domestic gender guidelines should recognise FGM as a human rights violation.  We also recommend induction and in-service training to promote greater awareness of the circumstances of women in refugee-producing countries.  Gender-sensitive techniques in interviewing should be utilised and gender-sensitive interview conditions should be provided to women seeking international protection regardless of whether a gender-related claim is provided in the first instance.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Chair on her recent elevation.  It is amazing what 25 years of hard work does for overnight success.</p> <p>  On behalf of the board of MDN, its staff, clients, participants and volunteers, I wish to express our gratitude on being offered the opportunity to contribute to the deliberations on gender equality, specifically domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  As a follow-up to our contributions to the Citizen's Assembly, we see it as both a privilege and necessity for men to be part of this discussion.</p> <p>  Having had that sense of privilege coming here today, I must not understate my network's sense of privilege, as a men's development organisation, in being part of this discussion.  To be in this room not only with our colleagues from Safe Ireland and AkiDwA but also with the members is a true privilege and a significant moment for a developmental organisation like ours.</p> <p>  I am the chief executive officer of MDN.  My aim today is to set out its stall and outline what it does.  With me is our head of programmes, Mr. Colm Kelly Ryan, who will reflect on the recommendations and what we feel should be done.  Also attending with me is our newest recruit, Mr. Kenny Doyle, our project development officer for research policy and advocacy.  He started on Monday and we trust him here today.</p> <p>  I offer apologies on behalf of one of our colleagues, Mr. John Doyle, our director of services, who intended to be here today but could not make it owing to a prior engagement with our facilitators and partner support organisations on our domestic violence intervention programme, MEND.</p> <p>  Before we share our reflections, it would be useful to give a brief introduction to MDN, its work and its methodologies.  The network celebrates its 25th anniversary this year.  It was established in 1997 in the south east of Ireland by a group of men who were supporting each other to be the best fathers and partners possible.  This group was developing greater awareness of how the system of patriarchy impacted negatively upon them, their partners and their families.</p><p>The men also readily acknowledge their own sense of privilege.  </p><p> We have our headquarters in the sunny south east of Waterford, but we also have offices in counties Carlow, Tipperary, Dublin and Wexford.  We have 17 core staff and a further 22 subcontracted staff working on various programmes.  We run four national programmes: MEND, the domestic violence intervention programme; Engage, the national mental health training initiative; our male advice line, a national freephone service for male victims of domestic abuse; and the all-Ireland White Ribbon campaign, which is men ending violence against women.  It is worth noting that in we are the only organisation which has dedicated programme to address victims and survivors of domestic abuse as well as perpetrators.</p><p> Over the initial years of the network, we ran a number of projects working with men who were at risk of or experienced marginalisation in the most marginalised communities.  During this time, the network developed its own methodology of engaging men that has influenced the development of all its programmes and practices.  These engagements with men also played a significant role in informing the first men&rsquo;s health policy with a strong emphasis on a social determinants model of men&rsquo;s health.  Ireland was the first country in the world to have such a policy.</p><p> As an organisation, we have five core values that when, adhered to, create the conditions for individuals to thrive and grow and for societies to adapt and change for the betterment of all.  These values of equality, being non-judgmental, partnership, professionalism and love underpin all our work and ensure that the principles of tolerance, respect and dignity are the cornerstones of our non-adversarial approach. </p><p> We see our work within a transformative framework that aims to create positive environments for reflection and analysis, leading eventually to action, whether this is as a society or as individuals.  Our approach as an organisation is similar to the process happening here today where we are reflecting on the work of the citizens' assembly at the second stage of a process of transformation.  That will eventually lead to a third stage where action will be taken in the form of agreed proposals for legislation or the holding of referendums.</p><p> Our work is about transforming masculinities by providing opportunities to engage men and boys on issues such as their health and well-being, gender equality and ending gender-based violence, not only in our national programmes mentioned earlier but also in programmes such as our parent support programme, walk the talk, FarmConnect, MenConnect, men's leadership, counselling services and our summer school, to name just a few.  </p><p> Over the past 25 years we have worked hard to develop partnerships and collaborations with the women&rsquo;s movement and acknowledge the leadership shown by women in creating the more equal society we have today.  I hope as a men&rsquo;s development organisation we are viewed as strong allies and supporters of the quest to end inequality and the elimination of violence against women.  Although many strides have been taken to address inequality, there is much to be done.  </p><p> The policy and legal frameworks are generally in place.  The next step, we feel, is the transformation of hearts and minds.  The rationale and evidence is now in place to positively engage men and boys in becoming catalysts and agents for change.  This is only one piece of the puzzle, but a significant piece nonetheless, in creating the cultural shifts that engage the silent majority of men and boys in becoming their most authentic selves and standing together with women in the ongoing process of creating a society of equality, respect and non-violence.  I hope this gives the committee a context for our contributions and reflections on the various recommendations today and that our mission statement, Better Lives for Men, Better Lives for All, is seen in the context of what I outlined earlier and that we are here today with an open mind, a tender heart and willingness to engage.   </p><p> Before my colleague, Mr. Colm Kelly Ryan, takes over and continues our opening statement on the specific recommendations of domestic sexual and gender-based violence, I also wish to offer the committee, in light of the breadth of our engagement on all aspects of gender equality, our willingness to further engage with committee in the other seven areas of recommendations, especially those on the Constitution, care, leadership, norms and stereotypes.</p></speech>

As an international human rights lawyer, it is a privilege to be here as a witness and I want to thank the committee for its work and wish members well over the next eight months of their journey.</p> <p>  I also wish to express our thanks for the work of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.  It members showed diligence, leadership and public service in the good work they have done.  I would also like to note that it is an honour to be here today with our friends from AkiDwA and Safe Ireland.  They are wonderful allies for human rights, gender equality and an all-around better society for all.  It is an honour to share this day with all of them.</p> <p>  In the remaining time available, I will briefly outline the Men's Development Network position on recommendations 37 to 41, inclusive, of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality report, focused on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  I would like to start by saying that we welcome the recommendations provided by the assembly.  We have a submission on this that I hope has been circulated to all members of the committee.  I encourage members to read it in conjunction with our recent submission to the Department of Justice on the draft national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p> <p>  In March 2022, Men's Development Network submitted a paper to the Department on the third draft national strategy.  In a sense, these recommendations align with recommendations 37 to 41, inclusive.  We outlined some recommendations I would advise regarding making Ireland a more gender equal society and addressing the issue of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.   These include providing a clear outline of the available resources to implement the national strategy and action plans and ensuring prevention and awareness raising efforts target the public rather than specific sectors of society, in accordance with Articles 13 (1) and (2) of the Istanbul Convention and Article 35B of CEDAW general recommendation 35.  </p> <p>  We also wanted to ensure that awareness raising programmes address the root causes of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, in accordance with international law.  As part of that, we wished to ensure that engagements with men and boys are based on international and national best practices in the most appropriate ways from a strength-based, non-judgmental and non-adversarial approach, and that there is a positive call to action for men and boys that instills support to build capacity and safety in the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It should be the case that men and boys can be allies for gender equality and ending gender-based violence.  </p> <p>  The development and funding of campaigns and similar initiatives such as the White Ribbon Ireland campaign to engage with men and boys as allies for gender equality in ending gender-based violence is vital.  This is a key piece in the Istanbul prevention pillar.  We also recommend the expansion of the proposed content of awareness raising activities and training programmes beyond the aspect of consent, but also to include themes mentioned in Article 41 of the Istanbul Convention, such as gender equality, respect, non-violent conflict resolution, interpersonal relationships, gender-based violence and integrity.  It needs to be quite holistic.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.626" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Kelly Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022040700002#D00400"><p>We can turn specifically to the recommendations of the citizens' assembly, and from there follow up with some questions on the submissions.  On recommendation 37 under the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, there is a commitment from Government to create a new statutory body that will be co-ordinated by the Minister for Justice, which will have direct responsibility for implementation of the strategy.  This aligns quite well with what is proposed by the citizens' assembly in recommendation 37 in section 1 of the draft national strategy.  It was supplemented by our submission on section 2 to the Department.</p> <p>  Regarding recommendation 38, we believe that the recommendation needs to be extended beyond current expression.  The training should be based on the prevention of the Istanbul Convention.  It should also include the role of men and boys in engaging them in the most appropriate ways as allies for gender equality and ending gender-based violence.  At this stage in Ireland, that has yet to take place.  It would be very innovative in terms of promoting a gender equal society.  </p> <p>  In regard to recommendation 39 on supporting victims and survivors, Men's Development Ireland acknowledges and welcomes sub-recommendations A to E, as recommended by the citizens' assembly.  We note the overlaps with the objections of the third national strategy.  I refer to advancing justice for the victims and survivors of domestic, gender-based and sexual violence not only in their engagement with the institutions of justice but also ensuring long-term sustainable justice for victims and survivors.</p><p>We would also recommend the inclusion of an option for the development of restorative justice or practice processes, where appropriate.</p><p> Furthermore, MDN supports recommendation 40 as presented.  We would encourage that such a provision be as inclusive as possible to all genders and to their children, with due regard to the fact that the majority of victims and survivors of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence are women.  It is important to note that the Istanbul Convention recommends one shelter space to every 10,000 people in Ireland, and that Ireland currently does not have that number.  There has been much work done, but much is still to be done.</p><p> I take guidance on recommendation 41 from our friends from AkiDwA.  I welcome what they have stated here this morning.  I would like to note that various UNHCR publications, such as the Too Much Pain document from 2014, indicate that FGM is a ground for seeking asylum.  This is supported by a wide range of jurisprudence in case law from common law countries and countries in Europe, such as France, as cited in our submission.  I note that in the wording of the recommendation, there is some concern in relation to FGM as a ground for seeking asylum.  We know that asylum is a fundamental human right.  It is a fundamental human right to seek asylum.  I urge that we would state here that FGM is actually a ground for refugee status, rather than a ground for seeking asylum.  This is because it is fundamental human right.</p><p> I thank the committee and I look forward to questions from members.</p></speech>

I apologise for moving the conversation on.  We all have the opening statements.  Our work is very much focused on how we implement the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  As Mr. Kelly Ryan said, all of us are very grateful to the Citizens' Assembly for providing us with such a clear blueprint to achieve gender equality.  It is a great pleasure to call Ms Mary McDermott, who is the CEO of Safe Ireland.  I thank her again for being here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.629" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary McDermott" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022040700002#E00300"><p>I am the CEO of Safe Ireland.  I am joined virtually by my good colleague, Ms Lisa Marmion, who is our national services development manager.  We thank the committee for the invitation to speak today on the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  We give our very great thanks, even more importantly, to our fellow citizens for their recognition that domestic, sexual and gender-based violence creates and maintains conditions of gender inequality in Ireland.  It must, therefore, be central to all considerations of the equality and freedom of all.</p> <p>  We frame our presentation today not only in the context of meeting the requirements of the Istanbul Convention, but also in the context of the publication of the report of the Citizens' Assembly, the national audit of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence infrastructures, the Tusla audit of domestic violence accommodation, the current draft of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and, crucially, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s very welcome decision to create a new statutory agency for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p> <p>  The overriding frame for Safe Ireland, however, retains the effects and the insights of Covid-19 on our society in relation to domestic violence, the strong reassertion of the importance and capacity of local communities and the effectiveness of co-ordinated Government and civil society engagement.  The importance of locally accessible domestic violence services cannot be overstated.  Equally, the redrawing of the relations between work and home, the private and the public and the use of IT, all of which are embodied here today, are directly pertinent to responding to domestic violence in a progressive, 21st century manner.</p> <p>  I do not need to rehearse here the public reaction to the murders of Urantsetseg Tserendorj and Ashling Murphy.  In particular, Ashling&rsquo;s death removed every possible victim-blaming variable that we usually use to distract ourselves from the scale of violence against women in our society.  We remember them here and we work on behalf of all women who are deprived of their lives and their freedom.  As such, we are done with endlessly describing this problem.  We welcome this moment in our history when we can actually accept that domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a large-scale social problem.  We can name it accurately and we can act to address it.  We have encountered focused, persistent and positive engagement from all sectors over the last two years.  The question now is about how we proceed.  It is a welcome starting place for us.</p> <p>  On the point of naming, language and the conceptualisation of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, Safe Ireland&rsquo;s core position, which is bolstered by decades of robust feminist and queer scholarship, is that this form of violence is a large-scale social problem.  It may not be reduced to poor personal choice.  We concur with Mr. Kelly Ryan's observations on the need to broaden that issue.  It is a cornerstone social problem.  We believe that if it is addressed centrally and systematically, many ancillary and problematic personal, social, political and administrative culs-de-sac in areas like mental health, addictions, homelessness, persistent criminality, child protection, education and employment and alienation of all kinds can be worked through.  All of these factors bring significant evidenced costs to our State, our communities and our personal lives.  All of them would be seriously repositioned if domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was placed centrally in our social policy.  I might add that the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, and Safe Ireland are working on a project to that end.</p> <p>  Our colleagues in Women&rsquo;s Aid, the Rape Crisis Network of Ireland and Dublin Rape Crisis Centre have presented substantively on recommendations 37 to 41, inclusive, of the Citizens' Assembly, which relate to awareness, justice and FGM.  We will not input heavily into these areas today.  We are happy to engage on these matters, but we will not repeat the previous inputs.  We defer significantly to our colleague in AkiDwA on the matter of FGM, as already addressed this morning.</p> <p>  I will make a brief input on social protection and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence supports.  Our submission covers this aspect of the matter under the heading of &ldquo;pathways to freedom and the importance of social protection&rdquo;.  A woman's journey out of coercion and, in particular, financial control, often requires her to be supported by the State to regain her independence and her agency.  Over the last two years, Safe Ireland has worked positively with the Department of Social Protection to develop such dedicated pathways.  We commend the work of Deputies and Senators on this, particularly their cross-party support in 2020 for the domestic violence rent supplement.  This important pilot, which has now been mainstreamed, demonstrates some of the important gaps which continuously exist for women who are exiting abuse.  As a follow-on, we are now calling for a similar protocol for the exceptional needs payment to assist women who have other practical emergency outlays and are experiencing domestic violence.</p> <p>  In 2020 and 2021, Safe Ireland administered a charitable Covid-19 emergency fund through our member services to support women on their exit from abusive homes to purchase essential items, including nappies, bread and milk, to pay bills and to travel to and from school and work.  The outlays funded here are fully documented and they provide a solid base of evidence for mainstream support through our Government for the exceptional needs payment.  We will be pushing for this campaign in 2022.</p> <p>  We are aware of a structural barrier that confronts qualified adults who are seeking to access dental, optical and audiology services through the treatment benefit scheme.  Practitioners are required to solicit the consent of the perpetrator in order for an injured woman to be treated.  We will be seeking support from the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the data protection commissioner to remedy this anomaly.</p> <p>  Recommendations 37 and 40 address the appropriate political and administrative structures which plan, design, provide and resource domestic violence preventions and interventions in Ireland, including the equitable provision of refuge across the country.  It is very important for us in this forum that we decided to keep services and structures together in our considerations.  This is because they are, in our opinion, completely interdependent.  On recommendation 37, which involves domestic, sexual and gender-based violence structures, we welcome the significant progress that has been made with the integration of services and policy into a single Ministry with oversight within the Department of the Taoiseach.  This is an important element for us.  The proposed establishment of a new agency is also very welcome.  It provides great opportunity for cutting-edge responses.  However, Safe Ireland strongly cautions that we ensure this new structure does not repeat the difficulties of previous iterations.</p><p>There is an absolute necessity for a dedicated domestic, sexual and gender-based violence infrastructure in Ireland.  We cannot stress this enough.  Mixed models or the shoehorning of domestic violence into existing structures will, in our opinion, simply repeat the problems all these changes seek to avoid.</p><p> The importance of robust and fully integrated national, regional and local community co-ordinated responses to domestic violence cannot be overstated.  Regional and community level implementation of the third national strategy arising from this new agency should be driven, managed, and co-designed by the existing cross-disciplinary expertise in the front-line services sector, which already exists, alongside the significant DSGBV specialisms that exist in allied public service professions including policing, healthcare, social services and academia.</p><p> The task of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly was to examine gender equality through a rights-based lens.  It follows, therefore, that women and all victims must be visible at the forefront of structural response.  In this matter, we ask for an open and public process with appropriate terms of reference to guide all these processes.  We note with concern that the current proposal in the draft of the third national strategy for regional co-ordination does not support such a model.  The organisation chart on page 18 of the draft proposes to charge the existing children and young people&rsquo;s services committees, CYPSC, with responsibility for regional implementation of domestic violence for women and girls.  We strongly suggest this is inappropriate.  It is not a structure that Safe Ireland can support.  Such positioning simultaneously reinforces sexist stereotypes, repeats previous difficulties in the structural positioning of domestic violence and erases and infantilises the status of women and the violence they experience.  We deserve structures in our own right.  It is not a fit structure for the significant challenges ahead.  We call again for the development of a coherent national services development plan.</p><p> I will briefly move on to services.  Again, keeping the provision of services and the structures within which they operate in view, we welcome the development of 21st century refuge, quality front-line services and competent communities across the country.  Here, again, we stress that crisis accommodation through refuge is not of itself a solution to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence generally, nor is it even, indeed, to the full accommodation and support needs of women in their journey to freedom.  Whilst refuge can provide protective respite for a number of weeks, the journey to safety for a woman can take up to two years.  We must ensure the ongoing availability of refuge spaces for women in crisis but they must be fully supported pathways to transitional and permanent housing accommodation.  These must be in place.</p><p> As we know, national housing policy does not even recognise women in domestic violence circumstances as homeless.  This is an outrage.  Therefore, they fall substantially outside the net of current interventions and priorities.  Other jurisdictions, and my colleague, Ms Marmion, will speak to this in detail if required by the committee, have successfully addressed these issues in the round.  The whole housing approach, for example, offers such a model, which addresses the housing and safety needs of victims and survivors in the UK.  This framework consolidates all the main housing tenure types, housing options and support initiatives that are needed to help women fleeing domestic abuse to either maintain or access safe and stable housing.  The framework could be adapted and for the most part provides a tailored plug-in to existing housing policy to address the current deficit.  On the matter of women staying at home and needing safe at-home shelter, we also support this process.  We note that while the first option is that the perpetrator be removed from her home, however, there are also instances where due to the cultural pressure of family, friends or, indeed, the community as a whole, a woman must flee her home.  We will, therefore, always need these mobile flexible accommodation responses.</p><p> With regard to the development of refuge across the country which, of course, pertains to the publication of the Tusla accommodation review and the identified areas in our country that have no refuge provision and do not meet the requirements of the Istanbul Convention, again, we urge careful planning to maximise the opportunity to create a 21st century response to domestic violence at local level.  This is a moment in history that we do not wish to squander.</p><p> By way of proposing possible future-proofed models for refuge, in 2020, Safe Ireland drew up what we called then the Sovereignty Project, noting that freedom is the absolute twin of safety.  The core concept here is that future refuge would be built on three principles, the first of which is safe spaces.  All refuge spaces would be accessible and trauma-informed, with contemporary design principles that are fully integrated with wraparound services and, vitally, a community interface.  The second is that best practice would specify good quality standards for front-line services and practitioners based on local expertise and-or international best practice.  Third, an additional prong to this development, which we suggest in the Sovereignty Project, is domestic violence-centred community development and engagement.  This novel element would specify a model to lead the development of competent, safe communities that can prevent and respond to violence against women and girls, giving them confidence and clarity in how to handle this problem at a personal, familial, local and community level.  The project is under way and we will launch it in October 2022.  We will deliver at that time a safe spaces toolkit including these three elements for communities and services, which we offer as a guide and support for refuge development locally, either as a new-build or with the help of retrofit.  We must thank our donors, the Community Foundation for Ireland, for funding this important piece of work.  Its patience while we awaited the accommodation review's publication and its confidence in Safe Ireland's expertise is really appreciated.  Indeed, Tusla also recently supported our work here, which is also welcome.</p><p> Safe Ireland&rsquo;s recommendations to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality on its considerations of the report of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality are quite simple: create a dedicated domestic, sexual and gender-based violence infrastructure at every level; develop existing expertise and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence structures; develop a coherent accommodation response in order to support a functioning refuge capacity using, for example, a whole housing approach; and create a well-planned and well-designed model of community domestic violence refuge and support services across the country, which can transform our communities' responses and enable and empower them to deal with this large-scale social problem.  We welcome the committee's questions.  If we are unable to respond we will, of course, provide members with what they wish.  I thank the committee very much.</p></speech>

She has set out in no uncertain terms the task ahead.  She mentioned that we had engagement last week with Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, Rape Crisis Network Ireland and Women's Aid on these recommendations.  Our next meeting on 28 April will be a public engagement with the Minister for Justice on the Third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence.  I will invite colleagues in turn to indicate if they wish to contribute.  We have a time limit of eight minutes on each member's exchange to maximise participation by as many of our colleagues as possible.  If I need to allow perhaps one or two members in on each round of questioning, that will be fine; we hope to get to a second round.  Deputy Clarke indicated first.</p></speech>

I will keep my questions concise because we want to hear the witnesses' responses.  I thank them all for their time this morning and for the expertise they bring to this room.  It is vitally important in our work to ensure that the recommendations of the Citizen's Assembly actually deliver that real change that is so desperately needed.</p> <p>  I will start with AkiDwA.  I want to focus on female genital mutilation, FGM, for a moment.  The picture Dr. Mbugua painted for victims and survivors of FGM is very bleak in our cities.  In our more rural communities and outside those major urban areas, however, the challenges people face in terms of accessing support must be much more profound, particularly around that psychological and wraparound support of which Dr. Mbugua spoke.  In Dr. Mbugua's opinion, what does this look like?</p><p>What does the model that meets the need look like?  She is correct to speak of those pathways to protections and supports in relation to our immigration system.  I fail to see the logic in telling somebody they can have an independent stamp 3 visa while at the same time refusing them access to employment in order to support themselves and build a life outside of the abusive relationship they are in.  This is something we see repeated across various Departments.  Steps are taken but they are not completed.  That lack of completion means that women are forced to return to an abusive environment because they cannot develop their own independent life outside of it.</p><p> I have a very specific question.  Tusla has highlighted the urgent and established need for 60 additional safe units.  The witnesses spoke the need for culturally appropriate supports.  What does that look like to them?  What are they looking for with these additional units, which need to be delivered rather quickly? </p><p> What engagement has AkiDwa had with the Department of Justice on the development of national action plan on female genital mutilation?  Do the witnesses believe the 2012 Act is effective, or does it need to be reviewed and updated?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.635" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caroline Munyi" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022040700002#G00300"><p>The Deputy asked how the model should look.  That is a very good question.  First and foremost is the national action plan, which AkiDwa is agitating for and which we want to be Government-led.  The national action plan will ensure FGM services in Ireland are streamlined.  Streamlining means a woman can walk into any hospital in Ireland.  Let us say this woman is living in Clonakilty in Cork.  She can go to Cork University Hospital and be triaged, taken to the relevant department and seen by a doctor.  She does not have to go to Dublin for this or that.  If that could be streamlined, that would be very good.  It would also reduce the stigma, which we know is an issue.  When women have to go to Dublin, it is very stigmatising.  Most of these women are very poor.  They do not have a lot of resources at their disposal, especially those who are living in direct provision centres.  They have children to look after.  Again I will use the example of someone living in Clonakilty.  Those barriers could be halved.  There is also the cost of childcare.  This woman could just go into a hospital and be seen and have everything tackled there without stigma.  This will require training for our doctors to take care of FGM-related needs, both physical and psychological, as well as cultural appropriateness.  That will also come as part of the wraparound nature of the supports.  As Dr. Mbugua said, AkiDwa is leading in training professionals in the sector on healthcare, cultural appropriateness and cultural competence.  The national action plan will streamline services for women, both psychological and physical, because women who have gone through FGM face very serious and severe mental health consequences.  That can only be tackled through that streamlining of services.</p></speech>

We have met with many Ministers on the development of the plan.  Our chair has worked quite a lot with us on the development of where we are now.  She helped in the development of the 2012 Act and making that law a reality.  We are saying that now needs to be reviewed.  As members can see, it was established in 2012.  It must be reviewed to ensure there are not gaps.  We need to check where we are now, in an Ireland of 2022, compared to 2012 when it was implemented.</p> <p>  On the national action plan, we met with a Minister of State in the Department of Health in 2018 when the first case of FGM happened in the country.  She had been asked by the T&aacute;naiste at the time to meet with groups to check what needed to happen.  We came up with the recommendations that we keep putting out there but unfortunately, that went out of discussion.  We keep calling for the development of this national action plan to ensure that no child is subjected to female genital mutilation.  We are very unfortunate because it seems nobody is actually helping us to make this happen or to develop that national action plan.  It is very important that we do it.  We have been moved around different Departments.  First we were told it was the role of the HSE and then we were moved to Cosc and so on.  We need commitment in this area to ensure it happens.</p></speech>

We are hoping that whatever we have submitted on the strategy will be included, and we added additional information there.  That is why we are putting these recommendations before the committee today, to ensure they are in the national strategy.  At the moment, based on what we have seen, the national strategy does not incorporate these issues.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about refuges.  We want them to be culturally appropriate.  They have to take into account the diversity of the lived experiences of women in Ireland today, particularly the religious aspect of that.  If there are Muslim women going into these refuges, for example, they have to be culturally appropriate.  They may need kitchens that are halal or they may need to be provided with prayer rooms and so on.  The refuge has to be culturally appropriate.  People also have to understand where the women are coming from in terms of linguistics, languages, culture and all those kinds of things.  When these refuges are being developed, it would be good if organisations like ours were consulted.</p></speech>

I will go back to AkiDwa, if the witnesses do not mind.  I am sorry to be focusing the spotlight on them.  In my previous role working with Irish Aid, I was very fortunate to meet a wonderful lady, Ifrah Ahmed, who has done a lot of great work in this area.  We were lucky to be able to assist her in developing some really helpful programmes in her home country of Somalia.  Until I met her and had some lengthy conversations with her, I was not aware of the significant risk posed to young women and girls here in Ireland.  I thank AkiDwa for the work it is doing in highlighting that.  We have had legislation in place for almost ten years now.  It is a decade on.  It is most unfortunate that we do not have the national action plan in place to match that.  I hope it will be helpful to the witnesses and their work if this committee focuses on getting some action on that as part of the work we are doing.</p> <p>  I have two questions, which are at different ends of the spectrum with regard to how we are going to address the challenge of FGM here in Ireland.  On the first issue, Dr. Munyi outlined very eloquently the pathway for somebody living somewhere like Clonakilty or Galway, where I come from, if they are a victim of FGM.  Both she and Dr. Mbugua also spoke about things being culturally appropriate.  How important is it right now to have a programme of education within our school system, at primary level and perhaps more important, at post-primary level, that could somehow effect a cultural change so the practice of FGM would no longer be tolerated anywhere within Irish society?  The green schools programme from An Taisce, which is very powerful, has successfully effected a major cultural shift within Irish young people around sustainability and environmental protection.  Do the witnesses have any ambitions around engaging with the educational system?</p></speech>

We have tried to engage with education professionals, but with varying levels of success.  At times it has very good and other times it has not been so good, because of the age of victims and the topic that is being discussed.  As members can imagine, FGM is a very hidden problem because of the part of the anatomy that it affects.  We are in the process of producing the handbook.  We hope to engage with teachers or those high up in the educational sector with a view to undertaking a survey and getting the views of teachers on the issue and how they want to engage.  With the help of teachers and through consultation with them, we hope that from there we will make some progress so that we can make inroads into the educational sector and see how far we can get.  We know that teachers interact with students and parents from practising communities.  We know how important it is.  Perhaps Dr. Mbugua can add to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.646" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Salome Mbugua" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022040700002#H00300"><p>Education, whether it is at primary, secondary or third level, is key to the whole area of DSGBV, not only FGM.  We think that even from the early learning years, for example, when students are in cr&egrave;che, there should be some way of introducing these kind of situations.  There was a tragic case involving a 16-year-old girl who kept saying that she was engaged to her fianc&eacute;.  She told her friends in school, but they could not understand how a 16-year-old girl would have a fianc&eacute;.  Two years later, she left and was married somewhere in Dubai.  Her friends later came to understand that she had been forced into an arranged marriage.  She was living in Cork.  The children did not know.  It is important that children understand these issues so that they can talk to the teachers.  In the case to which I referred, it was a kind of a secret that the girls could not tell.  We have also tried to approach schools to see if there is a way we can include FGM as part of sex education.  It has to be done in a very sensitive way, because we do not want to traumatise the students.  FGM is very traumatising.  We have tried to engage on this issue at the educational level.  To be honest, it is a very foreign issue and we welcome the fact that Ireland is open to even discuss it.  Engaging with schools has been very challenging.  However, we are trying to create discussions with teachers in the hope that they can then move it forward.</p></speech>

We are obviously anxious to put in place a programme that supports and deals with the victims of FGM.  At the other end of the challenge, in terms of beginning to eliminate the practice, what do the witnesses feel are the most powerful levers or mechanisms available to us right now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.648" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Salome Mbugua" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022040700002#H00500"><p>It is about engaging with the community.  It has to be done at the community level.  That is why we recommend the training of community ambassadors, including people who are from the affected community, coming from that perspective and helping with that.  Perhaps Ms Adejinmi can add to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.649" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Uruemu Adejinmi" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022040700002#H00600"><p>Another important intervention we can make is to diversify our educators as well.  Taking the example Dr. Mbugua gave of the 16-year-old, if there was a migrant educator in that system, they would have picked up that information.  They would have suspected what was going on and intervened at the time to ensure that the unfortunate outcome that was experienced was prevented.  It is very important to diversify our educators, even as we are upscaling current educators.  There are a lot of cultural activities that we can pick up straight away when we are observing these children as they interact.  That is a very important piece of work that we can look at.</p></speech>

Apologies, but I was coming from another meeting that ran on.  I ask Dr. Mbugua to expand on her comments on the challenges in getting into schools and the education system.  I ask her to give us some idea of what the actual challenges are.  Are obstacles being put in the organisation's way?  If so, where are they?  How can those obstacles be overcome in a practical sense?  Perhaps we can come from the top down if necessary to get into and infiltrate our school systems.</p> <p>  I am very interested in the idea of refuges.  I come from a constituency, which as Ms McDermott is aware, that is very bleak in terms of the supports, practical supports and wraparound services that are provided for women and men.  Mr. Ryan referred to the Istanbul Convention and the ideas contained within it.  He stated that the convention recommends one shelter space for every 10,000 people in Ireland.  How many refuges do we have for men around the country?  Where are the gaps?</p> <p>  I have had a lot of dealings with Ms McDermott over the last few months.  In her opening statement, she referred to "Mixed models or the 'shoe-horning' of DSGBV into existing structures" as something that Safe Ireland does not want to see repeated.  I ask Ms McDermott to be more explicit on the types of models that she was referring to there.  I know what Safe Ireland wants.  It wants a holistic approach to be taken.  It wants to see wraparound services and appropriate accommodation provided.  I ask Ms McDermott to outline explicitly what Safe Ireland does not want to see, so that we do not make mistakes when we are at the infancy stage of trying to create the right system.  I do not want to see those mistakes happen in Cavan-Monaghan anyway.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.652" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary McDermott" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022040700002#H00900"><p>We have had a few discussions on services in Monaghan and Cavan.  The first thing that Safe Ireland is saying is that this is a historical opportunity.  We do not want to squander resources.  Second, it is a very simple, old-school and deeply-imbedded insight within domestic violence work generally that refuge is not the answer to domestic violence.  That is the simple starting point.  However, making that point is like saying that field hospitals are not needed in a war.  We need refuges and we will probably always need them.  Noeline Blackwell observed last week that if there are better and stronger responses to domestic and sexual violence in the country, we will see a rise and then a fall in numbers.</p> <p> To answer the Deputy's question on mixed models, what we want to see and what we do not want to see, from our perspective, we want to see a skills-led community response.  We want to see refuges and spaces as places that not only provide refuge and high-end skills that are there all around in our own network of 38 organisations.  We have talked about, and Dr. Munyi mentioned, the capacity for front-line triage, including risk and safety assessment.  The disciplines that almost automatically have to kick in when a woman presents at a refuge include: legal supports; accompaniment; advice; housing and accommodation outside the immediate needs of refuge; social welfare; education, training and employment; and crucially, the full therapeutic supports that are needed.  We also welcome the news that for the first time, one of our members in County Donegal that solely provides therapeutically based services has received funding.  That is fantastic.</p> <p>  In our presentation, we were really trying to say that the structures that we are going to put in place will seriously impact how the services are rolled out and provided across the country.  As the Deputy is aware, previously, responsibility for domestic violence has been based in various locations within Government.  It was previously the responsibility of the HSE.  There have been various iterations.  This is not an attack; it is just a description.  As members are aware, responsibility has been moved from within the Child and Family Agency.  I cannot stress enough the fact that the Child and Family Agency had responsibility for the area, without a mention of the word "woman".  The role of the woman has been almost reinscribed in a knee-jerk fashion as one of carer, as subservient to the needs of those who are dependent around her.  Her own rights, needs and violations, in themselves, do not have priority.  Safe Ireland will never stand on that ground.  We see this as an opportunity to move away from that inadvertent reinscription of the problem.  I must say that we have really good relationships with Tusla, by the way.  This is not an attack on anyone; it is just about how best to create the right system in this country.  Keeping domestic violence under the remit of children and young people, as is proposed in the draft strategy, will just simply serve to reinscribe the very thing we have been working to stop.  We wanted and asked for policy and services together.</p><p>We want an articulated structure from the top down, with oversight by the Taoiseach's office, a Cabinet-level responsibility and an interdepartmental and a whole-of-government response.  I know that everybody in this House has been listening to the term "whole-of-government" for probably about 20 years, as everybody needs such a response to everything, but we need a whole-of-government response to be put in place for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  When it comes down to the regional structures, importantly and crucially, it will fall or stand on this point.  There are several models such as the Garda regional divisions, community healthcare organisation, CHO, divisions, and those of the courts.  There are many models of regionalisation and we are not proposing any one in particular but they need consideration.  From there, one works directly with the already-in-place, however fragile, unsupported and 19th century, Dickensian and badly resourced services, but there are, nonetheless, enormous levels of expertise all around the country.  That expertise must not be lost and dedicated DSGBV structures at local level must be created to access the resources that are already there.  Does that answer Deputy Niamh Smyth&rsquo;s question?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-07a.656" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Cooke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022040700002#J00400"><p>I want to come in behind what Ms McDermott is saying on the regional provision and structures.  On the development of those regional structures, a previous regional plan used to be in place and it does not exist any more.  It is a very strong mechanism to roll out, certainly around the perpetrator programmes that have been happening in Ireland.  We are part of the Choices programme called MEND.  Along with our colleagues in MOVE Ireland, Men Overcoming Violence, and in the north east domestic violence intervention programme, we roll out the national Choices programme, which is a 32-week programme of engaging men around this particular issue of their own behaviour and of changed behaviour.  We come to this and our strength is based on a positive perspective in that regard.  A review is happening in respect of the roll-out of that particular programme.  In some ways, many of these reviews are interwoven with the national strategy, with other particular programmes and with the accommodation review.  This review is still ongoing in respect of effectiveness, delivery, project management and the delivery of that particular programme.  This would clearly suggest that regional structures are probably the most appropriate way in which to start to look around the issue of delivery and engagement in order to address the issue of domestic violence.</p> <p>  It would also be remiss of me today as a representative of a men&rsquo;s development organisation, although it is not because of that that I say this, not to state there is also a recognition that we are talking about domestic violence being an inclusive issue that addresses a whole range of people, genders and sexes, which we need to acknowledge.  We certainly feel the need for a gender-sensitive approach in how we go about this work.  Ms McDermott and I have worked on various issues and have been in discussions over many years, in the brief moments when we get to take our heads out of the sand to do so, when we talk about the most appropriate ways and the language that we need to use when we talk and address the issues of domestic violence, regardless of the gender or sex of the person who is the victim.  </p> <p>  As I said earlier we work very much with both perpetrators and victims, which is somewhat unusual in that sense but whatever way we come to this work, this is done from a collaborative and partnership perspective, working in a non-adversarial way, on the basis and with the optimism that people can change, and that we can engage with their behaviours and change them in that regard.  </p> <p>  The other piece I will speak quickly on is the question of accommodation.  As it stands at the moment in Ireland, there is not any provision of refuge for men.  In saying that, there is capacity in which we can and have used the various different systems and hotel rooms in gaining access to crisis accommodation for men at various different times.  The Men&rsquo;s Development Network will be doing a review of its own work with the Male Advice Line, which we run.  This is a national freefone service.  We have identified from what we see happening and in how men present themselves that refuge is not necessarily the cornerstone, and as Ms McDermott was saying, is not the endgame in addressing the issue of domestic violence.  It is not necessarily what is required at this point in time.  </p> <p>  We have made a proposal to Tusla and are rolling out a pilot programme at present, which is a wrap-around remote service being offered to men.  This is so that when they engage with our services, we can then refer them to our client support worker.  We are finding that men are not looking to get out because the original question that is usually asked when they contact our services is whether they being abused as they are unsure what the situation is.  When we talk to them then it is more about developing a plan and what is the most coherent one for them as to whether they are going to exit the relationship or the home.  This is done in a way, however, that does not undermine them culturally, socially or even economically.  That is the sort of network there.</p></speech>

Every month, I have been trying to keep the women who have died through male violence in our thinking today and not just after the death of Ashling Murphy.  I have taken the opportunity, therefore, to read their names into the record at different opportunities in January, February and March.  Today is an appropriate day if the Chair gives me the time to do it, as it will give me a little more time to describe some of the circumstances.  It is so important to remember much of what we are trying to do here.</p><p>There were 23 women who died in the month of April because of male violence going back to 1997.  They include Noeleen Cawley, aged 39, a mother of five who was stabbed to death by her husband; Anne Shorthall, aged 47, who was bludgeoned to death by a man that she knew; Joan Casey, aged 64, who died from a gunshot wound arising from male violence; Catherine Smart, aged 57, who died after an assault from a man she was living with; and Bernie Sherry, aged 44, who was shot twice by her ex-partner.  They also include Irene White, aged 43, who was stabbed in her home; Emer O&rsquo;Loughlin, aged 23, who was stabbed by her neighbour; Joan McCarthy, aged 47, who was strangled in her home; Rose Patterson, aged 30, who was stabbed by the father of her son; and Alison White, aged 13, who was murdered by a stranger.  They also include Janet Cheney, aged 47, who was killed by her partner of 18 years; Anne Marie Duffin, aged 39, who was stabbed by a friend of her eldest son; Diane Burroughs, aged 30, who was strangled in her flat by her ex-partner; Jennifer Doonan, aged 42, who was strangled by her 20-year-old son and Joan Vickers, aged 43, who was stabbed to death in her home by her husband.  They also include Mary Hannon, aged 59, who was stabbed by her long-term partner in their home; Ciara Dunne, aged 25, who was murdered alongside her two young daughters by her husband; Lorraine Flood, aged 38, who was murdered alongside her two young children by her husband; Anne-Marie O&rsquo;Neil, aged 50, who died after an attack on her home; and Nicola Sweeney, aged 19, who was stabbed to death by her neighbour.  They also include Samantha Walsh, aged 31, a mother of four who was murdered by a stranger; Natalia Karaczyn, aged 30, who was murdered by her husband after attempting to separate from him; and Amy McCarthy, aged 22, who was murdered by her boyfriend and father to her infant son.  </p><p>I apologise for taking this time but I do this simply to keep this going and keep the awareness of why we are doing this work right to the forefront of our mind.  Deputy Smyth already asked my question of Ms McDermott as I was going to ask her specifically about that point on page 3 of her submission on the structure and model.  What she has said is very important in not reinforcing sexist stereotypes.  Her languages was &quot;erases and infantilises the status of women and the violence they experience&quot;.  It brings to mind the excellent document Safe Ireland produced in March 2021, No Going Back, which I thought was a moment of reflection, both intellectually and philosophically about women and their status, and is deeply relevant to the work of this committee.  In that document, in particular, it states on root causes that:</p> <blockquote> 	It is our continued understanding that DSGBV is a root cause, not an effect or side-issue, of many households and family&rsquo;s sufferings, regardless of what formation that home takes.  We believe that if DSGBV were placed centrally in conceptualising these problems many parallel social problems ... would gain greater capacity to respond at depth. </blockquote> <p>I wanted to take a moment within the committee&rsquo;s work to go back to that document and to ask Ms McDermott about the philosophical underpinning of it, as it was a very important moment in the debate.</p></speech>

We really believe we are at a historic moment.  Parties, businesses and individuals have approached us.  Everybody wants to do something about this.  You can see it.  Everybody knows it exists.  No Going Back was written under the pressure of Covid.  We said we have to reframe this.  The Deputy will see from my notes on my submission that there are secondary notes under the other recommendations I did not speak to because last week, my colleagues put in substantive issues there.  What I wanted to note was that the issue of language and conceptualisation is crucial.  First, we have a very simple statement.  Nobody should have to live in an oppressive home.  That goes straight to all the tropes and fatalism upon which we rely all the time - you made your bed now lie in it.  Second, we believe we need new language to describe this.  In our opinion, the axis of DSGBV runs along sex, gender and sexualities.  There is a hierarchy under all of those categories and you can track the lines of power and control.  We believe we must extend and increase our capacity to speak about this by extending our vocabulary and conceptualisations.  Mr. Cooke and I have had quite a few head-banging sessions on this issue.  We say that we need to make room for more people and younger people whose identities and concerns are different to our own and we need to be able to conceptualise DSGBV across the standard social exclusion and poverty categories of our national social policy, a project we are working on with TASC, and to address it across the issues that arise under what we call diversity and inclusion.  If you put sex, gender and sexuality as the core axis along which this violence runs, I believe you will develop a really robust and sophisticated way of speaking about this and will, therefore, be able to develop a social policy that will meet that demand.</p></speech>

I will come back and ask Ms McDermott about that because I have only a minute left.  The Department of Education is developing a new junior cycle programme based on consent.  That is fine except nobody has yet seen it.  What really needs to happen is at primary level.  I was in Kilkenny the week before last talking to teachers and garda&iacute;.  They spoke about how it can be a bit difficult when the schools say they want to talk about image sharing and Coco's Law but how when the garda&iacute; say they want to talk about it for the protection of all of the children, there is a slightly different reaction from parents.  What needs to be in the programme from primary education?  How do we talk about gender, consent, personhood and boundaries in an age-appropriate way?  How do we make parents who might feel that this is very different comfortable?  What is the right approach for the Department to take?  Clearly, it is part of what we are talking about in terms of the recommendations of the citizens' assembly, but what is the right way to do that to make sure we are hitting it correctly from a gender and diversity perspective and really get this right first time?  I know I am out of time.  I will be happy to come back to the matter.</p></speech>

I have met some of them previously.  One issue I raised with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth previously concerned assaults against children.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?  When we look at recommendation 37, we see that it talks about gender-based violence but it also talks about violence in general so we must take that into consideration in our recommendations and the work in their organisations?  I know the Minister is to come back to us regarding ongoing work in his Department.</p> <p>  The other issue I wish to raise concerns the joint policing committee for Galway.  Rape and sexual assaults were the offences that increased the most during lockdown.  They went up by 100% during that period.  Are we left with a legacy from Covid or has it just expanded our knowledge base concerning what is happening in people's homes?  From speaking to those impacted and relevant services in my constituency, I know that by the time it gets to somebody making a call to the police, it has been happening for a really long time and people were alone within their own homes so I can only imagine what led up to that.  Is there an added legacy from Covid?</p> <p>  The work we must do involves making quite firm recommendations and asking really serious and important questions about what is happening within Departments.  What other models around the globe could we look at and incorporate here?  We could often look at what has not happened and what the numbers are like but we must look at what the best model is and incorporate it into what is being done in Ireland.</p></speech>

I draw members' attention to the document, No Going Back,referenced by Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  In that, we set out the journey of a woman, although, of course, women are diverse and there is no one type of woman.  Notwithstanding that, we also draw out the journey of children aside from their parents through domestic violence and what is required for that support.  It is a unique journey that needs dedicated attention.  Safe Ireland was very concerned to ensure that the issue of children was included in the new national strategy so there is a lot of work to be done there.</p> <p>  In respect of the legacy of Covid, Safe Ireland's position is that Covid did not cause domestic violence; it exposed it.  It may have increased it where perpetrators were locked in a smaller domain but it certainly did not cause it.  We were very strong on that because that is another distraction.  </p> <p>  Ms Marmion will be very happy to hear me say that the whole housing approach is a model used in the UK that is effectively like a plug-in housing response around accommodation needs and domestic violence.  I will pass over to Ms Marmion, who will speak about children.</p></speech>

We encourage viewing children as victims in their own right.  We are very aware of the work we do with children and how they are triangulated in this experience.  It is a triadic experience for them.  The Senator mentioned assaults on children.</p><p>There is an opportunity for us to widen the lens in terms of the experience of coercive control that children battle with on an ongoing basis.  They are often embroiled in coercively controlling behaviours and their space for action is limited.  We must move away from that physical incident model and understand the complexity of the experience for children and young people.  Obviously, when we understand the depth and breadth of their experience, we are more inclined to be more engaged and to dedicate resources towards the safeguarding of children in this context.</p></speech>

We are aware of the cultural differences.  We educate people, especially migrant women, on the laws associated with the protection of children.  The issue of FGM is something that also affects underage girls so that is one of the reasons for our recommendation.  The first thing that I noticed in the recent announcement from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment was an absence of diversity.  There is an opportunity to include contributors from other backgrounds in order to ensure the curriculum is future-proofed and takes into account the diversity that now exists in modern Ireland.  That is a very important aspect and will support our collective efforts to safeguard children in Ireland.</p></speech>

The other critical thing is how being a witness or a victim as a child translates towards being a victim or perpetrating later in life.  That is something we have come across.  We believe a significant amount of work needs to be done to recognise the trauma that children experience within these kinds of relationships and the impact that has on them, and on the relationships they have with their parents and members of their extended family.<br/><br/>The legacy of Covid has been mentioned.  I fully concur with Ms McDermott's comment that Covid did not bring about domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, but it certainly increased the visibility of such violence.  One positive thing that emerged from Covid was an initiative within the Department of Justice.  When the pandemic began, the concepts of staying at home and staying safe were anathema for people who found themselves in certain circumstances.  As a result, the Department brought together a consortium of organisations that provide safety and supports to victims of domestic violence as part of a campaign to ensure people knew that support was still available and in place.  A really significant campaign, <i>stillhere.ie</i>, came out of that.  It was really important that the Department listened to the providers on the ground and took their advice.  The initial conversation was not about the <i>stillhere.ie</i>campaign, but something else.  When the campaign came about, it let people know that help was still available and that it was okay for them to travel outside the 5 km limit to seek support.  That is a positive legacy.  Certainly the Department is looking at other ways to address these issues, including coercive control.  We saw the recent media campaigns on coercive control.</p></speech>

I am quite moved by the contribution made by Deputy Carroll MacNeill and thank her for it.  What stood out for me in the contribution made by Ms McDermott was the need to call this out as a large-scale social problem.  If we can address it, we will fix a lot of things.</p> <p>  Deputy Carroll MacNeill spoke about the core axis of sex, gender and sexuality.  That is helpful for me as a queer man on this committee in terms of how I can contribute to the committee.  I believe I have found my tribe here.  It is a great privilege for me to be a member of this committee, but I must figure out my place on it.  I found the Deputy's contribution quite helpful.  The response to the murder of Declan Flynn in Fairview Park triggered the first Pride march, which travelled all the way from Liberty Hall to Fairview Park.  I will always remember that one of the banners at the march said "Stop Violence Against Gays and Women".  We have parallel struggles.  I thank everyone for spelling these things out today.</p></speech>

We welcome the Senator's words because we believe that if we use the terms "sex", "gender" and "sexuality" we will begin to account for all of the dimensions of our intimate lives, for the reproductive or non-reproductive capacities of our bodies and how they affect us materially and symbolically, for our gender identities, and for how we choose to express ourselves.  We are forced into social and personal roles because of stereotypes.  The other binary in the area of sexuality that I did not put into this space is of course the hairy one of masculinities and femininities, and how they play out differently on all the sexes, all the genders and all our desiring roles.  Violence and domination is eroticised to the extent that it is considered part of love and intimacy.  No wonder it is so difficult to deal with.  That is part of the work we do in Safe Ireland.  We try to dismantle that.  We try to dismantle that in schools in order that children do not think the adrenaline rush of fear is necessarily love.</p></speech>

I had to attend a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I captured much of the beginning of the presentations made by the witnesses.</p> <p>  All of us, like Senator Warfield, are trying to find our way on this committee and discover what role we can play.  The question of how men respond to this issue is a key one.  Senator Warfield is right when he says that both men and women are often the victims of toxic masculinity and are limited by it.  In saying that, I do not in any way deviate from the very serious issue of domestic violence.  How can we get that conversation to happen in the places where it is most needed, such as a changing room after a GAA game or a WhatsApp group of lads who are going on a stag weekend?  I am not sure I ever thought I would hear myself say this, but maybe Donald Trump was right when he said that men say certain things in those places.  Not all men say them, but some men do.  It is a question of how to start a conversation among young men.  We know there are huge issues around mental health, the rate of suicide among young men and the role of young men in society.  How do we start this conversation in a constructive way?   My comments are probably directed towards MDN, but I would welcome replies from everybody.  How can the State put in place programmes with voluntary organisations to start the conversation?</p><p>How do we ensure that the conversation continues in families where there might be generational differences of opinion and, where AkiDwA's area is concerned, cultural differences as well?  These are broad questions, but I would appreciate feedback on the issue.</p><p> AkiDwA's submission refers to the registration fee for victims of domestic violence when registering for the first time.  Will the witnesses from AkiDwA expand on that point?  I apologise if they have already done so and I missed it.  I welcome my colleague, Ms Adejinmi.  It is good to see her in the Oireachtas.  We may see more of her in future.</p></speech>

We work through a transformative approach.  This is a positive approach, one that is strengths based and engages them on their mental health in these areas.  Under our White Ribbon campaign, a pledge is made never to commit, condone or remain silent on violence against women or gender-based violence.  This is a critical and bold statement and we need to give young men and boys agency to say it.</p> <p>  After the Ashling Murphy case, there was a great deal of conversation and many people said that we needed to get men and boys involved in that conversation.  While that is true, we must also decide how.  We need to tell men and boys to buy a white ribbon, take the pledge and have that conversation.  We talk about stepping into the conversation.  There are three steps: men and boys need to step into the conversation, listen to the women in their lives, hear their testimony and understand what they are talking about and where they are coming from; they need to step up and challenge the attitudes and behaviours, not of everyone, but of their peers and friends in locker room-type conversations and say that they are not comfortable with them and they are not what should be happening; and step back and acknowledge our privilege as men.

We also need to step back and reflect on our own privilege and what we can do to encourage a greater understanding of and empathy and emotional intelligence around that.</p> <p>  I will pass over to Mr. Kelly Ryan, who has a more specific understanding of the White Ribbon campaign.</p></speech>

There is a level of innovation in the draft third national strategy whereby we begin to talk about prevention and we are clear on what that means.  It was nearly a subpoint in the first and second national strategies - it was a paragraph.  When discussing deconstructing structural inequalities, structural human rights abuses, structural racism and structural discrimination against LGBTI+ communities, though, it requires more than a subparagraph.  It requires a commitment as well as structural and tangible priorities.  I use that term strongly because it is a priority.  I hope that, in finding its role, the committee will share our view that prevention is a priority if we want to change these circumstances.  We in the network say that prevention is better than intervention.  If we can prevent it from happening and can engage with men and boys using a strengths-based, non-judgmental and non-adversarial approach on changing the norms in society, creating safe spaces for reflection and moving towards action, that is how we will make change happen.  This is how we do our work.  If we want to become a more human rights and gender equal society-----</p></speech>

When we consider what the basis for doing this would be and how we could make it happen, it is in recognition that, under Article 14.2 of the Istanbul Convention, education can take place in informal education settings.  I am sure Deputy Carroll MacNeill will ask us how we take these measures in a formal education setting, but it can also take place in informal settings.<br/><br/>I know that we are short on time but, as Deputy McAuliffe has mentioned, this conversation needs to take place in family homes as well.  We need to ensure that it takes place in a safe manner.  The challenge is getting the message into the family home and permeating that space.  In the Constitution, we recognise that the family home is a private space for family life.  At the core of how we will do this are awareness-raising campaigns, messaging and the use of media and social media.  I will refer once more to Article 30(b) of general recommendation No. 35 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, which reads:</p> <blockquote> 	These programmes should target: (a) women and men at all levels of society; (b) education, health, social services and law enforcement personnel and other professionals and agencies, including at the local level [the community level, which is close to the family home, and this is an important point to remember], involved in prevention and protection responses; (c) traditional and religious leaders; and (d) perpetrators of any form of gender-based violence, so as to prevent recidivism. </blockquote> <p>I am sure this matter will be raised later, but what I am talking about is that the scope of the messaging and how we have this conversation need to be human rights based, holistic and tackle the structural inequalities in our society while also engaging with men and boys through a strengths-based approach, not through a deficit-based approach that says men are broken and may be the perpetrators.  Instead, we need to tell men and boys that they can be allies - that is the key word - in ending gender-based violence and promoting gender equality.<br/><br/>I hope this has answered the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I wish to ask Ms McDermott a question.  Recently, I engaged with a local domestic violence service provider.  One of the issues that was strongly raised was that there appeared to be an imbalance being created between funding and the governance and compliance requirements on the service.  What is being asked of services is increasing but funding is not increasing to match it.  The impact of inflation on the delivery of these services is becoming more profound.  Will Ms McDermott and the gentlemen comment on their experience in this regard?</p> <p>  Ms McDermott spoke about "the full accommodation and support needs of women in their journey to freedom."  What is her opinion on the current structure for funding the provision of refuge spaces?  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has responsibility over this area, but the provision of refuge capacity lies with Tusla.  Is that relationship something that Ms McDermott would like to see changed?  Is there a more streamlined and efficient way of providing funding so that it results in better delivery?</p> <p>  Other commentators have mentioned regionalisation, joint policing committees, JPCs, and the capacity to speak.  At what other forums do this issue and all issues that relate to gender-based violence need to be discussed?  An issue that I have been examining is that of JPCs.  It is not that long since domestic violence figures started being extrapolated out within the crime statistics.  Are we at a point where membership of our local JPCs needs to be designated and retained for those who work in the area of DSGBV?</p></speech>

Even when we describe that, given the work that we do, we are conscious that migrant women are not a homogeneous group.  They come from different ethnic backgrounds but also immigration status.  It has affected the way they integrate into society and the way they receive support and any other kind of services, including coming out of isolation to look for those services.  We spoke so much about if a woman comes as a dependant of her spouse, she comes under that spouse's dependency and she has to be with him so that she can get her residency or, if they are claiming for international protection if they come as a couple, refugee status.  One will find quite often that women will not report on what is happening because if they leave that abusive pattern, they will not have access to social welfare because of the habitual residency.  Sometimes they are accepted by the refuges, but refuges also have the right not to accept them because of the public funds and the way it works.  It is difficult for them.</p> <p>  AkiDwA and some other organisations came together and formed a coalition in 2011 and 2012 and that is how the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, guidelines, that help women who are experiencing violence to seek independent status, were sought.  We are saying that while this is there, and it is a good and welcome development, it is still within the discretion of the Minister.  It should be out there and automatic that if a woman who is a dependant of a spouse, where they have type 3 stamp duty because stamp 3 spouses are not allowed to work, she could be able to access social welfare easily and that she can get out of that violent relationship.</p> <p>  Under stamp 3, they were not allowed to work but we know things are changing.  We even have some people in international protection now working.  These things need to be looked into.</p> <p>  Also, the issue of the family reunification is important.  It is maybe not even a partner joining but the family member who can help such a woman to be able to support the family and to support her when she is going through that.  In Ireland, we still have significant issues and challenges on family reunification which need to be looked into.</p> <p>  I hope I have addressed that.  I do not know whether any of my colleagues want to answer any of the other questions.</p></speech>

Either the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or Tusla should have full responsibility, but perhaps not Tusla because of what the organisation stands for.  There needs to be a particular focus on the woman, on the victim.  The children are also victims, often, by association, for witnessing and being traumatised by what they witness but there needs to be an increased focus in terms of providing refuge and then stepping it up to providing stand-alone accommodation.</p> <p>  Another current issue is if the family have a mortgage, for example, for the victim to access, if the woman has to leave the home.  That was an example that has been given because of the pressure of family.  The woman has to flee the home.  She cannot get access straight away to social housing because of the joint-----</p></speech>

The starting point here - we put it in our No Going Back document - is we are dealing currently with a 19th century infrastructure trying to respond to 21st century problems.  There is no coherent national process around this.  I need not say that the services - the front-line providers - are working day and night to try and provide services under very stressed circumstances but what is really of burden to them is that every year there are annual service level agreements, SLA, and there is no long-term planning.  Multi-annual funding is it.</p> <p>  I refer to the backroom work that we need to do for governance, compliancy and recording.  I note that last week there was an extended discussion around issues of therapeutic notes and disclosure, recording and data protection.  All of these issues are a burden and our front-line services - every one of those independent organisations - need full resourcing to do that back work.  Everyone in this chamber will fully appreciate that over the past two years under Covid people responded from the heart with great generosity.  They want to see the front-line provision but it is difficult to get well-grounded fully sustained resourcing for the backroom work for compliance, governance, finance, data protection, and IT infrastructure and managing in order that we can communicate with each other in a systematic and meaningful way and, therefore, crucially, that we can provide a coherent national fully-functioning 21st century infrastructure for domestic violence in the country.</p> <p>  With regard to regional structures, in response to Deputy Clarke I would say that there are various options.  We have worked positively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are various ways in which we interact but, again, I would say this is part of the national strategy's work.  We should not in a rush shoehorn domestic violence into any of the previous existing structures that are inappropriate.  We should take time, sit down, draw up the terms of reference, make the process consultative and co-design, which, as we know, is welcomed at present.  That is what we need.</p> <p>  I do not know if my colleague, Ms Lisa Marmion, has anything to say.  Ms Marmion has been sitting, witnessing.</p></speech>

There are certain limitations in using the children and young people's services committees, CYPSC, model that is in place, certainly, in terms of my own understanding of it.</p> <p>  I will return to the area of compliance.  As much as we fully wish to adhere to it in the charity sector or wherever, to give the committee a sense of what happens in terms of refuge provision, I would make two points.  The first is that at present it is through the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and one has to be a housing association to provide refuge.  There is considerable compliance attached to that in its own right, let alone the compliance of service delivery.  There is significant back-up support required in terms of fulfilling all one's obligations as a charity or as a company limited by guarantee.  There is not significant support.  Certainly, from our organisation's experience, we have to find ways in which to try and support the ongoing roll-out of our programme of work because we do not get the dedicated funding in relation to that.</p></speech>

There needs to be an acknowledgement in terms of funding coming in to organisations that allows them to operate.  There are programmes, such as the scheme to support national organisations, SSNO, from Pobal.  Unfortunately, we do not have support from that at present.  Hopefully, we will be successful in the next round.  It would be great.  That is the point I wanted to make on that.</p></speech>

I am conscious we have kept everyone over two hours and we still have private business.

I really appreciate it.  In terms of preventative measures, it is about educating not just men and boys but people in general.  We need more integration.  We need to look at our education system, institutions and same-sex schools.  Part of the issue, to borrow Deputy McAuliffe's phrase, is prevention rather than intervention.  If we can get them at that early stage to acknowledge equality of the sexes that will go a long way to doing away with the malaise we experience in later life.  Somebody also mentioned the media.  Advertising and trying to discontinue stereotypical product promotion can also get to homes.  That would be a way of educating people within homes without being too intrusive.</p></speech>

His commentary was that they have sprung up where communities, rather than the State, have responded and that that is the wrong way to approach it and there needs to be the national infrastructure that we talk about.</p> <p>  We are having the same issue with hospitals, schools and all other sorts of areas where we allowed voluntary or previously religious groups operate our social services, but this is slightly different.  How do we integrate people who are currently providing those services into a national infrastructure that takes on board their experience and marries it with a national infrastructure to provide those services, in a way that they do not feel disempowered?</p> <p>  By the same token, inevitably, finances may be different when we move to a national structure.  There may be regional structures and contracts of service that include the back end and financial management, rather than just a per-night type of approach.  Has Ms McDermott talked about how we marry our voluntary system with a new State system?  I know that is a lot to ask.</p></speech>

The position that we have in our initial discussions among ourselves has really been that in the new roll-out of refuge, it is very important that, precisely, we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.  We need land and gifts, for example, to be free and unencumbered and for the ethos, ideology or development around domestic, sexual and gender-based violence to follow and track the findings of a House such as this, in order that the Government has a guide over what is right for the citizens of this country.  That is a very important part of what we do.</p> <p>  With regard to the process of merging, we cannot underestimate the breadth and depth of knowledge and expertise in the networks of refuge and support services around the country.  They have to be absolutely front and centre in guiding, advisory and consultative, if not lead, roles as the local communities see fit.  However, this is a process of consultation and design.  If we take the time to do it, we will not repeat the difficulties of the past.  The Deputy has put his finger on a thorny issue that we need to talk through, as a democracy and a republic.</p></speech>

We talk about the three "Rs" in our education system; reading, writing and arithmetic.  There needs to be a fourth "R" which looks at the holistic nature of engaging with young people in an age-appropriate way, from Montessori, right through to third level.  That needs to be a continuous run that is age appropriate, addresses all of the areas around healthy relationships, consent, gender equality, gender-based violence and is done in a particular programme that runs its way through the organisation.</p> <p>  The other thing that needs to happen is that it needs to be graded in some way.  I do not say that on the basis that people learn this thing but it is the one way in which the schools and teachers will see a need for it.  They will know what the benchmark is in terms of making sure they do these programmes.  Many programmes go into schools and they are not part of the integrated or the full, core curriculum.  Schools and teachers then do not know what is success in terms of the programme.</p> <p>  They also do not put the time and effort into it, as they know that when the cigire comes along they do not have to worry about what the issue is in terms of the healthy relationship, the issue of consent or even the concept of climate and gender.  All of those types of things need to be incorporated in the CSPE model and it needs to be broadened at that extent.  Critically, there needs to be a continuity that runs from the very early stages right through.</p> <p>  Part of that, certainly, is using a particular model of engagement, whether it is with girls or boys.  It is about a non-judgmental approach.  It is about saying we are not trying to fix them, but are inviting them into a conversation around what they need to do and how they need to bring it home into the family.</p> <p>  My biggest problem with school sometimes is that they are overrun with many different programmes that they have to go into.  It is very difficult to get time and space to do stuff.  Really, we need to have a fourth element to our core curriculum that-----</p></speech>

A lot can be achieved in that way.  With education, we must look at all the stakeholders: the children, the providers, that is, the school and then the home environment with the parents who support outside of the school environment.  Every area has to be looked at with inclusion among our educators because that will also help with the continuity of learning and making sure that every aspect is integrated in every subject which is possible, as Mr. Cooke began to highlight there.</p></speech>

We mentioned the curriculum.  Mr. Cooke mentioned the need for integration.  It needs to be integrated and inclusive.  The curriculum that we have now does not reflect the diversity of people in Ireland today.  It has to go deeper and look at grounds of discrimination, for example.  You are in school with the children who have one parent, and others who may come from different backgrounds, including ethnic and religious.  The curriculum needs to be holistic and not only integrated but also very inclusive from primary level all the way up.</p></speech>

I return to sex, gender and sexuality and how it is handled in schools.  Core to that whole dynamic is the issue of violence and control in intimacy and what that is all about.  We talk about consent and who would not support that?  On the other hand, one of the most dispiriting things I heard within a short time of this issue being raised was that you already had young men asking young women to sign a consent on the phone to say that they had agreed to sex.  Consent is completely meaningless without context and the issue of choice: whose choice; what are you choosing; whose desire is at play here?  Famously women's desire is always rather submerged.</p></speech>

He was talking about the private sphere which is greatly protected but I would raise the separation of the world into private and public is itself a patriarchal construct.  It is a place where men divide what may be counted and not counted as real, not least among them, violence.  I was having a very interesting conversation with a UK expert last week when she said that if we look again at the figures around violent crime and put the private sphere into that assessment and take the outliers out, for the data nerds, then the most prevalent form of violence is of men against women.  And we all know that intuitively.  The division of the private and public is problematic, as I said in my opening remarks, which has been redrawn during Covid but also within an educational context.  There is the attitude of "We cannot talk about that here".  We have to sit down and talk about all this.  That is where we want to go.</p></speech>

I really appreciate it.  I thank the Deputy for the question.  First, I would highlight that education also needs to extend into the world of work.  We know that patriarchal structures, since time immemorial, put down women and girls.  I would call for an action that is in the national strategy and is something that we have lobbied the Government on this for the last eight months namely, the ratification of ILO convention 190 and implementation of recommendation 206.<br/><br/>Second, I want to refer to an observation made by our colleagues and friends, from the National Women's Council of Ireland in its submission to the Department of Justice in June 2021.  It noted that consent education is an important element of DSGBV education it is but one aspect, albeit an important one.  Consent as the primary framing or focus fails to capture the inherent complexities of DSGBV.  I would echo that.  This needs to be a broader human rights, and as our colleagues at AkiDwa mentioned, holistic approach to the issue.<br/><br/>There are broader measures required.  The Istanbul Convention speaks of legislative measures also.<br/><br/>I will quote from the Department of Justice report on legislating for hate speech and hate crime last year.  It states: &quot;Measures ranging from education and awareness to codes of conduct and professional standards are essential to any comprehensive approach to tackling hate speech and hate crime, including by effective prevention.&quot;  What I noted in reviewing that report is that there are some very clear nexuses in relation to the intersectionality <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>who experiences hate crime and speech in this country and who may be at heightened risk of experiencing domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  We need to ensure that the education programme we have is age appropriate, that it begins at primary level but that it does tackle-----</p></speech>

On education, consent and sex education in school and our education system, I know of many Traveller children who were told they did not have to do sex education or consent education on the grounds of culture.  I have seen this with Muslim people and black people too.  That is something that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  I welcome the Men's Development Network here today.  When we do talk about gender we include men in that conversation as well.</p> <p>  Very quickly, I wish to refer to refuges.  I do not know if anyone can answer this question.  To the best of my knowledge, from my own personal experiences working as a community development worker on the ground with people from ethnic minority groups, our refuges are not fit for purpose for use by all women.  They are not inclusive of all women from ethnic minority groups.  </p> <p>  As Ms McDermott just pointed out, racism can be in school.  We need to educate our children in how to not be racist.  Much of the time education starts at home.  Unfortunately, we educate our children to hate and to be racist and we normalise it within our society, especially towards members of the Traveller community.</p> <p>  We need a bigger conversation around how our refuges can be inclusive and can meet the needs of women, especially from ethnic minority groups.  Our education system should be inclusive of all of our children.  They all need the same information around consent.  No matter what older traditions there are or anything that goes with that, it is still eventually going to happen.  People need to be educated and that includes Traveller people.  If your culture puts men in one place and women in another, there is an issue with the culture.  Sometimes our systems can put men from different cultures in one place and women in another.  That is very unfair in general.  That is a general point that I would like to make.</p></speech>

It is about the inclusivity of all aspects of provision, whether it be women or men.  As was said, we do not have provision in place for men.  We do not think it is a requirement to have a dedicated refuge for men but others might have a different opinion on that.  We think there are much more appropriate wrap-around services and that client support systems are the way to go forward.  When we talk about refuge, whether it be the model of compliance and governance or whether it is delivery, we need to have a broad discussion on it.  I would fully concur with what Ms McDermott and our friends from AkiDwA said.</p></speech>

This is about all front-line services providing what we call culturally competent services.  Anybody who is providing a service should do so because the issue of culture and people not understanding other different issues which are happening in Ireland which are sometimes different to the culture where they are coming from can be difficult.  AkiDwA has produced training on cultural competency.  To date, Women's Aid and Ruhama have taken this training and we are calling everybody to take this training.  This training has to be provided by people who experienced these kind of challenges when they went looking for services.  We cannot provide training on the culture of Travellers; they have to be there.  The Senator also mentioned the key issue of racism in children.  We have racist bullying in residential areas and schools and that is why we go back to the curriculum and education for how we tackle these issues because we have to talk about them as well.</p></speech>

That lends to Deputy McAuliffe's point about the refuge services that are available nationwide and why there should be uniformity of service.  The experience is traumatic enough as it is and the response to those experiences are informing every refuge service around the country to support these victims who desperately need help to rebuild their confidence and trust in society.</p></speech>

I refer to Deputy McAuliffe's point on the origins and history of refuge in Irish society.  We know, for example, that in certain areas there are groups that predominantly fill the refuges.  Particular groups will fill particular refuges depending on the population of the area.  There is no manager or CEO of a refuge or service around the country who would not agree with every word that has been said.  The question is around resourcing, training and upskilling and this is the moment when we can do it.  Cultural competence training and so on is needed.  At one point we were talking to embassies to try to provide translation facilities but we are trying to do it on the run and we need a large-scale and systematic response that covers all of this.</p></speech>

There are also issues around class, which are really interesting, and which fall in ways one might not think they would.
