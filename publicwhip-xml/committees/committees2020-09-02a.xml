I thank our guests for appearing before the committee.  There are two matters to flag.  The first is that we have a technical issue with our feed this morning so, while our guests can see and hear us, we will be able to hear them but not necessarily see them.  It is also possible that the feed will come in and out and there might be a slight time delay.  It is just one of those things.  It will not be quite as smooth as usual but we can cope with that.  Second, I believe that our guests from F&oacute;rsa had a problem and were a bit delayed but they are here now and everything is okay.</p> <p>  We have been notified that Deputies Boyd Barrett, Paul Murphy, Gannon, Devlin, Murnane O'Connor, McAuliffe, P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan and Cahill will substitute for their party colleagues today.  May I take it that the 42 items of correspondence received are noted?  Agreed.</p></speech>

From the TUI, I welcome Mr. Martin Marjoram, president, Mr. Michael Gillespie, general secretary; from the ASTI, Ms Ann Piggott, president, Mr. Kieran Christie, general secretary; from the INTO, Mr. John Boyle, general secretary, and Ms Mary Magner, president; and from F&oacute;rsa, Mr. Andy Pike, national secretary, and Ms Liz Fay, industrial relations officer.  They are all very welcome to our meeting this morning.</p><p>Before we commence the formal proceedings, I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, they must respect that direction.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I thank all our guests for all the work that each organisation and its members have done to try to get schools reopened safely this week.  Everybody is extremely grateful and we look forward to this session.</p><p>I invite Mr. Gillespie to make his opening statement and ask him to confine it to five minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Gillespie" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#C00400"><p>The Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, welcomes this opportunity to address the committee today.  Our 19,500 members deliver high-quality public education across a wide range of settings, including second level schools and colleges, centres for education, institutes of technology and technological universities.  The TUI would like to thank all the principals and deputy principals, teachers, special needs assistants, school secretaries and caretakers, all of whom have worked tirelessly over the past few months to get schools ready to welcome back students.</p> <p>  The closure of school buildings on 12 March and its impact on staff and students have demonstrated beyond doubt that, notwithstanding the significant efforts made to ensure continuity of learning, nothing replaces face-to-face teaching and learning.  The schools we left on 12 March have been completely reconfigured and look very different.  A TUI survey of more than 120 second level schools, conducted in mid-August, illustrated significant challenges involved in a safe reopening, including difficulties employing contractors to make adjustments to buildings and difficulties recruiting teachers at a time when a two-tier pay system imposed by the Government is still undermining the morale of the profession.  The injustice of the two-tier pay system came to the fore again when the Department provided additional supervision to schools and decided to pay teachers differently, depending on their start date, to undertake the exact same work.  This damaging discrimination needs to end.</p> <p>  TUI members will not accept any departure from the public health guidelines, including the absolute necessity to maintain a physical distance of not less than 1 m - preferably 2 m - in our schools.  Unfortunately, we have had reports in recent days of schools that have not yet put the necessary measures in place.  We reiterate that the TUI will not permit non-compliance on this key issue.  The entire school community must observe and respect public health advice and do everything possible to minimise the spread of Covid-19.  Schools have already made significant adjustments, but they need the ability to ensure compliance with these measures.  Therefore, a nationally mandated addendum to a school&rsquo;s code of behaviour is required.  As soft face coverings are a critical safety measure, a policy is needed to prevent the wearing of soft face coverings with slogans or logos that may be offensive in a school community. </p> <p>  While the TUI welcomes the resources put in place by the Department to date, the challenges faced by schools are significant because our education system was chronically underfunded before the current health emergency, with the lowest spend on second level education compared with other OECD countries and the largest class size in Europe.  Furthermore, it is necessary that a safe and available school transport system is in place for all students who rely on that service.  The TUI will keep the circumstances in each school under review and if more resources are required, we will unapologetically seek them.</p><p>Any delay in providing necessary resources puts at unacceptable risk the health and safety of our school communities.</p><p> Many teachers do not have school-provided ICT devices.  They are uploading licensed software to personal devices.  This is unsatisfactory.  Teachers also need ICT training, in case the need arises to close a school partially or fully.</p><p> Some schools have a significant number of students categorised as very high risk and additional resources will be needed to ensure those students have access to technology to continue their education at home.  A major obstacle in this regard is the digital divide, where some students simply do not have access to broadband or the required technology to engage effectively.  Failure to address this will exacerbate inequality.</p><p> We must not forget that a teacher&rsquo;s workplace is the school and schools are crowded places.  A teacher working in a classroom of 49 sq. m can have up to 24 students with him or her in a class.  Some teachers have been categorised by the occupational health provider, OHP, as being at high risk although their own medical advisers have categorised them as being very high risk and working like this creates acute anxiety in the workplace.  The TUI made strong representations to the Minister on this matter and confirmation of an appeal process is welcome.  Given the rise in the number of young adults being tested for Covid-19, and the fact that many of our students are young adults, the TUI asserts that access to rapid Covid-19 testing for all staff and students is essential to help limit disruption in schools.  </p><p> We welcome the adjustments to the assessments for State examinations.  However, further adjustments to the curriculum or assessments or both may also be required as circumstances unfold.  Our students with special educational needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds cannot be forgotten or left behind.  Customised interventions and supports may be required to reintegrate them into school.  Our members will work to ensure these students are identified early and prioritised.  Failure to do so will have a lifelong effect on these students. </p><p> The TUI has stated emphatically and repeatedly that we will operate in accordance with the public health advice.  We will not put our students, their families, their communities and teachers at risk.  Our members have played a critical role in reopening our schools but we now need to tackle the next challenges, which include keeping schools open and making sure no student, for whatever reason, is left behind and that teachers can maintain a worthwhile educational experience for all students.  The Department of Education and Skills needs to maintain the intensive ongoing engagement between the various partners to meet these challenges.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Christie" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#D00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation.</p> <p>  Planning for the return to school was a fraught and complex process and there is a lot of trepidation and worry amongst ASTI members.  Phenomenal work to prepare was undertaken by school management teams, teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and ancillary staff across the country.  Over those weeks, the ASTI commissioned research and some of the sample findings included 84% of principals reporting that their schools did not have a dedicated ventilation system and 25% of principals stating their schools did not have warm water in the school toilet facilities.  A previous RED C survey commissioned by the ASTI found that 49% of teachers believed they work in schools with overcrowding in classrooms and 60% considered that there was inadequate storage available for staff and students.  Indeed, Ireland ranks last of 35 OECD countries for investment in second-level education as a percentage of GDP. </p> <p>  This lack of investment must be addressed if schools are to continue to operate safely in the context of Covid-19.  The ASTI is demanding that the Department of Education and Skills commission new school buildings and, in the meantime, order prefabs in recognition that the Government's approach of living alongside the virus into the future is going to require major investment in school infrastructure.  Concerns also emerged about the feasibility of social distancing for students throughout school buildings, with 70% of principals surveyed rating the feasibility of social distancing in school corridors and other communal areas as weak.</p> <p>  We demand that an urgent review be undertaken of the physical distancing requirements for schools, given the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, advice that only six people should congregate in any indoor setting and the lack of clarity in the guidance that underpins the operation of schools.  We wrote to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and to the Minister for Health seeking a meeting with the HPSC, but our request has been declined thus far.  </p> <p>  We have a question about the possibility of putting fast-track testing in place for schools in order to get results back in 24 hours, similar to those in the healthcare system, or within 48 hours at most.  Why has this not been recommended and put in place?  Why was there no recommendation to put Perspex, for instance, in front of teachers&rsquo; desks in classrooms, as I notice is in front of the Acting Chairman here today?</p><p>Why is there no temperature testing, at least for adults, when they arrive in school each day?  Why was no guidance given on the numbers that could congregate for assemblies and staff meetings in schools?</p><p> We also seek clarity on the safety issues involved for students and teachers in the high-risk category.  The ASTI has members whose illnesses include chronic kidney disease, cancer and serious heart disease.  Anxiety levels among this group are very high.  It is unconscionable that teachers who suffer the likes of these illnesses are being required to return to classrooms teaching sizeable groups.  The ASTI demands alternative arrangements, such as working from home, for teachers who are in the high-risk category.  </p><p> Additional concerns that we would like to discuss with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, have emerged further to the publication last week of the document, Schools Pathway for Covid-19, the Public Health approach.  Provisions that are of concern include that where a case has been confirmed, it will not be automatically assumed that a whole class will be deemed as close contacts; there is no blanket policy on testing entire year groups and classes in place; schools are not to inform parents or staff if a pupil or staff member goes home with symptoms; if someone goes home with symptoms, other staff and students do not need to be removed from the class, including siblings or other household members; and contact tracing will be done on a case-by-case basis.  Experts have argued that if a single child is infected, the entire pod has to go home and isolate for two weeks and get tested.  It is regrettable that those who are effectively making the decisions on these matters are refusing to meet representatives of those directly affected by them.</p><p> In addition, the Department of Education and Skills appears to be doing very little planning for the possibility that there might be individual schools or groups of schools closing down for a period.  We all want the sustained reopening of schools and hope that this will not happen.  However, this virus has shown itself to be persistent and it would be foolhardy to discount the possibility of closures. </p><p> Since the closure of schools in March 2020, the ASTI has repeatedly stated that remote learning is no replacement for face-to-face interaction between students and their teachers.  That is a given.  We have deep concerns about the lack of access to IT resources and broadband in many households.  Teachers have spoken of finding three and four siblings working from one device.  We have demanded that the Department of Education and Skills bulk purchase laptops for students and teachers so that every student has access to reliable IT equipment in the event of future closures.</p><p> On another matter, while the appointment of additional second level teachers is to be welcomed, the measure is inadequate in terms of achieving manageable class sizes and cover for Covid-19 sick leave during the pandemic.  This is a major concern.</p><p> Investment in education must be seriously increased.  We need support for teacher and student health and well-being, particularly the provision of alternative arrangements for the most medically vulnerable in our school communities.  Guidance and advice to the system related to physical distancing need to be reviewed and updated.  Staffing levels need to be adequately maintained and there must be proper contingency arrangements put in place to prepare for all eventualities. </p><p> My colleague from the TUI mentioned the situation regarding equal pay for equal work.  It is unfortunate that the pandemic has not put an end to those kinds of practices in schools.  We also call for an end to them.  I will have additional points to make later.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Boyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#E00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee this week as more than 500,000 pupils and 50,000 staff return to their primary and special school buildings.  There is excitement and trepidation in equal measure.  While INTO members are taking on the challenge of restarting formal education in the school system, it is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that all reasonable steps have been taken and all protections are in place to safeguard the members of the school community.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the progress made to date by the Department of Education and Skills with strong input from stakeholders, including the INTO.  The publication of the roadmap for primary and special schools was welcomed.  The urgent calls for additional resources and a centralised procurement system for the purchase of hand sanitiser and personal protective equipment, PPE, were listened to and acted upon.  The additional grants to schools are also welcome and efforts to ensure they were paid in a timely fashion are appreciated.  We also welcome the establishment of the supply panels and other teacher supply measures as a way to improve access to substitute teachers in the event of a teacher becoming sick or self-isolating with Covid-19 symptoms.</p><p>The INTO further welcomes the announcement that no new school self-evaluation activities will be expected this year, and that the inspectorate&rsquo;s role will be more advisory and supportive.</p><p> I commend the serious volume of work that was done in schools throughout the country all over the summer, especially the sacrifices made by principal teachers and those who directly supported them.  As we know, classrooms have been reconfigured and stripped of extraneous furniture, new sanitation stations have been installed, one-way systems have been mapped out, signage has been placed everywhere and communication with parents is ongoing.  These practical matters are all in addition to the many changes involved in classroom management, supervising and reassuring pupils, creating class bubbles and pods and adapting the curriculum and teaching and learning to fit the new reality.  Returning safely to school is a common goal shared by all members of the school community.  Ongoing communication via the national media will be vital to ensure buy-in from the entire school community.  Clear advice and guidance for parents on supporting their children will be required throughout the entire year.</p><p> As has been stated by my colleagues, we must facilitate teachers who are in the high risk category.  We called for and received assurances that a robust appeal mechanism will be available to those who dispute original medical evaluations conducted by the occupational health service, Medmark.  We must also ensure that everyone in the education sector has quick access to testing and tracing and that there is an ongoing surveillance system for the education sector.  Schools are essential services and they are now the new front line in the battle against Covid-19.  Of course, our teachers want to be back in school but they must have full confidence that where a case arises all necessary measures, to use the words of Dr. Ronan Glynn, will be taken to protect students and staff.</p><p> It is also essential that employers show flexibility for workers whose children have to self-isolate and that such workers receive payment while they are absent from their workplaces minding sick children.  Otherwise, they will be disinclined to keep their children at home, adding further pressure and making schools unsafe.  School leaders will need ongoing access to guidance, in addition to their leadership and management days, to deal with the additional responsibilities that continue to fall on them.  The introduction of planned changes to the system and non-essential paperwork should be suspended for the duration of the Covid-19 crisis.  Stakeholder consultations are ongoing, and they will be vital to ensure that any change in circumstances can be anticipated, planned for and reacted to in a timely and comprehensive manner.</p><p> Just because schools are open, it does not mean there is nothing further to be done.  It is imperative that a review be undertaken, by the end of September, to assess the reopening of schools and identify improvements which may be necessary.  This review must be cross-governmental and include input from the HSA, the HSE, the inspectorate and all stakeholders.  There has to be a trusting relationship between the HSE and schools if everyone is to remain safe throughout the year.  Unless we are vigilant and in a position to adapt quickly to changing circumstances, schools may risk a second period of enforced closure.</p><p> Covid-19 has been a transformative experience for everyone in Irish society.  With regard to primary schools, it has shone a harsh light on years of underinvestment, the massive size of our primary classes and the inadequate spaces they inhabit.  No other European country had to issue illustrations of classrooms which were expected to accommodate up to 32 children in a class.  It has also highlighted the degree to which the system relies on the goodwill and professionalism of school leaders.  Principal teachers have taken on almost single-handedly the enormous task of managing the safe return to school of hundreds of thousands of children and staff.  School leaders must be supported, facilitated and remunerated to continue this vital work in the coming school year.</p><p> We need to take this opportunity to re-evaluate what is important in our society, acknowledge what are essential services and value them accordingly.</p><p>For our younger teachers, that is, those who graduated after 2010, this means that the scourge of pay inequality needs to be eliminated for once and for all.  Otherwise, after the Covid pandemic ends we will again see mass emigration of our brightest and best teachers overseas.<br/><br/>In regard to Covid-19, no one knows what will lie ahead.  However, I am proud to say that Irish primary school teachers have answered the call and responded to this unprecedented situation, often despite personal anxiety and trauma, with the professionalism, integrity and duty of care that has been their hallmark.<br/><br/><b>Acting Chairman (Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill):</b>I thank Mr. Boyle.  I ask Mr. Pike to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andy Pike" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#G00200"><p>On behalf of the close to 20,000 non-teaching staff in schools, comprising school secretaries, caretakers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and others, including bus escorts, F&oacute;rsa trade union is pleased to have been asked to attend this meeting.  We are very much looking forward to the opportunity to engage directly with the committee on these matters.  Our opening statement covers five main areas: the position of staff with underlying health conditions; the availability and use of PPE; arrangements for attendance and testing; classroom supervision; and the use of isolation rooms.</p> <p>  We wish to make it clear that as the largest public service trade union in the State, F&oacute;rsa continues to support adherence to public health advice as we have done since the outset of the pandemic.  Our comments today are intended to inform debate on the optimum way to manage the pandemic and our schools within the context of the prevailing public health advice.  </p> <p>  The position of staff returning to school with underlying health conditions continues to cause concern.  Staff such as SNAs and bus escorts are not able to practice social distancing due to the nature of their role.  SNAs work side-by-side with students throughout the school day and bus escorts work in vehicles for several hours at a time in confined spaces where social distancing is simply not possible.  </p> <p>  Not all students can or will wear face coverings.  For instance, many students with additional care needs find wearing a face covering very difficult, if not impossible.  SNAs and bus escorts also provide personal intimate care for students who will not use face coverings.  Staff with underlying health conditions who have been classified as high risk should they contract Covid-19 have in many cases been advised to attend work in circumstances, despite their treating physician or specialist having advised against this.  </p> <p>  Some progress has been made by way of securing a review of the initial occupational health assessment.  However, we remain concerned that staff may still be directed to work side-by-side with students contrary to the HSE advice which states that those in a high-risk group should work remotely and that if they have to attend a workplace they should practice strict social distancing.  This is not possible for SNAs and bus escorts.</p> <p>  The Department has advised schools that a range of PPE is available and can be purchased.  This includes face visors and medical grade face masks as commonly used throughout our health and social care services on a routine basis.  Staff are now reporting that a number of schools have either refused to purchase such equipment or are requiring staff to reuse face masks contrary to HSE advice.  It is too early to be definitive as to the extent of this problem.  We intend to survey members early next week on this issue.  We can state to the committee that a significant number of staff are today providing personal care to students without adequate PPE.  The equipment in question is in plentiful supply and is inexpensive.  A medical grade face mask that provides protection against Covid-19 costs less than 50 cent.  </p> <p>  We support the protocols for testing students and staff and note that the HSE is developing supports for school schools with regard to rapid testing.  While we hope incidents of Covid-19 transmission in our schools we low, we believe there are advantages to conducting routine testing within our schools and universities.  The introduction of regular testing in schools would maintain confidence that a safe working environment for students and staff can be maintained and would provide a degree of certainty for the school community, including parents.  </p> <p>  There is one area where we believe public health advice could be reviewed, namely, the use of temperature testing.  The current advice for parents is that children should not attend school if they have certain symptoms, including a pyrexia of 38&deg;C.  To date, temperature testing has not formed part of the measures introduced to combat the pandemic.  While there has been no formal advice to schools to track temperatures, we have dealt with many queries about whether it will be required in schools and clarification would be helpful.  </p> <p>  Other stakeholders may wish to comment on classroom supervision as it is an issue that should only affect teaching staff.</p><p>F&oacute;rsa, however, is concerned that the Department's guidance and local practice may allow for special educational needs teachers to be deployed to supervise mainstream classes to cover absences.  Such practices reduce resources for students with additional care needs.  Where this takes place, SNAs are very concerned they may then be asked to supervise classes.  This is not their role, they are not qualified to supervise classes and they receive no recognition when they have to undertake such duties on instruction from a principal.  We would prefer to see a much stronger policy from the Department on this issue.</p><p> The use of isolation rooms for students exhibiting symptoms will without doubt be problematic.  Examples are now emerging of schools having simply no space for such a facility.  In one instance the isolation area in a school consists of a small Perspex partition hanging from the ceiling in a school secretary's office.  Difficulties are also apparent in the supervision of students awaiting collection by parents where SNAs may routinely be asked to provide this supervision, taking them away from their allocated students.  We suggest that these arrangements are reviewed to ensure that students with additional care needs are not denied access to their SNAs.</p><p> The reopening of our schools is of critical importance to the well-being of students, families and our society as a whole.  The efforts made by staff across the country to ensure our schools are ready to welcome back students is an example of the public service at its best and it should be recognised accordingly.</p><p> That concludes our opening statement.  We thank the committee for the opportunity to meet and discuss these issues.</p></speech>

I was just thinking that there are very few people in Ireland who do not have a strong personal interest in this going well: children, parents, grandparents, teachers, SNAs and employers.  The closure of schools has been deeply disruptive, and we are very glad to have the witnesses here in such a timely way.  We will move on to the members.

I think it is very much appreciated by everyone, in particular parents and students.</p> <p>  Some schools have now reopened.  Has there been feedback yet as regards any substantial problems arising now of which we need to be aware?  Even before schools reopened, perhaps there were particular issues arising that were not being dealt with in a timely manner.  The representatives of the various unions might provide an outline of that.  What were the major issues that schools were identifying and on which they felt they were not getting support?</p></speech>

This varies from school to school.  It is an issue particularly in schools where the premises are somewhat older and the corridors are narrower or the classrooms smaller.  We have had contact from some members in schools where it is quite a substantial issue and we and our teachers on the ground have had to intervene to insist that arrangements change and are improved on.  It is early days but that is the more substantial aspect of it.</p> <p>  We had other issues initially but we feel they will be addressed as time goes on.  The Deputy will be aware that there was controversy early on about large congregations in schools, not only of students but also for staff meetings.  Some staff returned to school and were expected to go into sports halls.  One example was rather surprising because the number involved was 84.  Two or three more of them were in a premises in Clifden, and it was bizarre that in the context of all the controversy that that attracted, teachers were being invited to go into sports halls in those kinds of numbers.  We intervened, the Department, to be fair, was helpful and schools have now been told that the likes of that are unacceptable and that school staff meetings need to be held remotely.  We have had teething problems, particularly around the issues of congregated settings and space.</p></speech>

Have the witnesses any indication of the total number of additional staff taken on?</p><p>Do we still have some schools where they feel they are still under pressure?  Classes are obviously going to be smaller, therefore more staff will be needed including more support staff as well.  Have we any indications about how schools are managing with sourcing staff and getting them in a timely manner?</p></speech>

While we welcome the supply panels, there are some schools that are not covered, that are not having adequate substitution.  We have identified that there may be an issue in Dublin and in the larger urban areas with getting substitutes for schools.  As to the teething problems, the pandemic has certainly highlighted the large classes that we have to deal with and members are quite angry about it.  It was practically impossible to realise social distancing in some schools where there was not adequate space.  As such there was an immediate call to reduce class sizes in line with our European counterparts and our members are rightly angry and anxious that their health, safety and well-being and that of their pupils is being compromised by the larger class sizes in overcrowded classrooms around the country.</p></speech>

For many years we have been looking for a nationwide supply panel scheme, as our president, Ms Magner, has just alluded to.  As of yesterday, these supply panels will be in 101 areas.  This is a massive increase on last year when there were only six supply panels.  We think it will cover in the region of 2,000 schools.  That leaves 1,250 not covered by the scheme.</p> <p>  Other measures have been put in place which we have welcomed.  Teachers who are job-sharing can now work nine days out of ten in their own schools.  Many teachers have taken career breaks so that they could move closer to home and now that they are closer to home they can work for the whole year as a substitute.  What we are really concerned about is the fact that young teachers cannot afford to live in the big urban areas due to pay inequality and the massive cost of rents, which have not really decreased very much during the pandemic.  These young teachers will vote with their feet and will not go to the cities.  In these instances, in an area like Dublin 15, for example, we have in excess of 1,200 primary school teachers and as of yesterday we have two supply panels there which are not covering all the schools.  We have six teachers who are supposed to be looking after up to 700 teachers, some of whom may have to be absent for up to two weeks to self-isolate.  As such it is maybe a bit early yet to say for sure but we will be demanding that that scheme be kept under review because as we get into the winter and the flu season, if more people are absent we are going to have to ensure we have cover for them.  We need to ensure that what Mr. Pike is concerned about for his members will not be happening, namely that those who are not qualified to teach and have other duties to be doing, important duties around special education, will not be asked to step in to cover classes.</p> <p>  With the largest class sizes in Europe, the bottom line for us is that we cannot have classes split among the remaining teachers because that totally goes against the whole premise of keeping people safe.</p></speech>

My understanding was that the Department had agreed to the fast-tracking of tests for teachers and school staff.  What is the witnesses' understanding of that?  My understanding was that this was to be put in place.</p></speech>

I suppose it has not been applicable yet.  It is to be between 24 and 48 hours.  If one thinks about 48 hours, it will still take another day to tell people in schools so that is still quite a long time.  I read that in England people were being tested within an hour.  I know that that is not possible.  We need it to be as fast as possible.  The whole issue of teacher supply will be crucial then.  If one student in one class in a secondary school becomes ill, the six teachers they have had all day might also be off work.</p><p>Some 1,080 teachers were promised.  When shared between 723 second level schools, that is not a lot.  It is an average of 1.5 teachers per school.  That will not be enough.  During the week, I heard about a school in which there are 32 pupils in every junior class.  I presume there are more schools in the same position.  That is not acceptable by any standard.  There will also be a teacher and, perhaps, a special needs assistant, SNA, in the same classroom.  These rooms are totally overcrowded.  No social distancing whatsoever is taking place.  Schools are greatly concerned about these matters.</p></speech>

We appreciate their input in getting schools back to work this week and last week.  I spent 15 years teaching in five different schools.  I have kept in touch with many of my colleagues from that time, including both teachers and management.  There is a lot of concern out there.  People are genuinely happy to be back and kids are happy to be back with their friends but there is a degree of nervousness.  It is important that we are hear about the concerns of staff and students from the unions this morning.</p> <p>  I have a question for the representatives of the three teaching unions.  Do they have an estimate of the number of their members, at both primary and secondary level, who are considered to have a serious underlying condition?  How many such staff members have been excused from the physical workplace so far?  How many of those whose requests to work from home were turned down are attempting to appeal that decision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.34" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Gillespie" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#K00400"><p>We do not have exact figures in that regard.  We have been contacted by many people whose medical advisers have said they are at very high risk.  That is why we sought an appeal process last week.  The Minister responded to that.  We hope they will work through that appeals process and we will have a clear picture of how many people are in the very high-risk category.  Such people will be assigned to teach students who are also at very high risk at home.</p> <p>  One of the bigger problems, which I tried to mention earlier, is that there is a lack of teachers for certain subject areas at second level.  Recruitment is proving very difficult.  In a month's time, delayed retirements will hit the second level system.  We will not have the teachers to replace those retiring.  There will, therefore, be a massive shortage of teachers in the field and only a small number of teachers who are out of the field will be used to replace them.  As a result of the number of teachers to be clearly identified as being at very high risk over the coming weeks and who will not be able to teach in their schools and the coming retirements, we believe there will be a chronic shortage of teachers in some second level schools.  I agree with my colleagues in the INTO that it is more than likely that this problem will be worst in urban areas, especially Dublin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.35" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Boyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#K00500"><p>With regard to primary schools, we only got this more robust appeals mechanism on Friday evening.  Some schools had already opened by then.  This was nearly a month after such a mechanism was sought.  That was regrettable.  We have received approximately 600 email queries per week from members since March but, as we have got closer to reopening, many members needed contact by telephone rather than email because they had sensitive stories to tell.  In some instances, four or five different consultants had advised these people not to go back to the school building.  The occupational health service, however, set a very high bar, which had been determined by Government.  People who met the conditions to be considered at very high risk would not have been going into the school even before the pandemic.  These people needed a lot of tender care from the union.  Our officials spent up to an hour on the phone with each individual.</p> <p>  It will become very clear in the coming weeks that there is a significant number of such staff members.  There is also a great number of teachers who are expecting babies and whose GPs and doctors are very concerned about their return to the workplace.  The danger is that, if the appeal mechanism does not work properly, many staff will be declared sick by their GPs or consultants and will not return to school.</p><p>In the case of a school that has multiple absentees, even the supply panels with which we are so delighted will be unable to cover the gaps.</p></speech>

Could the representatives of the secondary sector give an estimate of the shortfall of teachers, particularly in light of what Mr. Boyle has just said about teachers, or family members of teachers, suffering from serious illnesses?  There is also the fact that some women will possibly go out on maternity leave.  Is there any idea of the estimated shortfall of teachers at secondary level?</p></speech>

We are hearing that schools that have advertised positions have received very few applicants with none in some cases.  That situation will only be exacerbated, as my colleague said, in the context of the provisions of the public service stability agreement, PSSA, and the likelihood of a considerable number of retirements in October.  It is, therefore, something we will watch carefully in the weeks to come but the portents are not good.  We are hearing anecdotally that interviews are taking place but there are very few applicants for the available jobs.  Some people have told us that they have not received any applications for jobs, particularly in pinch areas such as languages and practical subjects.  That situation can only get worse in the context of illnesses and retirements that are in line.</p></speech>

That there are several jobs currently advertised shows the trouble that there will be for schools.</p> <p>  On the question of teachers who are high risk, we are getting heartbreaking letters and phone calls.  It does not apply to many teachers but there are some with very serious conditions, who have had cancer and are missing lungs or who have asthma and multiple medical problems.  They are very much in danger should they go into schools.  </p> <p>  We are not talking about a lot of people.  Numbers in one region in Germany suggest that 400 out of 13,000 would be high risk and very high-risk teachers.  A lot of high-risk teachers want to be in the classroom and are fit for work but there are some cases where teachers' lives will be in severe danger if they go into classrooms.</p></speech>

That number includes all of the teachers approached by the former Minister, Deputy McHugh, in Dubai in an attempt to attract them back to Ireland.  Some of those people have kept up their registration because it is easier to keep it up and pay the &euro;65 fee rather than allow it to lapse.  Those teachers are in Dubai because of pay inequality in Ireland.  Despite all the measures that we have put in place to try to attract people back here with good jobs, many of our best and brightest will remain abroad as long as pay inequality persists.</p> <p>  There are, of course, qualified teachers in Ireland who may have gone into other walks of life and may be willing to come back and help out on a day-to-day basis with substitution but I doubt that there are 6,000 across the primary and secondary sectors who are readily available.  Many of those people are just keeping up their registration because it is easier to do that than allow it to lapse.</p></speech>

We have an awful lot of people who are trained in specific subjects and have transferable skills such as languages or qualifications in physics and chemistry.  Those people can transfer into the main body of employment and are no longer available to teach, although they may maintain their registration because it only costs &euro;65 per year and will give them options in the future.  Those people do not want to allow that registration to lapse and remove those future options.  I agree with what Mr. Boyle said.  I do not believe there are 6,000 of those kinds of people available.</p></speech>

I thank them for their work and that of the members of their unions in the past couple of weeks because I know the effort has been phenomenal and major sacrifices have been made for the benefit of the children of this country.</p><p>I think I speak for many people when I say that we are grateful.  Perhaps it is time for those media commentators who tried to castigate school staff to reflect on their some of their comments now that the reopening of schools has been achieved.  Now that schools are open, it will be as much of a challenge to keep them that way.</p><p> A number of points have been identified through our guests' various statements.  Rapid priority testing is essential, as are ensuring adequate cover for the substitution of staff and tackling oversized classes.  In the context of cover, we must ensure that parents are not financially punished for keeping their children out of school.  That is essential to making sure that the reopening of schools is sustainable.</p><p> I will direct my first question to the INTO.  It relates to the entire process concerning Medmark and high-risk members of staff.  I will raise the issue of high-risk students with the Minister later.  I understand that there has been some movement with the process relating to staff and that there is an appeals process.  My concern is whether the process is adequately independent and whether there will be a fresh look at existing evidence and, perhaps, a reinterpretation of it rather than simply requesting new evidence.  There is significant concern in that regard.  "High-risk" is a very broad term for a category that seems to take in everything from mild asthma to people with leukaemia and those at risk of liver failure.  Many individuals are concerned, and rightly so.  How confident can we be that whatever appeals mechanism exists will be adequately independent and will ensure that members of staff are safe?</p></speech>

He obviously has a clear insight into the challenges that face us in primary schools.  There is no doubt that it has been a very trying summer for school leaders and school principals.  We welcome the Deputy's comments.</p> <p>  We had concerns in respect of Medmark, the online health service, and, as the general secretary has already alluded to, the bar was set high for our very high-risk teaching colleagues.  We wrote to the Minister and the Taoiseach in that regard to get a review process for Medmark.  Thankfully, that is in place and teachers can appeal the decision of Medmark.  They can submit their doctor's opinion and consultants' reports and seek a fast review.  We do not have figures in respect of the review process because, as has been outlined already, it came out a bit late, towards the start of the school year.  We await the outcome.  It is absolutely imperative that the health of very high-risk teachers is not put in jeopardy by having to attend school.</p></speech>

I take it that we will have to wait to see whether the process is adequate.  The message I hear is that it is something that needs to be kept under review.</p><p>My next question is for Mr. Pike of F&oacute;rsa.  I welcome the fact that representatives from F&oacute;rsa are present.  It is regrettable that they were not before the committee previously, particularly as that the staff F&oacute;rsa represents are extremely important.  SNAs will be concerned about how the inclusion model will work and the implications that will have for the children with whom they work.  Does F&oacute;rsa have a view on how the inclusion model can be preserved in some way or other?  I am aware that there are restrictions on a child being able to move from the unit to the mainstream and <i>vice versa</i>and decisions are being made by schools in that regard.  Does F&oacute;rsa have a view on how the process moves forward or how it can be preserved?</p></speech>

The pilot has a little way to go before it is evaluated.  The situation with Covid-19 may make that evaluation a little bit more difficult but we see no reason that the essential provision of additional therapy supports cannot continue to be targeted at those students who would benefit from same.  The onset of the pandemic delayed the extension of the schools inclusion model beyond those 75 schools.  What we have been left with is a decision to freeze mainstream SNA allocations this year.</p><p>That will present problems for schools being able to deploy staff to meet the needs of children who are presenting with additional care needs in the absence of a formal assessment by the NCSE.  This front-loading approach is very new.  We anticipate some problems whereby SNAs who had previously been allocated to specific students may be asked to work more generally with students who are assessed as having additional care needs.  It is very early days.  At the moment, SNAs are focusing more on how to keep students engaged, ensuring they are settling in following the return to schools and making up for some of the deficits in the Department's provision of advice on basic things like carrying out intimate care and infection control.</p><p> We will wait to see the evaluation on the school inclusion model, which is something F&oacute;rsa would support.</p></speech>

Many issues relating to special education needs are still to be clarified, one of which relates to face coverings.  I have a question for the representatives of the TUI on face coverings.  Principals who have contacted me are concerned that it is not clear what evidence they should rely on where a child is seeking exemption.  There are many justified exemptions, but the principals were not clear as to what they should rely upon and in what circumstances they should allow a child not to wear a mask.  Does the TUI believe that needs to be clarified?</p></speech>

We have continually raised the contradictory use of language in some of the documents, such as face coverings, soft coverings and face masks.  We have advised our members that a face covering is a mask.  As the Minister has said a mask is required just as people are used to using them in shops.  It covers the mouth and nose and should be worn within the 2 m because in most classes they are within the 2 m distance but cannot go within 1 m.  In rare cases, such as SNAs or SEN teachers, individuals will wear a medical grade mask within the 1 m distance.  That absolutely needs to be clarified.  If someone cannot wear a mask for medical reasons, a certified medical reason should be presented to the school and the school can make alternative arrangements.  For example, using a visor and maintaining 2 m distance could be set up in a classroom.  However, if the visor is also not possible, we would be back into physical distancing because we need to keep everybody safe: the student who cannot wear a mask or the teacher who cannot wear a mask because of a medical reason.  Then it is down to physical distancing.  The other priorities of hand washing etc. must also be maintained.</p></speech>

Parents are concerned that it is not clear that every child in a class will be treated as a close contact even though that is what ECDC guidelines require.  Is the ASTI concerned that that is the case?  Should every child in a class be treated as a close contact?</p></speech>

Last week, when the report that I mentioned earlier in my contribution was issued, immediately after the package was played on "Prime Time", Professor Luke O'Neill from Trinity College was interviewed and he appeared to have entirely contrary views in respect of some aspects of that day's report.  The system needs clarity.  I am not qualified to answer the Deputy's question definitively, but we need definitive answers.  Unfortunately, they have not been forthcoming.</p> <p>  There has been confusion in many schools on mask wearing, as the Deputy mentioned in his question to the TUI.  On a range of medical issues, there is an element of confusion.  There is an element of silence; it is difficult to get answers.  The experts need to sit down with us - the practitioners - and the Department of Education and Skills to provide clarity on the questions I mentioned earlier.</p><p>I will not list them off again; I listed them off earlier, regarding things like the use of Perspex in schools or exactly whether, where and when masks should be used.  For instance, there are jurisdictions in which masks are now mandatory in corridors.  There needs to be a clearer discussion on all these questions and thus far we have been struggling to get answers to some of our key questions.  </p></speech>

I am sorry but I am used to standing up in the Seanad Chamber, where Members all stood up to speak.  The real stand-out line for me is from F&oacute;rsa, which is that it can state to the committee that a significant number of staff today are providing personal care to students without adequate PPE.  Have we learned nothing from the nursing homes, where we sent in care assistants to look after elderly and vulnerable people with Covid-19?  Have we learned nothing?  It is an absolutely shocking statement that SNAs are going in to look after the most vulnerable students without any PPE.  It must be investigated as a matter of urgency.  My first question to each of the trade union representatives, because many serious questions have been raised here today, is how often he or she is meeting the Ministers.  Are they meeting the Ministers, Deputies Foley and Harris, on a regular basis to address some of these issues?  I am quite alarmed that meetings to discuss such serious issues have been refused.  Perhaps F&oacute;rsa could answer first.</p></speech>

The arrangements for service provision and in industrial relations more generally are not conducted through contact between unions and Ministers.  When we write to the Minister, she always responds.  It is not the case that we feel we are being ignored.  The week-to-week and sometimes day-to-day contact is with senior officials from the Department of Education and Skills.  On the issue of face masks, there is some confusion in respect of face coverings, which people wear to ensure they are not passing on anything to anyone else; and medical-grade face masks.  They are very cheap but are designed to the protect the wearer and to ensure there is a good degree of protection against droplet and aerosol spread.  One difficulty we have had with the Department is a reluctance on its part to issue clear advice.  We issued the advice ourselves, based on what the HSE recommends for staff providing personal care, that is, washing and changing of residents in nursing homes, and for those providing care in domestic or home settings.  It is very straightforward, namely, wear a face mask and wear a visor to protect one's eyes from splashes.  There are specific requirements around waste disposal.  If one has been washing or changing someone, any waste materials need to be bagged for 72 hours before they are put into general waste.  These are all common-sense, straightforward non-cost increasing issues.  We have found the Department to be very reluctant to address what one might call the specifics of providing care to students who have hygiene needs.  As regards PPE, maybe the term "PPE" is a bit frightening or disconcerting for some in the school sector but it is the basic provision of a face mask, gloves and an apron.  When people are being told to buy such equipment themselves or that the Department of Education and Skills guidance states that schools may wish to consider if they wish to provide this equipment for staff, we then have to say that the duty of care is not being maintained.  They can do a lot better than this.  We met the Department yesterday on this-----</p></speech>

It has now agreed to send out further advice to schools on the basics of what needs to be provided and what needs to be done to ensure that students and staff are safe, when, for instance, a student needs to change his or her clothes or there is a procedure to be carried out.</p><p>It has agreed to do that but we have not yet seen the draft.

Based on my information from teachers, it would be helpful if people, including young people with special needs, were asked to wear face coverings unless they had a medical reason not to do so.  I do not think that would be a complicated process.  If a parent says there is a reason that the child cannot wear a face covering, that should be adequate but the lack of clarity is bringing ambiguity to cases of pupils travelling on buses.  My fear is that there will not only be one classroom or school shut down but that several schools in an area serviced by a single bus will be shut down at one time.</p> <p>  Does any witness foresee circumstances in which teachers will have to withdraw from the classroom?</p></speech>

We in the Oireachtas owe them a debt of gratitude, as do the Irish public.</p> <p>  I would like to hear the witnesses' positions on the issue of leave provisions and whether Covid-19 quarantine periods will be counted against sick leave entitlements in following years.  Perhaps Mr. Boyle and Mr. Christie will give me their thoughts on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.69" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Boyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#P00700"><p>We have concerns about cases where a teacher who is absent and self-isolating, thankfully for him or her, tests negative.  If that were to recur a number of times in a year, since the public service sick leave scheme was quartered during the previous recession, it would not take long to result in the teacher being on half pay or potentially no pay due to Covid-19.  That is something we simply would not tolerate.  At the moment, we are keeping a watching brief.  Covid leave is available to those who have tested positive or who are deemed to have to self-isolate but the difficulty may arise in the case of teachers who were off work for a short number of days because were that to happen regularly throughout the year, the number of absences would accumulate.</p> <p>  We are also worried, as I mentioned earlier, about those teachers who are pregnant and whose medical practitioners recommend that they not return to work.  We have asked for the guidance of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, to be reviewed.  We heard some evidence from Dr. Kevin Kelleher of the National Public Health Emergency Team at the stakeholders' meeting yesterday that there is an ongoing review of that guidance.  We were promised that it would be reviewed and we engaged with the process throughout the summer in the expectation that we would see the colour of that review.  We have heard that the review is ongoing but we have not seen any paper evidence of that.  Moving forward into September, we will have to have a detailed review.  Given that the World Health Organization and European experts are at variance with the Irish experts, there definitely will have to be some joined-up thinking about this.</p><p>As schools continue throughout the winter with the flu season, we cannot have a scenario where workers are penalised in their pay because there has been a pandemic.  Hopefully, it will not occur too often, but it is something we are watching closely.</p></speech>

Returning to the point concerning vulnerable workers - teachers in our case - we welcome the appeal mechanism regarding teachers in the high-risk category who feel they should be in the very high-risk category, in which case they would work remotely.  However, in respect of the review of the categorisation of high risk and the illnesses that fall within that category, we are hearing from our members that their medical professionals are telling them that the list of illnesses in the high-risk category is far too broad and certain conditions should not be on that list but on the very high-risk list.  This is the big difficulty we have with that whole issue.</p></speech>

As Mr. Boyle said earlier, sick leave entitlements were quartered during the last recession and that means sick leave is precious.  We have many people who are worried and anxious and are using ordinary sick leave rather than Covid, and burning it because of this anxiety and nervousness.  That is especially the case when they see the after-effects of Covid.  Even those who are categorised as high risk or lower than high risk are nervous about returning to the classroom.  Classrooms are crowded places.</p> <p>  We have young adults in second level.  The media have been reporting recently, and the figures seem to back this up, that the number of people testing positive in the younger age group is rising rapidly.  These reports are creating anxiety which I believe will force staff to use sick leave.  We will then have the problem we outlined earlier because we do not have staff to support or replace these teachers and to meet the educational needs of students in schools.  In second level, it is certainly an issue with respect to the subject-specific teachers who are needed if a teacher goes out on sick leave.  If the only physics teacher in a school goes out sick, it will not be possible to get a replacement.  That is absolutely certain.</p></speech>

Education has suffered from what I consider to be poor leadership at Government level in the months of this crisis.  However, trade union members in schools have done an amazing job in maintaining a thread of calm, first by finishing the previous school year and then through the leaving certificate and into the period of reopening schools.  That cannot be stated often enough.</p> <p>  The first point I would like to raise is for the representatives of the ASTI.  It concerns the statistic that 25% of schools, according to principals, do not have hot water in their toilet facilities.  This is an astounding statistic given that the earliest public health advice we received, which has been a common and strong thread until now, is that we need to wash our hands regularly with warm water.  That was the first advice we were all given.  What are the reasons behind this statistic?  Why are a quarter of our schools without hot water?  What representations have been made to the Minister and her predecessor to try to rectify that deficiency in advance of this school year commencing?</p></speech>

Our schools are also totally overcrowded.  For example, a school built for 450 students may now have 600 or more students.  That is a problem, so much so that in schools that have been reconfigured, teachers do not have a room in which to hold staff meetings.</p><p>Staff are eating lunch in their cars and they are bringing everything with them in their cars because they do not have their own rooms anymore.</p><p> I want to refer to what Mr. Pike said about isolation rooms.  There is no room for isolation areas.  Some schools are using log cabins or converted and old shower rooms.  The problem with that is that if more than one student is sick - and this will occur.  In huge schools, one could have four students at the same time.  One student might have Covid, one might have hay fever, one might have a cough and there may be somebody else who does not have his homework done and does not want to be in class.  They cannot all be put in the same area.  Isolation means just one.  I am worried about that and glad that it was brought up.  </p><p> We have discussed space.  We constantly bring it up in meetings with the Department.  We would like to meet the Minister on several issues.</p></speech>

However, it was subject to planning permission and did not have a planning exemption as a piece of Covid infrastructure.  Are ASTI members coming back with similar stories of isolation rooms or other structures they are trying to construct and are being stalled in doing so by onerous planning processes?</p></speech>

We have token cleaning services.  Our capitation is less than a euro a day per pupil.  It would not buy a cup of coffee in today's world.  This is an accumulation of years of underinvestment in education.  Hot water is an absolute luxury in schools.  Toilets are an absolute luxury in schools, at times.  Pupils have to share toilets.  Multiple classes have to share toilets.  There are not toilets in every room in classrooms.  It is a huge issue.  We recognise the need to seek planning but when there is an emergency and a pandemic in the country, it has to be fast-tracked.</p></speech>

I will finish with a comment for Mr. Boyle.  He may not have time to respond to it.  I am concerned by what he said on advice being given by medical practitioners to teachers who are pregnant about returning to work.  We have raised this a number of times in this committee and Dr. Ronan Glynn said last week that pregnant women are not more susceptible to Covid than anyone else.  It is concerning and I echo Mr. Boyle's calls for more clarity from medical professionals to ensure that any anxiety being caused for women who are pregnant and seeking to return to work, be it in schools or anywhere else, is diminished.

The work undertaken since the beginning of the pandemic has been nothing short of heroic.  That should be acknowledged and it is lamentable that it has not been captured or highlighted in much of the public commentary to date.</p> <p>  I will list some of my questions and, hopefully, give the witnesses enough time to answer them.  One of the most important aspects of the return to school is the morale of our school community.  Any threats to that should be tackled immediately.  One such threat is the issue that has emerged over the past couple of weeks related to the leaving certificate, namely, that the school rankings given out by the secondary school teachers will now be revealed to the students.  I was not aware that was going to take place when it was announced in April.  When did the secondary school unions become aware of that and what is the view of their members?</p><p>How has this frustration been related back to the Department?  Is it something we can address before it becomes a bigger issue next week?</p><p> I have a question for Mr. Andy Pike on guidelines for SNAs and potential further supports for SNAs as we move forward in the D&aacute;il term.  I want to ask about the vagueness of the guidelines.  I also want to touch on the use of face masks.  The guidance for primary schools and special schools on PPE and the use of face masks by staff states that schools should consider the specific circumstances where the use of medical face masks may be more appropriate for staff, for example, where staff such as SNAs or school bus escorts need to be in close and continued proximity to students with intimate care needs.  Is the vagueness of these guidelines a problem?  If the guidelines simply stated that staff should wear the appropriate medical mask would it alleviate some of the arbitrary decisions that have been taken from school to school, which are placing many SNAs at greater risk?</p><p> Medmark has already been discussed but if there are outstanding issues the unions feel need to be clarified I ask them to feel free to take some of my time to do so.  There are outstanding issues.  Is there anything Medmark needs to change or adapt in its algorithm, particularly with regard to the newly announced review system?</p><p> I have a question specifically for the witnesses from the TUI.  Their submitted document states that students with special educational needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds cannot be forgotten or left behind and that customised interventions and supports may be required to reintegrate them into school.  Will the TUI witnesses speak a little about what exactly is meant by customised supports and innovations?</p><p> One of the stand-out parts of the ASTI presentation was that it is regrettable that those effectively making decisions on these matters refuse to meet representatives of those directly affected by them.  That is an absolute shame.  It is a travesty and should not be happening.  Will the witnesses give voice to how these meetings have been requested and what the tangible implications are for ASTI members when they are rejected?</p></speech>

We had a clear understanding that the information, which is extraordinarily sensitive and could have serious implications for particularly vulnerable students, would only be revealed as part of an appeal process or a request for data.  We were dismayed to hear differently and that it is being made available through a portal.  We have made very strong representations on this because all members co-operated with something that was almost anathema to them, to put such rankings down on paper, and put down on paper the position of children they had supported and kept in school and whose morale and confidence they had boosted.  We are very concerned about the correct treatment of the data.  We have made very strong representations and we continue to do so.  We have had meetings with the Department about it.  There is ongoing discussion and we hope for a change in the approach.  We have had numerous and very strong representations from members who feel incredibly strongly about this particular issue.  I thank the Deputy for raising it.</p></speech>

We expect to achieve resolution of this issue sooner rather than later and we are working hard on it.  It came as a shock to us when the plans that have been made public were brought forward.  Our members are certainly not happy about it and we are not happy about it.  We will do something about it.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked a direct question about the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC.  We sought a meeting with the HPSC and it declined to meet us.  We wrote to the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, more than a week ago and we have received no response, acknowledgement or reply.</p></speech>

It has been a long journey since the previous Minister for Education and Skills basically dismissed any concept or notion of using PPE in schools to where we are today.  We still have another stage to go to make sure that staff in the schools sector have the same minimum level of protection when providing personal care as staff in the community health sector and the HSE have where the issues are more or less the same.  It is not rocket science.  They should be given face masks.  They cost about 30 cent.  They are readily available.  People should be given some basic advice regarding infection control.  F&oacute;rsa as a trade union has given our members detailed advice but, quite frankly, it is not our job to do that.  It is something the Department should do.</p></speech>

I want to ask about high-risk teachers.  It seems absolutely scandalous that teachers with significant underlying conditions are being compelled to go back to work in circumstances where their doctors or consultants are saying it is unsafe to do so.  There does not seem to be any guarantee that this issue has been dealt with or that the likelihood of their being compelled to return will not arise.  Ms Piggott was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  She referred to one teacher who is battling acute leukaemia, Type 2 diabetes, asthma, anaemia and an autoimmune disorder and who was told to return to work after obtaining a risk assessment.  In a letter, the individual in question wrote that he feels like a turkey waiting for Christmas.  In regard to that case, does Ms Piggott know if the teacher is still being compelled to return to work or is there an appeals process?  I wish her to confirm that she is aware of multiple cases where the advice of doctors or consultants has been overruled by a private company, Medmark, in the context of teachers being compelled to go back to work.</p></speech>

When the person applied, he did so at a certain time, perhaps 7 p.m., and received a letter at 9.40 a.m. the following day telling him what category he fitted into.  One could question what effort was made to consider the person's case.  I do not think he was spoken to or met with.  There was no Zoom consultation with the teacher involved.  It may be the case that somebody looked up a list and saw that he was not in a high-risk category.  I tried to contact the person yesterday or the day before, but I have not yet spoken to him.  I will talk to him again.</p> <p>  I have heard of another particularly bad case.  A teacher had a letter from her consultant but she was told to go to school.  Since then, she has made new arrangements and will be working from home.  Many teachers do not want to make this choice but they have to.  There are important cases that need to be looked at carefully.</p></speech>

I have a question for Mr. Gillespie.  It seems that, at an individual level, coronavirus exposes and attacks underlying conditions, which relates to the previous question.  It also does so at a societal level and exposes the very low levels of investment in our education system as a percentage of GDP, the very high pupil-teacher ratios and the lack of space in our schools.  The pre-existing underinvestment in education has now been exposed and needs to be resolved.</p> <p>  Mr. Gillespie mentioned a number of schools where appropriate social distancing is not possible or is not taking place.  Can he put a number or percentage on that?  The point was made earlier about the Perspex screen in front of the Acting Chairperson.  There is not necessarily Perspex in front of teachers.  There is a basic point, namely, that it is absolutely unconscionable to ask teachers and students to go back to work and school in conditions which are less safe than those in which Deputies and Senators are working.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.92" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Gillespie" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#T00600"><p>I have heard from several schools - I cannot put an exact number on it because the information comes in on an area basis - where social distancing was worrying to our representatives.</p><p>The schools are going back in a staggered way, so we are not 100% sure how much movement has been made.  Through the lead worker representatives in these schools, we have clearly set out a procedure to all our members to follow if they have concerns, and they are following it.  We have had schools that have changed timetables to make sure they got 24 students into classrooms measuring 49 sq. m.  Very big classes have been divided into smaller areas or have been taught through live streaming.  If schools go through the 1:6 regime, they can solve this.  As I said, we have seen very big schools, namely, those with 1,600 pupils, managing to do so.  Where we receive a report that a school is not doing so, we tell it to get advice and call the Department's helpline, and then it should be able to do it.  Sometimes it is because the school has not pushed the last bit to get there.  We will not, however, allow our members to work in those schools where the basic precautions - such as physical distancing of in excess of 2 m, or between 1 m and 2 m when wearing masks - are not in place.</p><p> It is early days yet, and we may get more specific information.  We certainly heard a lot in the first day or two from teachers worried about the way in which their classrooms were laid out.  As Ms Magner stated, it was interesting that we had maps to lay out the classrooms in order that we could make sure we had 1 m social distancing in classrooms.  We have actually had to give maps to schools to make sure we know how many students can go into classrooms of various sizes.  Our classrooms are tiny.  Across Europe, 30 students go into classrooms that are nearly 100 sq. m, and our biggest classrooms are 49 sq. m.  Some of our newer buildings might contain classrooms that are up to 55 sq. m and we can put 24 students into those.  In certain countries in Europe, they put 15 students into classrooms measuring nearly 100 sq. m.</p></speech>

I reiterate the point other members made, namely, that the country is very appreciative of the efforts of schools boards, teachers, managers and the unions in trying to get the schools reopened.  Now that they are reopening, it is absolutely vital that we do everything possible to try to keep them open and functioning.</p> <p>  I wish to bring up a point that came up between the INTO and F&oacute;rsa.  The INTO thanked the Department for its actions to date and stated that its members have adequate PPE, while F&oacute;rsa has highlighted that it feels its members do not.  Perhaps we are talking about teacher groupings versus non-teacher groupings.  F&oacute;rsa also mentioned the idea of medical masks for looking after children in intimate settings and so on.  Could we get a clear distinction here?  Is there a united front that could be agreed whereby we could say that the secondary school teachers at least feel they have adequate PPE and then, perhaps, isolate the fact that F&oacute;rsa may feel its members need to be treated differently or that the case it is putting forward must be highlighted?  Could anybody shed some light on that matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.95" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Boyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#U00300"><p>Could I clarify the position regarding our opening statement?  We recognise that significant funding is put aside in schools in respect of sanitising and the purchase of PPE, but that does not necessarily translate into every member of staff having the benefit of that funding.  For example, there is flexibility within the funding for the purchase of different types of masks.  Our view from the beginning has been that if our members have any doubt about anything, whether returning to the workplace, having to self-isolate or what they have to wear, we advise that they wear whatever is most appropriate for them.  For example, we have teachers who are in the exact same position as the people whom F&oacute;rsa and Mr. Pike represent, namely, SNAs.  We have teachers who are looking after the intimate care needs of children with the assistance sometimes of SNAs, other times not because we may not have enough teachers or SNAs to look after special needs generally in primary.  Then there is the matter of administering first aid - responsibility for which very often just falls upon the class teacher - in trying circumstances in playgrounds or classrooms.  Our advice to our members and lead worker representatives is to demand that their boards of management provide what is available on the portal.</p><p>Nevertheless there will be differences with different workers and special schools.  We are really worried about the special schools sector and we are also worried about the fact that in the special school sector there are children up to the age of 18, which came up earlier.  We represent most of the members who teach there and there is not much distinction in the provision for those children on buses or in schools compared to the distinctions that are being made for students in the ordinary post-primary schools.  There is a lack of clarity and that is why we have continuing stakeholder consultations and we need to get that clarity as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I wish to speak to two points.  One is the digital divide that was highlighted earlier.  The TUI in particular mentioned access to broadband.  At the moment schools are providing laptops many students.  Why does there have to an interactive element?  If there is a difficulty with accessing the Internet for learning why not put programmes onto those laptops so students can work on the exercises at night at home and bring that work in the following day?  I presume we are talking about kids who are in the following week and have it assessed, rather than saying that because we do not have broadband that this leads to discrimination.  Surely there is a way of getting some of these programmes put onto the laptops where kids can work away regardless of whether broadband is available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.98" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Gillespie" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#V00300"><p>A lot of students do not have laptops.  At the end of last year, our research showed that the vast majority of students were depending on their phone.  The only devices they had to access the Internet and whatever was being put up on the school website were their phones.  The phones do not have the capacity to put up programmes, etc., so they were actually just using their phone to go onto the websites of the schools and trying then to translate that into the homework they were doing.  It is not just about a lack of broadband; it is about a lack of devices in homes.  Even if a household has broadband, they may not enough devices for all the school-going children to use at the same time within the hours in which people do their homework - between 4.30  p.m. and 7 p.m.  It is not as simple as putting stuff onto the laptops, it is the fact of the lack of devices in homes and the other uses to which the devices that are available have to be put.</p></speech>

It is impossible to believe that we are not going to have school closures over the course of the year and we need to be facilitating students.  I have just one more thing-----</p></speech>

The happy families that are contacting me are probably best epitomised by a parent of a student who is going to St. Mary's parish primary school, Bryanstown in Drogheda.  Last week there was a one-to-one between every parent and the teachers as to what was going to happen this week.  The parents, the children and the teachers were very professional, the parents and the children feel safe and there are very clear guidelines.  The professionalism of everyone involved is remarkable because this is not just a normal school year with the problems that happen in schools.  This is a pandemic year and I want to praise everybody concerned.</p> <p>  There are a couple of points of concern I want to raise.  I have a constituent who is a child with special needs and requires resources.  The child has been medically assessed as having that need.  The Department has turned it down and the child is now in school.  Their parents and their medical people advise that that the child needs a full-time SNA and the Department has not given a date yet for that review in the school.</p><p>I ask that the unions campaign for and on behalf of children whose appeals have been delayed and whose education, therefore, has been significantly compromised.  The happiness of such children and their parents and teachers is severely challenged.</p><p> The other issue I will raise relates to schools which have lost teachers.  A school in my constituency, Rampark national school, had 180 students on assessment day last year but is now expected to have 170.  The school has lost two teachers leading to an unacceptable increase in the number of students in some classes.  I ask the unions to articulate the rights of students in these cases, particularly with regard to those with special needs and schools that have lost at least one teacher or, in some cases, two.</p></speech>

We hope that such praise for our school leaders will lead to the return of their former remuneration package, which has now not been paid for more than ten years.  We wait in anticipation following the Deputy's praise.</p> <p>  With regard to special educational needs, the INTO has been demanding resources for children with special educational needs for a very long time.  This is not the first time the issues the Deputy has highlighted have come to our attention.  We will continue to work in this regard.</p> <p>  The issue of overcrowding in classrooms is very easily solved.  Class sizes must be reduced.  Our pupil-teacher ratio is the highest in Europe at 25:1, while those of our counterparts in the European Union average 20:1.  We and our colleague unions have spoken about the size of classrooms.  This issue would be solved easily by reducing class sizes.  If class sizes are reduced, much of this will be ameliorated and mitigated.</p></speech>

Under this schedule, one becomes a walking principal when the school gains four children.  If the school then loses some of these children, it not only could end up losing its administrative deputy principal, who had been given 183 days to administer the school but will now only have 37, but it also suffers the double penalty of losing an additional classroom teacher.  That could be very easily addressed in the budget.  If this was to be part of budget considerations in this pandemic year, it could be backdated to this September with an appeals mechanism to allow such schools to not lose their teachers immediately.  We now see the ridiculous scenario in which some of those schools that will lose a teacher in September 2020 will get that teacher, or even two teachers, back the following year if its enrolment increases.  The Deputy's Government can certainly address this issue.  It is something for which we have been calling for many years.</p></speech>

I also praise the work of the unions in engaging with the Department over recent months.  It has been challenging for everybody involved.  More importantly, I thank the principals, deputy principals, boards of management and staff.  I have been in contact with many and they have been moving furniture, measuring rooms and doing all sorts of other things in advance of the reopening of schools in recent days, which is exceptionally welcome.</p> <p>  With regard to engagement by the unions with the Department since July in respect of the reopening of schools, how much engagement over how many days has each of those present today had with the Department to date?  I do not mind who goes first.</p></speech>

Meetings have occurred weekly, sometimes biweekly, where issues have been addressed.  Our complaints are not about the level of engagement from the Department but relate to the more fundamental aspects of the plans that are in place, as I set out in my opening statement.</p></speech>

More than that, the volume of documentation that has been changing hands and in which we have been putting our points to the Department, outlining what we believe is required for the safe reopening of schools, has been colossal.  People have been working into the small hours of the night to read documents, make comments on them and send them back to the Department.  It has been a massive job of integration and a considerable volume of documentation has arrived into schools.  What has happened in a short time is mind-boggling.</p> <p>  As I said in my opening submission, schools have changed beyond belief since 12 March.  Second level schools have been pared back to the paint to fit as many students into classrooms as possible.  That has taken an effect on teachers who will return to classrooms where resources that have been there for 30 years or more are either in a skip or in a metal container in the car park.  That is hard for teachers and they have had to adapt quickly to a new way of doing things to benefit students.  A lot of the good work and ways we were teaching, including group work and whatever, has now had to change and teachers have had to adapt.</p> <p>  We spoke earlier about examinations and our teaching staff at both primary and secondary levels deserve a H1 grade from me for the amount of work they have done to get ready and welcome back their students in very difficult times.</p></speech>

In the week of 17 August, as we got closer to opening time, we had two official meetings and four unofficial or side meetings with different stakeholders.</p> <p>  We are well paid in our positions.  We worked through our annual leave and on the bank holiday Monday to facilitate the Department with responses to documents.  I must give a shout out to the school principals in the primary sector.  I do not know if it is well known that those principal teachers in the smaller, one, two, three, four and five-teacher schools who worked all through the summer received a payment before tax of &euro;180 per week, not per day.  There are 1,700 such principals and they have been waiting for a payment of an additional &euro;60 per week for 13 years now.  </p> <p>  I was proud to represent 44,000 teachers during the pandemic as we negotiated the safe reopening of schools.  They are the people who put on the green jersey and need to be looked after.  The public servants of Ireland have done mammoth work in the past six months and we must make sure that we remember that when we enter negotiations on the next pay deal.</p></speech>

It has had some amount of them over the past number of years but one initiative that proved challenging for schools intended to move from an evaluation model whereby an external evaluator, school inspector or team thereof came into a school to a situation where the schools themselves were forced to do a lot more self-evaluation so that when the inspectors arrived, much of the homework had been done for them.  In a submission to the Department in early May, we had a number of key requests.  The focus must be on the well-being of staff, students and parents in this time of the pandemic.  We felt that this was a time to lay those initiatives aside for one year and were delighted when the Department agreed that there would be no further school self-evaluation.  A school may, of course, evaluate how it is responding to the pandemic.  I hope schools do that and let us know quickly if they need further resources so that we can negotiate with the Department.</p> <p>  New initiatives, unnecessary paperwork and inspections put undue pressure on everybody in the community.  That cannot happen at this time.</p><p>The whole focus here is to get people back safely and to get them back into the groove of teaching and learning, as it were.  That cannot happen under the pressure of inspections or school self-evaluation.</p></speech>

Mention was made of school principals.  I have seen this with my sister who has put her heart and soul into getting her school up and running and reopened safely.  It is not just principals, although they are of course in a leadership position, but the whole school community.  It is everybody, from parents, volunteers, teachers and SNAs to escorts, caretakers, secretaries and all the others who have put their heart and soul into this.  That has been very evident.</p> <p>  I am sure the irony of a Government Deputy urging the unions to act on behalf of children with special needs will not be lost on the witnesses.  It was certainly not lost on me, although this is no laughing matter.</p> <p>  I will speak briefly about children with special educational needs and those with additional needs who require additional support to get into school.  A one-size-fits-all approach will not work for these children.  I will ask Mr. Pike specifically about bus escorts.  I realise these are a small part of the workforce but they are, nonetheless, an extremely important piece of the jigsaw in getting children to school.  What arrangements are in place to protect bus escorts?  I would not be so facile as to compare Covid to trampolining or anything else, but as has been said a million times, nothing we do is completely without risk.  We know that but it is the job of the Department to minimise the risk for workers.  What arrangements are in place for bus escorts?  What arrangements would Mr. Pike like to see put in place to ensure the greatest possible level of safety for his members?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andy Pike" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#Y00400"><p>The only arrangements in place are those that the transport providers can manage.  If social distancing were possible in every instance, the situation would be better, but it is not.  School transport is still often quite cramped.  Very often children with additional care needs are not able to wear face masks because it can be anxiety provoking and extremely distressing for them to be forced to wear a face covering.  As a result, many of them will not do so.</p> <p>  In terms of school transport, if fewer students are using a vehicle, that vehicle may have to make two journeys.  This means bus escorts may be within the confines of a cramped vehicle for longer than would have been the case before schools closed.  The protections available to bus escorts are just the medical grade face mask.  That is all.  There is a case for saying that the higher grade of face mask, N95, should be provided for bus escorts and staff who are in the vicinity of aerosol producing devices such as suctioning tracheostomy tubes or other procedures that may take place in special schools.  However, I am afraid only the minimum - the medical grade face mask - is available and there are problems accessing even that basic form of PPE.  Bus escorts are making sure children hand sanitise before they board buses and when they get off.  The Department could do much more in terms of giving very clear advice on how to stay safe in circumstances where something happens on a journey and a bus escort has to assist a student with hygiene needs.  We hope it will do so in the next couple of days.</p></speech>

I congratulate them on the energy and effort that has gone into the reorganisation of activities in schools.  I have one general question to them all.  While we are still in the early stages, from the experience so far what is the weakest link in the delivery of the educational services and the prevention of an outbreak of the virus in a particular area at the same time?  Is it in respect of school transport, class sizes, isolation areas or teachers possibly having to isolate?  Is it possible to address these issues and continue to deliver educational services effectively?</p></speech>

If routine testing was available on a very regular basis, it would provide more certainty.  We think there is a case for considering temperature checks for sure.  Given the problems with school transport and other issues, we believe regular testing would bring more certainty and confidence that schools can remain open.</p></speech>

That means emphasising maintaining physical distancing, wearing masks and hand hygiene in schools.  The resources to do that need to be supplied to the schools.  If schools are having difficulty they need to talk to the Department and get the resources.  If we are contacted by our members, we will be very quick to point out schools that are not doing those things.  Keeping Covid-19 out will include maintaining teachers in the school.  It comes back to the rapid testing Mr. Pike just mentioned.</p> <p>  Because of the requirement to track and trace people with symptoms, the lack of qualified substitute teachers will be an increasing problem as we move into the winter season.  People who in the past might have gone to school with sniffles or whatever will not be able to go because they would create anxiety among the high-risk people in schools as we mentioned earlier.</p></speech>

We are battling this on the back of several years of underinvestment.  That is actually the biggest challenge.  That is the common thread running through nearly all the problems we mentioned today.</p><p>Before Covid-19 we were already struggling with the system we have.  As somebody said when asked for directions in the countryside, one would not start from here.  Similarly, one would not have started with the most overcrowded classrooms, the worst pupil-teacher ratios, a demoralised teaching force and a recruitment crisis caused by unequal pay.  Those problems need to be fixed and we also need ongoing monitoring of what has been put in place to date.  The committee needs to meet on this issue again in a little while because these are still early days and we are only starting to piece together the picture of where the difficulties lie.  We will obviously continue to make representations on those difficulties but this is a picture that will become clearer over time.  The committee should also meet again to discuss the other areas of education in which we operate, namely, higher education and further education, because we have equally strong concerns about reopening in those settings.</p></speech>

We already have one class doing so.  If only 15 children were in a class, as is the case in Luxembourg, Lithuania and various other countries, not as many children would lose out on their education in the classroom.  However, we have up to 35 children in a class.  Notwithstanding what Government spokespersons have been saying and what some members of Government parties have said today, we need action on class sizes.  If class sizes were reduced to European averages and there was a properly funded system in place to support remote learning in cases where a class must stay at home and children are self-isolating, we would be dealing with the pandemic in the same way our European counterparts are dealing with it.  We want the children of Ireland to have the same opportunities as children elsewhere in Europe, even in a pandemic.  Smaller class sizes are the way to go.</p></speech>

I appreciate the pressures of trying to confine a session to two hours.  However, the two-hour time limit the committee has afforded itself is not what teachers or students are enjoying and it sets a bad example.  I very much appreciate that this decision was not taken at the behest of the Acting Chairman or me.  The D&aacute;il will meet this afternoon in the Convention Centre, a huge glass palace.  That, too, sets a poor example.  I made that point before the D&aacute;il rose in July and I still believe that to be the case.</p> <p>  We have seen many international studies, although perhaps fewer in Ireland, on the detrimental effect of students, particularly younger students, being out of classrooms for long periods.  What are members of the teaching unions encountering now?  For example, are third class students where teachers expect them to be in developmental and educational terms?  Are sixth class students, third years, or fifth years in secondary schools where teachers would expect them to be and, if not, what measures are required to compensate for that?</p> <p>  Has the effect of the closure of schools been greater on a particular age cohort or on students from a particular background than it has on the general student body?</p></speech>

Teachers and students want to return to school because, notwithstanding their best efforts in the months since March, there have been deficiencies and these will have to be addressed.  It is early days to quantify and particularise these deficiencies but we are already hearing from some of our members that it is an issue in classes.  Compensatory measures will have to be considered once there has been a proper assessment of where students are because there has been slippage, notwithstanding, as I said, the great efforts that were made.  There is no question that additional resources will have to be made available for that.  To link back to the previous question, that is why schools need to remain open.  There must be sustainable reopening and all roads lead to physical distancing and the other suite of measures that need to be taken to ensure that.  We called for a constant review to be undertaken to ensure the physical distancing requirements are appropriate for schools.  That review will have to be implemented.</p></speech>

While we have not seen anything specific to Ireland, are students where Ms Magner would expect them to be?  Are pupils in first class or third class, for example, where she would expect them to be in terms of educational development or has there been a regression?</p></speech>

Our priority is the well-being of children, so that will be addressed immediately in every classroom.  Primary teachers rose to the challenge over the summer and have upskilled immensely in the context of Seesaw and Google Classroom and providing learning for their pupils at home.  It has been exceedingly challenging.  It is an environment they were not used to and that they certainly were not trained for.</p> <p>  We are concerned about children in DEIS schools and those with special educational needs.  We are concerned about the disengagement that pupils in DEIS schools might be experiencing, and reintegrating them to school will certainly be a challenge.  Children with special educational needs are out of routine and will need additional support.  We are delighted that the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, will be on board and available to us.</p></speech>

I know how difficult it has been for everybody trying to get children back to school and unions all working together.</p> <p>  My first question is for the INTO.  I am aware that an agreement was reached to appoint three primary teachers for 12 schools in towns.  My question relates to rural schools.  My daughter is a school principal in Myshall.   Rural schools have not been put on what is called a supply panel.  How was the decision made to apply the panels to towns, that is, how is that 12 schools in towns were allocated three teachers whereas rural schools were not put on a panel?  Will the colleges of further education make their final-year students available?  Is the lack of teachers a problem?</p> <p>  Have the unions' members been asked to prepare online lesson plans in case schools or classes have to be sent home or because something else happens due to Covid-19?  Is a distance learning strategy in place?  Is there a programme for all primary and secondary schools?  I had many other questions to ask but, unfortunately, my time is almost up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.156" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Boyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#BB01100"><p>On the third question, it will be a matter for the next set of stakeholder meetings to try to organise a plan B for instances where towns, villages or schools might be closed.  We do not have a distance learning programme.  While we do not want to go back to such a scenario, the reality is that we probably will have to in some circumstances.</p> <p>  There are 101 panels.  The roadmap suggested that there would be 58.  We continued to chip away for the past four weeks and we got the number up to 101.  Places such as Clifden, where there are many small schools, were added this week, as were Gweedore and other Gaeltacht areas.  The large urban areas are where the greatest pressure points exist.  More than 2,000 schools will be covered by the supply panels.  Obviously, we would wish that every school was covered, including the island schools, of which there are at least two on the supply panels.  It is a good starting point relative to where we were, but we still have a bit of work to do there.</p> <p>  Perhaps some of the other witnesses would like to answer the Deputy's other question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.157" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Gillespie" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#BB01200"><p>At second level, every school is trying to make its own plans but there are no national guidelines, as Mr. Boyle noted.  There is nothing coming from the Department on this, so schools are making individual plans.  The problem again is the digital divide.  There are brand new schools with very sophisticated Wi-Fi where every student might even have a tablet, the purchase of which is organised through the school, while there are other schools where there is no such organised arrangement of the standards provided.  Many schools also purchased software platforms over the summer, as mentioned earlier.  These software platforms are licensed to the school, but teachers and students will have to use their own devices, without training to use these platforms, if there are full or partial closures of schools.</p><p>To answer the question, then, there is no overall plan; there are individual schools trying to do their best with the resources they have available.  We would welcome, however, some sort of national co-ordination on this issue and we hope that the stakeholders will start getting involved in that process.  As I said in my opening remarks, the next challenge is keeping schools open or keeping interaction in place if schools fully or partially close.  </p></speech>

I have so many questions that I do not know where to go.  Will the colleges of education make final year students available?  Is it a part of the talks between the witnesses' organisations and the Department of Education and Skills to see if student teachers can be made available?  I hope this does not happen, but if schools must close due to Covid-19 and they need extra teachers, is that in the plan?</p></speech>

One of the things that happened over the summer is that the Teaching Council and the other stakeholders, the colleges of education and the Department of Education and Skills, put together a procedure or option that final year professional master of education, PME, students can be used for supervision and substitution when called upon throughout the year.  That is in place.</p></speech>

They were being used then even without the rules changing.  Where those students were in schools doing their PME placements, they were being used in those schools for the whole year.  The effect of that change, therefore, may not be as big as people think it is going to be.</p></speech>

To inform this submission, Inclusion Ireland conducted a short survey of 267 parents of children with disabilities on the reopening of schools.</p> <p>  Inclusion Ireland welcomes the reopening of schools and acknowledges the hard work of school staff over the summer period to make it happen.  It is important for children to re-engage in education and the social interactions that schools bring.  This is especially true for children with disabilities.</p> <p>  In May this year, parents told Inclusion Ireland how home schooling was not working for their child with a disability.  Parents were working from home, they had more than one child at home and many children could not engage with education in the home.  Now, with the reopening of schools, 51.5% of parents responding to our survey report regression in their child&rsquo;s education and personal development.  This lost ground can often prove difficult, if not impossible, to make back.</p> <p>  The vast majority of children with disabilities - 87.5% - will, their parents report, go back to full-time education.  Some 9.5% of parents say their child will go back on a part-time basis with part-time remote learning and 3% of parents indicate their child will be engaged in full-time remote learning.</p> <p>  Some 80% of parents surveyed are worried about sending their children back to school during the Covid-19 period.</p><p>Thankfully, the level of worry in children is much less, with 54% having no concerns about returning to school.  Concerns for parents include anxiety and the risks regarding Covid-19, no social distancing on school transport and a lack of good information from the Department of Education and Skills.  Despite their obvious concerns, 86% of parents say their children will be going back to school.</p><p> A total of 11% of respondents to our survey reported that their children will not return to school due to high medical needs.  Our previous survey in May found that remote learning was not working for this cohort.  Inclusion Ireland raised this issue with the committee on 25 June and we have written to and met the Minister.  At present, we do not believe that satisfactory provision is in place to ensure that this very small cohort has access to appropriate education.</p><p> While schools are encouraged to create class bubbles, many children share SNAs who may be allocated to students in separate classrooms.  We do not believe that this has been addressed appropriately.  It must be noted that the impact of class bubbles on children with disabilities will be greater than the impact on their peers.  Parents report being told that there will be little or no access to supports such as HSE therapy services, the visiting teacher service, NEPS, assessments and special education teacher resources.</p><p> Inclusion Ireland is concerned that special education teachers will be used to cover absences of colleagues.  While welcome additional resources have been made available, teachers will, as a precautionary measure, have to stay off work once they display any type of cold-like symptoms.  This will place additional burdens on the substitute panel as we approach winter.  Resource teachers will be used as cover.  As we have already noted, parents are reporting regression in their children.  As we have noted, children with disabilities really need these additional supports to make up any lost ground.  HSE therapy supports and the visiting teaching service are vital educational supports for children with disabilities.  We ask the Department and its partners to look at alternative means of delivering these services to children with disabilities.</p><p> A total of 57% of respondents to our survey were either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with communications from the Department of Education and Skills.  Parents reported that communication from schools was much better.  A number of parents commented that the Department's guidelines were so vague that schools were having difficulty working them out, especially in respect of children with disabilities.  Respondents stated that they were in the dark about school transport arrangements, sensory breaks, access to mainstream education where a child is transitioning from a special class and, with so many people in schools now wearing face masks, communication needs.</p><p> Inclusion Ireland acknowledges the hard work involved in schools reopening.  However, parents have expressed some concerns about their children returning to school.  Resource teachers must not be diverted from their posts.  The Department must ensure that there is adequate cover on local substitute panels.  SNAs must be allocated per class and not between classes.  If this requires additional resources, we ask that they be made available.  There must be comprehensive support guidelines for children who cannot attend school due to high medical needs or a parent's medical needs.  These should include access to the home tuition scheme if appropriate.  The Department and its partners must examine how previous external supports can be delivered, either through telehealth means or otherwise.  Many children will require access to sensory breaks and this must be accommodated within the current guidelines.  Will the Department examine whether children can continue their journey into mainstream classes from special education provision?</p></speech>

In making this submission, we are mindful that children have only just returned and it may be too early to fully understand their experiences and the experiences of their parents.  We issued a survey to parents in order to inform this submission and this issue was raised by a number of those who completed the survey.  The survey was open from 4 p.m. last Friday until 1 p.m. on 28 August and a total of 3,177 responses were received.  I will go through some of the headline responses from the survey, and the one I want to start with is that 93% of children who went back to school enjoyed their first day.</p><p>The further comments that I make are within that context.  When I was before the committee a number of weeks ago, over 90% of parents felt their children needed to go back to school.  The high percentage of children who enjoyed their first day is really reassuring and strongly reflects the work done within schools to make sure school is a positive experience for children.</p><p> We asked parents about school transport.  Only 8% of respondents said their children were using school transport and of that 8%, 67% were happy with the transport that was provided.  Parents raised a number of issues.  There seemed to be a mixed experience from children in regard to adhering to the new guidelines.  Sometimes the experience is different going to and returning from school.  In situations where different bus companies are involved, it is difficult to sit next to the same person.  The availability of hand sanitiser and social distancing was raised.</p><p> Some 82% of respondents felt they had enough information in advance of the schools opening, but 12% felt they did not.  Some 120 parents who responded to our survey said their school did not share any information with them.  That is a matter of some concern.</p><p> Parents reported high satisfaction generally with information from schools through many media, such as videos that schools sent to them, and text messages and emails, outlining the procedures that were in place.  That gave parents an opportunity to prepare their children for their first day back at school.  Some parents had concerns that they had received inadequate information to do this preparation with their children and some said they received information but it was only the evening or two days before their children returned to school.  Some 86% of parents said they were able to communicate with the school if they had concerns.  However, 40% said they did not have a facility to do this.</p><p> We provided many opportunities for parents to give individualised responses.  A number of issues came up in those responses.  One of the key concerns parents had was what happens if a class or school has to close and what provision in terms of education would be made for their children outside of school.  One of the issues with primary school is that independent learning is very difficult for children of this age.  Parents had concerns about how school closures would affect their learning.</p><p> Pods were an issue.  Children's happiness at being back in school was affected by whether they were with friends in pod groups and were able to play with friends at break times.  Many parents said drop-off and pick-up times worked very well but some said there were definite difficulties, in particular for those with more than one child.  A lot of respondents were concerned about parents congregating at school gates and not wearing masks. </p><p> Some parents feel the restrictions in schools should be looser, allowing the children to mix more.  However, other parents believe the opposite.  That is challenging for schools to manage.  A number of parents are concerned about the overuse of hand sanitiser and believe that washing hands with soap is more appropriate for young children.</p><p> Windows and doors being open is an issue and is causing some concern, given the Irish weather over the colder months and how this approach will work.  Some parents expressed concerns about their children in special classes.  Parents are concerned that they will not mix with mainstream classes in the way that they are used to and that their children are missing out on the essential development of social skills.</p><p> They are the main issues raised by parents in the survey.  As I said, it is very early days.  Some of these issues may play out differently over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I invite Ms Fanning to make her opening statement.  Again, I ask her to confine her remarks to five minutes.</p><p><b>Ms Mai Fanning:</b>The National Parents Council Post Primary is grateful for this opportunity.  The mental and physical well-being of our children has always been and remains the main focus of concern for parents.  We again emphasise the importance of fairness, equality and equity in the delivery of support for children and their families in the face of Covid-19.  This must continue to be central to the consideration and implementation of plans as our schools reopen.  All partners in education have committed to an assurance that no pupil or student will be negatively affected by the restrictions imposed due to this pandemic.</p><p>Full support for all schools is integral to delivery of that assurance.  We must work collectively as educators to fulfil this promise.</p><p> The importance of our school communities and the interactions therein to our students' well-being is long established and recognised.  There is no risk-free way to reopen our schools, but it is broadly accepted that the benefits to students being back at school are very important.  That said, parents do have some very real concerns, particularly in light of the ever-changing demands related to Covid-19 and the rapid changes that can occur as a result of trying to manage normal life alongside this pandemic.  Where such concern and potential for change exists, clear communications between all involved is essential.  The NPCPP recognises and appreciates the commitment of the Government to provide substantial funds to assist schools to reopen and is extremely grateful to individual school management and staff for their hard work and dedication in preparing schools for the safe return of students and teachers.  Parents are thankful to see our youth heading back to school, and we are certain they will endeavour to meet all the requirements demanded of them.</p><p> Some particular concerns have been expressed and we have asked that these be taken into consideration, acknowledged and addressed by education authorities and school management.  Each school in our educational system is autonomous and therefore different.  Each will have its own plans and will experience varying difficulties.  Prompt responses and provision of required State financial or personnel support must be available.  Likewise, assistance towards securing any additional space or infrastructure to ensure the safety of those in the whole school community must be forthcoming and promptly delivered.  Dedicated points of contact between the Department, schools and parents are vital and must be maintained.</p><p> While the reopening phase is particularly demanding, there will be an ongoing requirement for support in the foreseeable future.  On reopening, time must be given to inform students, and all in the school community, of the new routines being adopted at schools.  Once routines are established, day-to-day co-operation and management will become more familiar to all involved.  Procedures in the event of any suspected case or outbreak of Covid-19 in a school, including isolation requirements, should be calmly and sensitively explained to all in the school community to avoid any upset or panic should a case occur.  Prompt testing and availability of results, where necessary, must be a priority.</p><p> There are concerns that the necessity to wear masks, as demanded in everyday activity outside schools where personal distancing is not possible, may not be applied in school.  Transmission prevention is known to be key in the containment of the virus.  At times during the day, student movement through corridors or congregation at various pinch points may be unavoidable.  Masks should be worn at such times.  Where students are unable to wear masks for health or other reasons, required personal distancing must be applied.</p><p> The NPCPP wishes to emphasise the importance of support for students and families who face particular additional difficulties or disadvantage due to personal or family circumstances and for those who require additional learning support or who have special needs.  There are students who, for various reasons or in certain circumstances, may not be able to return to school or may resist returning to school.  Provision must be made to assist these students and their parents by way of support.  While the NPCPP welcomes the commitment to meet the costs of school transport where a student cannot avail of that provided, we are very aware that the most vulnerable families in our school communities will be unable to meet such costs upfront.</p></speech>

I appreciate their opening remarks and their comments.  I also thank their organisations for their work over recent months.  They have worked exceptionally hard and with the various school bodies to ensure the safe reopening of our schools, which is greatly appreciated.</p><p>All of us in this Chamber and elsewhere have received calls from parents who found it exceptionally difficult to manage the blended learning and some who had no access to learning in the intervening period.  The witnesses' work and that of their various organisations is greatly appreciated.</p><p> I have read Inclusion Ireland's survey and it is welcome.  From the queries I have received to date in my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, parents have either had blended learning at home and found it challenging or they have not been able to employ it.  They are nervous that post Covid, things might not return to normal and I would welcome the witnesses' views on that.  The witnesses might also elaborate on the home tuition scheme.</p><p> Before that, I wish to ask two other questions.  I commend Ms Lynch of the National Parents Council Primary on her organisation's extensive survey.  Taking in 3,177 submissions over five days and bringing them here today is commendable.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#NN00400"><p>Yes.  On blended learning and our comments regarding the home tuition scheme, our previous survey was taken during the time when pupils were out of school.  We had an extensive survey with more than 1,000 respondents.  It was a fairly clear picture of the volume of children who were not able to engage with that blended learning.</p> <p>  What is proposed for children who cannot return to school because they are at very high risk from Covid-19 is again a similar situation of blended learning.  If the same children potentially are to be out of the school building setting for an extensive period, not just a couple of weeks or months, we propose that the children who so are identified should switch over to the home tuition scheme, which offers far more extensive one-to-one tuition of anywhere between ten and 20 hours depending on the age of the child.  What is currently proposed under the continuity of schooling report given to schools early last week is that a teacher would be appointed to the individual child who is unable to return to the school building.  While there is a framework there, we do not feel it would be anywhere near enough to just have remote-style tuition on a highly intermittent basis for children who cannot return to school for medical reasons.</p> <p>  That guidance also does not cover children who are at high risk and or indeed those who may have a parent or sibling who is at very high risk.  That continuity of support for children in the home setting is only for children who are at very high risk themselves and the document clearly states that no other circumstances will be considered and it only applies to those pupils.  As such, we do have a number of families where there is a child with disabilities who is at very high risk and is remaining at home and we believe that the proposals are less than satisfactory, particularly for those with very complex needs.  In the document appendix, some samples are provided.  The first three relate to children in mainstream school settings and special class settings and are focused on the teaching intervention being proposed.  When it comes to the child in a special school setting where there are more complex needs, it reverts to measures such as alleviating any issues in the home setting around behaviour and frustration and does not really engage with their educational input.  It is more about what can be done to alleviate things for the child at home.  We consequently have major concerns that children in that very high-risk cohort that cannot attend school and who have complex disabilities will simply be managed, as opposed to educated, during that time.</p></speech>

Our time is limited and I would be happy to engage with her again on those aspects.</p> <p>  Turning to Ms. Lynch, as I said, the National Parents Council Primary's extensive survey of 3,177 respondents over five days is to commended.  From my own knowledge, in the case of some of the schools in my own constituency and our own school as well, videos and text messages were very helpful and Ms Lynch referred to this in her own remarks.  This was particularly so for the junior classes, to ease them into primary school but also for those who are returning to schools with newly-implemented Covid compliance.</p><p>Ms Fanning touched on the issue of mental health and well-being at post-primary level in her opening remarks.  I have raised the issue of student support teams before.  Will Ms Fanning comment on those, their importance and their role in the Covid environment?  I thank all the witnesses very much for their attendance.</p></speech>

Children going back to school and their parents were anxious about what it would be like because of what had been reported in the media about the changes that would be made.  Seeing the school, how to enter and leave it and what the classrooms and pods would look like was very reassuring.  Families who did not get this information said they would have liked to have received such support because its absence added to their child's anxiety on the first day.  It was also an anxious time for children just starting primary school because normal things such as visits to the school before attending and parents going in with them on the first day were all very restricted.  That first day for junior infants was particularly challenging for some children.</p></speech>

With everybody else here, I welcome the opening of schools and I hope that they will remain open.  We all know the impact the closure of schools had on many pupils.  In many cases, students with special educational needs were disproportionately impacted by these closures.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the lack of information pertaining to children with special educational needs in the roadmap for the reopening of schools.  There should have been a link with child development teams or the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, within the roadmap but that was not the case.  A lot of therapies normally offered to children, such as occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy, were not offered during the period of the Covid closures or were only offered in a very limited fashion.  In other years a transitional report would have been prepared with the student who was transitioning from primary school to secondary school and with the child development team.  This helped prepare students for that transition and showed parents how to support them.  This proved invaluable to schools.  Are the witnesses aware of whether such reports were prepared with students this year?  I believe they were not although I am open to correction.  I hope I will be corrected on that.  The report might include things as simple as where lockers should be located or that timetables should be colour-coded.  Those things are very important, especially for children who have autism spectrum disorder, ASD.  Will therapies now be offered on a regular basis, as they were before?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.188" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#OO00400"><p>Families and their children experienced a massive reduction in the availability of, and access to, professionals who deliver therapeutic interventions for children over the last few months.  It is well known that the HSE had to redeploy a great number of staff to Covid swabbing centres.  These staff included speech and language therapists and physiotherapists.  These are the people who need to work directly with our children.  While I am aware that returning these people to their posts is a priority, in certain areas it has been communicated that further staff may need to be redeployed to swabbing, particularly in areas where Covid is deemed to be on the rise.  There is conflict between getting those well-trained professionals back to their posts working with children in schools and homes and carrying out such transition planning, and the need for the health service to react to Covid.  At a previous committee meeting in June we said that, in whatever planning the HSE carried out, it needed to look at a permanent workforce relating to Covid to allow therapists do what they do best, which is to support our children.</p> <p>  On the transition plans which would normally be prepared in the early part of the year in which a child is moving from preschool to primary school or from primary school to post-primary school and on plans for school-leavers with disabilities, there was major disruption regarding the ability to contact teams, where a child had a team to provide such supports.</p><p>Schools have transition passports so information around a child's needs may have been provided directly by the parents, not necessarily by a health professional.  There is a good passport for children with disabilities who are in receipt of access and inclusion model support when they transition from pre-school to primary school.  That end was covered whether or not the related professional reports accompanied the passports and at least the teachers of junior infants would be well aware of the needs and strengths of the child coming into the classroom.  </p><p> There was considerable disruption to the profiling process for children transitioning from schools to adult services.  I know that we are talking about third level, further education, announcements and leaving certificate examinations but a large cohort of children who have left school this year face major disruption in their passage to what they will do in the course of the next few years and that needs to be addressed at another committee session.</p><p> There are existing waiting lists but we are looking for an increase in the number of available therapy staff to support schools.  I believe the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has managed to find a way around the redeployment of therapists with which it had engaged and has sanctioned the direct hiring of an additional 31 therapists.  That one's resource can be taken away and used for something else shows that the system is not working during Covid-19.  </p><p> In considering supports for children in schools, the education sector needs to look at directly providing special speech and language therapy.  Getting teams back together is essential for continuity.  Scaffolding supports around schools and children is now more crucial than ever.</p></speech>

It is imperative that those supports are put back in place for the children who need them.</p> <p>  Ms Dempsey spoke about the fact that the home tuition scheme is only open to those students who are at a high risk of contracting Covid-19.  I would be concerned that the scheme is not available to students in other circumstances.  Some parents to whom I have spoken are afraid that their son or daughter would refuse to return to school because of having been out of school for so long.  Those parents and children also need support.</p></speech>

I know they are involved with voluntary organisations which can be time consuming for many of them.</p> <p>  Do our guests feel that we have got enough information out to young people?

As well as getting information out to young people, it is important that as students start to go back into school, we have mechanisms to listen to their experiences of that return.  We should hear what is working for them and what is not, what keeps them feeling comfortable and what is raising their anxiety.  We must have two-way communication and ensure that mechanisms are in place for young people, in primary and post-primary, so that we are hearing their voices about what is working for them.</p></speech>

One thing we could do better would be to collate those resources.  The information on the website of the Department of Education and Skills is tricky to wade through even for us professionals but a lot of good stuff is available.  There are wonderful videos that are aimed at children about going back to school.  We can tell from some of the surveys that have been carried out by ourselves and the National Parents Council that there is anxiety about going back to school.  Some students are worried about whether they will still be doing a piece from a special class into a mainstream class and what school will look like when they go back.  Lockers will be removed and access might not even be provided to them.  Some students worry that they will have to stay within their classrooms.  Some of the information is not trickling down to children as much as we would like and that is coming through in the anxiety that parents have reported seeing in their children.  Some of the resources out there are fantastic and it a matter of collation and not reinvention.</p></speech>

Are we not using the mechanisms that are there effectively enough?</p><p>Who should co-ordinate the use of those mechanisms for getting information out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.198" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#QQ00200"><p>In terms of collating information, independent agencies have produced information for the return to school targeted at children of different age groups.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has a series of videos for different age groups on going back to school.  The key point is that individual information for individual children has been problematic.  We mentioned previously videos of the classroom providing a tour of what children with developmental disabilities or autism can expect when they walk in the school door and what their classroom will look like.  These are all the key pieces that children who do not manage change very well would require.  There has been a huge gap in the experience of parents around that very individualised information.  Another point is to ensure that schools are signposting the information that is provided by the NCSE and other organisations such as the Middletown Centre for Autism, which all have back-to-school packs targeted at parents and children.  If the information does not trickle down to the parents, how are they to know that it is available?  Reports have been mixed as to whether parents have been aware of the information.  That comes down to communications with schools directly.</p></speech>

That means 18% were not satisfied.  I know one will never get 100% satisfaction in any survey.

Other parents felt the information came too late.  Information may have been provided to parents a day or two or on the evening before a school reopened and they may not have managed to work with their children on that information and get them to understand what was going to happen.  They found it was too late to do that work properly with their child before school started.</p></speech>

First, there are many different media and given that schools are autonomous, the information is best coming from the schools to the parents.  The key in communications is that it is ongoing and that the language used is clear.  Quite a lot of the information that comes through to the school is not in language that a parent may be familiar with.  That information has to be translated by the school so that the parents, students and children understand what is going on.</p> <p>  In our submission and in general terms we have spoken about the early weeks of going back to school.  This is brand new for us all.  I refer to the understanding of routine, the gaining of knowledge for each pupil, what each pupil requires and what pupils' needs are as they move into the school.  This is a critical period during which the schools, parents and children all have to work together.  It is worth taking time at the start, even at the risk of not covering some of the academic side, to get to know exactly what each student needs and ensure the two-way communication is understood and delivered.</p></speech>

First, I will address Inclusion Ireland.  It seems to me, and the previous survey presented to the committee demonstrated this, that children with special educational needs and intellectual disabilities were among those who suffered most due to the schools being closed, despite the best efforts of everyone.  From talking to parents and children, it seems the lack of access to schools during the lockdown was extremely difficult.  It is vitally important that these categories of children are prioritised.  Very often, these children have not been a priority for the Department of Education and Skills.  If ever there was a time for children with special educational needs to be a priority, it is now.</p> <p>  The roadmap presents some significant difficulties.  The first point that occurs to me concerns children who are in units.</p><p>There is a lack of clear guidance from the NCSE and the Department on a number of issues, including face coverings, but also units.  In some instances, principals are asking children and families to choose between the unit and the mainstream class.  Being in the unit reduces the value of the inclusion and integration with the main class unit.  If they are to go into the mainstream class, it to some extent undermines the argument for the unit.  That should not be the case because access to both is needed.</p><p> I have another question for Inclusion Ireland.  Deputies are hearing concern from constituents over school transport.  There are issues with school transport for students with special educational needs.  Very often there is a lack of access to taxis.  It that on Inclusion Ireland's radar?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.204" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#RR00200"><p>The issue with the unit is something we brought up earlier.  We think the existing information is inadequate as to whether a child will be able to continue his or her journey from the unit and do that piece where he or she spends part of the day in the unit and part of the day in the mainstream class.  I do not know what the solution is.  As our colleague has mentioned, each school is autonomous and different situations arise in each school.  The information coming from the Department is certainly not up to standard.</p> <p>  School transport is an issue, especially for children with special educational needs.  We are aware of children who may travel an hour, an hour and a half or two hours to school each way in a taxi, perhaps with two or three other children with very little social distancing.  That is a particular issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.205" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#RR00300"><p>I wish to add a point on the transport issue for students with special educational needs.  There is a divergence in planning.  Some areas have recognised that having pupils from two special schools sharing one bus leads to the potential risk of two school closures if there is an outbreak and have managed to adjust the routes separating those two school buses.  There is a particular issue in rural areas in getting taxi support where no actual bus route is in place and where they cannot get a taxi to serve that route, which leaves the parent having to bring that child significant distances to school.  We are not talking about half an hour.  We are talking about 100 km or more in some instances.  They have been well documented in previous committee meetings.  Parents are concerned about the social distancing particularly with the cohort on the special school transport who in the main cannot wear any form of face covering, leaving them more open to risk.</p> <p>  As Ms Lynch mentioned earlier, children going to school may not necessarily be on the same special school transport vehicle on the way back, which mixes it all up again.  When trying to reduce the risk of transmissibility it is a challenge for parents to see how that will work.</p></speech>

Parents are not totally clear as to when they should keep their children home.  They also have concern over income support.  If they do the right thing by keeping their children out when they display symptoms or if there is a positive case in the school, they are worried that they will be significantly out of pocket.  They feel there is a need for Government intervention there.  Do the representatives of the National Parents Council agree? </p></speech>

We highlighted it in our statement.  Back-to-school time is always an expensive time for parents in the best of years and this is a year that has had significant additional costs with the closure of schools since March and the home-schooling that has already gone on, in addition to the requirements that might come from learning outside the school requirements nowadays.  In particular we have raised the cost of transport where a student or parent may have to do that.  Many of the most vulnerable parents cannot afford to pay for those upfront.  We need to find a mechanism to avoid them being penalised from that perspective.</p><p>The commitment was given by everybody in the advisory group that no student will suffer as a result of Covid-19.  This is part of that so those kinds of costs must be covered.</p></speech>

Thought now needs to be given at the income level if parents need to take time off work, but also at the education level.  We need to plan for when classes cease or schools close for periods of two weeks and how we are going to support children and families during that time.  We now have a planning period to do that.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming in this morning.  I want to focus on some of the practical experiences that parents and children are having in this first week back to school and, of course, it impacts different children at different ages.</p> <p>  I refer to what Ms Lynch said about junior infants.  The junior infant children have never experienced anything other than going into school and their parents not coming in with them. The difficulty, and I speak from personal experience, is more for the parent than the child on the junior infant side.  </p> <p>  It is, however, a different thing for children going into fourth or fifth class who are more socially aware and on whom the long break has more significant psychosocial impacts.  When Ms Lynch was here earlier in the year - I believe it was it late May or early June - we talked about the importance of how the children were going back to school as much as when they were going back.  We spoke about the emotional resilience and emotional support they would need to cope with coming back, re-establishing their peer networks, coping with a new physical environment and, indeed, anything that has been going on at home for them in the interim.  Could Ms Lynch talk about how that emotional support is being acknowledged with schools?  I am aware Mr. Roland mentioned the importance of this already but could Ms Lynch talk about that, please?</p></speech>

Schools have put a huge focus on the mental health and well-being of children.  There are difficulties that are almost insurmountable at junior infant level because parents cannot physically go into the classroom.  Schools were doing a lot around videos before they went in and there has been much communication with parents.  However, many supports have been put into schools around that fourth and fifth class issue.  Much direction has been given to schools about the engagement of children back into the school with their peers and working through the experiences they have had over the past six months rather than through the curriculum.  The 93% of children who enjoyed their first day is a reflection on how that has been taken up and supported by schools and we hope that will continue.  We need to constantly be vigilant for children who are struggling with that.  The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, has put many supports into schools for either groups of children or individual children who are having a particularly hard time reintegrating back into school.  Tusla is also looking at that as well.  They need to continue and we need to keep a close eye.  It is still early days, though, so we may not yet be aware of some of the issues that might come up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#SS00800"><p>It may take a couple of weeks for any child to settle back in, particularly this year.  From a practical perspective at post-primary level, the absence of lockers and having to carry big, heavy books and also, perhaps, some gym gear or equipment for practical classes or whatever it may be, all adds to the anxiety of managing a day and managing it differently as well.  Some of the videos have been helpful.  I do not know about other members of the committee but I have seen few videos that have been targeted at children other than videos of the new school arrangement, or walking on this or the other side of the corridor.  The actual experience of a child coming in, sanitising his or her hands and wondering where he or she can put his or her stuff can generate significant anxiety for a 14 or 15 year old.</p> <p>  With the time I have left I want to raise, in particular, from the perspective of parents, the drop-off and collection arrangements.  When Ms Lynch was here before I asked her and the Department about looking at this from the perspective of parent and sibling coordinated drop-offs rather than class drop-offs.  If we are concerned about the management or congregation of parents around the school and the impact on risk for community transmission in that way, then minimizing the hanging around may alleviate that.  One might have one child who is collected an hour early or another child who is collected 40 minutes early from the same family, or three children in three different classes.  It really is going to make it much more difficult for parents.</p><p>Ms Lynch referred to it earlier, but could she make a broader comment on it for the committee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#TT00200"><p>Dropping off and picking up pupils was probably one of the main issues that parents commented on within the survey.  There will be some teasing out of how this works.  Until it is in operation, it will be very difficult for schools to determine whether something works.  Every school is different in terms of the space and the access areas it has.  Parents and schools will have to work together on it, perhaps with a sharing of good experiences within schools.  We have heard from parents that for some schools it is working very well and smoothly and there is flexibility, whereas in other schools it is not working as well.  If schools can share with one another practices that are working well, rather than everybody having to reinvent the wheel, that would really help matters.</p></speech>

It has been a very busy August for anybody involved in education in any shape or form.  Having visited a number of schools in my constituency, I know that principals have been extremely busy since the start of August to make the preparations that were necessary.  I am sure that is true of the representative bodies that have attended the meeting.  I thank all our guests for their very detailed presentations.  Many of the questions I had intended to ask have been answered.</p> <p>  I might direct my first couple of questions to Ms Fanning.  She made a point earlier about having a dedicated point of contact within the Department for parents.  Does she believe that is in place and functioning adequately at the moment?</p> <p>  There is an issue with older children, often from particular socioeconomic backgrounds, choosing to finish their schooling early.  Does Ms Fanning believe that enough supports are in place to get these children, who are often from vulnerable backgrounds, back into the school system to finish their education?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.219" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mai Fanning" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#TT00400"><p>The dedicated points of contact between the Department, schools and parents are vital for communication and getting the information across.  As Mr.O'Connor from Inclusion Ireland noted earlier, there is a great deal of good information on the departmental websites.  Nevertheless, getting that clearly translated and communicated to the whole school community may need to be worked on a little more.  The area where things are falling down is in miscommunication to parents.  Schools, within themselves, are working hard to communicate with the parental and student body.  If, however, schools are not getting the information they require to clarify matters, they cannot pass it on.</p> <p>  There are some grey areas.  I acknowledge that it is still early days for secondary schools because many of them have not yet fully kicked in.  There have been sort of lead-in days for different classes and some of them will not kick in full time for another week or two.  Grey areas have come up, however, and one of the main ones is that children who are classed as at risk because of a medical condition, but not at high risk, are in a dichotomy at the moment where they cannot go back to school because they are at risk.  The information from the Department refers only to high-risk children.  For such kids coming back to school, especially at second level, a remote-learning facility needs to be in place for them so that they will not be left behind.</p><p>They may not be a large majority, but they are still children in need of education and who have a right to education because of whatever disability they may have, be it medical, physical or anything else.  Those children must be supported within the schools.  If a school does not have the facility to provide remote learning for those children, such a facility must then be put in place, either through the school system or instigated by the Department, to help and cater for those kids.  Most schools are using a holistic approach to look after the academic side and the mental well-being of students coming in.  </p></speech>

We have rightly concentrated on children in this discussion.  I also have a question for the representatives from the two parents' organisations.  Has research been done on the effects on working parents?  Are we seeing many parents deciding to step out of the workforce this year because of the level of uncertainty regarding school closures?</p></speech>

That featured in the media today but it has been an ongoing concern that where those kinds of things happen, parents may have to step back from the workplace and suffer financially thereafter.</p> <p>  In answering many of the questions that have arisen, the key point that has emerged is that this is a learning period.  We are just back at school, we are starting to learn and we need to learn from this period.  We all need to work together to identify the various things that are going to happen and that we cannot tell will happen in advance, but we will learn as we go.  The important thing is that we work together, learn and put in place the management structures and supports that will be necessary behind all the things we will learn.  It is pointless opening the schools if we do not learn and look after the children, teachers and families involved.  In an unprecedented reopening time, there are new lessons to learn and we need to learn, manage and support them properly.</p></speech>

I have three or four questions.  I do not think I will get through all of them but I will try.</p> <p>  I direct my first question to Ms Dempsey and the representatives from Inclusion Ireland.  It was heartbreaking going through that organisation's report and learning of the regression that many students with intellectual disabilities have suffered during the Covid-19 period.  The Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, Deputy Madigan, will be taking statements in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  What are the main messages the representatives from Inclusion Ireland would like us to convey to her?  Do they have any solutions they would like us to address to the Minister of State and ask her to implement quickly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.225" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#UU00600"><p>We were fortunate to have an introductory meeting with the Minister the week before last, and we have a follow-up meeting organised for next week with the Minister.  The key areas for us are supporting schools to have adequate resources to support additional needs for children with special needs that might have been compounded by the extensive period at home.  That would involve looking at the whole school profile in respect of making amendments to it for the allocation of special education teachers and SNAs.  We feel that it can be challenging enough at times, but especially in a context where there may be ongoing issues for some children settling back into school because of leftover changes in behaviours, that challenge or otherwise.  Where schools identify a need for those additional supports, there should be a quick response.</p> <p>  Ms Fanning reiterated the issue of those at very high risk and the plans for supporting them at home.  The Department currently has no plans to support children in the high-risk medical group at home.  They are expected to attend school.  Even if those children are given a medical instruction to stay at home but they are at high risk, the document is not clear on the guidelines regarding whether the Department would step in and have that continuity of schooling programme open to them.  There is no indication as to what will happen in the case of children who have another family member at very high risk, whether a parent or a sibling.  This is happening already.  Families are having to make extremely hard decisions concerning their children, particularly at second level, who may not be going back to school because either a sibling or parent is at very high risk and there are concerns about the potential to bring infection back into the home, with catastrophic results.</p><p>Other than engaging with Tusla, it does not seem there is any proposal for those children to engage in continuing education.  There is psychological damage to the child who may not want to put their family member at risk.  There is also an educational issue for them in that, without standard provision being made in the plan for them, those children will be at home.  They will not have access to home tuition.  The proposal is not that the parents want to engage in home schooling.  They want their children to maintain contact with the school but that should be formalised rather than what we hear now, which is that it is left up to individual schools.  </p><p> In terms of additional supports from NEPS, those teams would be scaffolding around the schools, whether coming from NCSE or children's disability network teams, to ensure there is enough capacity there and that the schools feel supported in addressing any challenges that children with disability may have, which were compounded over the past six months. </p><p> Regarding parents who may be unable to return to employment, particularly if the child is in the very high risk category, there is no allowance for them other than to take permanent leave from their employment, with catastrophic economic consequences to the family unit.  These people are having to make decisions.  They might have term contracts according to which they were at home during the summer but they are expected to turn up to work this week and, unfortunately, they cannot.  There is no provision for them. </p></speech>

I have a question for the representatives of secondary school parents.  They have probably not been able to address their members on this so they might give a personal opinion, if they have one, or they can come back to me on it.  Regarding the adjusted leaving certificate results that will be out next week, is there particular information that parents would like to receive on how their children were ranked or given the grade they ended up with?  Has that come on to the representatives' radar?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.228" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Rolston" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#VV00300"><p>The most important thing about the calculated grade system is that it is seen to be fair and equitable.  That has always been the desire from the first time it was discussed.  That commitment has been given by every partner in education as we have worked through that system.  We have indicated that we will not know how satisfactory the system is until the results are delivered.  However, in fairness, a number of the potential issues have been looked at and addressed.  The general consensus among parents is that they have been addressed satisfactorily.  The proof will not be fully delivered until we see the results and how they fit in with CAO and college openings.  There has been a lot of focus right through the process and parents are generally happy.  There will always be some students and parents who are unhappy.  The appeals process and the transparency of that process will be critical.  The calculated grade system has never been perfect.  There has never been a possible perfect solution to it.  We need to make sure that we address the issues as we go and that the final result is acceptable to most people.  I believe most parents think that to date it has been reasonably addressed but that needs to continue and have a knock-on effect into third level.  There will always be individual cases which may come through the courts but which hopefully can be dealt with through the system. There are no specific scenarios that we can identify right now that any large cohort of parents are looking for.  They are just looking for fairness and equity.</p></speech>

Some of my questions have been answered so I will not go over them.  The past six months have been surreal, to say the least.  The task that the education sector has endured has been mammoth logistically and incredibly difficult for all concerned: pupils, teachers and anybody who works in the sector.  It is a different environment from what it was.  The world is a different place to what it was six months ago and the classroom is a different place to what it was six months ago physically and emotionally for all concerned.</p><p>My question is rather simple.  Are the witnesses satisfied thus far with the provisions the Department of Education and Skills made to get things right this week and last week as children go back to school?  This has been extremely difficult for everybody involved.  Thus far, are the witnesses satisfied with the provisions made by the Department for all educational settings, particularly primary and secondary schools?</p></speech>

We all know anecdotally that school principals and teachers have been working throughout the summer to get the show back on the road during what would ordinarily be the summer holidays.  This has to be acknowledged and commended.</p> <p>  In general, a lot of the information from the Department is reasonably good.  Speaking from the perspective of special education, some situations need a little more teasing out and, in our opinion, some situations have not been fully considered.  We have already mentioned young people transitioning from special education to mainstream education who spend part of their day in both.  We have already mentioned the SNAs hovering between two or three classes, where each class is meant to be a bubble.  The issue we feel has not been addressed adequately is that of children with complex disabilities and medical needs.  Many of these children will not be back in school any time soon.  We do not believe the Department's guidelines will allow them adequate access to a full education.  In our previous survey in May, parents were clear that what their children needed was access to a highly skilled teacher and that they, as parents, were not in a position to provide this education.  We would like to see a little bit more thought put into this.</p></speech>

The public health advice also changed over that time.  The schools have opened in a very good position with the work put in by the Department and the schools.  The area that needs specific attention is with regard to children not in school, whether for the reasons just outlined by Mr. O'Connor or because of events such as what happened yesterday when a class had to go home.  What is the provision for these children and their education?  This is the area which really needs some work and attention.  As time goes on, we do not know how frequently this will happen or whether there will be localised lockdowns that affect schools.  This is the area where we really need to do some work.</p></speech>

I will also focus on the grey area where there are children who do not fit into a box and, for whatever reason, cannot go back to school.  It is of the utmost importance that the Department facilitates them with a remote education system because some schools are not in a position to offer this facility, nor would they have the infrastructure in place for it.  This is absolutely paramount and needs to be addressed for second level students.  It does not matter what year they are in; it is important that it is looked at.</p></speech>

A large number of schools have done their very best over the past while.  There have been teething problems, and we should acknowledge that.</p><p> I want to pay particular tribute to Gaelscoil Osra&iacute; in Kilkenny, which held a meeting about a week before school resumed.  A GP and, I understand, a child psychotherapist were in attendance for the benefit of parents.  I thought that was an excellent idea.  There was a follow-up Zoom call with my child's class teacher.  I thought that was excellent.</p></speech>

I do not know if they are aware of a survey that was carried out by AsIAm, the autism charity.  It surveyed 1,100 parents, 77% of whom said their children who are getting additional support would need even more support.  Half of the parents surveyed felt they would not get it.  That shows the experience of parents of children with additional needs.  They have to fight for absolutely everything and it is sad that they think their children will not get the additional supports they need.  I would like to hear the opinions of the witnesses in that regard and what more can be done in the context of resource hours, SNAs and assessments.  There have been major delays in assessments, which will have a knock-on effect on children getting into ASD classes.</p></speech>

There is potential in terms of special education teaching hours.  It is welcome that the Department has provided extra resources for the substitute panel.  However, we are coming into the winter season.  Teachers would ordinarily go to work with a sniffle or a cold.  At the moment, however, when they have any signs of anything that could resemble Covid-19, they have been told to stay at home, and rightly so.  That will put significant pressure on the substitute panel.  When no one is available on that panel, special education teachers will be called in and away from their primary duty of supporting young people with disabilities.  We would like the Minister to put some additional resources into substitute panels.</p> <p>  In terms of SNAs, there will be direct substitution.  We are still worried about SNAs going between a number of classes.  If possible, schools could put forward cases to the Department for consideration on a case-by-case basis to ensure there is no possibility of cross-contamination.</p> <p>  Regarding class bubbles, anecdotal evidence indicates that parents have been told that they will pose difficulties in terms of in-class assessments by HSE and NEPS personnel.  As my colleague indicated earlier, many HSE personnel have already been redeployed to contact tracing and testing.</p></speech>

I do not know anybody who had his or her appointment stalled due to Covid who has now received a follow-up appointment and assessment.  Is that his experience?  He stated that he has heard anecdotal evidence to the effect that there are issues about personnel being in the same room.  That seems crazy.</p></speech>

Children who require assessments by psychologists tend to need an in-room assessment.</p><p>Directives for interaction with children have focused on remote interaction.  Certain types of things cannot be carried out remotely.  I am aware that the HSE is looking at other means to carry out those things.  There is a delay for children going through the statutory assessment of needs process whereby it cannot be completed, either because all relevant therapists are unavailable due to redeployment or because the assessment itself required them to meet the child in person, which was proving problematic, particularly in the early months of Covid.  Face-to-face engagement has started but is probably at a very low level, given that some staff have been redeployed.  There are existing shortages and waiting lists we already know about, but all of that is being compounded by Covid and restrictions on interactions.</p></speech>

We have had some of them here before, and some of the issues we discussed previously are obviously still very pertinent.</p> <p>  Communications appears to be a significant issue.  I note from both surveys that were done there was dissatisfaction in most cases with communications, which were considered vague in the case of the Department and some of the public teaching groupings and schools.  Have any of the groups thought about any ways in which this could be improved in the future?  We all know we are in this together.  Yes, there is a learning process, but is there an easier way of getting the required information out to families?  Have the witnesses any thoughts or ideas about that?</p></speech>

Parents do not necessarily engage with the Department of Education and Skills.  It is through the medium of the school that they get the communication that is specific to their school.  Members can see in our survey that many parents were very satisfied with the communication received, but some parents said there was a lack of two-way communication.  Whereas they might have got information, they did not feel in some small instances that they had an opportunity to talk to the school about concerns they had or to express their difficulties with arrangements that were put in place.  Where there is no such two-way communication, I think that can cause frustration that bubbles under the surface.  As I said, in the survey many parents said this was working well in their school, but where it was not working well it did cause more anxiety.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge that the schools, particularly the school management boards, have done excellent work trying to rise to all the challenges they have.  Some of these challenges have come up before.  I note that Inclusion Ireland's submission refers to the issue of children with disabilities who are in groupings or bubbles.  It says that in the event of a coronavirus case such children will suffer even more unduly.  It highlights that parents report having no access to supports such as the HSE therapies, services in schools, the visiting teacher service or NEPS services.  We have spoken about NEPS services before.  I did some informal work on this with local schools in Waterford and was appalled, to be frank, by the waiting times for the educational assessments and the fact that only a couple of assessments were being offered to individual schools each year.  Do those witnesses who are engaging with the Department in this area see any daylight on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.249" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#YY00900"><p>I understand there has been an increase in the number of psychologists to be recruited for the National Educational Psychological Service.  However, the Deputy is touching on an existing problem and an annual issue whereby schools are allocated a very small number of assessments for a particular child and, therefore, every year there are children who may require NEPS assessments but whose parents or guardians cannot get them prioritised for them.  Sometimes they are referred to the HSE to try some way of getting a similar type of assessment done.</p><p>As such it is an existing problem insofar as the child is missing out on six months of school during which assessments may normally have been carried out and there may be a delay there to children.  It is also important to note that the engagement with children who display additional needs in school in respect of their educational input should not be delayed by waiting on a NEPS assessment.  As there is a whole-school model of allocating special educational teaching supports, they no longer need a particular diagnosis to access additional teaching supports; it should be there and upfront.  However, in particular where children require a diagnosis for a particular type of support, there are still issues surrounding that, which the education system itself has to work through.</p><p> When it comes to providing psychological support to a school, I understand that NEPS has provided a lot of material to schools to provide generalised support to the whole school.  The Deputy is bringing up a situation where an individual child requires direct support from NEPS.  I believe that capacity is limited due to the overall number.  Its model is to provide a whole-school broad-level support, rather that one-to-one support for individual children.</p></speech>

Has Ms Dempsey spoken to the Department again about this issue?  If schools are only allowed, in essence, to do a couple of evaluations a year, the conundrum is that some of those doing the evaluations for the schools are also in a position to do it privately but their private assessment is not taken on board.  Has Ms Dempsey thought about trying to speak to the Department about that again?</p></speech>

There is a panel of assessors whose reports would be accepted.  Anecdotally, there have been stories in which the reports of certain psychologists might not be accepted by schools and the NCSE; that is a matter for professional bodies.  Again, these sort of stories come around anecdotally that registered psychologists will provide a report and indeed a diagnosis and that may not be accepted for supports.  The question as to why that has been the case between the HSE and other parties is really not for us to answer.</p></speech>

What has happened in recent years, and Ms Dempsey has referred to this, is that getting resources is now not nearly as linked to assessment as it used to be.  Schools are front-loaded with supports and children should be able to get those supports without an assessment from a psychologist.  It is based on the teacher's assessment of the student's learning needs.  We support the system going that way, rather than opening up the private assessment piece, whereby parents who can afford to get assessments do so and those who cannot do not.  That would be an important factor in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#ZZ00500"><p>In response to Ms Lynch, I have met a number of parents who have gone down the road of private assessment and I can tell her most assuredly that they could not afford it.  They had to scrimp and save to put it together because essentially, they are trying to fast-track some resourcing for their children who are being left behind.  It is not about people who can afford it.  As Ms Lynch probably knows, the majority of these people cannot afford it.  Everybody in the area needs to be lobbying for this, as it seems to be significant discrimination against these children.</p> <p>  On the home tuition scheme and the remote learning, can the witnesses provide an idea of the potential number of children and families who are affected?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.255" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#ZZ00600"><p>The home tuition scheme is different to the scheme that has been proposed for the continuity of education for children who are deemed to be very high risk.  Under it they would still be on the roll of their base school.  Currently, the only children that can apply for the home tuition scheme are those without a school placement and a significant number of children on the autistic spectrum fall into that category.  Children who cannot attend school due to their own medical conditions and who historically have had huge gaps in their attendance at school are a separate category to those who are now identified as being at very high risk from Covid.  There are also children who, for psychological or psychiatric reasons cannot engage in a school setting.</p><p>The existing home tuition scheme, even that for 2020-21, is still for the original cohort.  Although it is something at which we want to look, it is not currently proposed to consider children who are at high risk or very high risk and who cannot come into the school settings, although they have a base school, for the level of access a child on the home tuition scheme receives, which may be anything from ten to 20 hours of teacher contact time every week of the school year rather than just informal remote learning packages.  We would like consideration to be given to providing packages based on individual children's needs and home and family circumstances rather than saying a child is either over the line or in the home tuition scheme.  To be clear, children who are considered very high risk as regards Covid will not be considered for the home tuition scheme.  Children with medical needs who have already missed substantial parts of their schooling due to hospitalisations and so on can apply for the scheme.  It is for those who have an existing issue with regard to school attendance.</p></speech>

The Inclusion Ireland representatives said they are due to meet the Department again shortly.  I have engaged widely with people on school transport.  I ask the representatives to highlight to the Department that a number of people hold private contracts for school transport that have not been renewed.  They are operating the services again but are waiting for the Department to give them new contracts, which is putting them in a very difficult position.  Inclusion Ireland needs to bring that up with the Department.  I will certainly also do so.  It needs to be flagged.  A great number of people in the private sector are running services at a loss based on their previous contract and the Government is not engaging with regard to giving them additional resources or revised contracts to allow them to operate profitably.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1521" speakername="P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#AAA00300"><p>I welcome all of the delegations.  I have a number of questions, the first of which I will direct to Inclusion Ireland.  Its submission mentions that 87% of its clients have returned to their school settings or adult services.  What proportion or percentage of its membership attends school and what proportion or percentage attends adult day services?  Many Deputies will know of people who avail of adult day services.  The situation has been very difficult for their families.  Many of these people have not returned to their services.  Some of those who have returned are only attending for one day a week whereas they may have attended for four and a half or five days last year.  Will the representatives of Inclusion Ireland comment on the situation for people attending adult services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.259" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#AAA00400"><p>I will answer very quickly.  The 87% relates to schools.  Slightly over 9% are returning to school on a staggered basis.  They will attend school for a number of days and avail of remote learning for a number of days for the first few weeks.  A further 3% or 4% will avail of remote learning only.  We suspect that these are mainly people with high medical needs.  I know the topic of today's meeting is not day services but, as we understand it, the vast majority of adult day services will have returned by the end of this week, albeit not on a full-time basis.  Anecdotally, we are hearing that people are getting anything from two to three days a week.  That is probably an issue for a different Minister but these services have not received the same funding as schools with regard to reopening.</p></speech>

I again wish to express the difficulties those people are having.  Each child or adult's case is specific to his or her family.  I hope they can return to some kind of normality in the weeks ahead.</p> <p>  My second question relates to school transport.  I am interested in hearing from the parents' groups.  There are a number of villages in my constituency in which children are currently without a bus service.  Watergrasshill, where 46 children are without a service, is one such village.  There are a further 13 children in Glenville and a half a dozen in Carrignavar.  In Whitechurch, near Blarney, another 14 children are without a bus service since yesterday.</p><p>I noted that, in response to our guests' surveys, many people have expressed satisfaction with the return to school and have been fairly complimentary, albeit there has been some criticism of the school transport system.  I wonder what the interactions between members of the National Parents Council and CI&Eacute; or Bus &Eacute;ireann have been like.  Will they make a comment on the overall issue of school transport?</p></speech>

The biggest issue this year, apart from the major problems that Covid-19 has caused, has been the change from 100% to 50% capacity on transport.  That only happened relatively recently.  It is our understanding that the transport services are still working through that and trying to put buses in place in areas that are without them.  The issue of transporting children to school is an integral part of education and school life, as we have identified a number of times, and must be treated as such.  The commitment has been given that a parent who cannot avail of the public school transport system for whatever reason will be facilitated and repaid for any costs incurred in getting children to school.  That is fine, but we have highlighted that quite a considerable number of those who fall into that bracket are particularly vulnerable families who may not have the wherewithal to afford those costs upfront.  That needs to be addressed quickly.  We are hopeful that it will be addressed quickly in light of the speed with which some other matters are addressed.  It is an integral part of going back to school.</p></speech>

As our guests are well aware, there was a specific scheme this year and a lot of extra resources went into serving people with special needs and accommodating them during the lockdown period.  What were our guests' experiences of July provision this year and where would they like to see improvements or additional funding next year, given that these provisions are targeted at our most vulnerable children?</p></speech>

The feedback we have received is to the effect that it has been a very positive programme for those who experienced it.  As an advocacy organisation, we often hear only the bad stories because people tend not to ring us up and tell us about wonderful things that have happened.  The silence on this matter is a case of no news being good news and any anecdotal reports we have heard have described quite successful summer provision experiences.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.265" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#BBB00500"><p>What ran this summer was not actually the July provision scheme but was called a summer programme.  This was because the July provision scheme involves adherence to a separate set of restrictive criteria.  Thousands of children who would not normally qualify for July provision finally got the opportunity of an extended school year this summer.  In interactions with the Department and the Minister, we will be looking for that broader model of support for children with all types of disabilities to be extended to the summer of 2021.  It would not only apply to the extended school year for post-primary students.  It would be appropriate to have that educational input but there is also a need for social and psychological supports and the ability to provide students with a programme that is educational, social and sporting over the summer period whereby students are not just restricted to having access to a teacher but also to an SNA where that is more appropriate.  We should aim to give parents that choice again.  As Mr. O'Connor said, silence suggests success.  The easing back into school has been a substantial success for those children who availed of the summer programme because they had already seen what their schools look like, the staff involved and the layout of the classrooms.  They were afforded that familiarity because they got in the door much earlier than others.</p><p>We were always looking for an extension of the July provision scheme but what we saw was a summer programme, albeit that it had issues around communication at the beginning, and it certainly is the way forward.  That is what we will look to do for summer 2021.</p></speech>

Previous speakers spoke about the complications presented by Covid, but it is my experience that this issue was prevalent long before the arrival of Covid.  I have a letter I received from the HSE on 13 July this year concerning a constituent of mine.  The case concerns a ten-year old boy who was referred to the child development team of the HSE in February 2016 by Enable Ireland.  He received a diagnosis of developmental co-ordination disorder from Enable Therapy Services in August 2017.  This young boy needs support from the child development team psychotherapy services.  The case dates back to 2016.  The information I received in July is that the current waiting time for psychotherapy intervention is extensive but the service would make contact with the family as soon as an appointment becomes available.  You can imagine, Chairman, if you were the parent of that child and that is the clarification you received about a child who needed support from 2016.</p> <p>  This child also needs support from the occupational therapy service.  Again, there is an acknowledgement that the child was referred to the child development team in 2016 and that he is currently on the occupational therapy waiting list for intervention.  No date has been given, but there is an indication that there may be an appointment within the next three months.  The child also needs to meet the psychology services staff.  That goes back to September 2015 when a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder was made.  Since that time he has been on the waiting list for psychological services.  He received the psychology input from the primary care team and received a psychology appointment with the child development team in 2017.  He was then placed on a high-priority waiting list for individual psychological work but he is still waiting.</p> <p>  That is a scandalous legacy issue pertaining to a child with special needs and I know of countless other cases.  My question is directed in particular to the representatives of Inclusion Ireland.  Is that type of scenario particular to my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan or is it generally prevalent and is there any indication of exactly how many children are in that position?  How many families are going through the traumatic ordeal of knowing that their child needs supports and is not able to get them?</p></speech>

What I said is that Covid has compounded the issue of waiting lists.  It was not inferred that it was a result of Covid; it is a long-standing problem.

Covid has certainly compounded those waiting lists and they are only going in a negative direction currently.</p></speech>

Have its members who have been told to isolate their children for Covid-related reasons received the support they need in order for their children to be educated?  At the peak of the pandemic, I was contacted by many second year and fifth year students worried about how they would catch up this year.  Is the ground that was lost being made up in an adequate manner?</p> <p>  I know there has been an increase in the number of guidance counsellors.  Is there sufficient access to guidance counsellors in schools?</p></speech>

We would favour those 120 posts being for guidance counsellors only.  We have only just started getting our schools open.  As we go through, the importance of professional guidance counsellors within the school system particularly at second level will become increasingly clear.</p> <p>  We are back to home tuition and home learning.  That is totally dependent on the schools.  It has not been made clear, either by schools or the Department, what facilities will be there for children who would need to remove themselves from school for a particular reason.  I revert to those children who are classed as being either risk or high-risk.  A child who is not classed as high-risk but just risk may have a high-risk person at home and may not be in a position to go to school.  We need clarification on home-schooling and remote learning for those children.</p> <p>  If an issue arises in a school, the guidance counsellors will need to be there in order to not only offer academic support and guidance to the children but also the psychological supports that will be needed.  In dealing with anything that breaks out in the schools, we have to ensure that everything is done in a calm and cohesive manner to avoid putting excess anxiety on the children and their families.  That will only come if there is good communication, a matter to which all of the groups have alluded.  It must work both ways and not just come from the Department to schools and parents.  Parental concerns must be fed back so that they can be addressed by the schools and the Department.</p></speech>

Are its members asking about supports to deal with an increased level of anxiety among their children?  Are they finding children this year much more anxious than would normally be the case?  Parents coming to my office have indicated that their children are more anxious and nervous.  Has the National Parents Council Primary discussed supports for primary schoolchildren who may be anxious particularly if they are high-risk or have underlying conditions?</p> <p>  When the capacity of school buses was reduced to 50% and parents were told that if they drove their children to school they could seek a refund, was the matter discussed with the National Parents Council Primary?  How does the council see that working?  Is there a timeline involved?  How do people apply for the refund?</p><p>Many people who have come to my office do not have a car and depend on bus services.  They cannot afford taxis.  On what programme did the National Parents Council Post Primary work with the Department?  Was it at the talks?  While it is good that there is an incentive in place to drive secondary school children to school, the family must have a car to avail of it.  How much will families be paid as a refund?</p></speech>

We asked parents to rate on a scale of one to five how anxious their children were about going back to school, extending from "not anxious at all" to "very worried".  Some 7% of parents indicated their children were very worried about going back to school.  We did not ask if this was specifically due to Covid-19.  Typically in any year, there would be children who are worried about going back to school due to bullying and other issues related to going to school.</p> <p>  The supports put in place to date by NEPS and the Department are comprehensive and allow for a whole school approach and also a more individualised approach for children and families who might be experiencing more difficulties.  Time will tell, however, as these are early days.  Some children have only just gone back to school or today might be their first day back.  In a couple of weeks, we will need to find out at what level these anxieties are.  We will need to find out whether anxieties have decreased as children have gone back to school and whether things are going well and children have settled in.  Time is important here.  We do not want to leave this for too long but we need to see how well children and families are settling back in.</p></speech>

The National Parents Council Post Primary reiterated on two occasions that people are paid after the fact.  Parents who do not have a car should contact the Department directly.  There is a specific email for parents who have difficulty providing transport for their children.</p> <p>  Those who have a car are expected to drop everything.  The parent may not be going to the school down the road.  We have this issue regarding children with disabilities all the time.  It is an annual event.  The parents are paid after the fact.  They apply for funding and are paid a couple of months later.  Again, it is down to a person's socioeconomic status.  If a parent cannot afford to put petrol in his or her car, that is a challenge, even though parents typically have a car.  As far as I am aware, any parent in that position can contact the Department directly using a specific email address on the Department's webpage on the school transport scheme.</p></speech>

I am working on a few cases in the disability sector where bus services have been cut and some of the affected families do not have a car.  This is becoming a big issue because these families must use a taxi, which they cannot afford.  Are the Department and the NPCPP trying to come up with some sort of a solution?  We must make sure that, as Ms Dempsey said, children or adults with a disability, who are the most vulnerable, get to school or the workplace.  I do not know if there is a proper roadmap in place for that.  We need to see that. </p></speech>

Some children are always transported in taxis in lieu of a minibus or larger bus.  It is really in cases of children who are attending mainstream schools and children without disabilities that the affordability of a taxi is called into question.  If a child is in a special class or special school, a payment is not required on the part of the parent.  The Department will pay the taxi provider directly.</p></speech>

As Ms Dempsey said, that service should be free.  It seems there are one or two cases slipping through the net this year.</p></speech>

That is an ongoing issue which is not directly related to Covid.  These children are only given a space on an annual basis where there is a space on the special school transport route in question.  However, should another child qualify, he or she would be allocated that space first which leaves the other child out in the open, as it were.  This only happens where there is a disagreement on whether the child is in the appropriate special school that is nearest to his or her school or home.</p><p>Where a parent does not want to send a child to the particular special school or special class that is nearest to them, the Department will not fund that.  It will fund it only on a concessionary basis.  Where there is an agreement that it is the most appropriate school for the child, it will not have concessionary funding as the child will be on the school transport scheme.  It is a nuanced scheme but every year there are a handful of cases where difficulty arises in that the place is taken up by a child who qualifies and those who had a concessionary place are left without special school transport.</p></speech>

He spoke of a sense of relief because there had been a sense of isolation for many children, particularly those with special needs, during the lockdown and the following period of absence from school.  Ms Dempsey also spoke of a similar feeling of isolation and abandonment that parents had.  Would she share that sense of relief that the schools are open and children are now back in schools?</p></speech>

We have spoken several times about children who simply will not be able to return to school.  For parents who now have to face issues with their own employment if they have employment contracts, their only option now is to stay at home permanently.  There is a significant economic cost to such a family where it is left with these types of decisions to make.</p> <p>  The isolation will continue.  We all know about the reductions in other supports outside of education, such as home support, access to respite and all the other features that might originally have supported the family of a child with disabilities.  There will still be fundamental issues with the provision of all those other measures.  For families where the children cannot go back to school because of their complex disabilities and medical needs, that isolation will continue, and we need to look at how we can prioritise those families, whether for primary care or disability services or supports, and ensure they will not remain isolated in their own homes.</p> <p>  Everyone is talking about the word "cocooning", but there are families with children who will be required to cocoon continuously until such time as we are on top of Covid and vaccination programmes have been rolled out.  If such families' children are not able to go back to school, there has to be something for them in order that this isolation, which I have described to the committee in recent months, will not just continue.  Now we know about it - we have voiced it and documented it - and we know there will be a cohort for whom that isolation will continue unless we find other means to ensure that their family units are supported.  I refer in particular to siblings included in a new cocoon, given that they are unable to go back to school because the family and medical teams deem that the risk is so high for that one family member that the whole family must withdraw from society, although society does not need to withdraw from the whole family.</p></speech>

Others, of course, say they manifestly do not work and that, at the very best, they press pause.  How does Ms Dempsey think those families she described would feel about new lockdowns, whether localised ones that affect them or national ones?</p></speech>

This is an ongoing experience for some families, which existed even prior to Covid.  Some people have said that while family carers are not talked about enough, at least now, for once, other people in society are experiencing the same issues that families and people with disabilities face all the time, such as in regard to access to public services, education or employment.  Everybody else in the country is now feeling what can often be a normal experience for the cohort of individuals that Inclusion Ireland represents, whether they are in lockdown or otherwise, even if lockdown might make it more difficult.</p> <p>  There were great community efforts over the past six months.  The worry is that those kinds of supports, as the country has opened up, are now few and far between.  As for the feeling that we are all in this together, some people will not see that because they will not get the opportunity to experience it.</p><p>Regardless of whether supports are provided by the State, a voluntary organisation or a local authority, we need to remember that a cohort of people will be locked down in their homes for a substantial period.  We talked about education and we must ensure there is educational provision that is robust.  We must also ensure that surveys carried out six months from now do not make the same kinds of findings that we found in our surveys in May, which showed that remote learning was not working for some children.  We reiterate that every child under the age of 18 has a statutory right to an education and we need to find some mechanism to fulfil that right for all the children in the various scenarios we know about as well as those that might be unforeseen.</p></speech>

I am accompanied from the Department by Ms Deirdre Shanley, assistant secretary, Ms Aoife Conduit, assistant secretary, Mr. Dalton Tattan, assistant secretary, Dr. Harold Hislop, chief inspector, Ms Yvonne Keating, deputy chief inspector, and Mr. Eamonn Murtagh, director in the planning and building unit; and by Ms Anne Tansey, director, National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.</p> <p>  Although this is my first appearance before the committee, I have been following its work and I acknowledge the energy and commitment that have gone into its sessions to date as it discusses the response to Covid-19 across Government, State-delivered services and other sectors of society.</p> <p>  As members know, the reopening of our schools has been a number one priority since my appointment.  It was not a hope, as some would have characterised it, but a reasonable ambition which, like all ambitions, presented a series of challenges for us to address in order to realise it.  I have been fully supported by the Government in putting in place the supports necessary to realise that ambition.  In recent days and into this week, we have seen that ambition being realised.  Deputies will also be aware of the announcement I made yesterday on calculated grades, which followed a Government decision on proposals I put forward to amend the national standardisation process in the calculated grades model.</p><p>Under the calculated grades model, estimated marks will be adjusted, as planned, to ensure that a consistent standard is applied across schools throughout the country when judging the performance of students.  The change I introduced removes the use of school-by-school historical data in the standardisation model and places a greater emphasis on the estimated marks provided by schools to individual students.  In making this change, I was driven by the desire to ensure fairness for the students in the process.<br/><br/>Our decisions provide additional reassurances to 2020 leaving certificate students that their unique situation has been understood and treated fairly.  Fairness must be at the heart of everything we do as a society.  From my first day as Minister for Education and Skills, I have been determined that in this extraordinary year the system in place to mark students' achievements of their years in post-primary education would be the fairest possible system under these challenging safeguards.<br/><br/>In July, the Cabinet approved the roadmap for the full return to schools.  The roadmap set out how the public health advice provided to my Department on the safe return to school could be implemented at individual school level.  Approval was given for over &euro;375 million<b></b>in additional funding necessary to support the implementation.  I provided details of the supports being made available to both Houses of the Oireachtas in the last week of July and the effect of those supports has been seen across the country as schools reopened their doors from last week.<br/><br/>During August, I provided a number of updates on how the planning for schools reopening was progressing.  To date, the payments made directly to schools exceed &euro;160 million.  My Department brought forward the payment of the annual minor works grant to primary schools, totalling approximately &euro;30 million, which typically is paid in either December or January each year.  In addition, an enhanced minor work grant, which matches the 2019 payment, has also been issued directly to schools.  This amounts to &euro;60 million, which has now been issued directly to primary schools in minor works grants since the publication of the roadmap.  A minor works grant amounting to &euro;42 million issued to post-primary schools in the free scheme.<br/><br/>The minor works grant provides schools with the necessary flexibility to implement necessary physical measures in their school quickly to enable the full school reopening.  These measures include, but are not limited to, reconfiguration of classroom space, repurposing rooms to provide additional space, purchasing furniture, altering desk layouts, and the short-term rental of additional space.  Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide on the appropriate reconfiguration measures for their school, which are necessary to facilitate school reopening.<br/><br/>The roadmap was developed following intensive engagement with stakeholders from the education sector, including staff unions, representatives of principals and deputy principals, school management bodies, and representatives of parents and post-primary students.  This co-operation and collaboration has continued, including at a local level where school communities have worked together to best address their local circumstances.  Yesterday, officials met the primary and post-primary stakeholders again to maintain the spirit of partnership regarding reopening.  There was also a meeting of the advisory group on the State examinations yesterday emphasising the continued co-operation in this area.  I acknowledge the unstinting and selfless efforts of schools communities throughout the country in recent weeks and months to do all that is necessary to reopen our schools.  We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to all of them for their generosity of spirit, a reflection of their absolute dedication to their students and the provision of education for all.<br/><br/>The roadmap and its accompanying documentation provided schools with guidance on training, checklists for schools on preparing for reopening and guidance for operating the school safely in a Covid-19 context.  Template Covid-19 response plans for schools were also provided to schools.  These plans provide clear and practical guidance and support to schools on the range of measures that need to be put in place to bring everyone back to school safely.  The Department has produced age-appropriate guidance for students in the form of animated videos, which are intended to help students further understand some of the new routines when they return to school.  Guidance is also available for parents and will be available in several languages.  These animations are available at <i>gov.ie/backtoschool</i>and also issued to schools to be disseminated to parents.<br/><br/>The HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre has confirmed that all recommendations in the public health advice I published at the beginning of July, including physical distancing guidelines as set out in the roadmap, still apply in all schools, with the exception of the recommendations on face coverings, which has been updated to reflect the latest research and expertise.  Teachers and post-primary school students should wear face coverings, similar to those worn in shops or on public transport.  Guidance for parents, guardians and families on the return to school is also available on the <i>gov.ie</i>website.</p><p>Parents and guardians can direct specific queries to their schools. <br/><br/>A letter was issued to all schools last week, together with a HSE document entitled, Schools Pathway for Covid-19, the Public Health approach, setting out the approach to managing isolated confirmed cases of Covid-19 within the school community and the principles that will underpin the management of outbreaks or potential outbreaks and the aligned testing strategy within an educational facility.  It is important to note that the response to confirmed cases or outbreaks of Covid-19 in the community or in a school is the responsibility of, and will be led and managed by, public health and the HSE.  All decisions as to the appropriate actions following a confirmed case or outbreak will be made by their teams in the context of a full public health risk assessment procedure according to the principles set out in the document.  <br/><br/>Any actions to be taken by the school will be communicated directly by public health and the HSE.  School management will be informed as and when such actions, such as the exclusion of children or staff or partial or full closure, are deemed necessary on public health grounds.  If the school is not so informed, it has not been deemed necessary by public health. <br/><br/>Children will continue to display symptoms of many other circulating respiratory viruses.  It is known that young children often have a persistent cold.  A child with a blocked or runny nose but no fever can attend school, but if he or she requires paracetamol or ibuprofen, he or she must stay at home for 48 hours and parents or guardians should contact their GP to assess whether a test is required.  Students and staff who have symptoms of Covid-19, including fever, new cough, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties or loss or change to their sense of smell or taste, should not attend school. <br/><br/>The definition of close contacts within a school will be variable and determined by a risk assessment that will take account of individual factors within each school or class.  It will not be automatically assumed that a whole class will be deemed as close contacts.  Close contacts will be directly notified by the HSE and advised to restrict their movements and present for testing on day zero and day seven.  Close contacts will restrict their movements for 14 days even in the event that Covid-19 is not detected in both of these tests. <br/><br/>There is no blanket policy to test entire classes or years.  The testing strategy will be aligned to the public health risk assessment, which may recommend widespread swabbing within a class or school under HSE mass testing procedures.  In the event of an outbreak, public health will determine between a range of possible interventions, from exclusion and testing of a small group or pod of pupils up to and including closure of an affected facility.  All schools are required to have a summary of key information to assist public health in its public health risk assessment ready to be provided on request.  Outside the school environment, everyone should follow the latest public health measures announced on 18 August, which are available on <i>gov.ie</i>. <br/><br/>The issue of school transport is an area of considerable interest to Deputies and it is a massive daily logistical undertaking. </p></speech>

Updated health advice from NPHET has an impact on the operation of post-primary school transport services.  The Government decided that the arrangements made for primary school transport schemes will proceed as planned when schools reopen and these services will operate fully with additional measures in place, such as preassigned seating and additional hygiene and cleaning measures.</p> <p>  The post-primary scheme has also commenced operation with additional measures in place, such as preassigned seating and other measures I have outlined in line with those required on public transport, which is using 50% of passenger capacity, for post-primary services as required.  The Department is rolling out that facility in the shortest time possible.</p></speech>

I want to give Deputies time to ask questions which, it is to be hoped, can be answered.  The first speaker is from Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#LLLL00500"><p>I, along with my colleague, Deputy Conway-Walsh, who will flesh this out, want to flag with the Minister the issue of calculated grades.  I do not need a response now and I may raise the issue with her on another occasion.  Students who sat the leaving certificate in 2019 are concerned about the implications for their college places.  I believe solutions can be found and I will write to the Minister's office with some suggestions.  The issue can be resolved and I urge the Minister to act because it is vitally important in terms of being as fair as possible to those students.</p> <p>  The schools are open.  We had our first day back with our nine year old on Thursday and it went very well.  Earlier today I acknowledged the extraordinary work done by school staff, teachers, boards of management and parents.</p><p>I have been very critical of the Department.  I will be again.  I will be this afternoon.  Countless issues and many gaps and areas of concern need to be resolved.  It would, however, be churlish of me not to acknowledge the fact that the Minister and her Department staff have worked hard on this issue, and I wish to acknowledge that now.<br/><br/>However, getting schools open is one thing; keeping them open is as great a challenge, if not more of a challenge.  What parents, teachers and everyone else connected to schools right across the State want to know is whether the schools will stay open on a long-term, permanent basis and whether the reopening will be sustainable.  We have heard throughout the day from representatives of school staff and parents and people advocating for those with special educational needs that there are a range of issues that suggest that the return to school has not been flawless and that there are major risks that could potentially undermine that return.  There are a number of keys issues - I have written to the Minister about this - that need to be addressed to ensure that schools remain open safely and sustainably.  The first is rapid priority testing.  The next is supporting families and parents where a child is displaying symptoms, whether that is expansion of <i>force majeure</i>leave or illness benefit or whatever other measures the Government needs to take.  It is essential that parents are supported in making the right choice.  They will want to keep their children out when they are displaying symptoms.  That should not mean their risking their income or their job, and there is a policy gap there.  I appreciate it is not just the Minister's responsibility but she needs to talk to the Ministers with responsibility for employment and social protection.  This is central to ensuring that schools remain open.  We need to reduce the largest class sizes in Europe.  We need to deal with the shortages of teachers, which do exist in some areas, whether or not the Minister chooses to acknowledge it, and we need to ensure that the children who are most affected by the closures of schools are not left behind when it comes to those with special educational needs.<br/><br/>I will move on to my questions.  The first relates to that first priority I raised with the Minister in writing and just now, namely, priority testing.  It was reported by Emma O'Kelly of RT&Eacute; news that this had been agreed.  Subsequently she clarified that the Department was now telling her that it had not been agreed.  She stands over the fact that this was reported to her but, whatever the position and whatever the Department told her, the Department's current position, as I understand it, is that there is not yet priority testing.  That is not good enough.  That needs to be resolved.  When will there be priority testing for children and school staff?</p></speech>

On the question of whether schools will stay open and whether they will do so on a long-term basis, he has raised an important point.  Experts, including our Chief Medical Officer, CMO, Professor Philip Nolan, and others have said that schools by their nature are essentially very safe places and all the measures that need to be put in place in terms of a Covid-safe environment have been put in place, with substantial funding of &euro;160 million already gone into the schools for a variety of measures to ensure that the best possible safety measures are taken in schools.

It is hugely important we recognise that if the community wishes for our schools to stay open in the long term, the community must accept responsibility for supporting schools and the good work they do.</p> <p>  We have had a number of engagements with the Department of Health and the HSE and, just some time ago, a high-level engagement where we raised the issue of priority testing.  Priority testing will be provided where there is an outbreak in a school.  Schools will be treated no differently from other environments where priority testing is being provided where a situation of that nature occurs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#MMMM00900"><p>That is welcome but it is not consistent with some of the previous statements that have been made.  The Minister is confirming there will be priority testing.  That is vitally important and I hope we will see that happen for students and staff where it is required, within 24 to 48 hours and as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I will speak about high-risk staff as well but I wish to raise with the Minister the issue of high-risk families.  I was contacted by many relatives of schoolchildren and school staff after the roadmap was published who were astonished that there was no reference to them at all.  They still have not had that gap addressed.  I sent correspondence to the Minister on behalf of one family with a parent who has leukaemia.  The Minister's office responded to them saying it was the responsibility of the board of management.</p><p>That is not good enough.  The fact is there is no guidance whatsoever.  There is guidance for very high-risk children.  There are issues with high-risk staff that need to be resolved and I will return to that.  It is, however, incredible that there are parents whose children are worried about going back to school because they are worried about bringing the infection home to those parents and they have had no guidance at all.  They feel ignored and neglected.  It is not good enough to bounce the issue on to a board of management, which has no basis on which to make a decision because it has got nothing from the Department on it.  That is a gap that needs to be resolved.  Can the Minister tell me that she is going to do that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#NNNN00200"><p>The issue the Deputy has raised is the specific case of parents or family members who are categorised as being at high risk.  I absolutely appreciate the difficulties, the trauma and the worry for people who are in a situation of that nature.  However my suggestion would be - and it is appropriate - that they would take guidance from their GP and discuss it in a medical context.  The advice that is being made available to us is that child-to-child transmission and child-to-adult transmission of Covid-19 is very low.</p> <p>  As we are aware, studies have shown that students who have been out of school since 12 March need the opportunity to return to school.  This is necessary not just from an educational point of view but from a socialisation one and we must recognise that within the system as well.  As I have said, where there is anxiety, a GP should be consulted in the first instance and there should be a medical decision made around that.  In the second instance, there are well-being resources available for parents and for students who might have particular concerns around the issues the Deputy has raised.  As such, we cannot take a blanket approach with this because each set of circumstances is unique and individual to the persons concerned but in the main, this is where we stand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#NNNN00300"><p>I am not looking for a blanket approach.  I am not looking for a one-page email or a one-page statement.  I am looking for some kind of guidance, that is, some kind of documentation or a process but there is nothing for these people.  Even the stuff the Minister said about GPs has not been provided.  The school has no basis on which to say that it should accept the letter of a GP.  The school is in the dark and the family is in the dark.  I urge the Minister to address this because that is not a good enough attitude.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#NNNN00400"><p>To clarify, in our roadmap we are clear about the supports that are out there.  We are clear that issues will arise with children or indeed parents being anxious about the return to school and we are clear about the supports that are there for that.  As such, there is no absence of clarity but if there is an individual case the Deputy wishes to raise, I have no difficulty in looking at that individual case.  We are very clear, however, about the supports we are making available and all that we will do to ensure that a child is safe and happy within the school environment.</p></speech>

I will leave it at that and ask the Minister to consider the issue because it really does need to be considered.  There is no reference anywhere to this category of family.</p> <p>  My final question relates to school transport.  It is chaotic.  It is a bit of an issue every year, as I am sure the Minister knows from her own county of Kerry where I am sure there are many issues with it.  However, this year in particular it is extremely messy.  There are such diverse levels of social distancing and private operators are offering potentially different distancing depending on the price.  What is the latest update on additional capacity for school transport and will the Minister engage with the non-publically funded sector because that is a lot of traffic-----</p></speech>

That meant there was no requirement for social distancing other than for masks to be worn by second-level students on buses.  The additional resources were made available for hand sanitiser, PPE for the bus driver, measures for cleaning down the bus and all of that.  A number of days ago, the NPHET advice changed on second-level schools and as a consequence of that we are working with Bus &Eacute;ireann to roll out, as speedily as possible, the 50% capacity.</p><p>Some of that is already operational.  Indeed, our further education and training service is already being supplied at 70% capacity.  An additional 1,600 buses and drivers will be required.  We are providing funding to make that possible.  In the interim, we have offered to compensate parents who wish to provide transport themselves.</p><p> With regard to the private operators the Deputy mentioned, Bus &Eacute;ireann may have a relationship with private operators but that is a different matter.  Private operators who have a private arrangement with parents are not within my remit.  The Department is only charged with overseeing the school transport system as operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Private arrangements between parents and private operators fall within the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport rather than the Department of Education and Skills.</p></speech>

I recognise the significance of that.  I particularly think of families who have members going to school for the first time.  Different people have different experiences but I met a parent regarding a child who faces great medical challenges.  The national school gave the parents special attention a week prior to the child coming to the school.  It has been exceptionally aware and fully supportive of their parental needs.  I hope that has been the experience of others as well.</p> <p>  I have some questions for the Minister.  This morning we heard about the challenges facing teachers who have significant and, in many cases, life-threatening illnesses.  That is the situation as I understand it from some of the contributions of the unions.  The issue arises of how such teachers appeal a decision if they have such a diagnosis and believe they have not been adequately dealt with.  It is a question of the appeals process.  It is very important that there be a specialist or a team of people to which such cases could be quickly referred for an ultimate and final decision in the case of disputes.  If the Minister has not already made such an arrangement, I encourage her to do so.  That is my first question.</p></speech>

I again acknowledge his appreciation of the work schools are undertaking on the ground to engage with and meet the needs of pupils as they arise.  With regard to the specific question on the categories of high-risk and very high-risk school staff, in the first instance, adjudications on such cases are independent medical adjudications carried out by persons separate from the Department of Education and Skills.  It is very important that we are clear on that.  With specific regard to the very high-risk category, 750 applications by persons to be categorised as very high-risk have been made.  To date, 547, more than 73%, of these people have been given that status.  I appreciate the point the Deputy has raised in respect of those who did not meet those criteria.  Of course, as the Deputy has said, there is an opportunity for such cases to be looked at again.  Such appeals will be adjudicated upon by an independent panel of four occupational health physicians.  Those who are asking for their cases to be adjudicated upon have the opportunity to present previous medical evidence and additional or new medical evidence which they feel may add to their case.  It is our expressed view that, where a case is on the border between the high-risk category and the very high-risk category, the panel is to err on the side of caution and deem such cases to be in the very high-risk category.  I want to be clear that the mechanism is in place and there is a facility for cases to be looked at again.  I reiterate that it is a case of an independent medical analysis by persons separate from the Department of Education and Skills, which is as it should be.</p></speech>

I mentioned the case of a child with an exceptional disability.  They have been assessed and the school, medical personnel and the family believe they need a full-time SNA.  The appeal has been turned down by the Department with what is called an SNA exceptional review to take place.  However, because of Covid it has not taken place.  Neither the school nor the family can be given a date.  This wonderful child who has this disability wants to attend school.  The child needs this care and attention and cannot be in a positive learning situation without it.  I ask the Minister to urgently review the timeline to have such exceptional reviews carried out immediately.  Some of the letters I have seen relate to Covid and school etc.  If the assessment needs to take place outside school, it should be given an absolute priority.</p></speech>

St. Patrick's national school in Harestown has 197 pupils but needed to have 201 and all classes are now overcrowded as a result.  Notwithstanding the additional 1,000 teachers, which I welcome, does Covid offer the opportunity to reconsider overcrowding in classrooms as a result of teachers being lost, particularly the two I mentioned?</p></speech>

While the other school has lost one teacher, there is overcrowding in all the classes now.  I can send the Minister and the Department the details of these schools but I am sure my colleagues have other examples as well.  Schools need to be as safe as possible.  They just want what they had last year if at all possible.</p></speech>

I thank her for all the work she has done since taking up her portfolio, together with her officials and the various stakeholders.  I know it has been challenging, in particular in recent months.  I hope that as we see the schools reopen in a safe environment, we will see the fruits of that work.</p> <p>  Earlier today we had sessions with several unions &ndash; the TUI, the ASTI, the INTO and F&oacute;rsa.  I praised the work of principals, deputy principals and the school staff, in particular during the month of August, in getting schools prepared and ready for reopening.  The Minister mentioned the &euro;375 million that was available for that purpose to most schools.  I will come back with some questions on that but praise must be given to those staff because of the tremendous effort that has been put in by all involved in schools.</p> <p>  Later, we heard from Inclusion Ireland and the National Parents Council Primary and the National Parents Council Post Primary about their needs and challenges.  If I have time, I will put the questions to the Minister that came up in those earlier sessions.  I also commend the work of the Minister and her officials on their drive and ambition in getting the schools reopened.  When we last met the Minister in this committee in June, there was scepticism on whether schools would reopen in time in September and she has achieved that, so I commend her on it.</p> <p>  That is not to say there are not challenges.  We know there will be challenges going forward.  The scale of the challenges facing the education sector should not be underestimated.  The Minister touched on some of those in earlier contributions about the leaving certificate and, in particular, the calculated grades.  Information for parents and students is essential.  The information that was released some weeks ago was very welcome.  Some schools, including in my constituency, did excellent information videos, targeted mainly at junior infants, those who did not get an opportunity to have their first day in the classroom with their parents.  They targeted that and they did it very successfully and I commend them on that.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions and the Minister may not have time to answer them.  I think there is an issue with the sound which I hope will be addressed when the committee next meets.  It seems to be between the committee room and here.  If the Minister does not have time to answer all the questions she might please come back to me.</p> <p>  Similar to the previous question about Deputies being contacted by teachers, especially with concerns about their own health and that of the students in their care, what is the process that they must undergo if they are displaying symptoms?  What supports are in place for them, including the provision of substitute teachers?  That is a big issue.</p> <p>  The second question I have touches on the contributions from the unions in an earlier session today.  A school had a lack of warm water.  Surely the &euro;375 million that was available could be used for that kind of thing, because a school is not Covid-ready without warm water.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.  I do not have the details of where the school is but that is immaterial.</p> <p>  The Minister is aware that I have raised mental health and well-being in schools in particular at post-primary level as a real issue, especially in the face of Covid.  Could the Minister elaborate on what supports are available, in particular in terms of the student support service and the National Educational Psychological Service?</p><p>I ask the Minister to please answer those questions.  She is very welcome before the committee.</p></speech>

The guidelines for this process have issued to the schools and there is absolute clarity around them.  A student who feels unwell will be taken to the isolation space.  The parent or guardian is called and contact is made by them with a GP.  That GP will determine if a test is required and if it is, and proves positive, public health will then engage with the family and school.  The public health team will make the decision as to what happens next.  Representatives of that team will come and do the testing and tracing, and determine if a single class, a larger group or a year group is exposed to infection.  All decisions about what happens next will be overseen by public health because it is at that stage that the infection becomes a public health issue.  That is no different to what operates in any other environment or workplace.</p> <p>  I am glad that the Deputy raised a question about warm water.  In excess of &euro;160 million has already issued to the schools, including an amount for minor works.  Schools were free to do whatever they felt necessary with that particular budget to ensure, insofar as possible, that they would remain free of Covid-19.  Schools could reconfigure space in classrooms and so on and so forth but that funding was specifically available for works in schools where warm water was an issue.  I would have to say, equally-----</p></speech>

We addressed representatives of the teaching unions this morning and I brought up the following matter which I think is important.  The Minister reached an agreement that three primary substitute teachers will be available for every 12 schools across towns in the country.  In the likely event that the three substitute teachers are already allocated and a fourth and fifth school require a substitute, what options are available to those principals to secure cover?  Could the Minister come back to me on that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#RRRR00900"><p>As the Deputy is aware, we have rolled out the primary school substitution panel to ensure that children will not be subdivided from one class into another should an issue arise.  It was a pilot scheme that worked very well last year and we have rolled it out throughout the country.  There are 101 panels currently operating, including specific ones for the Gaelteacht.  The teachers are based in a base school from which they work and operate.</p> <p>  I can tell the Deputy that these arrangements will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and if there is a determination that further substitutes are required to be placed on that panel, we will do that.  We are determined that this substitution panel is there to support schools and if additional resources are needed to give more support, we will supply them.</p> <p>  Those panels are only one source of substitution for a school.  Nearly all schools would have their own traditional resource upon which they would draw for substitution.  The TextaSub panel is also available.  There is no issue of supply for primary schools from what we are hearing on the ground.  This is just one measure that we have put in place but it is there to supplement the other measures and resources that schools have used before now.</p></speech>

My daughter is the school principal in Myshall.  That school did not make the panel so it, and other rural schools like it, must look for substitute teachers.  A panel was not put in place for them and the Minister might look at that issue in the long term.</p> <p>  The Minister also spoke about the minor works programme.  Her announcement that funding has doubled this year is very welcome but the bigger picture is important.  An issue might arise when older schools get double the money but, as other speakers have said, have problems with water or old pipes.</p><p>The Minister needs to look at the minor works programme whereby new schools and old schools do not get the same allocation.  She will be aware that it depends on how many students a school has and therefore a school with 300 pupils will get whatever amount is allocated.  If an older school is getting that it is different.  It is not as beneficial to the newer schools although I am aware that newer schools need works done too.  Will the Minister look at setting up some other form of funding for older schools through the Department, whether it is through the minor works programme or whatever?</p><p> I will raise another issue because my slot will be gone quickly.  I asked the Minister for Health last week about random testing in schools and he replied he did not think it will happen.  Will it happen and is it something the Minister for Education and Skills is in favour of?  Will the Minister look at saliva testing for children as it is said it is not as invasive as the other testing?  Will the Minister come back to me with those two answers?</p><p> We have all been contacted this week by private bus and coach operators who could certainly do with the business.  Has this been explored with the transport operators?  We have received correspondence from many private operators and they need the business.  Is there something we could do for them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#SSSS00200"><p>Regarding schools that did not make the panel, the idea is that a panel will be based in a particular area but will serve a much wider area.  Again, I will not repeat myself but we do not see the difficulty in the availability of substitution.</p> <p>  There are older schools and newer schools and I appreciate that.  The money was made available and schools made their best judgment as to what works needed to be done.  If there was addionality in terms of something extra that might be required they referred back to the Department.  That is the system that has been put in place.</p> <p>  Regarding random testing in schools and the type of testing that will take place for children, to be fair, that is a medical decision and medical expertise will be required.  As regards the type of testing, the public health team will make that decision and I would not presume for the Department of Education and Skills to stray into territory it is not an expert on.  I will leave that best judgment to the medical experts.</p> <p>  On private buses I again reiterate that our arrangement is with Bus &Eacute;ireann which may then subcontract.  Private bus operators who make private arrangements are not within the jurisdiction of the Department.  Guidance as to how they operate and what they need to do can only come from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></speech>

I echo previous speakers in acknowledging the work that she, her Department and those more widely in the education sector have done.  Principals, boards of management and teachers have put huge work and effort into getting children safely back into school this year and it is important that is acknowledged.</p> <p>  This builds on an issue raised by Deputy O'Dowd which is the 30 September cut-off for the primary online database, POD, returns that will decide staffing, not for this year but the following year.  As we are aware there may well be children who will be homeschooled for this year and who will be kept at home because they are in a high-risk category.  This may artificially depress the numbers of students within a particular school and that will have a knock-on impact for staffing numbers in 2021.  I raised this with the Minister's predecessor in the D&aacute;il.  Is it on the Department's radar and will it be resolved?</p></speech>

We are looking at the maximum return of students which is what we are seeing at this point.  I imagine over the next number of days it will reach that maximum return and that is the criteria.</p><p>Does Ms Shanley want to add anything?</p></speech>

That process will be in place as well for the returns for this year.  In the context of the cut-off date of 30 September, the Department will also be conscious of the unique nature of this year and of any schools having difficulty because of students who remain out.  As the Minister stated, however, we will be supporting a full return to school for all children.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1617" speakername="Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#TTTT00300"><p>I would like that aspect to be borne in mind by the Department because I am aware of several schools which are very close to that cut-off point.  This could have an adverse effect on staffing in the year beginning in 2021.  A related question, in some senses, concerns the responsibility of the boards of management.  Members of boards serve voluntarily.  I have served on the board of management of my local school and it is quite a responsibility to take on in a voluntary capacity.  That is particularly the case this year in light of the seriousness of the decisions that need to be made.  An example mentioned earlier was the case of parents who are high-risk.</p> <p>  I am also concerned that social distancing is simply not possible in some classrooms.  There may be 34 children in a small, confined space and it is not possible to observe social distancing in that situation.  The school principal in the case I have in mind has been advised that that classroom is forming the bubble.  Members of that school's board of management are worried about liability and that, if there is an outbreak of Covid-19 in that classroom, somebody will come back to them and state that social distancing was not properly observed.  Can the Minister give a certain amount of comfort to boards of management and principals that find themselves in this situation by stating that they will have the support of the Department if they take every step possible within the physical confines of their school buildings?  If they take all reasonable steps, will the Department be fully behind them in making those decisions?</p></speech>

We are looking at a distance of 1 m, where practical, for older age groups.  There has been excellent ongoing engagement with our Department.  On specific issues, we have invited schools to engage with us where there is an opportunity for departmental officials to work on the ground in the unique circumstances that apply to each school.  We are happy to do that on an ongoing basis and our helpline remains open.</p> <p>  Equally, however, for purposes of that nature, moneys referred to previously, such as those relating to the minor works grant, were made available to facilitate schools in reconfiguring and reimagining spaces.  I refer, for example, to taking away excess furniture that might be in rooms.  In essence, therefore, if there is an individual case of concern, I invite that school to engage directly with the Department.  I assure the Deputy that my Department will certainly engage proactively in return.</p></speech>

Finally, because my time is short, I echo the concerns expressed by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire about grade inflation and, in particular, its impact on the 2019 cohort.  Students who sat the leaving certificate in 2019 should not miss out on college places to which their results would otherwise have entitled them.</p></speech>

I will use the short time I have to focus on school transport.  There is great concern across the country, including in my constituency of Dublin Fingal, regarding the provision of school transport and its future, and, indeed, if we will have sufficient school transport for the entire academic year of 2020-2021.  My first question concerns something that took place on 20 August, when the Bus &Eacute;ireann portal for the registration of and payment relating to school transport shut down.  This has never happened before.  We all know this is a busy time of year and, as public representatives, we have all dealt with school transport issues in August and September in previous years.</p><p>As regards the shutting down of that portal, was the Minister briefed on it by either the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport or senior officials in Bus &Eacute;ireann, and what was the thinking behind shutting it down at that time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#UUUUU00200"><p>As I already outlined, our arrangement is with Bus &Eacute;ireann, and from a school transport point of view, we cater for 120,000 children and 5,000 vehicles.  Some 14,200 of those children have special needs.  We engage with them on an ongoing basis where issues arise, in particular issues that have been flagged by NPHET in the recent past in terms of additionality and capacity.  Specifically, in relation to the ongoing negotiation and discussion with Bus &Eacute;ireann, I will ask Ms Aoife Conduit, who has responsibility for that, to speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.373" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aoife Conduit" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#UUUUU00300"><p>I thank the Deputy and the Minister.  Directly in relation to the portal, when the updated health advice was given to us, it became clear to us that there was a very significant piece of work to be done by Bus &Eacute;ireann in assessing hundreds of routes and assessing where additional services and buses were required and where services and routes needed to be reconfigured to allow for the 50% capacity on the post-primary services.  It was agreed with Bus &Eacute;ireann that as an exceptional measure, in an exceptional year, the portal would be closed so that it could take out the children in cases where eligible children had been allocated their tickets and concessionary tickets had also been allocated where there were seats available.  It was also agreed that a route-by-route analysis would be undertaken to see exactly how many buses were required and to put in place the systems that would allow Bus &Eacute;ireann to subcontract out, and its contractors to source the additional vehicles.  That was agreed with Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

There are parents who have paid money.  Some money still remains with Bus &Eacute;ireann and they do not know if they are going to get a service.  Other parents who have paid, I believe, under &euro;175, have had their money sent back to them, so they are wondering if they will get a service at all this year.  Can Ms Conduit make a commitment and give a timeline?  Will every student who requires school transport have it in two weeks&rsquo; time, by the end of September, by the end of October or will they have it at all?  I ask Ms Conduit to please give me a timeline on that.</p></speech>

By their nature, they are concessionary tickets; they are given where there is available capacity on a service.  All children who are eligible for the scheme and who have paid and applied on time, are guaranteed a school transport service, and that is no different this year from any other year.</p></speech>

The decision was taken given the late advice from NPHET that we would not withdraw services on the post-primary scheme while that was done.  It was decided that we would continue to roll out the services, we would offer a grant to the parents of eligible children and we would offer a refund to parents who had paid for tickets and were not happy about putting children on a service that was not yet operating at 50%.  However, there will be a time lag for some services.  Bus &Eacute;ireann advertised last weekend for additional vehicles and for contractors who are interested in providing additional services.</p></speech>

There is a very complex route analysis being undertaken by Bus &Eacute;ireann and the regional offices.  As buses, vehicles and drivers become available, they will be put in place.  For some routes that has been immediate, and this is continuing and will be updated week by week as Bus &Eacute;ireann works its way through those routes.  Our ambition absolutely is to implement the 50% capacity on all services as soon as we possibly can.</p></speech>

I understand the pressure must be immense and while we certainly differ in approach, I appreciate the work she has contributed so far.  The last line of the Minister&rsquo;s statement stated that &ldquo;now, more than ever, we need to stay in this together&rdquo;.</p><p>My Sinn F&eacute;in colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, raised the issue of a family where the mother is suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CLL.  They cannot send their two teenage children to school because the mother is at such risk.  I do not believe the Minister's answer was satisfactory.  I will ask her again: what exactly are we providing for parents who have extreme underlying health conditions and cannot send their children to school and, because it is they who are suffering as opposed to their children, they cannot access remote learning.  How are those families being supported?  They are in severe situations and we cannot leave them behind.</p></speech>

I have full sympathy and understanding for families who find themselves in a situation where there is a member with particular health issues.  I appreciate and acknowledge that there will be anxiousness around that in terms of the return to school.</p></speech>

We will be guided by the HSE advice that is available to us.  The HSE has advised that children with immediate family members, including parents, who are regarded as being extremely medically vulnerable can return to school and that it is important for children's overall well-being.  This is consistent with public health advice internationally relating to at-risk family members.  Equally, these households will be advised-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1560" speakername="Gary Gannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#VVVV00500"><p>International public health advice regarding CLL, which the mother suffers from, is to remain cocooned.  That is not possible if they are sending two teenage children to individual schools.  The one-size-fits-all model does not suit this family and they are being left behind.  They have written to the Minister and an official from the Department wrote back, telling them to get in contact with the board of management of the school.  The board of management does not have the expertise, nor have the members received guidelines from the Department telling them how they can cater for that family's needs.  We need to protect them.  The Department needs to intervene here.  It is not satisfactory.  I am happy to arrange for the Minister to have a meeting with the family.  They will meet her any time and we can create guidelines to alleviate their genuine worry that they will catch Covid-19 and that will have devastating consequences for their family.  This is beyond anxiousness and it needs to be addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#VVVV00600"><p>Again I will say that the priority is that we facilitate all our children and young adults returning to school.  Where there are issues such as the individual one the Deputy raised, I have outlined the HSE advice given to us, which is that in such situations, it is generally in the best interests of the children or young adults to return to school, and the family can be advised on best practice to minimise the risk of coronavirus at home and all of that.  Equally, as I said earlier, if there is a specific and individual case, we invite medical evidence such as a discussion with a GP and an engagement with the school and we will take it from there.  The Department will engage on a one-to-one basis in relation to that but I must emphasise that these are the HSE guidelines that have been given to us.  Regarding those who are categorised as extremely medically vulnerable, it is still advisable for the children or young adults to return to school.</p></speech>

That is in direct contradiction with this family's individual case.</p> <p>  I will move on as I have other questions.  I refer to the ranking system that will be announced next week following the leaving certificate.  When did the Minister become aware that the individual rankings a class would achieve - whether a student came first, second, third, fourth, fifth - would be available to all the students and that they would be able to see the ranking the teacher gave them and the individual mark for the leaving certificate?  Does the Minister think that is fair?  If she does not - and she probably does not, as the unions certainly do not - how can we address it before next week?  It is a genuine concern and anxiety for teachers grading leaving certificate students next week and they were not told about this in March or April, through this committee or by any other means.  The goalposts have been moved for teachers and that needs to be addressed.  </p></speech>

It was an agreed approach.  Following this, how that mechanism would work was agreed.  I suggest that in all of the documentation on the calculated grade process and the availability of information it is included that the percentage marks awarded by the school and the rank order would be made available.  Students are entitled to their personal data.  However, I will say that a query has been raised on the issue of the rank order and we are taking advice on it.  That is where it stands at this point in time.</p></speech>

I ask this question because 50 times more public money is going into ensuring social distancing among D&aacute;il Members than the Minister is putting into ensuring social distancing, funding safety in our schools and minimising the possibility of Covid-19 transmission.  In total, &euro;375 million is being allocated per year and we have 1 million students.  At present, we are paying approximately &euro;50,000 a week for the Convention Centre to ensure 160 Deputies can physically distance fully in accordance with NPHET guidelines.  Of course, the consequence of this much lesser investment in protecting our students and teachers and the parents of those students is that many of the guidelines for the schools include the phrase "where possible", such as references to 1 m distance where possible and not sharing work stations and tables where possible.  "Where possible" is not applied to us but it is applied to schoolchildren.  Does the Minister not think this is just not good enough and that we are not providing the resources, a sufficient number of teachers or the physical space necessary to ensure that pupils, teachers and parents of pupils, particularly those with underlying conditions, can have some sense of assurance that the return to school will not pose a very serious health risk to them?</p></speech>

The &euro;375 million which, by the time we have finished will be in excess of this and passed the &euro;400 million mark, has been universally acknowledged as a huge endorsement and resource for the education sector.  I have visited many schools and this has been the universal opinion of those whom I have met.  It far exceeds what many Members of the House had originally sought, imagined or suggested would be made available to education.  It is a phenomenal resource.  With regard to everything in the roadmap, our schools operate on the basis of the public health guidelines and the best medical advice being made available to us, and not on something we conjured up ourselves.  It is on the basis of the best medical health advice available to us.  This is how we are proceeding and using the funding we have secured from the Government.  With regard to what operates here, it is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and how it operates and what it does.  How things are operating in our schools is on the basis of the advice we have received from NPHET and we are following it.</p></speech>

We hear stories from everywhere.</p><p>We already had massively overcrowded classrooms, massive underinvestment and a huge physical infrastructural deficit before Covid-19.  The term in the guidelines that states things should be done "where possible" is not possible.  We are putting pupils and, in particular, teachers and the parents of pupils with underlying conditions, at significant risk.  The only way we can minimise that risk is to dramatically increase investment, reduce class sizes and have more teachers and more physical infrastructure so that we can have the sort of social distancing that is possible for Deputies in the Convention Centre but is clearly not possible in schools.</p><p> I have a brief supplementary question on public transport.  The current guidelines for 50% capacity present a significant problem.  Taxi driver representative groups have, I understand, written to the Minister and asked her to engage with them.  They have very little work at the moment and would be very keen to talk to her about how they could assist with the school transport crisis and deficit that exists given the Covid-19 guidelines.  Is the Minister willing to respond positively to their request to discuss this with her?</p></speech>

I must reiterate that the guidance that we received was written by public health officials rather than by us.  The wording the Deputy might take exception to was not written by officials in the Department.  It was written by public health officials and we are abiding by that.</p> <p>  On school transport, I must reiterate that our arrangement is with Bus &Eacute;ireann and we are dealing and engaging with it on that issue.  We are doing what was outlined by Ms Conduit in terms of rolling out capacity for second level to mirror the 50% capacity on public transport.  I again reiterate that the operation of school transport at primary school level remains as is.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#XXXX00500"><p>I congratulate the Minister on her appointment.  I have not had an opportunity to congratulate her.  I commend the work she and her Department are doing.</p> <p>  I wish to highlight that I wrote to her a couple of weeks ago with respect to concessionary tickets for Blackwater Community School in Lismore, County Waterford.  The Department gave a commitment to come back to me and I would appreciate if that could happen.  A number of children there are essentially stranded and parents are in very difficult positions.  I am sure there is a way to accommodate students in the school bus system.</p> <p>  The Department of Education and Skills approved funding of &euro;11.3 million to support hygiene, PPE and sanitisation for school transport.  However, it has transpired that just 50% of this fund, approximately &euro;5.5 million, has gone to private operators despite the fact that they supply 90% of school transport over the 39 weeks of the school year.  Private bus operators are being offered between &euro;4.50 and &euro;8.50 each day to provide sanitising equipment to clean their buses, any PPE and whatever else is required.  Some buses will do multiple runs.  This is wholly inadequate and is something the Department needs to revisit.  </p> <p>  I know the Minister will say that school transport is operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann, which is under a tender system, but that is certainly not good enough.  We are asking bus drivers to behave like serfs.  They have to clean buses on an hourly basis for &euro;4.50.  Private bus operators received a number of quotes, the cheapest of which was &euro;30 for one bus clean.  I ask the Minister to examine this situation.  It is not sustainable and is taking from the services operated by private operators.  The situation is not equitable and I ask the Minister to do something about it.</p> <p>  I note the Minister's comments that the school transport scheme operates through Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department feels it has no role to play.  I disagree.  The Department must take into account private bus operators who are dealing with family groups.  If NPHET says that the 50% capacity has to be implemented how will that be borne by hard-pressed families?  It is not fair that the Department has passed the buck on this issue.</p><p>In addition, a large number of scheduled bus operators in the private sector are still waiting for contracts to be issued by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  This is despite the fact that Bus &Eacute;ireann is picking up a lot of that work and probably doing it for three times the cost.  Again, the issue involves crossover with other Departments.  I ask the Minister to consider these matters.</p><p> The other issue I raised earlier today - I think the Minister heard what I had to say - relates to psychological services for children with autism and those on the autism spectrum.  I highlight again that there are very hard-pressed parents who are paying for private consultations in order to have their children evaluated and then the Department or the HSE do not take those tests as being valid unless they have been done through the schools.  This is despite the fact that a large secondary school - it is usually a secondary school - might be allowed only two NEPS consultations per year.  This is something the Minister really has to look at.  Perhaps she would like to comment on it because I have met a number of hard-pressed families in this situation.  They are at their wit's end.  They are trying to do the best for their kids and ultimately they feel they are being stonewalled by the system while their children regress further.  I ask the Minister to comment on that matter.</p></speech>

We continue to engage with Bus &Eacute;ireann on this and other issues.  Where matters need to be reviewed, we will review them.  That is where we are at this point.  Everything is being reviewed.</p></speech>

On our buses that cover the official school transport system, we are operating on the basis of the NPHET guidelines and rolling out measures for post-primary in respect of those guidelines.  That is how we choose to operate.  We are following the NPHET advice.  As regards the private bus operators, with the best will in the world, private arrangements are not something in respect of which the Department of Education and Skills can intervene.  That would be more the jurisdiction of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We have to cater for those who are on the official bus routes with us.</p> <p>  I see the Chairman would like to come in on NEPS, etc.</p></speech>

First, I thank her for all the help she and her Department have given my constituency, Cork South-West.  She has only been in her ministerial position a short time.  I assure her that the funding that has been provided because of the urgency of the situation - in many cases due to the Covid crisis - has been most gratefully received in Scoil Mhuire na nGr&aacute;st, in Belgooly; Bandon Grammar School; Scoil an Chro&iacute; R&oacute; Naofa, in Castletownbere; Dreeny national school, in Skibberreen; and Rath national school.  These schools and the staff, pupils and parents are very grateful.  We do, however, have some more schools that still need help because of Covid-19, and perhaps the Minister might take these on board.  We have been in contact with her office.  They are Scoil Bhr&iacute;de, in Ballydehob, and Our Lady of Mercy national school, in Bantry.  Both these need an extra teacher each, both have too many students in one classroom and both have empty classrooms where the students could be more socially distanced if they had an extra teacher.  In Our Lady of Mercy, in Bantry, one of the students, a little girl, has special needs and cannot go to school because there are too many in the classroom.  The Minister might be able to have a look at both these schools.  As I said, I have contacted her office and I hope we will have the same success we have had regarding many other issues in recent times.</p> <p>  The issue relating to school buses is a whole other nightmare.  The Government's original plan was to run the school bus system the same as in former years, with the addition of masks, visors and hand sanitisers.  This was a woefully inadequate response to the virus, many feel, because it was clear from the spring that social distancing would be obligatory on school buses.  Now that there must be social distancing on buses in the wake of a recommendation from NPHET, Bus &Eacute;ireann will have to play a lot of catch-up trying to roll out perhaps 1,200 to up to 1,600 school buses on a phased basis.</p><p>There is no guarantee that the required number of buses will be in place any time soon.  It may even be after Christmas and more clarity from the Minister is needed in that regard.</p><p> On a more local note, I have had parents on the phone day and night.  This concessionary ticket is a scandalous nightmare.  People from Kinsale, Bandon, Clonakilty, Enniskeane, Coppeen, Bantry Skibbereen, Sheep's Head and throughout west Cork do not have places on buses for their children and have no way of getting their children to school.  We need to get school transport up and running so we are not leaving children behind.</p><p> The Minister also indicated there was a grant available for those who decide to avail of post-primary transport services.  How much will that grant amount to per day?  When will it be available and how do parents apply for it?  Can parents hire a private taxi to transport their children to school?  These are questions that are being asked of us on a regular basis.</p><p> To be fair to the Minister it was always going to be difficult to get children back to school and this has been done, but some children are literally being left behind.  I would welcome her comments and solutions.  This evening, I had parents ringing me to say that a Bus &Eacute;ireann bus from Bandon to Kinsale was at 100% capacity.  It was full when it should have been at 50% capacity.  The lack of social distancing on school buses could undo the best efforts of schools to protect their students from Covid-19.  Another factor is that in many cases a bus delivers students to more than one post-primary school, thus increasing the potential to spread the virus.  The Minister might have a chance to answer some of those questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#ZZZZ00200"><p>I ask that the Deputy leave the details of the two schools to which he referred with me and the Department will look at those specific cases.</p> <p>  I reiterate that there has been superb engagement with schools on the ground.  We have received between 3,000 and 4,000 calls to our helpline and thousands of emails.  There has been very good engagement.  Where difficulties have arisen, I am very pleased to say that many of them have been sorted out at this point or we are continuing to work through them.  We will certainly look at the two cases the Deputy raised about which he might give further details.</p> <p>  On school buses, I reiterate that the guidance on their operation was, from the very beginning when the roadmap was issued, based on the guidance given to us by public health.  This is how it was envisaged the buses would operate.  Children and young people were being regarded as a single cohort in a particular environment and that it was safe for them to travel as they normally would.  Additional measures would, however, be employed, for example, the use of hand sanitiser and the provision of PPE for the bus driver.  Another additional measure suggested, in fairness, by Bus &Eacute;ireann was pre-allocated seating.  That continued to be the case up until just recently.  Some time last week, new guidance was issued by NPHET and this refers only to second-level bus services.  It was determined by the Government that we would proceed as planned and on a rolling-out basis there would be capacity of 50% to mirror public transport.  That is exactly what we are doing and we are doing that as speedily and quickly as we possibly can.</p> <p>  The concessionary ticket is exactly that - a concession.  Those who are eligible and paid on time received a place on a bus.  Those who were not eligible in the first instance became eligible for a concessionary ticket where there was additional capacity on a bus.  That is the position.  We are in the process of rolling out and meeting the requirement to operate at 50% capacity, which will probably require in excess of 1,600 buses.  Once that has been done, if there is additional space on those extra buses, we will look at students who still require a seat.</p> <p>  The grant is an opportunity for those who may wish to avail of it.  It is a small recompense of probably &euro;25 per week or whatever.  My officials may wish to provide more detail on that.</p></speech>

The next speaker is Deputy Conway-Walsh.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#AAAAA00100"><p>The Minister does not get the issue of school transport at all.  There are hundreds of children who cannot get a seat on the bus.  I am not talking about concessionary children, although it is abysmal to categorise children in that way.  Many of those the Minister refers to as concessionary are the children of our front-line workers who cannot get to work because their children do not have a seat on the bus.  What would the Minister say to the mother of four children who has contacted me?  Her children are 15, 13, ten and eight years old.  She missed the deadline by two days because she was having surgery.  She has no transport and it is a distance of 20 miles to the school.  How are those children going to get to school?  The Minister does not get the urgency of the situation.  Everybody has raised this subject today.  Will the Minister talk to Bus &Eacute;ireann and get it to act as a matter of urgency?  People are being pushed from Billy to Jack.  Bus &Eacute;ireann's reply to this mother indicated that payments to it cannot be processed at the moment because it is unsure if there is any spare capacity and that it will have a further look at the matter in a few weeks.  For heaven's sake, these children have been off school for months already.  It is just not good enough.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's comment to the effect that the system used for calculated grades will give primacy to the teachers' grades rather than to the algorithms or to any other process such as those used in the other four jurisdictions.  It would have been reckless to do anything else.  The Minister has said, however, that the appeals process will not examine the accuracy of the teachers' or schools' judgment in awarding grades but will simply check the accuracy of the data.  We do not know what the data are.  I will ask the Minister a very specific question.  Why will she not tell us what data are being used?  Why will she not tell us what model is being used?  I ask her to please not speak around the model but to tell us why.</p> <p>  What provision has been made for students who sat the leaving certificate examinations last year?  We are five days away from the results being released.  Some 20,000 students are affected by this and they need to know.</p> <p>  What contact has the Minister had with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection regarding the eligibility for unemployment payments of those who choose to sit their leaving certificate examinations this November and have to go to college?</p> <p>  What does the Minister have to say to the approximately 10,200 students who will receive a grade that does not reflect their hard work and ability?  They will now have fewer points when seeking places that may demand increased points.  As a mother of somebody who is doing his leaving certificate this year, I want to know whether he will be one of the 10,200.  Will we have to wait until Monday to find out?</p> <p>  I have spoken about the issues of transport eligibility and the appeals process.  I also want to ask the Minister about the ancillary grant.  She has talked about the money being given to schools but I know of schools whose &euro;5,000 ancillary grant has been taken away because of the arbitration agreement in 2015 which covered the period from 2016 to 2019.  Will the Minister tell me whether this grant will be restored?  Will she tell the school how it can pay a secretary and a cleaner out of &euro;10,000 per year?</p> <p>  The supply panels for substitute teachers are not working in many rural areas.  They are not enough and must be expanded.  Ballina is the nearest panel to the area of Erris, in which I live.  This distance of 50 miles is far too great to be workable.  I ask the Minister to answer those questions and thank her.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#AAAAA00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  On the issue she has raised in respect of the bus service, the specific case she has mentioned is exceptional.  I would appreciate it if the Deputy would bring details of any such exceptional cases, such as where somebody has been ill, to us.  If there is availability of space on the bus, these children will certainly be catered for.  There will always exceptional circumstances of that type.  The important thing is whether there is availability on the bus.  With regard to additional capacity on the buses, as the Deputy is aware, there was a change to the NPHET guidelines.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is reviewing its routes and determining where bigger buses and so on will be required.  Where possible, extra capacity will be made available.</p><p> On the appeals process and the calculated grades, the Deputy also asked about the information used by schools.  As she will be aware, schools were invited to provide an estimated mark and a rank ordering.  I will defer to the chief inspector in a moment.  I understand that schools had to complete a form showing the information they used to make that determination, which may have included Christmas and Easter tests.  All that information was recorded within the school.  In the event of an appeal, that will be made available to the appeals process.  That information is retained within the school and the basis for the percentage mark is very clear and precise.</p><p> Regarding last year's students competing with this year's students, the calculated grades represent an extraordinary measure in an extraordinary time for the education system.  However, it is the process that has been employed so that the students of 2020 will have a leaving certificate that is as close as possible and comparable to that of 2019 and, indeed, of 2021.  The calculated grades incorporate a standardisation process for that reason.  Just as there was a standardisation process in the 2019 leaving certificate, it will also be part of the 2020 calculated grades process and, therefore, there will be comparability.</p><p> The Deputy asked how last year's students would feel about the present calculated-grade students and their results.  They are as close as they possibly can be in the first instance.  Perhaps there will be an element of stronger subject profile, but the standardisation process will have ensured there is comparability between last year and this year.  As the Deputy will be aware, there was an announcement yesterday of additional capacity with an additional 1,250 places at third level.</p><p> She asked about the need for the supply panel to be expanded.  I have referenced that.  The primary school supply panel was a programme that worked successfully in the past year.  We have no evidence of any difficulty in recruiting staff for that panel.  As I mentioned earlier, this is an additional opportunity for schools to draw down from that panel.  Equally, schools have their own resources and pools from which they have drawn substitute teachers in previous years.  That might have been a local arrangement or "Text-a-Sub".</p><p> The Deputy also asked about the written exam in November.  At this point we do not know how many students will opt for that.  That determination will not be made until students receive their results and their CAO offers and all that will entail.  The student will be able to take the better grade achieved either in the November written exams or in the calculated grade and that will form their leaving certificate as it were.</p></speech>

First, I thank the Minister and wish her well in her job.  I know it has been a very difficult number of months in dealing with the current challenges in the education sector, at primary level, secondary level and third level.</p> <p>  I wish to touch on an issue that has been raised already, namely, school transport.  Like many other colleagues in my constituency of Cork North-Central, I too have had quite a number of problems in areas, in particular in the rural area from Glenville across to Grenagh and Burnfort.  A lot of people do not understand how decisions were arrived at.  Has a target date now been set for the resolution of the outstanding issues in the school transport system?</p> <p>  Where one child in a school has been accommodated on a bus and there are two other children from the same family, are they are being treated as one unit of three rather than as three separate individuals?  I know they are three separate individuals but I wonder if the situation could be clarified in terms of the way we are dealing with school transport given that the three individuals are coming from the one family.  If there are a number of families travelling on the bus and we are trying to retain 50%, it is a very small number of families in real terms that are travelling because there are two, three or four from the same family.  I wonder if that issue has been looked at.</p> <p>  While I accept that some seats are provided on a concessionary basis, when there be a more definitive idea of what is available and when will parents be made aware of availability?</p> <p>  I raised earlier the issue of getting the message out to young people.  I am aiming it at secondary school students.  Third level students will be returning to colleges in the next week or two.  Will a focused message be sent out from the Department together with other Departments?  In the Minister's constituency in the past week, we saw many young people socialising.  That is not surprising given the time of year.  In the area I represent around University College Cork, UCC and Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, one has a lot of socialising in the first six weeks of the academic year.  Is there a targeted campaign to deal with that issue?</p> <p>  Some speakers raised the issue of leaving certificate students.  That situation needs to be clarified further for those who sat the leaving certificate last year but who are now sitting it this year.  There seems to be a lot of uncertainty and we are receiving a lot of queries in that regard.</p> <p>  Earlier today we heard that substitute or replacement teachers are available in schools but that in some of the larger urban areas, there is a significant challenge in trying to get the necessary numbers to fill the gaps in the event of teachers not being able to be at work who need to be replaced.  Is any additional incentive being proposed to get teachers in those areas where teachers would find it expensive to live due to high rents?</p><p>Is anything being proposed by the Department to deal with that shortage?  It is difficult to find a replacement for a teacher who is unable to be at work, whether as a result of illness or otherwise, in areas where there is not a sufficient number of substitute teachers.   Will an incentive to deal with that issue be put in place?</p></speech>

We have been very clear within the Department and used a variety of different means to speak with the young people in our care.  A variety of videos, for example, have been issued.  They include animations for the younger children and more age-appropriate material for older children and those at second level.  We have done likewise for parents.  We have also disseminated leaflets containing information to parents and families in co-operation with the guidance from the HSE and public health.  Information has also been translated into a wide variety of languages.  We will continue to do these things.  I also acknowledge that schools are doing excellent work in introducing stay-safe measures and reinforcing those messages within schools.</p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to young people in secondary school and specifically raised issues about third level students.  As he will appreciate, the matter of third level students falls within the remit of the Minister with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Harris, whom I have heard discuss issues about communicating the message at third level colleges.  As those institutions reopen, I have every confidence that there will be clear communication.  In my own area of responsibility, we will be communicating on an ongoing basis and keeping that under constant review to reinforce the message.</p> <p>  I will say to the Deputy the same thing I have said to previous contributors, namely, that our schools and colleges require effort from the whole of communities.  It is not a matter that is confined to the young people who attend primary school, secondary school or third level.  The wider community must play its part and we all have a part to play.  Personal responsibility to keep the virus at bay falls upon all of us.</p> <p>  I reiterate that substitution panels have been formed for primary schools.  I appreciate the reference the Deputy made to the expense or otherwise of living in particular areas but our primary concern is to ensure that the panels are up, running and operating.  They have worked well at pilot level and we have every confidence that they are going to work on an ongoing basis.  As I said earlier, where there is a need for additional members to make up those panels, we will look at that.  The panels do not take away from the other resources that schools have in their own traditional supply of teachers.</p> <p> There is a broader context regarding how we are dealing with these issues, particularly at second level, and a number of resources are being made available to schools.  The limit on the number of hours that an individual can work if he or she is job-sharing has been lifted for the first time and schools now have the facility to draw on additional hours from a staff member who is already in place.  Career break restrictions have also been lifted.  Teachers who were on reduced hours within schools are being offered the facility to add to their hours if somebody happens to absent or out, as the Deputy said.  Our professional master of education students are a valuable resource to our schools and will be in a position to make themselves available for additional hours.  There is a suite of resources there from which the schools can draw.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the matter of calculated grades for students this year and potential difficulties facing students who sat the leaving certificate examination last year.  I will ask our chief inspector to come in on that matter because I have already referenced the issue.</p></speech>

It is important that given the teachers provided the estimates, the system of calculated grades here has valued those estimates as the primary source of evidence for the giving of scores to students.  That said, it is clear that teachers were overly generous in providing those estimates.  That is to be expected and hence it is necessary to reduce some of those estimates.  The important part of reducing those estimates is concerned with fairness.  Those grades have been increased in some schools more than others and sometimes even between different groups of teachers more than others.  Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to even out that unfairness within those grades.  To do that one must reduce some, but by no means the majority, of the grades.  In fact, almost 80% of the grades will remain unchanged and just over 4% of them will be increased.  If we must reduce grades, and we estimate approximately one sixth of the total might have to be reduced, then the degree by which one does that reduction is linked in an important way to preserving student acceptability and confidence, as well parent and public confidence, in the system.  If we reduce them too severely, as was attempted, for instance, in the UK, and insist on strict comparability with previous years, then the system simply will not work.  The whole objective of calculated grades to allow young people to move on will not be achieved.</p> <p>  The Minister has made a decision about a delicate balance that must be achieved within bringing fairness for the cohort of 2020 yet retaining public acceptability and student confidence in the system.  It means the set of grades that will come out for 2020 will be higher than they would be normally but they will be nothing like as high as if the teacher estimates had been issued unaltered.  If that were to happen then huge unfairness would be dished out to the 2020 students as well as others, and a huge disparity would exist between 2020 students and those of previous years.  This is the best balance of fairness that can be achieved for the 2020 cohort while retaining some degree of comparability with previous cohorts of students.  One of the background and contextual reasons referred to by the Minister in her opening address was the enormously upset year and the trauma those students have gone through in 2020, which has been quite extraordinary.  Certainly, in the advisory committee a huge emphasis was placed on the concerns for those students.</p></speech>

They are competing already in the 2020 cohort.  They are entitled to calculated grades and may do better or worse, just as they would have in an exam.  However, given the grades arising, in some cases they are likely to do even better out of the calculated grades than they might have done in 2019.</p> <p>  If they have entered for the 2020 leaving certificate, they are also entitled to sit the written paper in November if they so wish.  They can have the better of those two grades, be it the calculated grade or the examination grade of 2020, accredited to them.  If they are entitled to, they can combine the 2019 and 2020 grades.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#EEEEE00400"><p>We are in unprecedented times and the Minister has faced many challenges in the past couple of weeks.</p><p>Issues were bound to arise when we tried to reopen schools in such difficult circumstances.  While I will raise several issues, I acknowledge that, so far, a very good job has been done in reopening the schools, which many critics said could not be achieved.</p><p> In July, the Minister announced funding of &euro;11.3 million to support hygiene, PPE and cleaning requirements on school transport.  This was a necessary step and was much welcomed.  However, 90% of school transport services are operated by private bus operators.  It was expected that they would be allocated funding proportionate to their size in the market to meet public health measures.  It has now transpired, however, that private bus operators will receive just 50% of this fund, &euro;5.5 million, over the school year of 39 weeks.</p><p> When that figure is broken down, every school bus operator in the country can expect between &euro;4.50 and &euro;8.50 per day for an enhanced cleaning regime on school buses.  This is grossly inadequate.  It is less than the minimum wage and does not take into account the cost of cleaning supplies.  One month later, the money has not yet been delivered, with bus operators forced to take on the burden of the expense when their cash flows are at zero. </p><p> These private bus operators are often small, family-run businesses and this situation is putting them under great financial pressure.  To meet public health standards in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, buses first require a deep clean, followed by daily cleaning and disinfection of touch points on board and then a deep cleaning every weekend.  This deep clean will take two people one hour to complete for every bus every weekend.  If the coaches get a deep clean to start off, then the running cost will be &euro;22.13 per coach per day for disinfecting and cleaning, plus a weekly deep-cleaning cost of &euro;55 per coach.  The cost of the first deep cleaning of a coach can vary in cost up to &euro;170.  Why were private bus operators only allocated 50% of the fund, when they operate 90% of routes?  Can these funds be made available upfront to private bus operators so they can cover additional costs?  Why are Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann getting up to &euro;50 per day per vehicle for cleaning, while school buses are only getting a fraction of that amount?  Why this inconsistency?</p><p> A decision was taken last week to reduce bus capacity to 50% to allow for social distancing on buses carrying secondary school students.  This means that additional buses are now required to deal with demand.  With schools reopened, operators still do not know if they will be required to provide more services or whether new contracts will be placed with different operators.  This lack of capacity means that students, who had been travelling by bus to school for years, are now being refused spaces.  I am aware of numerous instances from all around my constituency, from Hollyford, Shevry, Upperchurch and Gortagarry to Ballingarry, where students who previously travelled to school by bus are now being denied places.  Dozens of young people and their families are being affected by these decisions.  Changes were made to the way that pupils with concessionary tickets were dealt with in 2012-2013, and that needs to be revisited.  Given the year we are in, when we are dealing with Covid-19, there is an obligation on us to ensure that all pupils have a place on school transport to get to school.</p><p> I also refer to the portal payment system and the way it was shut down in a guillotine fashion.  That decision also needs to be revisited, because parents did not realise that was going to happen.  This situation needs to be urgently revisited.  Can the Minister provide clarity so that operators can ensure adequate provision of buses and every child who needs to be transported to school can be guaranteed a place?</p><p> Another issue arising concerns bus drivers being hired to run additional services.  Can their vetting process be prioritised to get them on the road as soon as possible?  Roughly 25,000 pupils go to school on services provided by private operators, for various reasons.  If these buses must operate at 50% capacity, as we would expect with social distancing, the parents involved must get some help to carry this cost.  This issue also needs to be addressed.  Can we get clarity, therefore, regarding private school runs and what additional help will be provided?</p><p>In the past few minutes we have addressed the 20,000 pupils who sat the leaving certificate in years prior to 2020.  There are pupils who, for various reasons, did not take up their college place in 2018 or 2019 and now intend to take up a place in 2020.  They are worried that they will be at a disadvantage regarding the predictive marking that is being calculated this year.  Can the Minister give further clarification on how she will ensure fairness in the system for pupils who sat their leaving certificate in 2018 or 2019 and are now seeking a college place and that their results from a previous leaving certificate will be adequately reflected to allow them the access they would have had if they had sat the leaving certificate in the normal manner in 2020?</p></speech>

I was letting Deputy Cahill know that many of my questions overlap his so if he hangs on, he may get some clarification.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister.  She has had a tough brief since she was elevated and that needs to be acknowledged.  She has done sterling work, despite all the criticism that the Department has received in the media and so on.  The main motivation has been to get children back to school and we have achieved that successfully so far, so the Minister and her Department are to be commended. </p> <p>  I will start with school transport, as previous speakers have also done.  I have been in touch with the Minister and I appreciate her feedback and that from her Department over the past few weeks.  As Deputy Cahill alluded to, we are in extraordinary times.  This issue recurs every year.  I recall last year the then Minister of State, John Halligan, committed to a review of the school transport issue.  He is no longer with us so that review fell by the wayside but I hope that, given the problems we have had this year, that review and a root-and-branch reform of the system can be looked into for next year.  The school transport system needs to reflect the demand for a bus to go to a specific area rather than getting the metre stick out and measuring how close someone lives to a school.  That needs to be reflected in any future policy.  </p> <p>  I will touch on what previous speakers have said.  As the Minister will be aware, I have a number of villages in my area, including Watergrasshill, Glenville, Carrignavar, Whitechurch, Blarney, Grenagh and Bottlehill.  Almost 100 children do not have a bus place in those areas.  I understand the restrictions of the service and the responsibilities of Bus &Eacute;ireann in rolling out that service but, as Deputy Cahill has said, these are extraordinary times.  Given it is the year of Covid and the restrictions on capacity, we need to think outside the box.  This year, even if it is just taken on its own, additional rooms need to be put in place and additional funding needs to be found from somewhere.  The children need to get to school.  I urge the Minister, if at all possible, to re-examine the issue.</p> <p>  I refer to the leaving certificate.  Similar to the Minister, I was a teacher for many years.  While many Opposition members have spoken negatively about various decisions that have been made, many of them were cheerleaders for the predictive grading system.  Now that it has happened, they have been the first to criticise.  I was a firm believer in the old conventional testing method but that race is run.  Now that we are where we are in terms of predictive grading, on the question raised by Deputy Burke, can the Minister provide reassurance for students who sat the exam last year that they will not be disadvantaged this year?</p><p>What assurance can the Minister give that this will not be the case?</p><p> The issues of substitution panels and staffing levels have been touched on.  It depends on the size of the school.  Many schools have 600, 700, 800 or more students and many have up to 100 staff.  While the additional resources dedicated to substitution and sick leave for teachers need to be acknowledged, in the event that there is a resurgence of the virus over the winter or a bad winter flu, and multiples of the teachers required for cover are also absent due to various illnesses, will the Minister be open to revisiting the matter or supplementing the substitution panels if it becomes necessary?  I would appreciate it if the Minister gave me clarity on these points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-02a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090200002#HHHHH00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  On the substitution panels, as I have said, we have taken great confidence from the fact that the pilots worked very well in the six areas where they were rolled out.  This success has given us confidence.  Almost 101 panels have been rolled out at this stage.  This is in addition to resources that schools might already have in the pools from which they traditionally draw for substitution, whether in the locality or through the TextASub facility.  It has been a very positive move by the Department to provide year long contracts to teachers to make themselves available on a substitute panel so that where there are issues in a school that require access to a substitute, the measure will be there.  As I have said previously, these panels will be reviewed as we go on.  Everything is in a state of flux.  We review, review and review and we amend, amend and amend where we have to.</p><p>With regard to the students who sat the exam last year and how they will fare this year, we have made every effort, as the chief inspector has said.  The calculated grades are a new measure.  They are an extraordinary measure in an extraordinary time.  Every possible effort has been made to ensure the 2020 calculated grades will be as close and comparable as possible to the leaving certificate of 2019.  As the Deputy is aware, in the traditional leaving certificate there is standardisation and there was standardisation in the calculated grades system.  The Deputy will appreciate it is there because teachers will know their students and their capabilities and abilities but it is not possible for them to know the capabilities and abilities of students in the next school or in the next parish or county.  Therefore, standardisation is brought in so there is comparability.  It is this standardisation that will give confidence not just to the class of 2020 but to the class of 2019 that the calculated grades will be as close as possible.  Will there be a stronger grade performance in some subjects this year?  Yes, there will but it is as close as we can possibly make it.  This standardisation was important so the 2019 students would be able to look at 2020 and <i>vice versa</i>.</p><p>With regard to the issues raised by the Deputy on school buses, I appreciate Deputy Cahill also raised these issues.  Both Deputies have raised these issues on an ongoing basis with the Department.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is reviewing the routes it has on the basis of the new advice that came to us from NPHET.  All along, our roadmap and all we have been doing have been on the basis of the advice available to us on school transport from NPHET.  That changed last week.  We are now meeting the NPHET guidelines for post primary and rolling out capacity as quickly and as speedily as we can.</p><p>When the review has been completed and we add additional buses, if there is additional capacity on those buses those who are eligible, may have paid late or have concessionary tickets will be offered seats at that time.  I appreciate the point the Deputy made on issues with the school transport system and the need to examine it. </p><p> When we have extra buses in place, we will examine how many more can be accommodated.  In terms of issues around that and the capacity this time last year and the number of students in need of a place on a bus, we are at almost half of that capacity at this point in the year.  Considerable work has been done in a very short time, bearing in mind that we received the NPHET advice in the last number of days.</p></speech>

On a personal level, like the previous speaker, I commend the Minister, Department, officials, teachers and boards of management across the country on opening the schools.  It is a desperately welcome and necessary step forward.</p> <p>  Like the previous speaker, I would have preferred to have had pupils sit the leaving certificate.  It would have been possible to do so at the time and would have provided a welcome and necessary confidence in society generally.  That decision was not made by the Minister; she inherited the situation as it was rather than she might have liked it to be.  I again commend her on having reopened the schools.</p> <p>  I refer to the wearing of masks by second level students.  I understand that decision was taken as a result of advice.

Various Deputies, including me, have received information from students who are questioning that.</p></speech>

I want to move on to the marking of exam papers.  This is a question for the Minister or Dr. Hislop, whoever the Minister deems most appropriate.  Some 4% of students will have their grades increased and about 16.66% will have their grades decreased.  How will the 4% and 16.66%, respectively, be selected?  To what extent will their grades be increased or decreased, respectively?  On what basis will they be increased or decreased?</p></speech>

The 16.66% figure refers to grades.  There are almost half a million grades to be awarded across the 62,000 students who are taking leaving certificate 2020.  Information on the extent to which estimated marks are moderated downwards or upwards will be published in detail once the leaving certificate results have been published.</p><p>However, 4% of them will be increased from the teachers' estimates by one grade or more.  Very few, less than 0.1% of them-----</p></speech>

That is what the standardisation process does.  It examines the teachers' original estimates from the schools' data and then combines that with other pieces of data.</p></speech>

We tracked back what they got at junior certificate level.  Very sound research has been published showing how junior cycle scores can be used, on a whole-class basis, to predict the level of achievement likely at leaving certificate level.  It gives us a very good indicator, therefore, of what should be the expected level of achievement in that school.</p> <p>  There is also the historical national standard, which influences those data as well.  The regression model or prediction that goes from junior cycle to leaving certificate, combined with the teachers' scores, can be compared and contrasted.  That gives us a good indication of the extent to which the group of teachers teaching in individual subjects - this is done subject by subject and not school by school - conform to the pattern of results that we would have expected those students to achieve.  There are also several protections built in, so that if there are exceptional students that stand out in the teachers' data, for example, parts of the software will pick up those students and ensure that they are adequately rewarded and that their scores are not moderated downwards by too great an extent.  </p> <p>  The predictions that we have from the model, therefore, can give us a very close estimate and a good prediction of the class groupings and the scores which should or should not be increased.  The details of how all that works, and the mathematical modelling behind it, will be published next Monday in conjunction with the publication of the leaving certificate results.  A large technical report completed in April when the original proposals were drawn up will also be published.  The details of the model, how it evolved, how it works and its mathematical underpinnings will also be published next Monday.  </p></speech>

The Minister asked us to look at one of those types, and she made the decision this week to remove it from the data.  That was the historical prediction, which would be a reflection of what leaving certificate scores would typically have been in each school, based on an historical pattern.  The idea was that we would have used the data from the leaving certificate examinations of 2019, 2018 and 2017, combined those data and the mean of those data or the pattern of results we would normally expect on a school-by-school basis.  We have those data and we could have used them.  The disadvantage of using those data is that they place a strong emphasis on the historical pattern in each school.  It is also a pattern of historical data that has been created by students other than those of 2020.  It was for those reasons, as well as the lack of public acceptability and the experience of the overuse of these data in the United Kingdom, that led the Minister to decide to remove those data.</p> <p>  Some historical data still exist in the process, but it is historical data linked to the students themselves.  The vast and most important data, therefore, are the estimated marks that the teachers thought students might have achieved.</p><p>It is historical data linked to the students themselves, so the vast and most important piece of data is the result of the estimated marks that the teachers thought students might have achieved.  The students, though, themselves, of each class group, create a pattern of results in their own junior certificate results of three years ago, and it is that piece of data that allows one to make a prediction as to what those students ought to have achieved, if they had been able to sit a leaving certificate examination in the normal way.  Clearly they were not.  However, that data can be be very useful to us, and that is is what we used, combined with the teacher estimates, to produce an accurate prediction of what students should be able to achieve.  In the United Kingdom, a huge emphasis was placed on making sure that the predictions were very tightly in line with what students would have achieved in historic data sets that the Minister ultimately removed.  The consequence of that was a very severe and harsh downgrading of student marks, so that for instance, in England and Wales 40% of marks were downgraded; one third of them in Northern Ireland and in Scotland it was about one quarter.  In Ireland, we have adopted an approach that places much greater emphasis on the students' estimated marks, and also on historic data from the junior certificate created by the students of 2020; not created by students from another group, in which these students of 2020 had no part.</p></speech>

There is one more issue that I just want to look at.  At the outset, the Minister talked about achievements in reducing the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools from 28:26.  Earlier today the ASTI were in here and its representatives said that 80% of secondary schools in Ireland have poor ventilation and 25% have no hot water, and that Ireland is at the bottom of OECD league in terms of investment in second level schools <i>per capita</i>.  She also said that she would look at reducing the pupil-teacher ratio further but I want to ask her if, as an experienced politician, she has ever seen large-scale reductions in pupil-teacher ratios and investment in school programmes at a time when tax take is plummeting, namely, in this time of lockdown and restrictions etc.  There is no point debating what is necessary and proportionate, and what is not necessary and not proportionate.  My simple question is: does she think the Department can improve pupil-teacher ratios and the standards of secondary schools with less money than was heretofore available to the Department?</p></speech>

The substantial funding, which at this stage will be in excess of &euro;400 million, has gone directly into the Department of Education and Skills for these present measures, many of which we have discussed here today, and indeed will be on an ongoing basis.  It is a statement of the importance that is being placed on the education sector by this Government.  It is an investment in the education sector by this Government and it is an investment in the young people we serve in the education sector.  It is also a statement of intent of the priority that is being put on education by this current Government.</p> <p>  The Chairman referred to particular issues with ventilation and hot water.  Again, specific funding has been made available to schools on the ground to implement measures that need to be implemented such as those the Chairman has highlighted.</p> <p>  The Chairman specifically referred to the pupil-teacher ratio.  That is absolutely something we will look at.  It is a commitment in the programme for Government.  I recognise there is no one single magic wand to do everything, but there is without question an absolute determination on the part of the Government to deliver for education.  We have seen the investment - as I said, almost in excess of &euro;400 million now - as an absolute statement of intent of the priority the Government is placing on education.  I have no doubt that that investment, determination, dedication and priority to education will continue.</p></speech>
