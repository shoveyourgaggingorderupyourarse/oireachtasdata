Are the minutes of 10 October agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  In category A, No. 2451, dated 10 October, and No. 2466 from Caranua are briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  Is it agreed that we note and publish these?  Agreed.  Category B is from Accounting Officers and their Ministers in follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts, and other items for publication.  The first is No. 2432 from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General, Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, dated 4 October 2019 providing an update relating to the post-project review requested by the committee of the P&aacute;l&aacute;s cinema project.  Related correspondence is No. 2465, also from Ms Licken, dated 15 October enclosing a copy of the mentioned post-project review.  We will note and publish this.  I brought along the periodic report No. 3 which the Committee of Public Accounts published in July 2018, in which there is a specific chapter, including timelines, on the Galway arthouse cinema.</p><p>We made a number of recommendations, including the need for a post-project review.  That is referred to in this report.  I have a number of comments to make on this post-project review but perhaps Deputy Connolly will comment first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#B00200"><p>I was going to ask for this to be postponed.  I looked at it before but perhaps we could look at it in the next session.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#B00300"><p>I understand.  We will hold it over.  I have comments on the specifics, which we will come to next week.</p> <p>  I have a general point on this post-project review process.  I am sure the members will agree with what I have to say.  This had to be published on budget day and it has come to us now.  I will not discuss the recommendations because they relate to the specifics of the report but the gist is that the culture section of the Department should learn lessons from what happened.  This review was approved by that Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before it was published.  The scope of a post-project review for any project in future must include recommendations from which the public sector can learn.  There are clear lessons to be learned from this that could have benefits across the public sector if they are implemented.  Everything in this report has a very narrow focus on this project and one section in one Department that should learn from what took place.  It is too narrow in terms of the scope of its recommendations.  All future post-project reviews must extract specific lessons and when they go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it must see what benefits can be obtained across the public sector.  This report displays a silo mentality and focuses narrowly on one project, one section and one Department.  All the recommendations are confined to that Department.  I suspect that because it is so narrow in its conclusions, there will be no learning process across the wider public service.  It will be deemed to be for a specific narrow area.  All spending reviews in future must have a section on learning lessons across the public sector.  Any report I see that does not have it in future will be seriously challenged by this committee as not being effective in terms of learning the required lessons.</p> <p>  I will not get into the specifics.  I expect Deputy Connolly will have much to say about the matter on the next occasion.  It is a comprehensive report and we need to devote some time to its examination.  I am happy to postpone that examination having made some general comments.  They pertain to more than just the specifics of the case.  This came from an earlier report of the Committee of Public Accounts and it is why we have a particular interest in it.  We will publish the reply and hold it over.</p></speech>

That commission had a long lease on a building and the commercial lease now is nearly half of what it was.  We were told that another public entity gained from talking up the lease.  Who decides to carry out these reviews that measure public gain or loss?  Who can pull these together rather than having the issues siloed or fragmented?</p></speech>

It is a legitimate question to ask an Accounting Officer the Department's programme of reviews, how the elements are selected and when other spending priorities will be dealt with.</p></speech>

There have been a number of cases involving two public entities.</p></speech>

People like to keep things in silos as if they have nothing to do with the rest of us.  This has everything to do with every Department that spends taxpayers' money.  This is a broad matter and we will come back to it.</p> <p>  No. 2434 is correspondence from Mr. Mark Ferguson, director general, Science Foundation Ireland, dated 8 October 2019, responding to our request for information regarding the laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas of the accounts and financial statements of Science Foundation Ireland.  We were concerned about the late arrival of these accounts.  Mr. Ferguson advises that he has referred our query to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which is responsible for laying the accounts before the Oireachtas and they will let us know the position.  I wish to let people know that we are continuing to follow up on this.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has indicated separately that in the year to date there has been a continued improvement in parties submitting their accounts for audit within three months of the year end.  We have made that a little part of our mission.  We will note and publish this item.</p> <p>  No. 2436 is correspondence from Mr. Gerard Dollard, chief executive officer, Irish Greyhound Board, dated 7 October 2019, providing information requested by the committee at our meeting on 19 September.  I will detail the types of matters included.  They comprise details of animal welfare cases and the number of inspections of kennels, at approximately 500 per year.  He lists catering, which was outsourced, and he was asked about a separate care fund established by the Irish Greyhound Board for greyhounds retired from racing.  There was a question about the rehoming organisations for greyhounds and the grants given to various organisations.  These are quite small, with several at &euro;3,000, although there are one or two bigger examples.  They are not major sums.  He also dealt with the foster care process.  It is good to know about this.</p> <p>  Mr. Dollard also dealt with the breakdown of consultancy fees for 2017 because the issue was raised at our meeting.  The &euro;663,000 paid by the organisation in one year for those services is phenomenal.  Legal consultancy fees amounted to &euro;138,000, taxation and financial advice amounted to &euro;12,500 but there also different reviews taking in strategic and organisational restructuring totalling &euro;227,000.  That comprised work by Preferred Results at &euro;130,000, Tandem Consulting at &euro;12,000, Professor Dermot Duff at &euro;4,800 and Power Economics Limited at &euro;6,690.  We made the point here that there appeared to be four consultants examining the organisational structure within a relatively short period.  It defies logic to an extent.  There is also mention of public relations and marketing consultancy, as well as pensions and fees management and human resources consultancy fees.  The four different consultants involved with strategic and organisational restructuring being paid in one year seems extraordinary, and that is why we highlighted the matter.</p> <p>  We asked for details of travel expenses as they were not provided on the day.  The vast majority of people, or almost 90%, get less than &euro;5,000 and they have to travel to race meetings all over the country.  That is not unreasonable.  We asked about the spend on welfare and the information is included.  There is also information on the impairment review summary for 2018, specifically asset and capital grant impairment.  It is quite technical.  There is also a section on organisational restructuring, which has some redaction as various individuals are mentioned.  Generally, it is a comprehensive reply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#B01200"><p>I will come back to the consultancy spend as we have raised this at a high level in the context of how much money the State or organisations funded by it are spending on consultancy.  It is similar to what we are doing with other matters and when we see consultancy spend we should seek a breakdown of what exactly the money is being spent on.  We must examine this a bit more closely.</p><p>There is a lot of change management within the Civil Service.  I imagine that there is a great deal of commonality involved when change is taking place.  When money is being spent on strategic and organisational restructuring, that happens as a matter of routine across many Departments and organisation.  There are examples of it when very large changes are being made.  For example, in the context of technological universities, a lot of change management has to take place in order to merge two institutes to become a new university.  There were issues around the level of consultancy being used to fund all of that.  However, there is a broader point about where lessons can be learned and how they can be applied.  There are also lessons regarding consistency, guidelines and in-house expertise.</p><p> The point we made at the previous meeting is that it is far too easy for organisations funded by the taxpayer to reach out to private consultants or to get consultancy firms to carry out some work before decisions are made.  However, it is the same firms doing the same work, often with the same recommendations.  There is a need to examine this in terms of whether we are getting value for money and if enough is being done by the line Departments that fund these organisations to ensure that better direction is given and that better guidelines are in place in the context of how transition and change are managed.  There is a lot of money involved.  The question I asked on the previous occasion was whether it is possible to get a figure for, say, 2018.  How much did the taxpayer spend on consultancy?  The clerk to the committee is shaking his head.  It might be difficult to get that figure but we should be able to get it.  Every Department should be able to come back to us and tell us how they fund the different organisations and what they spend on consultancy.  Is it listed in their accounts?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#C00300"><p>It is a desk-top exercise for somebody.  As an exercise in good, prudent examination of how taxpayers money is spent, would it not be good to have a figure for how much the State spent, directly or indirectly, on external consultancy in a particular year?  I would say the figure would be frightening.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#C00500"><p>It is not a case of trying.

The only issue is our definition of consultancy.  To take information technology, IT, which is one of the biggest levels, we can have a consultant and sometimes that consultant's work continues in terms of developing the system.  That is really IT development.  Where does the consultancy stop and the carrying out of a project commence?  It is about getting our definition of where we stop and start.</p></speech>

It is many years since we did it.  In 1994 or 1995, we compiled a report on consultancies and there is a definition in that distinguishing between contracting out of normal work.  One would often have that with the running of, say, an IT system but developing an IT system from scratch would generally be regarded as consultancy work-----</p></speech>

The difficulty in going down the route of making a definition and then forcing everybody to report in the context of that definition is that they will start from scratch, whereas in the governance statement attached to every set of financial statements now, they have a listing of consultancies so it is available for harvesting, so to speak.</p></speech>

I agree with the Comptroller and Auditor General that we need to tease it out.  He may not have used those words but he said we should not go down the road of a definition yet.  I agree totally.  If we look at Caranua, for example, which is coming up later today, there is a jump of &euro;43,000 for other consultancy.  That is the same for every organisation.  Perhaps the answer is somewhere in one of the organisations mentioned - Preferred Results.  We get reports to give us the preferred results.  I am not saying anything against this organisation but the clue is in its name.  We have the Grace case, on which we are awaiting the result from the commission of inquiry.  How many reports were compiled in that regard?  How many Preferred Results consultancy reports were compiled in respect of the national children's hospital?</p><p>There is a much larger issue here and the first step is collation to see the nature of the beast, to use a bad pun.

When we refer to money spent on consultancy, some of it will need to be spent.  We are not stating there is no place at all for spending on outside consultancy.  The volume and the repetition involved is a worry, however.  Leaving aside the definition of what consultancy work is, I imagine a shocking amount of money is spent in any given year.  It would be far cheaper if a unit existed within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, or some other Department, to give these organisations the assistance they need, whether with change management, strategic development or finance.</p></speech>

We will not get lost in the little stuff when there are such large amounts involved.

The point mentioned by Deputy Catherine Murphy relates to this correspondence as well.  Some five weeks ago representatives from Bord na gCon were here and we asked for information, all of which we now have.  On the same day, I spoke specifically about the Irish Coursing Club.  It is intended that body will now register all new-born dogs.  That information will then be transferred to the Irish Greyhound Board's database, if the dogs concerned are going to be involved in greyhound racing.</p> <p>  We inquired about the Irish Coursing Club.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine replied that it was nothing to do with it because it was a private organisation and did not get any funding from that Department.  I am amazed to hear that we are handing over that function to a private organisation that probably has charitable status and which has zero accountability to the Department or to this House.  We asked the Department for a note on whether a traceability system similar to that used for cattle or bovines was explored for greyhounds.  We also asked for a detailed briefing on the Irish Coursing Club, its role in greyhound traceability, Bord na gCon's reliance on its system and the level of assurance provided to the Department regarding the process.</p> <p>  We asked the Accounting Officer of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for that information some five weeks ago.  We have not received it and that is not acceptable.  It is fortuitous that representatives of that Department will appear before this committee next week as part of our work programme.  The answers to those questions will be the first item on the agenda, and it will be six weeks since we made the request.  While it is fortuitous that the Accounting Office is here next week, had he not been scheduled to appear, he would be coming in specifically to give us an answer as to why we have not received that information after six weeks.  I make this point to all Departments.  If they do not provide the information requested within four weeks, their representatives will be back here in week five to explain to the public why questions were not answered.  </p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is lucky.  Its representatives happen to be here next week.  I think my point is well made.  I am tired, as the Chairman, wondering if we got replies to questions we asked five, eight and even ten weeks ago.  We should not have to wait that long.  Departments should be efficient.  If it was a case of a parliamentary question, there would be an obligation on a Department to answer it promptly and a request from this committee should be treated with the same sense of urgency.  We are obliging the Accounting Officers by giving them time to provide us with written responses.  They should come to this committee prepared to answer most questions in the first place.  The letter of invitation to all Accounting Officers states that they have to make someone available to appear before the committee.  That is so information can be provided to the committee during the hearings.  They normally run for a few hours.  We have taken a lenient approach by deciding to allow answers in writing in due course.  We are not, however, going to accept this delay of a month in future.  I have said this before, but I think my point is well made now and we will follow through on it.  We will note and publish the correspondence received.  My other comments have been well noted regarding the situation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 2440B from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, dated 8 October 2019.  It provides an information note on the difference between the national debt and general Government debt.  I am going to summarise this for the public.  We got a very detailed answer from the Central Statistics Office and the Department of Finance reconciling one to the other.</p> <p>  The gross national debt consists of Irish Government bonds and borrowing from the EU and the IMF, short-term borrowing from ministerial funds and State savings products, excluding the post office savings account.  That is the gross national debt, because those moneys are owed to all those people.  The national debt is the net debt derived from the gross national debt by subtracting cash Exchequer balances in respect of any liquid assets on hand, as well as non-liquid assets such as the Housing Finance Agency guaranteed notes, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, term loans and credit support account collateral funding.  That is the net situation, consisting of the gross national debt minus cash and other resources that could reasonably be converted to cash.  That is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA. </p> <p>  General Government debt is a measure of the total gross consolidated debt of the State.  It is assessed by the CSO and takes into account the debt and liabilities of central and local government and Government funds such as the Social Insurance Fund.  We have been provided with a detailed note on all this, but generally the gross national debt is how much we owe, the net debt is that figure, generally, minus the cash balances and perhaps assets held by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland that could be made liquid fairly easily.  General Government debt is the measure of the total gross consolidated debt of the State, which includes other agencies such as local authorities.  I am summarising it and it is not 100% accurate, but it is as accurate as people will appreciate.  The full note is several pages long, giving a full reconciliation of the national debt to the general Government debt.  It is great reading and I encourage people with an interest to read it.  It is good to ask the question.</p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; states that the Department has a liaison role and is asking organisations that are in the same geographic area to liaise with each other.  It does not have a legal role.  It will ultimately go back to the Department for sanction.  It was a good point for the committee to highlight and a circular has been issued to the various higher education institutes.</p></speech>

I do not think they are due to appear in the immediate future.  We will note and publish that correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 2447, dated 10 October 2019, from Ms Lorna Gallagher, appeals commissioner at the Tax Appeals Commission, responding to our request for an information note and further details on the ten highest value appeals in the bi-monthly progress report provided to the committee.  We asked the commission to identify the industry sectors of these high appeals.  The commission states it cannot do so because that might identify the parties involved in the big sectors.  The level of debt at the tax appeals commission has been increasing.  The commission was established in March 2016 and by the end of 2016 the quantum of cases on hand was &euro;1.4 billion.  It then got &euro;600 million of new cases, meaning that at the end of 2017 there was &euro;2 billion in outstanding cases on its desk.  In 2018, it had five high value appeals which brought the debt to &euro;4 billion.  Those cases had a value of &euro;2 billion between them.  Obviously, if the commission were to identify the sector, it would make the organisations in question easily identifiable.  Of interest is that to date in 2019 the quantum of appeals closed by the commission has exceeded the quantum of new appeals received by &euro;300 million, resulting in a current balance of appeals on hand of approximately &euro;3.7 billion.  These are significant figures.  Obviously, five companies account for over 50% of the overall figure.</p></speech>

For example, a dispute may relate to a pharmaceutical company writing off research and development expenses.  I read an article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>or <i>The Sunday Times</i>last week or the week before.  The article was a bit eye-watering as it outlined that the amount paid is 10% of the amount adjudicated.  For example, if there is an adjudication of &euro;100 million, the liability will end up being &euro;10 million.  I acknowledge that we do not need to see the individual cases, but we need some sort of profile of what the settlements end up being because while a figure of &euro;3.7 billion is eye watering, it is a different matter if only 10% of that is realised.  We need to get a better understanding of that.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the article to which the Deputy refers.  The committee has highlighted a couple of matters.  First, only a fraction of the settlements published by the commission are paid.  Although a firm may be adjudicated as owing &euro;1.4 million or similar, there is no indication of whether that amount has been paid in full or in part.  Sometimes it is paid and sometimes it is not.  We have asked for details of the amounts collected following the publication of the appeals.  We will receive those figures.  The percentage is relatively low.  It seems that the Revenue pursue the tax judgment to make a point.  It may be aware that it will not receive the money, but it wants to follow cases through.</p> <p>  Second, in the cases referred to by the Deputy, the Revenue faced a legal challenge on grounds of delay.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referred to this in his annual report.  That means that we need to bring in Revenue quite promptly on this issue.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to give his opinion.</p></speech>

I made recommendations on how the commission might improve its reporting in that regard such that in the case of published settlements we find out whether that amount was collected and, if not, why not.  The case referred to in the Sunday newspaper is one that I provided as a case study.</p></speech>

It happened to be one of the cases we examined because there was no other way of finding it.  It was by paring back that case and looking at how it evolved over many years and whether the amount had been collected that we found it had not been.  On published tax defaulters, there is a diagram that indicates per quarter how much of the money had been collected.  It outlines the payment rate at the end of May 2019 for the period from quarter 1 of 2017 to quarter 4 of 2018.</p></speech>

Not all the judgments are published, for a variety of reasons.  There are several matters arising from that chapter which should be discussed with Revenue.  In fairness, with regard to quarter 2 of 2018, a year later only 29% of what was published was outstanding.  The variances are quite significant but there is scope for better reporting of these figures, and that is what I suggested.</p></speech>

Some of these cases could end up in court during this process.  It is a matter of legal interpretation rather than a calculation of tax.</p></speech>

This issue is incredibly important because it these cases do not involve Joe and Josephine Soap.  Most of them relate to corporation tax.  We have a very generous corporation tax system and when that is in dispute, it brings it into disrepute.  The commission gave us a very graphic description of how it functioned when it was set up first, making reference to computers going on fire and so on.  It was quite a shocking session.  Did that make a difference?  If something is going to be problematic because of the length of time spent adjudicating on it, are we at a point such that we can see a difference in terms of the intervention being made by the commission?</p></speech>

This was addressed in the Budget Statement.  All members are aware that the Government totally underestimated the task before the Tax Appeals Commission when it was established on a statutory basis.  There was insufficient provision in terms of the number of appeals commissioners and other staff, as well as resources.  The organisation established by the Government was not fit for the task ahead of it.  When one sets up a new body, it will attract new interest.  It has been playing catch-up.  There are some historic appeals.  Its funding has been significantly increased this year.</p><p>I think there was legislation to increase the number of commissioners the other day or I spoke on that issue somewhere recently.</p><p> Between 2019 and 2020 there were significant increases in resources to the Tax Appeals Commission for staffing and commissioners.  It is playing catch-up and I accept it did not get it right at the beginning.</p><p> I just want to make an observation on the consultancy issue.  I would like the Office of Government Procurement to come in on this at a later stage when we collate the information.  Take the case of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  I suspect this is what is happening.  There is a myriad of Government bodies and agencies which have to handle this.  They go to the Office of Government Procurement to get a firm of consultants to deal with it.  One could find ten different Government agencies ending up with the same company asking for a brief on how to handle GDPR.  Given that the company will have done the job for the first agency, all it has to do is change the cover and charge the full price for the next nine.  I have seen this happen before.  All the big firms know they will be called upon.  They have taken on big operations to deal with these queries.  Say the company charges &euro;20,000 for a project.  Then another similar sized agency comes along.  All the company has to do is change the cover and the names on it and the job is 99% the same.  That is my concern.</p><p> I will be asking the Office of Government Procurement to look at categories of procurement.  If there are umpteen agencies putting out a similar tender independently, is there any way of getting a reduced rate on the basis that one will get a similar project from ten organisations as opposed to a once-off?  I am only speculating but my instinct is that there is some of that happening.</p></speech>

However, it has taken this committee and reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General on the redress scheme to follow up on this.  We have said it many times but it is important to say it again.  It should have not taken that much effort.  If an agreement was made, voluntarily or legally, it should have been followed up.</p> <p>  On a general point, for example, Lenaboy in County Galway, a former industrial school, was finally transferred after ten years.  The site had remained vacant in that time.  It has taken all this time to transfer it to the local authority.  Now it has an empty building that is derelict and that will cost the taxpayer a fortune, not to mention security.  I fought for and wanted it this transfer.  That is just one example of what has happened in this case of absolute mismanagement and failure to follow up.</p></speech>

I was on the previous committee and this question was often asked.  At one stage, there was one staff member working on this part-time.  It was neglected by the Department for years on end.</p></speech>

That is not acceptable.</p></speech>

It should not take the committee to get these things sorted.  If it is the only way it will happen, we will do it.  However, this should not have to be the case.  We will do it if nobody else seems to be actively or publicly on the case.  We are probably helping the Department in our own way by raising this matter publicly in terms of its work in dealing with various organisations as well.  Today&rsquo;s main meeting will deal with this.  We will note and publish this item.   Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2449 B is correspondence from Ms Marie Broderick, superintendent, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, dated 9 October 2019, in response to a request from the committee for further details on information provided by the Garda Commissioner at the meeting on 9 May 2019.  We will note and publish this item.  Deputy Cullinane requested information on this case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#F00800"><p>I want to respond to the letter and the response we received from the superintendent on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.  This goes back to questions I put to the Commissioner on an individual.  Her name is in the public domain but I will not use it.  It concerns an individual who was arrested on suspicion of fraud relating to sick leave.  At the time, it was an extraordinary situation where proper due process was not followed.  There was no proper internal process followed where the person would have an opportunity to account for herself.  It seems it went straight to a criminal investigation.  A very strange arrest was made and then the case went to court where it was dismissed.</p> <p>  We asked the Garda Commissioner several questions on process.  I am not satisfied with the responses we got from the Garda Commissioner.  I have no problem with the first two responses because he cannot be across every detail of every case.  He was not aware that the individual in question had made a further complaint and he was not aware of a mediation process.  He accepted that when he was before us.</p> <p>  However, another issue concerns the exit survey the individual did.  My understanding is that she claimed bullying occurred.  We asked whether this was a pattern in this particular Garda station.  We asked for a breakdown of the exit surveys and whether any instances of bullying or harassment had been cited.  We asked that the response include a breakdown for Store Street Garda station.  We were not looking for individuals&rsquo; details just the data.  The response is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has no record of any person citing bullying and-or harassment in an exit survey.  It is qualified, however, by stating that exit surveys are conducted by local management and there is no organisational policy in place in this regard.  That does not answer the question.  It may well be that there are such instances but that they are not logged at a local level and the data are not collated.  We need to tell the Garda to go back to the superintendents in the Garda stations and local managers and have them provide the data.  If there is no structure in place for collating data, that is not our problem.  That is the Garda's problem.</p> <p>  We also asked for information on the number of cases where civilians and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were arrested for suspected fraud relating to sick notes.  The response is that between 2016 and 2019, three disciplinary investigations were undertaken to investigate allegations concerning the altering of medical certificates and the claiming of allowances while on sick leave.  We would not stand over any that if there were instances.  It does not answer the question, however, as to whether any of these cases led to criminal investigations.  I am taking from the reply that the answer is "No" apart from this one case.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.123" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#F01000"><p>No.  These were disciplinary investigations which is a different process.  The question we asked is whether there have been instances of people who were arrested for suspected fraud.</p> <p>  The point is that this individual&rsquo;s case is the only instance where there was an arrest and the person was brought before a court for alleged fraud relating to a sick note.  The case was then dismissed in court.  We asked were there any more instances.  This letter does not answer the question.  It talks about disciplinary processes.  My point is that there is no candour here in terms of giving the responses to the questions that have been asked.</p> <p>  More importantly, we asked about the related policy and practice in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for dealing with suspected fraud relating to sick leave and the details of it.  The response noted that instances of non-compliance with sick leave regulations and falsification of records are reported to human resources.  It states the Civil Service disciplinary code may be invoked for serious misconduct.  In the case we raised initially, that did not happen.  Why?  That is the point.  In this case, the Garda seems to have bypassed its own processes and went straight to an arrest.</p><p>What we know is that the garda&iacute; who arrested this individual were known to her.  That was an issue as well.  There are issues with process here.  It may well be that they are not for this committee to discuss - I do not know - but they came up in the course of an appearance of the Garda Commissioner before the Committee of Public Accounts.  We need to go back to the Commissioner and get clearer answers to the questions we put.  The obvious ones concern the exit surveys, which I have cited.  Can he be clearer that there was only one case, as it seems there was, that led to a criminal investigation?  That should be very easy for him to respond to.  Furthermore, why was this issue not dealt with through the Civil Service disciplinary code, as per Garda policy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#G00200"><p>I think we all recall the Garda Commissioner giving the information on this case.  The committee subsequently received a letter stating that there was an error in his response to us.  Whether he was before this committee or whether the information was given by way of correspondence, that certainly happened.  Obviously, the Commissioner did not get the correct information internally from the people who were advising him.  It strikes me - and this may not be a matter for this committee to discuss - that to carry out an exit survey with one's immediate supervisor is not the way to go.  We certainly have to ask about the process used in this regard.  If there is to be a change in culture, we have to make it possible for people to be honest and frank in exit surveys.  That seems very obvious.  If something is subject to a criminal investigation, the committee would have no business having a discussion about it, but we need to know if that is the case.</p> <p>  Garda&iacute; are involved in a very dangerous job and some of them will be out on sick leave.  One would expect to see that.  Let us say there are allegations that there are a small number who have altered medical certificates.  Would the various allowances apply while they are out sick?  It is not at all clear what that would have amounted to in terms of the payments individuals have received.  In the Civil Service people are paid a certain amount, but with certain other grades, such as garda, soldier or whatever, very often allowances make up a large proportion of their income.  It would be useful to find out if people on sick pay lose their allowances.</p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane is right about separating out the reasons a disciplinary code would be used, when it is used and when matters go beyond the code.  That is not clear from this correspondence.  I am not sure whether this is a matter for the committee to discuss but it is difficult to ask another committee to follow up on something on which we have opened up a dialogue.  We should close that off before we decide what to do with this.</p></speech>

This ends up becoming a value for money issue because if the systems in place are there in theory but do not work, they end up costing money.  This is probably a matter for the justice committee as well.  The points have been made.  I recall the Commissioner's appearance before the committee.  He came back and apologised or said he did not know-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#G00600"><p>Yes, I know.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#G00700"><p>If one does not know, one waits, but he said he did not have foreknowledge of the matter.  This is simple.  Exit surveys should not be carried out if one is not going to learn from them.  The whole point of an exit survey is to learn from it.  A simple answer here would have been very helpful to us.  We asked a very simple question, namely, whether bullying and harassment were recorded in the exit survey.  Instead of responding that the Garda has a system in place and its analysis found that bullying and harassment did not come up, the response was that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had no record of any person citing bullying.  That is not an answer to our question.  The next question we asked was very simple, namely, whether anyone had been arrested in respect of fraud.  The answer should have been "Yes" or "No" and in the case of "Yes", the number of arrests should have been given.  These are simple questions, so it is not reassuring to the Committee of Public Accounts to receive such answers.  Only two weeks ago, we had Garda representatives before us with their transformational presentation on their organisation and the justice committee.  We want to believe them.  I want garda&iacute; on the street and in my community and I want to believe them, but answers such as these do not help.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#G00800"><p>I raised this case because it was brought to my attention before the Garda Commissioner appeared before the committee.  There was a value-for-money element to it because there was an allegation at the time that due process was not followed.  That led to a criminal investigation that cost the State money.  It went to court and the charges were dismissed.  Leaving aside that case, I have no problem with individuals within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are falsifying records for the purpose of defrauding the State and the system being dealt with.  Of course they should be dealt with.  Nobody on this committee would stand over anything else.  The question, however, is what processes are in place to determine that.  When it is an issue of sick leave, it should be dealt with first by human resources and then the other systems, the disciplinary code and so on, kick in.  That is the procedure to be followed.  The point is that in this case that procedure does not seem to have been followed and there were a lot of question marks over the nature of the arrest and so on, all leading to the case collapsing in court.</p> <p>  There is, however, a more fundamental point, which Deputies Connolly and Catherine Murphy touched on, about the exit surveys.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na says there is no record of bullying being cited, but we need to know whether that statement is factual, in other words, whether it is based on the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have an organisational record or whether it has actually carried out the trawl.  There is a difference.  It would not be factually right to say there is no record.  There may be no records held, but that does not mean that in a local Garda station somewhere, when garda&iacute; start to go through any exit surveys, there would not be a record of bullying.  If there is a number of records in one particular Garda station, that would create a problem because there could be a culture, which is what we were trying to establish.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy's point about the independence of exit surveys is also important.  I do not think that is a matter for our committee, however, and perhaps we should refer it to the justice committee.  We should send our follow-up questions.  It would not be good enough for the committee to decide the answers to our questions were unsatisfactory.  We need to get clearer answers from the Commissioner and then perhaps we can decide how to proceed from there.</p></speech>

If these cases came to light through a total review of, for example, sick leave, as opposed to somebody making a decision to carry out an investigation based on a belief that something was incorrect, that would be a totally different thing.  Is a system in place to carry out a review?  We want people who are out sick, who have been injured on the job, to be above reproach.  If there is fraud in the system, it undermines that.  What is the system in place to identify this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#G01000"><p>I will make a few suggestions.  First, while the name of the person mentioned in this letter is in the public arena, we have not put it in the public arena, and I propose we redact the person's name before we publish the letter.  The name is out there but it is not for us to put it out there.  The name is mentioned three or four times in the letter but it will be redacted when we publish it.  Second, I think everybody is clear that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have an organisational policy in place for exit surveys, so it does not know.  That is the honest answer.  If it does not have a policy, it could not have said there is no record.  We will, therefore, ask the Commissioner whether he will put a policy in place.  If he will, we will ask how it will be implemented, and if he will not, we will ask him for reasons.</p><p> I will move on.  I am taking a slightly different approach to this.  I see a distinction in this letter between the arrest and what we are talking about, particularly in the last paragraph, which states that where cases of fraud are suspected, they are escalated for criminal investigation.  They have nothing to do with HR.  If someone in the Garda believes fraud has been committed by another member of the Garda, the matter goes straight to a fraud investigation.  The letter further notes that instances of non-compliance with sick leave regulations are reported to HR.  Someone came to the conclusion that there was a suspected case of fraud here, but HR does not follow up on fraud.  HR can do what it likes, but if the Garda suspects fraud, it must follow it up on a criminal basis.  These are two different, unconnected tracks.  One can follow the other, though it does not have to.  I have seen cases over the years of garda&iacute; being prosecuted for allegedly taking &euro;200 or &euro;300 out of a station from money handed in for gun licences.  That is suspected fraud, which goes straight to a criminal investigation.  That does not only go to HR, because if the Garda believes there is fraud it goes off on that track.  That is the Garda's job.  It has a second role as an employer and HR comes into that.  I see why one went-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#H00200"><p>I would add a caveat to that.  I do not disagree with what-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#H00300"><p>Allow me to finish.  There is a complete distinction between suspected fraud and instances of non-compliance with procedures.  Suspected fraud cases mean a potential loss to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as money would be paid out in a fraudulent manner.  Fraud is a criminal issue, not a HR issue.  Do members understand the distinction I am making?  I am not trying to muddy the waters, but rather trying to clarify.  We will go back to what the Deputy said.  I am not asking everyone to agree with me, but I see two different issues going on here which are independent of each other.  One does not follow the other.  I accept that this particular case was dismissed and was probably thrown out of court.  However, I can see why, if the Garda believes that one of its members is involved in suspected fraud, it would be a straightforward criminal matter rather than a HR matter.  I am just making that observation.</p></speech>

He is quite right to point that distinction out.  The second page of the letter refers to the three disciplinary investigations, which are the next step in the process.  HR proceedings come first, then the internal disciplinary mechanisms kick in.  The allegations in these three cases apparently related to altering medical certificates and did not get to the point of fraud, it would seem.  We asked about suspected fraud and arrests but the letter talks about the disciplinary procedures.  In this case, I imagine that it should have gone through the disciplinary procedures, where any errors would have been captured, rather than going straight to an arrest and a court proceeding.  There are a number of different steps in the process.</p></speech>

We need clarification on whether these three cases are separate from the case about which we are talking.  It is quite possible that these cases were disciplinary and that the case to which we are referring is criminal.  I want to know whether the one we have been writing about is one of these three cases, as I do not know that.  There are two different processes involved, namely, criminal proceedings if there is suspected loss of money, or HR intervention if not.</p></speech>

We will publish this letter, redacting the name of the person concerned.  That is noted and published with redaction.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2450B is from Mr. Tom Doherty, chief operations officer of Teagasc, providing an information note requested by the committee about the number of contracts that were non-compliant with procurement rules in 2018.  These were recorded in the statements of internal control or governance in its annual report.  This committee now has a policy of immediately writing to an organisation for a detailed explanation, which can be put on the public record, whenever we meet instances of non-compliance with public procurement.  Public bodies will likely not want their details read out to that extent in future and so it will probably encourage them to deal with the issue and not let it recur.  The letter from Teagasc provides considerable details, much of them relating to the rollover of a Vodafone telephone account.  It seems to be dealing with the issues.  We will note and publish the letter.  Our point is well made on that particular issue.  Public bodies will have to give a detailed point-by-point full explanation of the issue, the action taken, the value involved and the remedial action taken.  They will not want to be written to again next year.  Let us hope they act accordingly.  We will note and publish that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2453B is from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, the director of the State Claims Agency.  It provides information requested by the committee on the general indemnity scheme and clinical indemnity scheme, details of the type of cover provided and information regarding which legal costs are covered or not covered.  This is a follow-up inquiry for the purposes of our periodic report.  We have asked for details where we felt there were gaps in our information.  We will note and publish that letter, which will feed into our periodic report.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2454B is from Mr. Michael Goodwin from the energy security division of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It provides an information note on the National Oil Reserves Agency levy and its potential repurposing for use by the climate action fund, which will require legislation.  Deputy MacSharry previously raised this issue.  The Department states that legislation is required to achieve this goal.  It also clarifies, in response to the Deputy's question from a previous meeting, that it is not in a position to hand over the surplus in its accounts to the Government by way of a dividend.  It accepts that the levy is in excess of what it requires and it now wants it to be used for the climate action fund, which is Government policy.  The Government has published the National Oil Reserves Agency (Amendment) and Provision of Central Treasury Services Bill, which will provide for the surplus levies collected to be used for the climate action fund.  The letter goes on to say that legislation is currently being developed to amend the 2007 legislation and provide for the expansion of the purpose of future levy funds.  The letter has not answered the central question we asked about the existing build-up of funds, though we understand that future levies can have a new purpose based in the legislation.  This question will probably be debated in the Chamber during the passage of the legislation, whenever that happens.  The letter sets out the Department's position crystal clear.  We will note and publish this item.</p></speech>

The reality is that that &euro;250 million cannot be used for anything except that agency.  The other issue is that people are paying 1.5 cent per litre for the climate action fund on top of the carbon tax and being hit doubly, though I acknowledge that this is Government policy.  We will not get the benefit of that &euro;250 million unless the Government stops levying the agency for a period and works down the funds.  Alternatively, as was suggested to me, it could buy an extra few days' oil, which might use up the money.  I am glad to have exposed this issue, but I wish we could use the &euro;250 million for other projects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#H00900"><p>It is interesting that, in this day and age, &euro;250 million has essentially been locked into a State agency's account.  It has no immediate purpose for that fund and there is no provision to pay it back to the Government by way of a dividend, so it is locked in.  We have to find a mechanism in order to use it for an appropriate purpose.  I thank Deputy MacSharry for raising this issue.  That is where it currently stands.</p> <p>  The next set of correspondence is category C, which is from individuals and other correspondence.  Correspondence No. 2431C, dated 6 October 2019, is from an individual who has queried information provided to the committee on whether profits from the student transport scheme are or could be used to cross-subsidise Bus &Eacute;ireann.  This is a school transport issue, which was raised at a Committee of Public Accounts meeting on 28 Feb 2013.  The letter quotes Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who was a member of the committee at the time, from the committee transcript.  He was very concerned and wanted to verify that Bus &Eacute;ireann was not using these funds for any purposes other than school transport.</p><p>The then Chairman, Deputy McGuinness, reiterated the same point.  I think many people sought clarification on it.  At this stage, we will request a note from the Department of Education and Skills on whether Bus &Eacute;ireann's auditors have satisfied themselves on this question.  As a member of the committee at that time, Deputy Donohoe wanted verification that this was the actual situation.  We will try to get that.</p></speech>

They are not giving an assurance that there is no cross-subsidisation.  All they are saying is that it has been prepared as agreed.</p></speech>

We are going to write to the Department to clarify this point.  Members can see that it is an ongoing issue.  It has been before this committee for a couple of years.  It was before the last Committee of Public Accounts as well.  We will note the correspondence.  We will not publish it because it is from a private individual.  We will ask the Department to respond.  I think that under GDPR, we have to get permission from the person if we want to contact the Department on his behalf.</p> <p>  Next is No. 2435, from the Irish Thalidomide Association, dated 30 September 2019.  It relates to communication with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability services.  The association is looking for all-party support for a number of issues, including the lifting of the limitation period in the context of all thalidomide survivors, an acknowledgement of wrongdoing by the State and recompense for survivors.  While we are all sympathetic and we all support the principle the association is talking about, it is not a matter with which the Committee of Public Accounts can deal specifically.  It has been referred to the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Minister of State for them to deal with it.  I suggest that we note this correspondence.  This is really a matter to be dealt with in the Chamber.  Members can show their support for this cause by asking parliamentary questions and raising it in the Chamber, but the Committee of Public Accounts cannot take it on.  Any change in the legislation in this area is a policy issue.  Any time limitations on the taking of cases are policy issues.  We will note the correspondence.  I ask members to support it as best they can and in a manner they deem appropriate.</p> <p>  Next is No. 2438, dated 7 October 2019, from an individual who represents a group that is raising the alleged misuse of resource allocations in schools.  The correspondence refers particularly to resources for students with special needs.  It lists a number of findings and recommendations in relation to whole-school evaluations.  It suggests that the Department of Education and Skills has failed to deal with the educational matters raised.  In my view, this is a matter of public funds allocated for special education purposes.  It is alleged in the letter that funds are being used for school administration and other purposes.  If this means that money being allocated for special needs purposes is not being used for those purposes, the Committee of Public Accounts will want to know why funding being allocated to a vulnerable group is possibly being used for other purposes in the school.  I do not know whether it is.  I met the correspondent in person outside a committee meeting a couple of weeks ago.  He asked this committee to examine what he considers is the misuse of public funds in this case.</p></speech>

We do not want to hear what its policy is: we want to know what it is doing to ensure voted moneys that are set aside for children with special needs in schools throughout the country are being used specifically for such purposes.  It would be dreadful to think that this is happening on any significant scale.</p></speech>

I would be very surprised if it has not been raised with other Deputies.  What control does the Department have at individual school level?  Can we ask it specifically about this critical issue?  What inspections and controls are in place?  Is there a complaints mechanism?  What controls are put in place to ensure there is no abuse?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#J01100"><p>We need to ask those questions.  I am not sure whether boards of management have to audit the income of schools, such as capitation grants and other grants.  Maybe members can tell me whether they do.  I am not talking about teacher salaries because they come straight from the Department.  It goes without saying that all schools are tight on money.  I am involved in my local community employment scheme, which has to have two audits, one of which relates to its own fund.  The company that runs it has to have a second audit.  The accounts of community employment schemes are audited to ensure the moneys that are paid for training, staffing, courses and materials are used for the purposes for which they are intended, as agreed with the Department.  An audit has to be done.  I do not know whether any audit is done in a school.  I am just not sure.  I am not suggesting that 4,000 audits have to be done in all the schools in Ireland.  I think there should be an annual return from the board of management of each school, showing how the money received from the Department under various headings has been utilised.  Maybe there is a need for some spot checks.  The issue this correspondence highlights is that when the money is sent out, that is the end of it.  That is not good enough.</p></speech>

They often have to share a resource among a number of pupils.  We might have to differentiate between certain things.  I received a complaint about a laptop that was provided for a pupil, when in fact the pupil did not get access to the laptop.  That is the kind of thing that has been brought to my attention.  We might have to differentiate between those two things.  Most schools are trying to do their best to share out things that might not be specific to an individual student.  Each school has to define who has the most need.  The resource in question might not cover all of the need.  Complaints can be made when there is an expectation that a shared support will be used in a certain manner.</p></speech>

We will ask the Department for a detailed response.  I know there are major gaps in whole-school evaluation reports.  If a school building is collapsing, it will not be covered in the whole-school evaluation report.  We will ask the Department to respond to what has been highlighted.</p></speech>

We know that every school in the State is under strain and stress because of shortages.  The Chair has indicated that we will ask the Department what process or mechanism it uses for auditing school grants.  Perhaps this is done through boards of management or through inspections.  There is a need to ensure every single grant under every heading is spent in the right department of the school in accordance with the procedures.  We should ask the Department how it supervises and inspects school expenditure.  Maybe it can furnish us with the relevant details.  How many cases have been brought to its attention?  Did it investigate them?  What was the outcome?  If several cases were brought to its attention in the past, what has been done since then to ensure these problems have not continued?</p></speech>

We will send a transcript of this discussion to the Department with a covering letter in order to ensure it is familiar with the issues members have raised.  We will note this item of correspondence and we will contact the Department directly on it.</p> <p>  Next is No. 2445, from Deputy Kate O'Connell, who is requesting further information from Bord na gCon regarding the post mortems that are conducted when greyhounds die on the track at its events.  I take it that the Deputy is happy for us to forward her letter to Bord na gCon for a detailed response.</p></speech>

We will do that.  It is agreed that we will ask for a detailed response.</p> <p>  The final item today is No. 2446, dated 10 October, from Deputy David Cullinane, who is requesting further information from the National Transport Authority.  We sent a detailed list to the authority arising from last week's meeting.  The Deputy has a few other issues he wants to raise.  Is it agreed that those issues will also be sent to the National Transport Authority for its response?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Having dealt with the correspondence, the next item on the agenda is three sets of financial statements that have been laid before and listed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  They will come up on the screen in a moment.</p><p>The Arts Council, the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies and the Commission for Aviation Regulation all received a clear audit opinion.  We will just note those and the fact that they have been laid before the Oireachtas.</p><p> The next item on the agenda is our work programme, which is on the screen now.  Caranua will be before us today.  Representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will be here next week to discuss accounts and there is also a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on this matter.

I refer here to getting patient records systems in place and so on.  Children's Health Ireland commenced functioning on 1 January this year but work was being done on that project prior to that.  That body has not been before this committee yet but it is a fundamental part of the national children's hospital project.</p> <p>  We have suggested a meeting with Pobal for 12 December.  Last week we agreed to have a meeting on the carbon fund, fossil fuel levy and so on.  The CSO has produced a report and the Comptroller and Auditor General has a chapter in his report on this issue.  We know that well over &euro;3 billion has been collected and the Comptroller and Auditor General has recommended that Departments be required to show how the money that has been collected under the name of the carbon fund has been utilised.  The CSO has reported on this and the ESRI has produced two reports on it which have been circulated to members.  One of the ESRI reports, published in October, provides a breakdown of the headings under the carbon fund.  We will not have a big discussion on it now but I am proposing that as the aforementioned two independent organisations have done much work on the carbon tax collected and how it has been spent, I propose one or possibly two meetings on this issue.  At one of the meetings we will talk to the CSO and the ESRI because they are independent of the Department and have done great work on this.  We are not going to redo any of their work but it would be very helpful for the public if we have a public discussion on the carbon fund.  There is a lack of transparency and the CSO and ESRI have done much work to try to get behind it and have commented on how the funds collected have been used and whether the spending has been detrimental or useful in terms of reducing our carbon emissions.  Obviously, we will invite representatives from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment a fortnight later.  We do not have confirmation from these organisations but we will ask the secretariat in November to make the necessary arrangements.  We will try to make sure the meetings are not too long because people are under pressure.  We should be able to do a nice piece of very important work on the carbon fund in terms of taxes collected and their use, in two meetings.  We will confine it to two meetings - one with the CSO and ESRI and the other with the Department.  It will be helpful to the public.  This is 100% under the remit of this committee.  Taxes have been collected for a specific purpose and we want to see how they were utilised in the context of environmental issues.  It is 100% under our remit.  Are we agreed that the secretariat will come back with the dates as soon as they are confirmed?</p></speech>

However, if they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that they shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy.

Caranua is responsible for overseeing the use of substantial funds pledged by a number of religious congregations to support the needs of survivors of residential institutional child abuse.  The Act provides that the funds received from the religious congregations were to be used to pay grants to survivors in order that they may avail of approved services.  The types of approved services for which grant funding is available are housing support services, health and well-being services and education, learning and development services.  The Act also permits the use of the fund to pay for expenditure incurred by Caranua in the performance of its functions.</p> <p>  The financial statements for Caranua before the committee today relate to the financial year 2017.  At December 2017, cash contributions amounting to &euro;101 million had been received into the fund.  Interest earned on deposits amounted to &euro;321,000.  As at 31 December 2017, the status of the amounts received was as follows: &euro;66.8 million had been paid out by way of grants to survivors of residential institutional child abuse; &euro;7.6 million had been used to fund Caranua&rsquo;s administration costs and there was a net balance of &euro;26.9 million remaining in the fund.  Caranua&rsquo;s expenditure in 2017 totalled just over &euro;17 million.  Almost &euro;15 million was expended in respect of grants to survivors.  This included &euro;10.7 million on housing-related grants and &euro;3.7 million on health-related grants.  Administration expenditure charged to the fund in 2017 amounted to &euro;2.06 million.</p> <p>  My audit report in respect of Caranua&rsquo;s financial statements for 2017 draws attention to the statement on internal control, which discloses weaknesses in the board&rsquo;s control over grant payments, which created a risk that in some cases grant expenditure might not be used for the purposes intended.  During the audit of the 2017 financial statements, sample-based examination of the controls over grant payments found that: evidence was not available in respect of 56% of the sample cases examined that required pricing quotations were received by the board in advance of grant payment; evidence was not available in respect of around 50% of the sample grants examined that required invoices and receipts had been presented following payment of grants and; evidence was not available in respect of 55% of a sample of housing support grants examined that claimants had provided the required proof of property tenancy or ownership.  These grant control findings are similar to those of previous years&rsquo; audits, to which I had also drawn attention.  The statement on internal control sets out the steps being taken by the board to resolve the control weaknesses identified.  Fieldwork on the audit of Caranua&rsquo;s draft 2018 financial statements has been completed.  I expect that the financial statements will be certified in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Caranua was established in 2013 as the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board, under the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012.  Caranua is responsible for the management of a limited fund to improve the quality of life of people who, as children, experienced abuse and neglect in institutions and who have received an award or settlement as referred to in the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.  To date, &euro;106.9 million has been received from the religious congregations and an additional &euro;1.38 million in interest.  There is just over &euro;3 million outstanding in contributions, which is expected to be received in full by December 2019.</p> <p>  Caranua commenced accepting applications in January 2014.  Since then, Caranua has received applications from 6,543 people.  Of these, 5,987 were survivors who were eligible to apply for funding supports.  By the end of September 2019, Caranua had made over 54,000 funding supports payments to the value of &euro;91.3 million.  At 30 September, the highest area of provision of funding supports was home improvements at &euro;65.1 million, followed by health at &euro;24.5 million, education at &euro;1.4 million and exceptional needs support at &euro;0.28 million.  In carrying out its function, Caranua has tried to distribute the fund provided in the fairest way possible to all eligible survivors.  The legislation sets out that all operational costs must be met from the fund.  To the end of September, &euro;11.5 million has been spent on operations.  The board of Caranua and management have worked determinedly to minimise operational costs and continue to do so during the wind-down phase.</p> <p>  As part of enhanced reporting, we have improved our accountability and transparency through our monthly updates on our website.  Our website has information on board minutes, monthly updates on applications and spend, information on complaints and feedback from survivors and other news items are published regularly.  Caranua has to strike a balance between working with survivors in a person-centred and compassionate manner and our obligations as a public body with regards to our fiduciary responsibilities.  While at times the process can be seen by some survivors as too bureaucratic, it has been necessary for Caranua to respond to the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  Following recommendations of the 2017 audit, we invested a lot of time reviewing and improving our internal policies and procedures, aiming to combat the issues raised, while still focusing on delivering an accessible and person-centred service for survivors.  Since the beginning of 2018, our internal controls are reviewed at every board meeting and actions are implemented and updated at the following meeting.  Our risk register is also reviewed at every audit and risk committee meeting and updates are provided at each board meeting.  Since December 2018, Caranua has been at 100% compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The board of Caranua has established a wind-down committee to manage the orderly wind-down of Caranua.  This committee met the representative of the Department of Education and Skills tasked with drafting the wind-down legislation required.  The committee will continue to engage with the Department.</p> <p>  In order to combat discrepancies between the confidential payment system and the case management system, a complete change of practice was undertaken in 2018.  Monthly reconciliations are now undertaken and a full report from 2018 shows the two systems are now fully reconciled.  Public procurement guidelines are complied with in all instances of purchasing goods and services since 2018.  For purchases prior to 2018, where the guidelines were not complied with or documentation was not retained, we have undertaken a process of market testing to ensure value for money.  As Caranua is currently in wind-down, a decision was made not to re-tender for the existing suppliers.  Since September 2018, we have introduced purchase requisition order documents.  Evidence of tax clearance certificates are now obtained for all relevant suppliers.  On travel and subsistence claims, supporting documentation is obtained for all claims made.  The rate of subsistence for staff is in line with Government circulars.</p> <p>  On prepayment documents, a simplified acceptable quotations document is provided to survivors so they are aware in advance of the standard of quotation required for audit purposes.  We have also introduced additional internal checks to ensure the paperwork is of the required standard prior to payment.  We implemented a best effort approach with regard to post-payment requirements.  During the course of their application, the application advisers ask that survivors send in their receipts for all funding supports received.  In addition, we wrote to survivors requesting return of any outstanding receipts from 2018.  Caranua has received 66% of receipts from funding supports made during 2018.  While this may seem like a straightforward task, receiving the letters was upsetting for some survivors as they felt we did not trust them, which was not the case at all.  It can be a challenge to meet both the needs of survivors and the audit recommendations.</p> <p>  Our 2018 audited accounts are currently with the Comptroller and Auditor General and we hope to have them finalised in the coming weeks.  As Caranua operates with a limited fund, which is now nearly expended, we are nearing the end of our remit and are currently in the process of winding down the organisation.  On 31 May 2018, the board of Caranua announced the decision to cease taking new or repeat applications from 1 August 2018.  As legislation prevents Caranua from making first contact with survivors, we were dependent on raising awareness of the cessation date through a variety of methods, including outreach events, poster campaigns, media advertising, word of mouth and working with survivor support and other stakeholder groups.</p><p>As a result of this work, Caranua received 289 applications between 1 May and 1 August 2018.  After 2 August 2018, Caranua received 378 applications.  Except for in exceptional circumstances, Caranua has not provided funding supports to these survivors, but we have offered advocacy supports and some survivors have availed of them.  In the past 18 months, Caranua has adopted a targeted approach to outreach events by focusing on a number of specific survivor groups, including survivors who required additional supports in managing their applications and those who had received limited or no funding supports.  This targeted approach has proven to have excellent results, as survivors are provided with an opportunity to discuss their applications in person with their application advisers.</p><p> I will outline some examples of our outreach work.  More than 100 survivors have opted to come to Caranua's offices for meetings with their application advisers.  Outreach days have been organised in conjunction with the Christine Buckley Centre for Education and Support, Right of Place, the Cork Deaf Association and in the UK with the C&aacute;irde survivors group, the Coventry Irish Society and the Disabled Survivors Support Network.  Caranua commenced a programme of outreach for survivors in prisons across Ireland.  In addition, 2019 marked the 20th anniversary of the State apology to survivors and the tenth anniversary of the publication of the Ryan report.  I was delighted that the Christine Buckley Centre for Education and Support invited Caranua, along other survivor support and counselling services, to join the organising committee to plan two events to mark the anniversaries.  We organised a conference, Facing the future together - Ireland's lifelong responsibility to the survivors of institutional abuse, on 11 May in Trinity College.  In the afternoon, a celebration event was held for survivors.</p><p> Through our work, we have found that social isolation is an issue for a number of survivors.  Many survivors contact Caranua on a regular basis for a chat as this communication is the only social contact they have.  Survivors outside of Ireland often mention that Caranua is their only link with Ireland.  We aim to assist survivors by linking them with survivor support groups and other organisations that may be able to offer support and befriending services in the longer term.</p><p> While working in Caranua, I have had the privilege of meeting and working with some of the most resilient and empowered survivors and I have also met survivors who are still very much impacted by their childhood experiences who will require supports for the foreseeable future.  Caranua will continue to work in support of survivors until our closure.  I thank the Chairperson and the members for their attention.  We are happy to answer any questions that the committee may wish to raise.</p></speech>

The background to this, of course, concerned the previous redress board and all the money.

I am sure the Comptroller and Auditor General produced many reports but I am referring to the one from 2015.  My point is for him and also the Department.  Page 11 of the summary sets out the setting up of a redress scheme.  It is stated that lessons learned should be identified, in addition to improvements that could be applied to any future redress scheme.  Redress cost &euro;110 million and we were supposed to have learned lessons.</p></speech>

Reference is also made to "expenditure forecasting methodology", to which we will come back.  I am referring to the forecasting of expenditure over time.  Also mentioned is "effectiveness in meeting intended objectives and outcomes".

That had issues in terms of very high turnover of staff, a lack of consistency.  There were some staff who were possibly only working there for a month at a time.  The quality of service that was delivered to survivors was not optimised.  Caranua commissioned a firm to carry out a study on workflows, application timelines and so on to see how they could deliver an optimal service for staff.  I think the human resources figure referred to for 2016 was that study.</p></speech>

I see a difficulty in the administration of the fund as I have read all of the accounts and complaints.  I am not putting the focus on the people who are accessing the fund, rather I am putting the focus on what is in place in terms of accountability.  It seems that when the board was set up, it was obvious that there was a limited fund, a limited amount of time and that a limited number of people would come forward.  All of these decisions should have been made.  Going back to the chapter in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, there should have been learnings from the previous one and predictions about the expenses involved and what would be necessary.  It seems that was not done.</p></speech>

The cap was introduced arbitrarily because the board realised it had a limited fund and it applied a limit.  People were told, "You have got that amount.  You cannot get any more."  There were all sorts of problem, as Ms Downes knows.  Letters were sent without explaining things to people.  How much is left in the fund?</p></speech>

We make monthly projections in looking at what is left in the fund and how it is being distributed to see if there is a possibility to look at doing additional work with survivors.  As part of the work, we are looking at making exceptional needs payments.  A big piece is recognising that there are a number of survivors with whom we are working who will need long-term support.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, at this stage there are a lot of survivors who ring us just to a chat.  We are working with other groups, Alone in particular.  We are looking to having a project with it and link survivors with it.  Whether it is through the access services or the befriending service-----</p></speech>

Did Caranua close it off too late?  I will ask the chairman of the board.  Let us say Caranua makes average payments in these cases and pays out &euro;4 million.  If it ends up with &euro;2 million unspent, where will it go?  Will it go to the children's hospital?</p></speech>

Caranua hopes to use the remaining &euro;8 million in funding by June but there may be a surplus.  It did not know for certain that it would use all this money, although that is its aim.  Given that Caranua has a duty of care and given Mr. O'Callaghan's comments a few moments ago that "survivors are number one", why would Caranua not have included those 22 applicants who were deemed eligible for funding?</p></speech>

The redress scheme was in operation from 2002.  It was supposed to end in 2005.  It was open for late applications until legislation was passed in 2011.  Between the period from 2005 to 2011 there were an additional 2,000 late applications.  Unfortunately, it is simply a fact that all schemes have an end date.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Munster, but we have to take into account that she is talking about 22 survivors.  Let us consider the numbers.  A study was done on the possible number of people who were still alive who could apply to Caranua.  That figure was in or around 12,000.  Of that, approximately 50% of the people who were eligible to apply actually applied to Caranua.  Caranua has conducted extensive outreach and publicity on its closing date.  Ms Downes may wish to comment on that.</p> <p>  It is an unfortunate fact-----</p></speech>

The Caranua report states that while it would have preferred to place advertisements in all relevant and national newspapers, it was mindful that all operational costs, including advertising, must come from under the fund.  Caranua had already spent &euro;11 million on operations and administration.  Surely, the survivor comes first.  Caranua undertook to outreach to get to as many as possible.  It has a duty of care to each survivor.  Surely, Caranua should have held back on nothing to ensure that every survivor could be informed about the closing date.  It seems to me that Caranua cut back.</p></speech>

We went to all the Sunday newspapers in Ireland, the UK and America.  Unfortunately, advertising is cost-prohibitive.  I completely understand what Deputy Munster is saying about operational costs.  We have tried.  Many of our operational costs go towards survivors.  We have a free telephone service and a free post service.  We undertake outreach to ensure we get out to meet survivors.  That is part of our work as well.  We tried to ensure that we used our networks, and a poster campaign was run.  That would have been in every general practitioner office, social protection office and Garda office.  We used as many extensive networks as we could to get the word out.</p></speech>

They discussed how they were treated or how they perceived themselves to have been treated by Caranua.  I am in total shock that there are 22 survivors of institutional abuse and that Caranua did not see fit to inform the Department or flag it up at any stage that these 22 survivors were going to get nothing.

What we are asking is that Caranua demonstrates that.  I want to get an indication of the timing of the 378 that have been received since, for example, how many came in during August, September or the following month.  Ms Hynes said earlier that Caranua received an inquiry in the last week or two, so they are still coming in.  We have already established that &euro;8 million is probably significantly more than needed to deal with the outstanding cases.  At the end of the day, we do not want to find that there are, as the case may be, 200 requests on file for funding from people who were abused, and because their application came in after Wednesday, 2 August, decades after they were abused, they were told they were a day late, a week late or a month late.  That would be a travesty when the process is over.  We have had many difficulties with Caranua.  We do not want a situation where there are 200 people we can do nothing for.  It is an issue that will not go away.  While it will probably be for the Department to take up, long before the wind-up we need an assessment or report from Caranua in regard to the cases where it has been notified, and also an estimate based on its experience as to how much it will cost to settle those cases.  If it is a question that the Department or somebody has to find perhaps another &euro;5 million, &euro;2 million, &euro;6 million or &euro;8 million, or perhaps no money, in the context that not just 22 cases but 378 cases have come in late, we cannot leave several hundred people out there.</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, we do not want to be saying to a person, "You can apply for X, Y and Z", if we know we cannot meet that.  It is about ensuring we are not going to a person and asking them to go to the trouble of getting quotes and doing all this work that we require to meet our audit requirements, and then coming back to them to say we have no money.

It is not good enough that year after year we have to deal with issues of compliance with public procurement rules and failures of bodies to present accounts.  If a body is receiving taxpayers' money and, having carried out his work very diligently, the Comptroller and Auditor General publishes a report identifying weaknesses in governance, and if the organisation, in its own set of internal control statements, sets out that it will take steps but fails to do so, it must be held to account.  One of the places where they can be held to account is at this committee.  When, over the course of four years, the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out lapses in controls in the organisation, why did the board and Mr. O'Callaghan, as chair, fail to deal with them?</p></speech>

I have reported to the committee on this before.  Caranua was set up hastily.  The scope of its responsibilities and its remit were not fleshed out or specified in any shape or form.  Events have shown that it did not have enough staff or computer systems.  It had nothing.  There was pressure on us to open for business.  I accept that in 2014, 2015, and 2016, our controls were not up to specification.  We have to accept responsibility for that.  It is not the case that we ignored any of the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We did the best we could.  Our approach is that we have to be very flexible with survivors.

At the start of this response, Mr. O'Callaghan stated that the weaknesses lay in the way in which the organisation was set up.  That may well be the case.  It may well be the case that it was not staffed properly and that it was set up hastily, but the reality is that it was set up and was in place and, over the course of four years, failures in controls were identified but not dealt with.  Notwithstanding the failures in how it was set up, Mr. O'Callaghan has said that the board was not ignoring the Comptroller and Auditor General's opinions, but it certainly did nothing to correct the issues he identified.

Where we have challenges is the number of survivors with which we are working and the difficulties they have meeting that criteria, complying with those quotations and getting three quotes.  There are a number of instances where we have made a decision that we will accept fewer quotes than we have set out in our criteria in order to facilitate that survivor availing of the service.  This is constant challenge that we encounter each year.</p> <p>  We have constant challenges between trying to work with survivors to ensure they can avail of the services with as little difficulty as possible.  It is very difficult.  We are asking survivors to meet the audit recommendations, to go to three different shops to get three different quotes and come back to Caranua.  They might then be told that the quotation is not correct and they need to go again.  We will hold our hands up, I completely get-----</p></speech>

I am saying that, in process terms, the percentage of cases for which evidence was unavailable was not 5%, 10%, or 20%, it was 56%, 50% and 55%.  That brings me to the point that Deputy Munster was making.  There are a number of survivors who may get nothing.</p> <p>  I come to those 22 survivors who applied outside the statutory timeframes, and I accept that, but that said, these are people who were the victims of abuse.  They got around to applying outside the statutory timeframes.  Mr. O'Callaghan talked about weaknesses when the fund was set up in the first place.  When we previously looked at this, there were issues on how the first tranche of money was spent.  Perhaps mistakes were made in how that money was spent because a small number of survivors got money very quickly meaning that the pot of money available for others may not have been what it should have been.  There were issues about that.</p> <p>  There have also been issues about lapses of controls in many areas, including the 56%, 50% and 55% to which the Comptroller and Auditor General referred.  We are now left in a situation where there are some people who may not get any compensation whatsoever.</p> <p>  Can I come back to these 22 people?  Mr. O'Callaghan said that Caranua will be reviewing all of these cases.  Can he tell me what that means?</p></speech>

Caranua talks about their survivors, but they are all of our survivors.</p><p>We have a role here as does the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Weaknesses in controls can have consequences.  That is why we pay particular attention to these.  I do not want to duplicate what Deputy Cullinane has gone through on the level of the sample and the numbers which have been repeated over several years.  However, take the consequences of not clarifying if a tenancy is a secure one.  For example, we could be spending money assisting some vulnerable people but they may get a short duration out of that benefit.  Take the list of the housing supports in the briefing note.  Many of them are fixed such as the replacement of windows and doors, carpets, floor coverings, heating systems, roof repair and so forth.  Some of them such as white goods, wheelchair and walking aids would be transferable.</p><p> Has Caranua experience of where a tenancy has not survived long after a payment has been made?</p></speech>

We did not have enough staff to deal with the number of applications that came in at the beginning, and unfortunately that legacy carried on over a number of years.  It took us six years to get on top of that.  While we have always done outreach, we can now invite survivors into our offices, so we have done much face-to-face and focused outreach work over the past 18 months.  That work has been invaluable and has also helped us develop relationships with survivors.</p></speech>

A big part of our remit is empowering survivors to make their own decisions and choices.  That does not always lend itself easily to working with a public body due to the fiduciary responsibilities and auditing requirements we come under.  We need to balance that.  It has taken us a while to get to that stage, though we are getting there.  We try to put the survivor first, and that is something on which we have really focused.</p></speech>

Caranua's opening statement drew attention to survivors who required additional support managing their application as well as survivors who had received limited or no funding supports.  It seems obvious that there was always going to be a cohort within this group-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-17a.832" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rachel Downes" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019101700002#Z01400"><p>The challenge is identifying who is in that cohort at the beginning.  When opening up a scheme such as this one, survivors who can manage their own applications are probably the first people to contact us.  It has taken some time to identify the people who need additional supports.  Sometimes they are identified by other survivors.  As we build relationships with them, they might inform us that they have a sibling or friend or know someone else who needs support.  It is only through those relationships that we find out about people who need additional supports from us.</p></speech>

The people who are able to come forward will do so.  By definition, one would want to look at the people within the group who did not come forward.</p></speech>

When Caranua opened, it received nearly 2,000 applications in the first two or three months, but only four application advisers were sanctioned.  The numbers were so overwhelming in the beginning that all they could focus on were the applications and ensuring that payments and funding supports were made.  As we have developed, we have been able to take a breath every so often and see what is or is not working and what we need to change.  In one way, it is a shame that we are only progressing, developing and putting improved practices in place as we are winding down.</p></speech>

That is a criticisable failure.  I accept that there were staffing issues, that it was chaotic and that large numbers of applications and expectations had to be dealt with.  However, Caranua should have anticipated that this was a very vulnerable group.  We deal with people coming through our door all the time and one has to work harder with some groups if there are literacy issues, where they might need help filling in application forms, and so on.  They require more time but one should anticipate that.  It appears that the people who were more able to engage with Caranua, such as those who had done better in life and perhaps bought a house, as opposed to those in a more precarious position, did better out of the fund at the beginning.  That concerns me.</p></speech>

From the questioning here today I believe that it seems to have been a basket case from the genesis of it.  It did not have the staffing complement.  It has come to the fore that Caranua had not recognised the complexities of the people who would be coming to it.  As Deputy Murphy has clearly outlined, Caranua appears to have been shocked that those who were most able seem to have been able to access the fund most in the initial period.  I believe this to be completely at odds with Caranua's job in the first place.  These people, who are our people and a legacy of what has happened in Ireland, are all of our responsibility.  I am very disappointed that the system set up for people to engage has not been fair from the outset.  Does Ms Downes feel this is a fair charge today?</p></speech>

In her opening statement Ms Downes referred to "well-being".  I do not like words like "well-being" because they are not scientific enough for me.  Looking at Caranua's spend, there is a section on the sample of services provided in health supports.  With regard to evaluating who Caranua is getting, for example counselling is the first item that struck me.  When counselling is paid for from the fund, does Caranua question if it is a qualified person or is it wherever the client wants to go?  I just want a "yes" or "no" response because I want to get through this.</p></speech>

Was there someone who may not have had not the loudest voice who perhaps needed home nursing, immunisation or something else that was essential?  Were people getting money for massages when others were not getting money for a wheelchair, for example?  How can we be spending money?  I am aware there is value to massage but it is hard to quantify.  There are other items such as reflexology, acupuncture, chiropractic, osteopathy and pain management, which I find a bit strange considering there is prescription medication.  Is this a person coming in with a receipt for Solpadeine or something?  I am just wondering-----</p></speech>

When we were doing outreach in the UK more than 12 months ago, we identified survivors who had zero to &euro;5,000 of funding.  We contacted them and found that 50% wanted to meet us and there was a cohort of approximately 20% who did not want to engage with the service for whatever reason.  That was a respectful decision after we assessed the reason.  We will always explore with what we have on hand but as Ms Downes said, the legislation prevents us contacting people directly.</p></speech>

Caranua is not invoiced for the work because it deals with the survivor and not with the contractor employed by the survivor.  Caranua cannot get an invoice made out to it under any circumstances.  It does not come to Caranua but it goes through the survivor.  The obvious question is, where these stage payments have been made, how does Caranua know the work was ever done?  To put it bluntly, we live in the real world just like the witnesses.  If I ask for a quote for &euro;10,000, I can say I will take a cheque for &euro;5,000 and I will give the other person a cheque for &euro;5,000 and we are all happy.  That happens.  The second thing that happens is that I receive a quote for &euro;10,000, the job is done for &euro;5000 and we split a difference.</p></speech>

We understand the need to protect the anonymity of the survivors who were allowed to commission the work themselves.  I am not saying anything went wrong but we cannot be sure of that.  There is a question mark there.</p> <p>  From Caranua's contacts, it knew of the genuine cases.  All these people had been through the other redress schemes to start with.  Caranua would be aware of the bona fides of the people it is dealing with.  This gives a level of comfort as to whom one is dealing with, even though it is not a verifiable assurance.

The lessons that are supposed to be learned from that will apply to redress schemes in the future.  It could be argued that Caranua was not a redress scheme.  A recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General was that the Department would carry out a <i>post hoc</i>evaluation of the redress scheme, which we are in the process of finalising.  In doing that, we look back at the original estimates of the cost of redress and the actual projections of how many people would be involved.  We expect to have this finalised shortly.</p></speech>

There are accountability arrangements, since there have been serious deficits over the past years.  The third is expenditure forecasting methodology, which had serious flaws.  In 2016, three years after the scheme was ostensibly set up, criteria were brought in for a cut-off point.  The fourth point is effectiveness in meeting intended objectives and outcomes.  Those are not just points for one specific scheme but learning points.</p></speech>

Caranua opened its doors for business in 2014.  Caranua attempted to look at the projected number of people who would avail of it.  It carried out an actuarial study of the number of survivors estimated to be around at the time.  When Caranua saw where moneys were being spent it took corrective action.  It was accountable under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies from 2009 and, after that, the 2016 version.  There was accountability for Caranua all along.</p></speech>

There would have been some natural loss through deaths and people being ill and not coming forward, but Caranua knew the numbers it was facing.  It did not, however, rise to that expectation and ask itself how it would cope with the finite sum of &euro;110 million.  It did not ask what its plan would be or how it would do it in a fair, just and equitable way.  Mr. O'Callaghan may say I am wrong, but if it did act in the right way, it certainly is not jumping out at me from the documentation.</p></speech>

As the representatives of Caranua said, it was already up and running at that point.  Perhaps I was coming too late with those points.  They were there in 2002 or 2003, as was the underestimation of the payments that would be made, the number of beneficiaries and so on.

People can sometimes dip in and out of the process because it may be difficult in terms of the previous trauma that they have experienced.  Given the purpose of the organisation, they may feel that it brings up many issues.  Other reasons include that survivors may have been in and out of other institutions, hospitals and prisons and personal reasons, such as family, a death in the family and so on.</p></speech>

In regard to the winding up process, how does Caranua propose to deal with these cases?  What approach will it take to these intermittent contacts?  Will they be a matter for the Department?  The legislation refers to the tying up of outstanding assets and liabilities that might arise from the work of Caranua.  Who will estimate that?  Will it be taken on by the Department?</p></speech>

We will attempt numerous times to contact those survivors that may be having difficulties or may be on low funds with a view to organising outreach.  For example, we recently engaged in prison outreach because when we reviewed cases at the start of the year we identified 51 survivors who were in prison on low funding.</p></speech>

It has been said that of the 317 outstanding cases, 95% or thereabouts are first-time applicants.  Caranua has made payments to about approximately 6,000 people.  I see in the annual report how Caranua has made payments of &euro;11,500 to survivors to date.  This means that on average, 6,000 people got two payments.  Obviously, some got one payment while others got three or four.  Could the witnesses explain these figures?</p></speech>

Ms Downes understands that figure but nobody other than whoever wrote that could get that impression from that.  When I see &euro;11,500 under payments made to survivors, I would assume that there are 11,000 different cases but they might have all been a series of stage payments.  That figure does not mean what I thought it meant.  That is fine.</p> <p>  Caranua will give us some information on oldest cases - just numbers - because we would hate to see people being told the scheme is now closed and they should have come back earlier.

At the end of the day, the Department will take over liability for all those pensions when Caranua is gone.  Will a figure be put on that in this wind up or will it just get paid when people retire, as is the case with the rest of the public service?  Will a figure for that liability be taken into the Department or will it just be taken and paid as it goes, as is the current system?  How is this being done because the heads of a Bill have been produced?  This issue must have been addressed.  It stands out in the accounts.  Pensions will be absorbed by the Department.</p></speech>

With regard to my next point, it will not necessarily affect the 2018 accounts because Caranua is in existence for 2019 but when we come to the 2019 accounts, knowing that it will be wound up within six months of year end, it cannot possibly prepare them on the basis of a going concern because it will not be a going concern for the following year.  The accounts being prepared by Caranua in two months' time for the end of this calendar year cannot be prepared on the basis of Caranua being a going concern.</p></speech>

These are just small points.</p> <p>  My next two points are more for the Department of Education and Skills.  From what I have heard here as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Caranua was set up without adequate resources and an adequate estimate of what was involved and as soon as it was established, it was snowed under with regard to the number of staff processing applications never mind doing the work it would have liked to have done and with which it is probably dealing.  Who in the Department of Education and Skills advised on what was necessary to set up this organisation?  I have been critical of the Department.  Whoever did it failed to properly estimate the work rate as evidenced by everything we have seen with Caranua.  It has been said year after year when Caranua has been in front of the committee that it is snowed under.  The matter is broader than the Department of Education and Skills.  The Committee of Public Accounts found the same thing in another Department that set up the Tax Appeals Commission.  It did not set it up.  We have seen how when setting up new agencies, Departments get it woefully wrong in terms of estimating the work, staffing, resources and workload.  I have cited two examples.  There is a lesson for the public service, which is why we are the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am not just directing it at the Department of Education and Skills.  I am sure that if I worked my way through some other new agencies that were set up in recent years, it might be the same.  I do not want to personalise it but Departments consistently undersell and underestimate the problem.  It is probably easier to convince us in the Oireachtas and Ministers that something is a small thing and that it will be easy to get it through and will not require much funds.  If they got a fuller picture, we might have been better off and Caranua might have been better resourced from day one and might have provided a better service.  The fact that it did not get adequate resources was not its fault.  I put it back to the parent Department, although it is not unique to that Department.  Other Departments make this mistake.  It is systemic.  We saw it this morning with a different item about a post-project review relating to a cinema in Galway that involved the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Again, mistakes were made involving overruns and underestimating.  They talked about training within the section within the Department.  This happens across the board in the public service.  We need learning across the board instead of pigeonholing it and putting into the particular box where the problem arose.  Some Department will set up some other new agency next year or the following year and I advise it to look at the mistakes that other Departments have made in setting up new agencies.  Sitting here for the past three years, I see no evidence yet of an organisation being set up properly.  Perhaps I am being a bit severe.  It is not directed at the witnesses.  It is across the board.  This is what the Committee of Public Accounts must take on board.  We would say Caranua was financially handicapped from the beginning.  </p></speech>

It would be remiss of me not to put this on the public record.  As Chairman of this committee, I point out that we have been on this case with the Department for the last couple of years.  This issue has been going on for 17 years at this stage and there appeared to be a lack of drive in terms of getting it over the line, but we have seen a considerable effort being made in the past year or two.  We have been getting quarterly reports on it.  In case the people watching are wondering if it all vanished into thin air, I want to put this information on the record and would ask the witnesses to comment.  I will read from the aforementioned letter because it is important for the public to see that the Department has been following this well.</p> <p>  Properties are being transferred in respect of the 2002 indemnity agreement, as are those offered voluntarily by congregations under the 2009 agreement.  Since the last quarterly report, a number of transfers have been completed.  The former primary school at Westport in County Mayo has been completely transferred, and the transfer of St. Anne's, Lenaboy, in Galway, and of lands at Cahir, County Tipperary, have also been completed.  Three properties have yet to be dealt with and are referred to in this report.  One is at Ballyjamesduff involving the Sisters of Saint Clare.  The note on this says that the Chief State Solicitor's office is awaiting closing documents from the congregation's solicitor prior to the transfer being in a position to be completed.  Communication is ongoing between both solicitors and transfer is expected to be completed shortly.  That transfer is earmarked for the end of this year and it is hoped it will be included in the report early next year.  Do the witnesses want to add anything to that?</p></speech>

We are talking about the title.  The Sacred Heart property in Waterford is also in use.  The issue is that it was never registered previously.  The certificate of title is expected to be received shortly from the Property Registration Authority to enable the transfer to be completed.  That is progress and we are pleased about that.  The Department is also pleased with the progress.  Maybe it is not the job of this committee to keep after this but we are getting there and that must be acknowledged.</p> <p>  On the 2009 agreement and the National Rehabilitation Hospital lands in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, ministerial consent will be sought shortly and then the consent of the Charities Regulator.  Regarding the Blaith&iacute;n childcare facility, Gracepark, Drumcondra, on receipt of the Minister's consent, regulatory authority will then be sought from the Charities Regulator and the estimated timeframe for completion is the end of the year.  I ask the witnesses to explain what ministerial consent means and what happens after the Minister gives consent.</p></speech>

Once that consent is forthcoming, it goes to back to the solicitors who send it to the Charities Regulator.  The 2012 Act allows the regulator to approve transfers.  The regulator does not need to conduct any investigations, so that clears the way for the charity, in this instance the congregation, to complete the transfer.  After that, it just goes through the last-minute closing process in terms of the provision of documents and whatever else is needed.</p></speech>

These contributions, plus added and accrued interest of &euro;1.382 million, have been received by the Department and placed in an investment account established under the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.

One property is in my area and I suspect there were issues around title deeds, which meant the transfer could not be done.</p></speech>

In each case we got cash to the value of the properties but we can confirm all of that for the committee in writing.</p></speech>

That went into meeting awards of the redress board.  That was nothing to do with Caranua.</p></speech>

I ask the Department in its next report to include a note on the cash taken in lieu of property just to complete the circle.  They probably dropped off the list because they went for cash but we would like to complete the picture.  I wish the Department the very best in completing that work.  It will be good to get to the end of that particular road as soon as possible.  These matters often take longer than they should but that is life.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses from Caranua and the Department of Education and Skills for their attendance.  I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for being here today.  The clerk to the committee will follow up on any information requested and carry out any agreed actions arising from today's meeting.</p> <p>  At our next meeting we will discuss the 2018 appropriation accounts with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Chapter 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2018 report on forestry grants.</p></speech>
