We will start with recommendation 16 in respect of chapter 6.  There is an amendment put forward by Deputy Dooley.  There is an amendment to the amendment, on which we propose to vote.

I propose one amendment to it, which I hope will be acceptable.  This is in relation to the response to the Citizens' Assembly recommendation that the level of carbon taxation should be increased.  My proposed amendment is that we accept the expert advice in favour of this measure from the Climate Change Advisory Council for a carbon price trajectory that rises to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030, and that this should be supported by legislation in 2019.</p></speech>

I will bring in Deputy Dooley.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032700002#M00400"><p>I am not accepting the amendment as proposed.  I set out a very clear amendment aimed very specifically at assuring the public about how the Government might respond to the collection of a carbon tax.  From my point of view, I have supported a carbon tax and I acknowledge, accept and appreciate the advice that was given at the Citizens' Assembly and, indeed, that of the Climate Change Advisory Council.  In conjunction with setting out the trajectory and the numerics, it is important to set out information for the people who will be most affected by the increases in carbon tax, which I and my party accept fully are a necessary component to assist in the behavioural change to wean this society off fossil fuels.  What we do not accept is for the committee to decide on this now without assisting the information deficit among the public and of people who will recognise the impact of an increase on them, particularly on those in the category of fuel poverty who will not be in a position to do a deep retrofit or insulate their home.  All this amendment presents them with is a tax and a charge but they are not being given any significant outline of what it is that the Government intends to do, or what we are suggesting from a committee perspective, to assist them in meeting those increased charges.  It is important that we do this in step and in parallel and I am not prepared to accept the amendment until such time as the work is done in setting out in a very clear and concise way how we are going to assist people in making that transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>I accept that it is happening and I support the principles but it is not good enough to just talk about a tax on the one hand while on the other hand not to talk in any meaningful way about the capacity to assist people, particularly those experiencing fuel poverty, to whom I referred, and those who are struggling to pay their mortgages and their rent.  We must set out in a very clear way how we will assist them in the transition away from fossil fuels.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032700002#N00200"><p>We need to be careful about what this amendment is about.  It is about multiplying by four the carbon tax that we have at the moment, from &euro;20 per tonne, which brought in about &euro;450 million in the past year, to &euro;80 per tonne.  This is happening without any consideration for the impact it will have on low and middle income households or, indeed, on businesses and on rural dwellers, in particular.  What we are doing here if we go ahead with this amendment is that we are simply loading on another layer of tax on top of citizens who are already under serious pressure with mortgages and all the other increases in charges that they have as well.  We are doing it without any firm international evidence that can show that this has worked.  We are also doing it without having the alternatives available for citizens to make the transition.  We want citizens to make the transition to more eco-friendly living in using public transport and electric vehicles.  We do not even have the network for charging electric vehicles and there is an affordability issue with them.  There is the issue of public transport, which, outside the M50, does not exist in most of the country.  The poorest and the lowest income households in this State are those that most need retrofitting.  On microgeneration, I have a Bill sitting on Committee Stage that needs to be progressed to allow citizens, small businesses and householders to generate electricity.  We are doing it at a time when we have not made a switch in how we generate our power.  If we are going to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, we are talking about the electrification of our heating systems and of large parts of our transport systems and we have not made any changes in how we generate that power, except to continue to do so mainly from fossil fuels.  Our party has put forward proposals on that to move to 80% renewables by 2030.  For those reasons, we will be opposing this amendment.</p></speech>

I know this is an important issue but we must do that to try to be fair to members.  I will let them know when their two minutes are up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032700002#N00400"><p>All committee members are very conscious of the need to ensure that there are mechanisms put in place which reflect the views of the Citizens' Assembly in respect of fuel poverty.  While, by and large, there is a recognition of the &euro;80 per tonne by 2030, which was set out by Professor FitzGerald and others, there is also a need for actions built into the recommendations of this committee to ensure there are plans to ensure that funding is put in place to protect those people who are in fuel impoverished households and, in particular, those who are on low incomes.  We are all very mindful of that.</p> <p>  I seek clarification from the Chairman on what is actually before us as an amendment.  As I understand it, we are to divide on one element of the recommendation, namely, the word "accepts" versus "agrees."  In other words, we either accept the expert advice in favour of this measure from the CCAC for a carbon price trajectory that rises to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030 and that this should be supported in legislation by 2019.  The rest of the wording of that paragraph speaks to the issues here in supporting Citizens' Assembly, recognising the negative impacts for people who are on lower incomes and so on, accepts the international consensus around the need for behavioural change and increased investment towards mitigation and away from fossil fuels and agrees that carbon pricing should be ring-fenced.  The clarification I am seeking is on whether we are dividing on the issue of whether we accept the 2030 target, as set out by an independent body outside of this House, or whether we can find a mechanism to recognise that target and not divide the committee.  There may be a compromise.  Instead of using the word "accepts" for the expert advice, perhaps we could say that we "recognise" the expert advice of the CCAC for a carbon price trajectory.  Therefore, we would be acknowledging the outside expertise on this issue and we would be obviating the need to divide the committee on the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032700002#N00500"><p>I want to clarify the amendment to the amendment that Deputy Corcoran Kennedy has put forward.  The difference in language to Deputy Dooley's amendment is that in response to the Citizens' Assembly recommendation that the level of carbon taxation should be increased,  the committee accepts the expert advice in favour of this measure from the Climate Change Advisory Council for a carbon price trajectory that rises to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030 and this should be supported by legislation in 2019.  The difference between Deputy Corcoran Kennedy's amendment and Deputy Dooley's is that it is saying the committee "accepts" the expert advice and it also names the price of carbon by the year 2030 which is at &euro;80 per tonne and states that would be supported by legislation.  Those are the three key points, namely, that: it accepts the advice rather than acknowledges it; that the carbon price would be set at &euro;80 per tonne by the year 2030, which is in 11 years' time; and that this should be supported by legislation in 2019.  They are the differences.  I accept the point that Deputy Dooley has really built around the support mechanisms in the rest of the amendment but they are the differences.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1268" speakername="Pat Deering" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032700002#N00600"><p>This is an important stage of the proceedings.  It is important that the committee starts to take responsibility.  We have been here since last July, we have engaged quite constructively over recent weeks and months and the engagement has been particularly intense in recent weeks.  It is about taking responsibility now.  The time for talk is over.  We have all engaged with those in our constituencies and at local and national levels, particularly with children and students in recent weeks.  They want us to take action and they expect us to take action on this.  While it is easy for some of us to say we will do this, that and the other in the media and elsewhere, now is the time for action.  It is important that we have a figure on what the trajectory will be.  If we do not have that figure, there we will never be able to achieve anything.</p> <p>  It is also important that we need to be able to carry out these measures over the next number of years, be it retrofitting houses or whatever.  We are playing catch up in this regard.  There is a great cost to this and somebody has to pay for it.  We have been down the road with different issues in the past where expenses were involved and members of other committees did not take responsibility.  We will see the end result of that over the next period of time because of certain members who spoke quite loudly and were prepared to bully members into making decisions and frighten members in respect of different decisions but now is the time that we stand up and take responsibility for our actions.  We have been here long enough and it is time we did that.  The amendment to the amendment that Deputy Corcoran Kennedy has proposed is quite straightforward.  It is saying that we need this trajectory and to have the figure underpinned by legislation this year, which is very important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1386" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032700002#N00700"><p>I support the amendment proposed by Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.  It is an important amendment.  In many ways it sets out what we have been looking for over the past nine months.  We have spent nine months debating, going through issues and having Secretaries General before us.  The general public needs to have clarity on what we are proposing when it comes to the carbon tax issue.  The carbon tax issue has been one of the key issues we have been discussing since we came here.</p><p>We just had amendments and now we have an amendment to an amendment.  We are trying to get clarity for communities and society on what we will do on carbon tax for the next 11 years.  It is a fair and balanced amendment and there is genuine support for it in society.  If one looks at the protests in the past few weeks, young people will not thank us if we do not take hard decisions.  They will not thank politicians in Leinster House who want to fudge this issue.  We need to take responsibility and move forward.  Today is an important day, on which we must set the price of carbon for the next 11 years.  If we do not do so, society will not thank us for engaging in shady politics and being afraid to take hard decisions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032700002#O00200"><p>There are a number of different aspects to this.  The words of the proposed amendment appear innocuous enough when looked at in black and white and one could say the amendment is acceptable.  However, we also have to consider how little the Government has done in recent years.  There has been no clarity on what it will do about the carbon price, which stands at &euro;20 per tonne.  My problem is that I do not trust this Government and would not trust any other Government enough to give it <i>carte blanche </i>to increase the carbon price to &euro;80 per tonne immediately.  It is vital that we retain ownership of the figure of &euro;80 per tonne and tie it in specifically to measures that will help those who cannot afford to meet the requirements imposed by climate change.  My problem with the proposal is that we cannot give a blank cheque to any Government.  For this reason, I will not support it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1237" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032700002#O00300"><p>Since the committee was established in July last, all of the sessions with witnesses have been in public session.  Since January, we have been meeting in private session to try to achieve cross-party political consensus and produce a powerful all-party report.</p> <p>  The children who went on strike from schools and marched on the D&aacute;il and in my constituency were saying we need action.  I explained to them that this committee is important because when members reach an agreement across party lines it carries considerable weight and gives the Minister of the day significant power to act upon its recommendations.  It is easy to get consumed by the knowledge that the Minister is from the Fine Gael Party but we could have a Fianna F&aacute;il, Labour Party or Sinn F&eacute;in Minister dealing with these issues tomorrow.  I guarantee that we will have Ministers from other parties before 2030.  That is the nature of politics.  If we look back 11 years, Ministers have changed and they will change again in the future.  We should not become fixated on who is in government and whether people trust it.  The issue is this committee, as an all-party group, agreeing what is the best way forward.  That gives us considerable power and we should not underestimate that.</p> <p>  It is disappointing that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party amendment proposes to acknowledge rather than accept the need for increases in the carbon tax.  Deputy Dooley states he wants an increase in carbon tax but his party, in this amendment, is watering down the wording of the recommendation by using the word "acknowledge" rather than "agree".  This removes the proposed trajectory for the carbon tax increase, which would give absolute certainty to individuals and businesses and give them a roadmap showing how we would reach a figure of &euro;80 per tonne by 2030.</p> <p>  A key point to remember is that this is not a revenue-raising tax but a means of achieving behavioural change.  If we remove the trajectory and tell people where this carbon charge will go, we will not achieve the crucial change in behaviour we are trying to bring about.  It will be a fudge and the other positive elements of the report will get lost because the headline will be that the committee was not brave enough to set out a trajectory for carbon tax.</p> <p>  I do not have a problem with ring-fencing revenue generated from increases in the carbon tax.  We should discuss how such ring-fenced money could be spent but I question the view that we can dictate now how everything will be spent when we do not know what will be the spending plans of Governments of whatever parties in 2026 or 2027.  That is where consultation is key.  Fine Gael has been passionate about getting buy-in on carbon pricing.  In the next two or three months, we intend having engagement, which will be led by the Department and involve town hall meetings being held across the length and breadth of the country.  Every Tidy Towns group, local executive of the IFA or ICMSA and all other sectors of society impacted by this would have their say on how best to use an increase in the revenue raised to achieve behavioural change.  That is what we need to do.  Removing the proposed trajectory for increases to the carbon tax would weaken and water down the report and would be a retrograde step in the context of all the work we have done since July last.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032700002#O00400"><p>If members of the public are confused about the reason the discussion has started on this issue and the way we are discussing it, I do not blame them because I am also confused.  What is happening is similar to Henry Ford's statement that one can have any colour of car as long as it is black.  That is what is being said to us in different ways here about carbon tax by both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Nobody should be fooled by this dancing on a pin about words such as "accept", "acknowledge", "believe" or anything else.  This is about implementing a carbon tax on ordinary people that will rise fourfold in the next ten years without taking into consideration the circumstances in which they live.  People living miles away from their workplace are forced to drive into work because we have poor public transport services.  Others live in substandard accommodation that is damp, does not have double-glazing, has doors that do not fit or where there is no retrofitting and the occupant cannot afford to lag the attic.  This goes on all over this country.  I have an amendment proposing that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il look at the fuel poverty in which people live before they even consider having this discussion.  It is disingenuous and disrespectful of the Citizens' Assembly to say to the public that we must sort out this before we sort anything else out.  It is unbelievable.  Even the Taoiseach said to Deputy McDonald that carbon tax is only one measure in a suite of measures.  Now we are making it the only measure because if we do not get this through, the whole strategy collapses.</p></speech>

The committee is evading the real issues that will deal in a radical manner with the issues that schoolchildren, some of whom are here in the Gallery today, were protesting about.  They took strike action to tell the Government to keep fossil fuels in the ground, yet Fine Gael, including the chairperson, have manipulated the system to block a Bill that would have kept them in the ground. </p></speech>

As members will be aware, we were to report as a cross-party committee at the end of January.  We sought a further extension in order to deliberate.  We have been working on this issue of climate action for the past seven months and, as we all know, we are under time pressure.  The clock is ticking on how we deal with climate change.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, is waiting on our cross-party report to feed in to his whole-of-Government plan.  The reason we opened in public session on this issue was that we were to go into public session today and tomorrow and have a report published tomorrow.  There was one issue that came up at very late notice last night and again this morning which created an obstacle.  We had to overcome that stumbling block if we were to publish tomorrow.  That is why we opened on this particular amendment to the amendment, as I explained earlier.  I am giving all members an opportunity to give their views on this particular stumbling block.</p> <p>  I acknowledge and compliment members on the many hours of work that were done in private session.  We have worked collaboratively.  We are on the same page on more issues than not.  As Deputy Smith said, this is only one small part of the overall solution to tackling climate change.</p><p>Whether the Deputy agrees or not is a separate issue and she has made her views on that very clear.  We have done an awful lot of work.  We have more than 40 recommendations in the report and the price of carbon is just one small part of it.  This is why I felt we needed to go into public session to get this started.  Then we will go back to chapter 1 and start working our way through the whole of the report in order that we can report to the Oireachtas.  What we have done over the past seven months has been very ambitious.  It is a transformational piece of work that can feed into not just this Government but future Governments.  On this, I want to move to our next-----</p></speech>

It almost seems inevitable that the issue of carbon taxation dominates.  Certainly it is the first question that is always asked and then one does not get onto the wider work.  It is important that we do so.  I support the amendment because I want to keep that certainty in the ten-year period in order that we can start concentrating on the matters on which we really need to concentrate and on the big ticket items we need to get right.  The committee has done really good work on setting a higher renewables target of 70%.  The Government has responded to this and it was not going to do that at all.  What we have said about needing a national land use plan is significant and important in terms of helping with the revised Common Agricultural Policy and a completely different future for Irish forestry and farming.</p> <p>  We must consider the scale of the change we need to make.  We are all in favour of retrofit but we should recognise that the national development plan, which will have to change, states that by 2021 we will be deep retrofitting 45,000 houses to a B rating or higher.  Last year we did 220.  How will we go from 220 to 45,000 in two years?  We do not have the workers or the financing mechanism set up.  There are so many things we must do and it requires the political system.  As we will not put the blame or guilt on the individual, it is up to us in the political system to work together collectively to make this transition.  Irish people will be, can be and want to be good at it.</p> <p>  Carbon tax will not be the key measure but it will help.  We heard research from UCD environmental policy masters students who are reviewing the literature that it will depend on what level it is set at but it could achieve 5%, 10% or 15% of the job.  The analysis we got from the ESRI is that if we use the fee and dividend model, it would give an emissions reduction of approximately 17% by 2030.  This is not exact but they are our best independent scientific experts who have applied their best independent thinking to come up with this figure.  It could be lower or higher but it is not insignificant.  It would help a country facing fines of &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million a year.  The Irish public would really find us guilty if instead of going into social welfare, housing, health and education, money was going out of the country because we failed to take the type of action we need to take.</p> <p>  Deputy Dooley made a good point yesterday but he was reiterating the point we have all been making throughout the process, which is that if we are going to do anything on carbon tax, we have to make sure we do everything we can to protect those on lower incomes.  There are different views as to how we could and should to that.  My understanding is we have all pretty much agreed that we need to spend the next four or five months working out with the Government the best way of doing this.  We need to do this because by the end of this year, we as a country need to go to the European Union and agree a plan that is real and justiciable, in the sense the European Union will hold us to account on it.</p> <p>  The wording here is "acceptable", in that the word "accepts" is not as strong as the word "agree" that we had earlier but it accepts the expert advice.  It accepts what we heard from the Climate Change Advisory Council, which is our best independent adviser on the issue, on what we need to do.  We are saying we will do it gradually.  We will need to do a whole body of other work after that.  I will be honest and say we will not get it all done in the next six months and we will probably not even get it done in six years.  This will be a two or three-decade project of massive ambition, transformation and transition for our country that, first and foremost, has to be a just transition.</p> <p>  I would love to have a debate such as the one we are having on that just transition, forestry and transport.  My God, we need to talk about transport.  We are still heading completely in the wrong direction.  Our entire transport plan has to change.  A carbon tax will not do this; it will require political decisions of the Government to make it happen.  However, we can start concentrating on it when we get over this issue that is dominating.  It is the only issue ever discussed.  Agreeing the amendment will not provide certainty because we are not agreeing the budget here but it will give a political signal and allow us to concentrate on what we need to concentrate on, which is how we protect those on lower incomes, transform our transport system, tap into the energy potential we have as a country and retrofit our homes.  These will not be easy but they are doable.  However, they will not be doable if we just break down on this issue at the very start.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith that it should not have been given such prominence.  It should not be first up.  Unfortunately, that is the nature of the politics and how it is played out.  We should not divide on it.  Even if we divide in a vote we should not lose what has been good on this committee, which is the collective approach.</p></speech>

Deputy Deering and others spoke about taking responsibility.  Many people have stated we need to take responsibility and accountability but the committee has done so.  We are coming to the endgame now and we are thrashing out what we believe and agree on.  We agree the youth movement, whom I invited before the committee, made a fantastic presentation.  The youth movement throughout the country, and not only those who were on strike, are very vocal not only on this issue but also on social justice.  They stated they went on strike for the environment and to give the legislators a kick in the ass to do something.  They also stated that in no way should the poorest in our country who suffer fuel poverty be landed with the tax or whatever it will be called, and as far as I can see it is a carbon tax.</p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan said we will not put blame or guilt on people or individuals but we will.  We will put blame, guilt and cost on individuals because the simple fact is that while we may have a fee and dividend system, we will expect people to move into a green economy and a green way of living, working and enjoying life without offering an accessible and affordable alternative.  We speak about behavioural change.  In a psychological sense, if people were having therapy they would sit down and go through the need for change and how to do it but they would make sure it was realistic and the change that needed to be done was actually doable.  I do not think we have got to that point with regard to affordability and accessibility and what people will use instead of fossil fuels and diesel cars.  There are electric vehicles but at present they are quite out of the reach of a lot of people.  A carbon tax would be punishment on people already trying to get on with life and to do their best.  We have seen the capacity to change in this country and we are great at it.  We have seen the capacity to have a green environment but not at the cost of pointing the finger at the people who can least afford it.  I cannot support the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032700002#Q00100"><p>I have listened with interest to all concerned and still believe that the text, which I originally set out and which the amendment seeks to change, is adequate.  There is a lot of talk about certainty.  We need absolute certainty for the people who will be impacted by the measures to increase carbon taxation, which I support and agree with.  I have done so at and outside of this committee.  I support and accept the position of the Climate Change Advisory Council in that regard.  It and the language in the report set out the trajectory very clearly.  Fine Gael in particular seems to be clear about wanting absolute certainty on the value of the tax.  It is less clear, however, on providing certainty on how it will be spent, what it will be spent on and whether it will address the real needs and concerns of the people who will be affected to the greatest extent by the taxes increasing over time.</p> <p>  Somebody talked about bravery.  I will take no lecture from anyone in Fine Gael about bravery on climate action.  Fine Gael has been in power for the past eight years and has done absolutely nothing to address climate change.  All of a sudden, we now have a panic attack in this committee and need absolute certainty for everyone concerned.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party introduced the carbon tax, which has resided at &euro;20 per tonne since.  Had Fine Gael shown any regard for an increase in the carbon tax, it could have done so over the last eight budgets.  It could certainly have done so last year with the public campaigns on recognition of addressing climate change, but it sadly failed to do so.  Fine Gael, through its stewardship of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and public transport generally has failed absolutely to address climate change.  This year alone, we are purchasing 110 dirty diesel buses.  It has shown scant regard for people who want to address climate change through feed-in tariffs from their own energy generation within and around their own businesses, whether solar or wind energy.  It has brought forward no proposals whatsoever for planning guidelines to assist with the continued roll-out of onshore wind energy.  No supports have been provided for solar energy for the farming community who might want to use lands that would assist in generating an income and also contribute to the renewables.</p> <p>  Will Fine Gael help me in trying to understand why this newfound interest in climate change is of such magnitude that Fine Gael seeks to undermine what I have already set out in my documents?  The party that I represent has, at all times, both in government and in opposition, taken a really responsible approach to climate change, long before it was fashionable.  We protected the environment through the introduction of the levy on plastic bags, if one wants to go back that far.  It was not exactly welcomed at the time but had phenomenal benefits.  We introduced the carbon tax with the Green Party, at &euro;20 per tonne, where it has resided since.  This additional amendment is unnecessary and I hope that the committee will not support it.</p></speech>

The current Government and past Governments have done very little on this issue, and we are facing hundreds of millions in fines every year because of the lack of Government action.  It is typical that tax is always the first response.  We have to encourage behavioural change but the way to do it is to assist people to bring it about in order that they are enthusiastic about that behavioural change, but not without putting measures in place first.  Other people mentioned our public transport system.  It is on its knees.  It has been starved of investment for years.  There are parts of rural Ireland where people have no other option but to use their car.  Parts of rural Ireland do not have a bus from one end of the week to the other.  That is how bad it is.  Our national rail service, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, is so badly underfunded that there are serious safety issues within it.  Most ordinary people just cannot afford to retrofit their houses.  It is not at the top of their agenda.  Spare money is not sitting there for that.  While a fourfold increase may not affect many people here or the proposers of the amendment or the Government, one has to consider home energy consumption and fuel poverty.  The Government has to accept responsibility for bringing about that change by supporting people, by investment and by making it affordable for ordinary families to make that change.  I will vote against the amendment.</p></speech>

As others, including Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, have said, I would have loved to be able to come in and have public debate in other areas such as about public transport or public procurement.  There is significant potential for this report and this committee to transform the landscape with regard to climate change.  I have some difficulty with this because I understand the distrust and the concerns that have been expressed.  I believe that there are valid questions.  It is, at times, difficult to see the urgency spoken of by Government when action has not been taken in the past.  We hope that the urgency being reflected in this debate is also reflected in support for the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 this week in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  I note the mention of carbon pricing and I believe that carbon has a cost that needs to be recognised.  The cost of carbon is not simply when people are purchasing fuel and the pricing of it.  The cost is also for the damage which has been done to date, which is why I hope this committee will also look at levies on some of the sectors which have driven us to the point that we are at and contributed most to our carbon emissions in the past.  There is also a cost of carbon that needs to be factored into public procurement, so that when we are spending, we think in a holistic way about it.  When we look at the long term, 11 years in the future, knowing what we know about the 12 years remaining to avert catastrophic climate change, the greatest cost of carbon will be from climate change.  The cost of not cutting our carbon usage will be felt by the most vulnerable, not just here in Ireland but around the world.  That is why, even though it is with great difficulty and concern, I need to accept the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council on this issue.</p> <p>  However, I believe that the rest of the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment is much stronger than the original text.  It addresses the balance and the issues of fuel poverty.  I know we are discussing an amendment to an amendment, but one aspect of the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment allows me to support it.  It is that prior to the introduction of any increase in carbon pricing, there must be an examination and specific policy measures brought forward to assist certain people.  Everybody would be given assurance if the Government indicated that the legislation in 2019 will not be brought prior to the specific policy measures mentioned in this text being brought forward.  If that is not the case, I will battle these issues in the legislative space in the Seanad.</p></speech>

I think I have attended most of its meetings.</p><p>Every single person who sat around the table for the past few months is here because he or she cares about what the committee is doing.  Nobody has a monopoly on caring about the country, the environment or anything else.  We were in a period of austerity and while I would have loved to have seen much more progress being made on the environment, that was not possible because we had no money at the time.  Things have changed, however, and the new Government formed in 2016 appointed a Minister with specific responsibility for the environment.  It also established a Citizens' Assembly to specifically examine how we could be leaders in climate action.  This committee was then established to examine the report of the Citizens' Assembly and how we might achieve this goal.</p><p> The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton announced &euro;500 million for the climate action fund earlier this year.  Deputy Stanley stated that the carbon tax raised &euro;150 million.  We want to see much more progress.  I completely accept the point that the carbon tax is just one aspect of a major debate that we must have.  There is much more work to be done and many more things to be talked about.  While I accept the bona fides of members, it is with some disappointment but not a surprise that Deputy Dooley has sought to be so political about this.  I was happy to see his fine video produced at the weekend in which he seemed to be moving in the direction of accepting a carbon tax.  He says he accepts a carbon tax but does not want to put a price on it.  What we are suggesting here is to be realistic and to put a price on it.  We all say we accept it to a degree but there should also be a price on it, which is something we have to do.</p><p> Senator Alice-Mary Higgins made a point that I had intended to make to allay Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's concerns around fuel poverty.  The remainder of the amendment more than adequately covers this.  We are all very concerned about fuel poverty and ensuring that the people who will be impacted most will be supported most.  For this reason, I am glad the fee and dividend approach will be considered and that those in fuel poverty will be protected.  That is accepted and it is also provided for in the amendment.  I appeal to the committee to support our amendment on this because it is the right way forward.</p></speech>

There are four recommendations, regarding the governance structure, to chapter 1, the need for a new national framework.  They read:</p><blockquote>The Committee recommends that a new governance framework be established for delivering on climate action, and in that regard it recommends [a number of suggestions] that:<br /><br />1. New climate change legislation be enacted by the Oireachtas in 2019 that will include, with regard to a new governance structure:a. That action on climate should be considered a priority activity across all of Government;<br /><br />b. the establishment of a new Climate Action Council to supersede the Climate Change Advisory Council;<br /><br />c. The establishment of a Standing Committee of both the Houses of the Oireachtas on Climate Action;And with regard to mitigation targets and performance:d. A target of net zero economy-wide emissions by 2050;<br /><br />e. A provision for a 2030 emissions target, consistent with the emissions reduction pathway to the 2050 target, to be set by 2020 by Statutory Instrument requiring the formal approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas following receipt of advice from the Climate Action Council;<br /><br />f. Provision for five-yearly carbon budgets consistent with the emissions reduction pathway to 2030 and 2050 targets, to be set by Statutory Instrument requiring the formal approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas following receipt of advice from the Climate Action Council;<br /><br />g. A target for the renewable share of electricity generation of at least 70% by 2030; and<br /><br />h. Strengthening the statutory obligation on public bodies to require that they perform their functions in a manner consistent with the 2050 target and interim targets. (See Sections 1.3. and 1.4)Recommendation No. 2 provides:A stronger mandate, expanded secretariat and budget should be given to the Climate Action Council.  That mandate shall include the responsibility for developing and proposing five-yearly carbon budgets.  The legislation should ensure:<blockquote>a. that the board of the Council has a mix and balance of both gender and expertise; and<br /><br />b. the Council be given access to the data and expertise held by Government Departments. </blockquote>Recommendation No. 3 provides:The Standing Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas on Climate Action should:<blockquote>a. hold Ministers and public bodies to account for their climate action performance;<br /><br />b. examine selected public policy proposals for climate implications; and <br /><br />c. Report annually to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the performance of the State in meetings its obligations.</blockquote>Recommendation No. 4 provides:A coherent all of government approach, supported by the Climate Action Implementation Board, should be adopted for the delivery and management of climate actions.  The central co-ordination and performance oversight role should be mandated to the Department of the Taoiseach.</blockquote> <p>That is an outline of the four recommendations, to which there is a Fine Gael amendment proposed.  The Members will note it is on the draft amendment list.  It is amendment No. 6.</p></speech>

We have just been hearing of the costs and of our having to be serious about the cost of carbon and the costs obtaining.  There is a cost associated with transition.  With respect to inserting the words "least cost", in the context of procurement, we know what using the lowest cost approach, rather than a best or a quality approach, resulted in.  Attaching a least cost pathway to climate actions puts cost as a priority.  There is a problem with that phase and I certainly will oppose its inclusion.</p></speech>

Procurement regarding this issue is not an issue in itself.  This is about ensuring we use an economy of measures that will be less costly, if we can provide for that, to ensure we get to where we want to get.  We are not trying to move away from it.  We have proved that in the previous debate.  We are trying to ensure we get to where we want to get but there must be a proactive measure in place that the least cost pathway is better for our society, people and the economy.</p></speech>

What we want from Fine Gael is absolute certainty in terms of the cost that will be imposed on the citizens, but when it comes to measures appropriate to assisting people in addressing climate change from their own perspective or within the curtilage of their own home, Fine Gael is very clear that, from a Government perspective, it wants to do it at least cost.  I certainly will not be supporting this amendment because it is indicative of a plan by the Government to try to use this committee and this report as a means to support what it has been doing, which is very little in that it has failed to recognise the challenges that exist and is attempting to do this on a shoestring.  We know that if we are to make that seismic shift, the Government will have to invest very significant sums of money in the way it does its business.  If we note what Deputy Corcoran Kennedy sought in her previous amendment, she has no issue with setting the burden on the shoulders of the taxpayer, outlining that at an early stage, but not providing any clarity or certainty in terms of what the Government will do.  We now get a little insight into it, however, which is that it will be done at the least cost possible.</p></speech>

This is a great Trojan Horse.  We have clarity on the pathway that is wanted around carbon taxes, but when it comes to mitigation and giving people support, there is a want and a necessity to have the least cost pathway.  That shows why we need clarity on the other aspect of the report and why Deputy Dooley's earlier amendment was needed.  It seems to be the intention of the Fine Gael Party to give a licence to Leo to introduce the tax, but when it comes to everything else in this report, there is a contradiction and compromise.  We should not give that licence to an Executive that has not shown any leadership in this area during the past eight years.  We need to front up to that reality.  Consensus works both ways.  The Government cannot have a licence to tax to get clarity while at the same time wanting to fudge the leadership issue, not wanting to give back to the working families who need support and a bit of help with the cost so that they can deal with this issue in their homes, and wanting to lower the cost and fudge the issue of investment for working families.  I reject this right-wing amendment, and the committee should reject it also.</p></speech>

I think they make common sense.  We should be guided but it should be looked at in a schematic way, and the schematic way is by moving towards reducing carbon emissions and taking carbon out of the way we live.  I remind members that one of the requirements of the energy regulator when putting renewables on the grid and promoting that is to look at the cost of renewables.  That is why we have onshore wind.  I think members are getting pedantic.  Maybe we have hit the kernel and it certainly sounds like we have hit something that is being blown out of proportion.  This does not need to be there, other than for clarity and it is a good idea for clarity.</p></speech>

The term "least cost pathway" is a term used in procurement and it probably comes from the industrial manner in which we deal with how things are valued.  The Deputy's answer that it is the least cost to the citizen indicates again that we see all costs going on ordinary people.  There is no mention of the least cost to industry, the least cost to the financial world or the least cost on profits.  It is always the least cost to the citizen.  I think we should oppose it on that basis.</p></speech>

There are no more amendments, as all amendments to do with this have been withdrawn.  There was only one and that is why I went to Deputy Corcoran Kennedy in regard to the least-cost pathway.  She has withdrawn that amendment.  We are going to vote on the recommendations at the end of chapter 1.  I will go through them one by one and ask if they are agreed.  We will then move on to chapter 2.</p><p>On chapter 1, is recommendation No. 1 agreed?  Agreed.  Is recommendation No. 2 agreed?  Agreed.  Is recommendation No. 3 agreed?  Agreed.  Is recommendation No. 4 agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>We now move to chapter 2, which deals with &quot;Supporting a Just Transition&quot; and contains two recommendations.  The recommendation states:</p><blockquote>The Committee recommends:<br /><br />4. A Just Transition Task Force be established in 2019 to proactively consider the likely upcoming challenges of the forthcoming rapid transition to a low carbon economy.  The Task Force should have an Independent Steering Committee and Chair and will involve workers and their unions, employers, communities, farmers, Government and civil society to plan the detail of delivering security and opportunity for workers.  The Task Force should be invested with the requisite authority and resources, including a specialist mediation service and the facility to draw on expertise as needed.  The Task Force shall:- commission research in 2019 examining which regions and sectors of the economy are most likely to experience serious disruption over the next decade as part of our transition to a low carbon economy.<br /><br />- address the need for sound investments in low-emission and job-rich sectors and technologies by:<blockquote>(i) Carrying out early assessments of the social and employment impacts of climate policies;<br /><br />(ii) Addressing training and skills development;<br /><br />(iii) Identifying social protection needs in the changing industries, along with active labour market policies and [there is an amendment to this from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, to which I will return];<br /><br />(iv) Developing local economic diversification plans that support decent work and provide community stability in the transition.</blockquote>The implementation of agreed interventions for transition, as developed in the framework, should involve a partnership approach involving Government, employers, farmers, trade unions and civil society (Section 2.4).</blockquote> <p>The second recommendation in this chapter states:</p><blockquote>5. With regards to the immediate need to address the ongoing transition in the Midlands region, the Government should direct as soon as possible in 2019:a. The Midlands Regional Enterprise Plan (REP) Committee to devise a Midlands Just Transition Strategy, in order to sustain the economic and social fabric of the region in a post peat extraction era.  The strategy should make provision for specific funding, to finance amongst other things, a major project to rewet denuded peatlands in the Midlands.  This should start with the peatlands owned by Bord na M&oacute;na<br /><br />b. Bord na M&oacute;na to undertake a review of the employment potential of deploying its current workforce to a peatlands restoration project for its landholding.  This review should also outline the full cost of such a project and contain an assessment of the carbon impact of creating a carbon sink; and<br /><br />c. The SEAl to examine how best to deliver a major house retrofitting programme in the Midlands (Section 2.5)</blockquote> <p>Those are the two recommendations in chapter 2 in regard to &quot;Supporting a Just Transition&quot;.  There is one amendment from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, who proposes, after &quot;active labour market policies&quot;, to insert that the reference to active labour market policies in this context excludes any obligation being placed on those made redundant as a consequence of the transition away from carbon-intensive industries to participate in the State's JobPath or similar programme.  The amendment proposes that, at a minimum, those displaced from or denied employment in carbon-intensive industries should never be subjected to punitive and damaging JobPath-type labour market activation policies currently outsourced to and implemented by private sector companies with such devastating impacts on unemployed people.</p></speech>

We have had lots of studies into how these companies are used and the impact this is having on many people who are short-term and long-term unemployed and who are brought before them.  If we do not insert something that alleviates the fear of people who are facing unemployment that they will be used in this way and subjected to the systemic manner in which these companies deal with unemployment, we will not reassure them we are serious about a just transition for workers.  We need to accept this measure to do that.</p></speech>

I appreciate the points Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is making in respect of the critique of the State's JobPath programme.</p><p>My worry is that by making that amendment we could dilute recommendation 4(iv) which relates to transitioning people away from carbon production into local economic diversification, where workers themselves become partners in that transition.  If they are active stakeholders in that transition, the risk of exploitation, as Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is probably arguing here, is diminished because they are partners in their own transition.  That was the point or philosophy behind the ICTU's submission to the committee.  I accept the amendment that Deputy Smith is making but I would not want to introduce issues - I will not call them extraneous issues - into the purity of the just transition task force.  However, if there is a critique to be had of social protection policy this might not be the chapter or the forum in which to do that.  I accept the Deputy's right to bring forward the amendment, but I ask that we do not diminish in any way the success that we have managed to secure in this report through the mere existence of a just transition task force.  That is a success in itself.  Social protection policy should be critiqued, attacked or changed elsewhere but not necessarily in the forum of this report.</p></speech>

We put a lot of work into this and have met union officials and workers.  It is particularly relevant in the midlands, and a major issue in Laois and Offaly is that the area does not become the rust belt of the country.  It is very important that we have that.  We had a section in the report, which was deleted, to insert the International Labor Organization, ILO, framework for a just transition, which we believe would have strengthened it.  We are not 100% happy that it was removed and we would have preferred if the report was stronger to give some of the protections to which Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith referred, but the final recommendations provide a lot of protections.  What happened in the past is that industry closed down, whether it was Bord na M&oacute;na or whatever else, and the fire engines arrived afterwards, or a task force was put together after the event.  What we are trying to achieve by establishing this task force in 2019 is that it will be in place, it can foresee what will happen and it will start taking the necessary steps and actions and pulling the relevant parties together.  We are disappointed that the ILO framework is not included in the final report but it contains some protections and we will support it.  We will also support Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's amendment.</p></speech>

However, Deputy Smith has the issue of former workers who might participate in training as part of this just transition being put under pressure by the Department to take up JobBridge posts, which have nothing to do with it.  In fact, it would deflect from them doing training and retraining to participate in a just transition.  JobBridge would be a barrier.

We are working so hard to create jobs, based on our tourism potential, to change things and to deal with the changing society, that I deeply resent and reject this negative narrative.  I ask Deputy Stanley to withdraw it.  Using this type of language about our area is not on.  I will leave that to one side.</p><p>A just transition task force is crucial.  My county, Offaly, is the one that will be most gravely impacted by Bord na M&oacute;na's decision to change its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre </i>in the context of the necessity to transition to a low-carbon<i></i>economy.  The midlands regional task force which was put together, on which Offaly County Council leads the way, is positive and has turned up interesting evidence.  For instance, many Bord na M&oacute;na workers are looking at moving to third level<i>.  </i>Many would have started work very young as they had no other options.  Interesting things are coming out of this and we need to be positive about giving people opportunities in this transition.  Let us look at it as a way of enhancing people's lives instead of this constant negative narrative about my county, which I completely and utterly reject.  </p></speech>

It is vital that it be supported.  I also support the amendment.  I might have framed it differently myself but the key point made by Deputy Smith is important.  It is not that separate.  We heard about the return to third level and training.  One of my key concerns, which emerged in the hearings on JobPath, is that the programme makes it difficult for people to move into education or training.  By its nature, it tends to push people towards employment opportunities only.  In many cases, where an industry is changing and shifting, education and retraining are fundamental.  JobPath would be an inappropriate tool.  It is flawed in many ways, and while we do not address all of those here, but it is important that those making the transition are given options, including education and training.  I will, therefore, support the amendment.</p></speech>

We must make a clear distinction.  JobPath is often used to assist people at a certain space, often in their own development.  As Senator Higgins correctly identified, what we are talking about is retraining, re-energising and reactivating and developing the skills of people who have worked hard throughout their lives, and who have the capacity and wherewithal to work and have been working in an active environment.  We must go much further than just using the existing pathways to get people back to work, or to assist those who find themselves in between jobs.  An entirely new programme must be developed to assist people in the sector.</p><p>I would like to see it being fleshed out more.  We want to ensure people who have been actively working, want, are able and have the wherewithal but not the opportunity to work receive every assistance.</p></speech>

The wording before is: "The implementation of agreed interventions for transition as developed in the framework should involve a partnership approach involving Government, employers, farmers, trade unions and civil society".  Trade unions are the backbone, specifically as it relates to the midlands.  It will move into the farming sector and others.  I would have thought the wording, as it stands, would have absolutely negated the opportunity for exploitation because civil society and trade unions were included.  Notwithstanding that, if members are landing on a particular view, I will absolutely and utterly support whatever compromise they want to reach.</p></speech>

It would be appalling for workers, if and when they are made redundant, because we want to move to this being a carbon-free country.  They need to be protected to the full.  I do not believe labour activation market policies will help to protect them.  That is why it was included as a full sentence, rather than a deletion, because this would give them more protection.  People come to me daily who are compelled, harassed, feel damaged and punished by these activation measures and it would be an appalling outcome for workers in this attempt to move to a carbon-free economy.  The representatives of the trade unions at the committee said Bord na M&oacute;na workers were being treated very badly.  The level of discussion among and with them is not sufficient.  We want workers to buy into this, not to be afraid of it.  This would add a little protection for them.</p></speech>

It is quite clear that we are talking about active labour market policies which when read, as Deputy Sherlock said, in conjunction with the line at 3582, set out that the interventions agreed to can address concerns about the active labour market policies that might be put in place.  JobPath may be no more.  There may be something else, with new ideas about how to re-train, but I do not think we need to get to that level.  If provision is made for further dialogue at some point to agree what the measures or active labour market policies should be, the provision for further dialogue should be sufficient.  Otherwise it is just having a go at JobPath and this is not the committee to do that.</p></speech>

The view expressed by Deputy Sherlock is very fair.  We have an active labour market and engagement involving all sectors.  Why, therefore, are we going after JobPath?  This is not the place to have that debate.  It would not be appropriate to do so.  If someone has a problem with JobPath, there is surely another forum in which to address it.  This issue has been well thought out by the just transition task force.  Setting it up in 2019 is a positive step because it anticipates what will happen.  It puts a process in place to help those who will go through a transition.  We need to stick with what is in the report.</p></speech>

There are two sentences in the amendment, the first of which is fundamental as it makes it very clear that nobody should be required to participate in JobPath or a similar programme.  I understand there are difficulties because it is difficult for others to agree with some of the other language used, although I agree with it, but the fundamental point is that nobody should be obliged to participate in JobPath or a similar programme, something which the Chairman said is captured in the first sentence.</p></speech>

That is why the wording is included because the intention is that at some point workers may be included and the State would like them to face participation in labour market activation programmes which have been questionable to say the very least in the treatment of workers.  We should be protecting workers who may lose their jobs in Bord na M&oacute;na, at Moneypoint or anywhere else and not subjecting them to the possibility of being treated in an appallingly bad manner.</p></speech>

We would be saying no worker should be forced into a labour activation measure prescribed by the Government against their will or something like it.  We have spent hours discussing this issue and I have made it a red line issue from my party's perspective.  The idea behind a just transition was that a decision would not be made against a worker without bringing him or her on board, whether he or she was a peat worker in the midlands or working in a carbon intensive industry.  No decision would be made over his or her head and he or she would be brought along or part of the movement towards a just transition.</p> <p>  I am not against what Deputy Smith is saying.  The philosophy is absolutely right, but she is trying to prescribe something very specific.  I do not think we should be so prescriptive about JobPath.  We can talk about ensuring there would be no exploitation of workers or that no worker would be shoehorned into a scheme that would work against his or her transition or best or personal interests, but I want to ensure we will not lose anything in pursuing the concept of a just transition.  I want to try to work with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and other members to come up with a wording.  If we talk about ensuring there would be no exploitation of workers and find such a wording, we can find a compromise.</p></speech>

I absolutely respect their wishes to compromise.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has suggested that we divide on this issue.  I am happy to discuss this matter further.  It will have to be dealt with anyway, and taking it offline is not necessarily going to rectify the matter.  I want to say very clear that I accept Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's point about ensuring there is no exploitation of workers in a just transition to a decarbonised economy.  We must find a wording that respects the premise but is not so prescriptive about one particular programme, which might cease to exist.</p></speech>

Agreed.  Is recommendation No. 2 in that chapter agreed to?  Agreed.</p><p>We will move to chapter 3, Citizen and Community Engagement, to which there are two recommendations.  Recommendation No. 1 reads:</p><blockquote>The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment should enable each local authority to establish or designate a Climate Change Strategic Policy Committee (SPC), to be incorporated into the SPC schemes for each local authority after June 2019.  External representation on this SPC should be inclusive of all social, economic and environmental stakeholder groups.</blockquote> <p>Recommendation No. 2 reads:</p><blockquote>The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment should enable each local authority, individually or jointly, to establish a one-stop-shop or other suitable structure, with appropriate resources and expertise.  This should provide practical advice to households and businesses on significantly reducing GHG emissions and utilise information and advice from the SEAI and the Climate Action Regional Offices.  This one-stop-shop must include a strategy for reaching out to all communities by the end of 2020.</blockquote> <p>There are no amendments to those recommendations.  Is recommendation No. 1 agreed to?  Agreed.  Is recommendation No. 2 agreed to?  Agreed.  </p><p>We will move to chapter 4, Education and Communication.  There are no amendments to the four recommendations made in this chapter.  Recommendation No. 1 reads:</p><blockquote>The Department of Education and Skills should by the end of 2019, in consultation with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and other relevant experts, review the curriculums for primary and secondary education for coverage and accuracy to ensure that students are fully literate on climate change and its potential impact.</blockquote> <p>Recommendation No. 2 reads:</p><blockquote>Government Departments as part of the all of government approach to climate change should, before the end of 2019, develop and launch public information campaigns on the need to take action to address climate change, challenges and opportunities.</blockquote> <p>Recommendation No. 3 reads:</p><blockquote>The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland should, by the end of 2019, develop guidelines and measures to encourage and facilitate climate change broadcasting and on-demand service distribution to ensure comprehensive and accurate coverage of climate change.</blockquote> <p>Recommendation No. 4 reads:</p><blockquote>That Met &Eacute;ireann takes a more proactive role as the trusted source in weather forecasting to, where scientifically justified, link specific events to climate change.  Furthermore, Met &Eacute;ireann should consistently reflect the scientific consensus represented by the IPCC.  To this end, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government should resource a dedicated Climate Communications Section within Met &Eacute;ireann.</blockquote> <p>Is recommendation No. 1 agreed to?  Agreed.  Is recommendation No. 2 agreed to?</p></speech>

While I absolutely support the recommendation, I would like it to be noted that my adviser made numerous attempts to have consideration given to the possibility of broadening it to cover public information on the role of industry and the privileging of private markets over the public good.  In other words, we should recommend that the public be educated on the role of the fossil fuel industry and other global corporations in the impact of climate change.  That would broaden the discussion and give people a clearer view on what was going on.  Although I was unable to amend the recommendation, this type of education should be part of how we educate the population on climate change.  If such education is not provided, the public will have a very skewed view on why we are where we are.</p></speech>

Agreed.  Is recommendation No. 3 agreed to?  Agreed.  Is recommendation No. 4 agreed to?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  We will move to chapter 5, Unlocking Potential.</p><p>There are two recommendations here, with no amendments to them.  The first reads:</p><blockquote>Developing climate change solutions represents an opportunity to show leadership and progress economic and social opportunities. Starting with the budget for 2020, a program of substantial R&amp;amp;D investments should be instigated focusing upon developing solutions to climate change. Priority should be given to those areas and technologies where there is the greatest potential for mitigation and adaptation.</blockquote><p>The Second recommendation reads:</p><blockquote>The Department of Health should carry out a review of the health risks associated with climate change and benefits associated with climate action. The results of this review and the preliminary report on the Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme should both be published by June 2019. Following this publication, if the evidence supports it, the HSE and DCCAE should bring forward a proposal on a national roll-out of the Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Minister for Health should report their progress on these matters to the Standing Committee on Climate Action no later than end Q2 2019.</blockquote><p>Is recommendation No. 1 agreed?</p></speech>

We have to recognise that it poses a very serious and existential threat to human life and to all life on this planet.  We should always begin by recognising that.  Notwithstanding that, I believe the recommendation is pretty harmless, but if it stands alone without any acknowledgement that we recognise this as a threat to human existence and to the environment it is just being presented as a business opportunity.</p></speech>

Climate change has become nothing more than a green business opportunity.  Businesses are covering themselves in the green and saying that it will help Ireland become climate friendly.  I am a bit cynical about it; big business is not in it for the good of our health or for the good of the health of the population but rather the profits that can be made.</p> <p>  On the second recommendation, covering the health risks associated with climate change, for clarity, we will look at localised and national climate change and its impact on public health.  We will consider what we know so far and what is predicted.  However, many international studies have been conducted as well.  Will they be taken into account?  We should also consider the effect of climate change on much poorer parts of the world; our lifestyles are having a massive impact on those places.  We have to consider the local, but also what is happening world wide.  Climate change poses a huge risk to our health, due to pollution, etc.</p></speech>

The health aspect, as discussed in private session, is an absolutely critical part of climate action.  Is recommendation No. 1 of chapter No. 5 agreed?  Agreed.  Is recommendation No. 2 of chapter No. 5 agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We will now move to chapter No. 6 now.  I propose to take a break for 20 minutes.  We are moving through the recommendations but there are amendments to be discussed.</p></speech>

Clear political fault lines are now emerging in respect of recommendation No. 16.  I am of the view that we should keep going tonight, to be honest but I will listen to what other members have to say on that.  I have specific amendments in respect of the contentious wording and would like an opportunity to discuss those further.  Unless people are going to come back in here tomorrow with something new or innovative, we are just going to be rehashing the same old arguments again and I am not sure that is the best use of our time.</p></speech>

They are very clear.  I propose that we vote on those recommendations now.  There have been three separate opportunities to amend amendments in recent weeks.  We have been trying to wrap this up since the third week of January and we are now in the last week of March.  We should not delay this process any further.  There is a very clear proposal in front of us in terms of what is in section 6.7, as well as in the first, second and third recommendations within that section.  I propose that we deal with them now.</p></speech>

There is scope within the wording of recommendation No. 16, even if we do not take my wording to the letter of the law, to allow for the standing committee, in its ongoing work after the publication of the report, to deal substantively with the issues that we all have in respect of fuel poverty.</p> <p>  Again, nobody has been able to clarify for me what it is that will happen overnight.  It is only 6.50 p.m. now.  I suggest as a compromise that if we are going to meet tomorrow, that we park chapter 6 and try to get the other chapters out of the way this evening.  That might be a good way of doing it so that we are not reconvening-----</p></speech>

Agreed.  Is the recommendation on community energy and small-scale renewable generation agreed to?  Agreed.  There is an amendment to the fourth recommendation.  The recommendation is that the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in conjunction with the ESB, EirGrid and Bord na M&oacute;na, continually examine the options available to the State to phase out coal and peat burning for electricity generation, and that the Department report quarterly to the standing committee.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's amendment, No. 30, is to insert the following after "the State to phase out coal and peat burning for electricity generation": "In the event of any decision to close Moneypoint or to end peat production, the Government, in the interest of a just transition, will guarantee to underwrite the current pay, conditions and pension rights of workers affected."</p></speech>

This is a very important aspect of how we get the whole country to buy into the measures that need to be taken to reduce carbon emissions.  While we all know that, we must spell out what it means.  I am referring to the workers who will be most affected, namely those of Bord na M&oacute;na and Moneypoint, the obvious places that will have to experience just transition.  I spoke on the last occasion about the need to be very clear about what labour activation measures means.  This is not about that.  It is about guarantees if the workers move to another job.  If we take workers out of Moneypoint and use them to deliver on the wind energy policies, their current pay, conditions and pension rights should be ring-fenced and protected for them.</p></speech>

We have seen, particularly over the past 15 years, that transfer of undertakings regulations have been widely understood as protecting workers when they move from one company to circumstances under the ownership of another.  "Ownership" is the operative word.  I refer to the workers being owned by those running the company.  Transfer of undertakings agreements have been broken continually, and we have seen small shop workers, retailers, farm workers and labourers of various descriptions almost fraudulently cheated out of their rights on transfer.  The proposal is a beginning.  It protects Moneypoint at this end but looks towards other cases of just transition that may arise.</p></speech>

The ESB, which is operating Moneypoint, is a semi-State company.  How will the measure work if it is directed to underwrite the pay, conditions and pensions?  I assume most of this will be done through negotiation and through the just transition process itself.  That is why we have that mechanism put in place.  Are we setting a legal precedent?  Will we be doing the exact same thing in industry?  Legally, have we the ability to impose such draconian measures on a semi-State company?  I question what it will achieve.</p></speech>

I have no issue with including it in the report.  It will not encumber the Government and it will raise the issue, which is helpful.  For sure, we must consider the issues concerning just transition and we must ensure those who are affected are addressed.  There is no point in trying to give people false hope, however, by stating that by putting something in this report, their futures will be protected.  There is no way we can force the Government to do so.  I cannot see how the Government would be in a position to guarantee what is proposed.  Perhaps if we had more time, we could get the wording right regarding the committee calling on various employers.  Ultimately, notwithstanding that the ESB is a semi-State company, the Government is not the employer in the direct Civil Service way.  I fully accept the sentiment of the amendment, however, and absolutely support the principle.  In the absence of other language, we will support it.  By saying we are supporting it, however, we must be honest with the people listening to us &ndash; the workers concerned.  Just because this language is included does not mean they can take it to the bank and that their terms and conditions are guaranteed.  Sadly, they are not and there will be a role for us to continue to ensure a just transition where jobs are lost in the circumstances in question.  The State, as the shareholder in the ESB, can play a role in that regard.  I hope we can achieve consensus on it.  I certainly believe we should not divide on it.  It should not be for us to second-guess how the Attorney General might address this but we should flag it and include it, purely as an indicative position to protect workers.  Let us be honest with everyone, however.</p></speech>

Somewhere else in the document, I argue that renewable energy production should be widely engaged in by the State.  If we take seriously the power of wind off our coast and exploit it to produce energy, I hope the State will be heavily involved.  Where workers from semi-State companies that are producing our energy move to a different type of energy production, the State should underwrite their terms, pay, conditions and pensions.  That is what my amendment is getting at.</p><p>If necessary we can add the words, "where workers engage in alternative energy production"-----</p></speech>

In areas such as the midlands and west Clare where the people the Deputy mentions are employed, their lifestyles and experience will not only be affected by this.  The impact of the loss of the jobs in the community, regardless of the employment of the individuals, will also be significant because we are forgetting about the contractors who work in these areas.  It is much broader than what this amendment seeks to address.  That is why we would have to flesh it out, probably in the context of the just transition.</p> <p>  In addition, there are people who have reached a certain stage in their career who will be more than happy to take a significant redundancy and change tack.  We are not going to rewrite entitlements in respect of one's job.  It is highly unlikely anybody will be made compulsorily redundant in the semi-State companies.  I do not mean to gild it but much better protections will be afforded to them than to the subcontractors who have no rights and entitlements other than the loss of what was a permanent job.  There is a much broader dimension to it.  I accept what the Deputy is trying to do, but I would like to broaden it.  Perhaps we could look at trying to get more in there.</p></speech>

The point I wished to make is that in Bord na M&oacute;na, in particular, many people are contractors, not employees.  There are people working for the contractors as well, which complicates matters.  The Deputy would have to state that they would have to be the employees but also - and this is important - where they continue to work for that company.  Bord na M&oacute;na now has a number of subsidiaries such as AES or it could be the ESB and the person could be working for ESB International or one of the wings of the company.  To achieve that we have to state that it is in the case where they continue to work for the company or a subsidiary of the company.  The sentiment is good but there are difficulties with trying to implement that as it stands.</p></speech>

It has a deep sea jetty, which is critical, so it is perfect.  Regarding Bord na M&oacute;na, I agree with the amendment as amended.  We have a major problem because we can no longer get the workers to do the retrofitting.  People involved in this business are saying that the biggest problem is getting workers.

I will read out what I believe is Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's new priority recommendation.  The Deputy wants to add another recommendation to the chapter on agriculture that reads:</p><blockquote>The committee recommends that the Department of Finance commission an enquiry into the revenue that could be realised through the introduction of a carbon tax on the profits of large agri-food producers and the feasibility of ring-fencing that revenue to help low-income farming communities move to sustainable low-carbon food production.</blockquote> <p>Does the Deputy wish to add this recommendation?</p></speech>

I do not think it should cause members too much of a headache because it is basically about looking into the possibility, investigating and having a inquiry to see what we might do in the future.  I think there are three or four major food producers in this country that are of a global nature, are absolutely massive and make huge profits.  We spoke earlier for a very long time, and probably will speak again, about the carbon tax that will be levied on ordinary people.  This is a measure to look at the possibility of ring-fencing a tax on the profits of major agrifood producers.  Please do not think I am going after the farmer.  I am not and I am not arguing that this should be passed on to the farmer or consumer.  Rather, I am arguing that it should be ring fenced with regard to these major global food corporations.  I do not want to name them in this committee but this measure should be used to help to low-income farmers to move to sustainable, low-carbon production.</p></speech>

In my part of the world, large agricultural producers are the co-operatives and these are owned by farmers.  They are co-operatives such as Dairygold, Carbery Milk Products and Drinagh Co-operative Ltd.  They are all basically owned by farmers and are farming entities.  This proposal would put a carbon tax on the production of farms.  This is a major issue and am completely opposed to the recommendation on principle.</p></speech>

Realistically, what we are trying to do is bring everyone on board.  The farming community feels pressure regarding carbon and where it will go in this space.  If we were to go down the route of picking a vehicle over which the farming community has direct ownership and putting an actual carbon charge on their production, it would be a major step backwards in the context of this report.  There is a need for  buy-in from the people and communities.  We could lose an entire cohort of society by pushing ahead with this proposal.</p></speech>

Even though she stated that she is not going after farmers, she is going after them indirectly because the profits of the co-operatives are funnelled indirectly back to the farmers on an annual basis.  I know this is about an inquiry into the revenue that could be raised through the introduction of a carbon tax on profits but would it be possible to impose a carbon tax on the profits?  I do not think it is possible.</p></speech>

We introduced a carbon tax on large corporations in the emissions trading scheme, ETS.  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court ruled against the way we did it.  I think there are mechanisms like this that we should consider again looking at that Supreme Court judgement because it is appropriate for us, particularly with regard to seeing companies in the ETS paying more as well.  There was a difficulty with the Supreme Court when we did it.  The case was taken during the tenure of a subsequent Government but it was possible.</p></speech>

I am sure that will act as an incentive for them to transition away from the production of carbon.  Perhaps I am wrong, I hope I am, but what I think is at the base of this is that Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith somehow wants to penalise the companies that are part of the ecosystem that is our agrifood business.  Some of these companies are co-operatives while others are public limited companies but they all run on the same basis of profit and loss.</p><p>If the cost of production and sales goes up, a couple of things will happen.  The companies will force down the price they pay to their primary producers, whether they are co-ops or PLCs, meaning the farmer will certainly take a hit.  They will also look at the elasticity within their employment numbers and the livelihoods of the 167,000 workers Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has been trying to assist and protect will be affected, whether this is by restraining the capacity to get pay increases or reductions in their numbers.  It might look well, from an ideological point of view, to go after big business and it might constitute a great slogan but the effects will not be on the directors or the shareholders so much as on employees and the people who supply the primary produce to the company.</p><p> We should look at this right across society, rather than targeting the agrifood sector.  One section addresses agriculture and how we mitigate the effects of measures to deal with emissions in the sector.  The approach is broad-based but this suggestion will have no meaningful impact on reducing emissions.  Instead it will hurt between 167,000 and 170,000 employees in the sector, including farmers, and will have a negative impact on the overall economy.</p></speech>

The worry I have about the amendment is that industrial jobs will be lost.  There is a potential negative impact on prices at the farm gate and, in the co-operative model, there is a risk that employees who are not shareholders, such as accountants, technical advisers, marketing and sales staff, will get the chop if there is a profit warning.  These people are living mainly in rural communities and in small and medium-sized towns that are allied to co-ops.  By seeking to put in place an inquiry, I would fear that industrial workers in the areas I represent would be the first to be put out of the door.  In any case, the wording in the body of the report could facilitate the process of an inquiry where there are specific recommendations by the Department of Finance for public consultation.</p></speech>

It asks that we get the Department of Finance to commission an inquiry into ring-fencing a tax on the profits of major agrifood producers.  I am not saying we should lash the farmer out of it, go after the co-op in Drinagh or take on the industrial workers of east Cork.  I am not talking about Drinagh but Glanbia, Kerry Foods, Goodman and such companies that operate globally.  They are worth billions and I am suggesting we give the tax back to the small, struggling farmers who are on low and middle incomes to help them transition to a sustainable model of farming.  This amendment is not a big bombshell.</p></speech>

If that was the case, why would we tax these companies at all?  Why would we not let them have a free-for-all, let them create jobs and then tax the workers and live off that?  The arguments against the amendment are nonsensical.  They suggest we should not tax business at all so that those companies can create jobs and make everything perfect.  The gist of the amendment is to provide for a report to be made and I do not think a report should cause so much fear.</p></speech>

There are four recommendations and a number of amendments.  The first is No. 35, which states:</p><blockquote>The Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment with the SEAI and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (DHPLG) should urgently carry out a needs assessment in order to determine the requirements for the delivery of the Government's target for retrofitting 45,000 homes per annum from 2021 and explore increasing it incrementally to 75,000 homes.  This should include:a. Prioritising the categories of houses to be retrofitted with a focus on those with the lowest building energy rating (BER);<br /><br />b. For all housing where the State is landlord, the DHPLG should set annual targets for each local authority to deliver deep retrofits of all of its public housing stock by 2030.  The DHPLG should allocate necessary finances through the capital budget and explore finding support from the European Investment Bank (EIB);<br /><br />c. Producing a plan as a priority by Q3 2019 to meet the training and educational requirements of an enlarged workforce needed to deliver the retrofitting programme (early action in this regard can maximise the associated employment potential and economic, social and environmental benefits (Sections 9.3. 9.7).</blockquote> <p>There are two amendments.

One of the measures we could possibly take is targeting certain areas in the country.  For example, for a variety of reasons, there may well be a case, in retrofitting social housing or supporting the private sector, to look at rural Ireland first.  If something is being done in a rural area, we know that we can put up a worker, whereas in Dublin it is very difficult to find accommodation for someone.  This might be beneficial because we will want to protect rural communities if carbon prices increase.  There are, however, other circumstances and factors that we have to take into account.  If we were to just go with cost abatement curves, we would sometimes miss the social priorities we would have to apply.  Obviously, we have to look at cost abatement curves, but being explicit on having a needs assessment for just that one category would restrict us in the social and other priorities we might want to apply to investment.</p></speech>

We had a specific amendment with a target of approximately 100,000 houses per annum, but as a committee we have settled on a figure of 75,000.  I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan on ensuring there would be a social element also such that we would not make it too technocratic.  That may not be the specific intention, but it could be interpreted in a way that would be too technocratic.  We want to ensure we will develop infrastructure that will have the requisite skill set and the pot of money required to do this and set clear targets for retrofitting.  The 45,000 target is too low, notwithstanding the fact that in reality far fewer than that number are achieved on an annual basis.  There is scope to beef up the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and work with stakeholders such as the Construction Industry Federation and academic institutions to develop short courses, for instance, to try to get more highly skilled graduates into the space to create a demand for retrofitting.  We need to create an infrastructure that will ensure the primary user will not face an arcane or overly bureaucratic set of guidelines when he or she applies for a grant.  That process should be made as seamless as possible.  Our interaction with the Tipperary Energy Agency was very effective because it ensured it acted as an interlocutor with the service provider, the engineers and so on.</p></speech>

Agreed.  The next amendment was withdrawn earlier.  There is an amendment to recommendation No. 36.  The recommendation reads:</p><blockquote>The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government should provide a road map by Q1 2020 for the decarbonisation of the rental stock by 2030.  This road map should include a timescale and associated measures for requiring a minimum C BER [rating] for residential lettings.</blockquote> <p>Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has tabled amendment No. 40 which seeks to insert the following: &quot;The Committee recommends the introduction of a measure (e.g. a tax allowance) to redress the higher energy costs which the increasing number of people now housed in rental accommodation will incur in those situations where landlords do not take steps to improve the energy efficiency of their residential rental properties&quot;.

We have to deal with people living in private rented accommodation that is substandard and where landlords are not willing to bring it up to the energy rating required.  We all know that this is becoming increasingly.  People are being forced into private rented accommodation because of the lack of social housing.  One third of people in Dublin already live in private rented accommodation, much of which leaves a lot to be desired in terms of energy efficiency.  Another measure could be brought forward to force landlords to make the changes required, but we should find a measure to give a tax allowance to address higher energy costs.  I refer to persons who have to keep the fire on.</p></speech>

That would be a far more effective measure.  If we were to give a tax allowance to the tenant, there is a risk we would encourage landlords to keep the existing system.  The rent would increase such that, like a lot of these things, the tax allowance would be sucked up by the landlord.  It would be far better to regulate to get llandlords to do the work.  Such a measure has recently been introduced in the United Kingdom.  Regulating landlords, rather than giving a tax allowance, is the better approach.</p></speech>

Deputy Eamon Ryan said it should be levied on landlords.  In an ideal world it should be levied on them, but the problem is nobody would pursue them to make sure they would do it.  The reality is that if the State had to give a tax free allowance to the tenant, it would then have an interest in making sure the landlord did the work to reduce the tax free allowance in order that it would get more tax.  The problem would arise if the State was to abdicate its responsibility to protect tenants.  I take it that is the reason Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith-----</p></speech>

Some of them use slot meters which are very expensive.  That is accepted and the issue needs to be addressed.  I am not sure whether this suggestion is workable.  I agree that we need to do something about the matter, but we would have to deem whether a building had the proper energy rating and, from the Minister's point of view, give tax relief in that particular instance.</p><p>It is a critical area.  It is one of the areas we have previously tried to highlight and put forward measures to address.  To put it another way, let us say I am in one apartment and Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is in another.  If I think mine is colder than hers, getting a determination on that or getting a landlord to allow it would be difficult.  While it probably cannot be done here and now, I propose that private rental properties should have a minimum building energy rating, BER.  In other words, they should come up to a certain standard, say a rating of B or C.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Is recommendation No. 38 agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>We will now move on to chapter 10, which concerns transport.  There are seven recommendations.  The first recommendation has two amendments.  I will deal with that first and then we will continue.  The preface to the recommendations states:</p><blockquote>The Committee notes that transport is a complex problem to address and that substantial further investigation shall be required by the Standing Committee, the Climate Action Council and the Government as part of the all of government approach.  The Committee in accepting the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly makes the following initial recommendations:</blockquote> <p>The first recommendation, recommendation No. 39, states:</p><blockquote>The urgent delivery of proposed investment under Project 2040 and other programmes in low-carbon and zero-carbon modes of transport including major public transport infrastructure works, commencing in 2019 and calls for these and additional similar projects to be prioritised and expanded.  (Section 10.5)</blockquote> <p>There are two Green Party amendments, Nos. 43 and 44.  They are both new priority recommendations.  Amendment No. 43 provides that all current transport infrastructure programmes should immediately be revised to achieve a ratio of expenditure on public transport to spending on roads of at least 2:1.</p></speech>

An earlier comment referred to the scale of the challenge we face.  No climate assessment was carried out in respect of the current national development plan and Project Ireland 2040.  We learned that in our hearings.  We also learned that even with all the projects that are included, the National Transport Authority, NTA, is projecting a 30% increase in transport emissions, rather than the 30% reduction that we need.  We heard from the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that the Department has no plan or understanding of how to bring emissions down.  Clear and irrefutable evidence of this was presented.  No major public transport projects were built in Ireland last year, and none will be built this year or next year.  More than anything else, in my own city of Dublin we are widening all the approach roads.  That is what is happening in reality.  We know how difficult it is to change this approach because we heard it in our own committee hearings.  All of these roads are popular.  The most difficult thing for this committee to achieve would be to stop the development of a road.</p> <p>  The national development plan was not assessed.  When it was assessed later as part of our work, we realised that it would deliver 30% of the emission reductions targets we have committed to for 2030.  We have a 100 million tonne gap to close and there is no clear sense of how we are going to do so.  We did not do a lot of work on reducing emissions in transport planning.  We have to go back and do more work in respect of transport.  We have a significant problem.  If we are going to accept the Citizens' Assembly recommendations, the reality that we have to switch our transport spending to the ratio the amendment outlines must be front and centre.  The ratio of spending on roads to public transport is currently 2:1.  We have to switch that.  If we do so it will be a better outcome because our people are being stuck in traffic.  Dublin faces congestion costs of &euro;2 billion, a figure which is growing every year.  We have to be ambitious in switching the transport budget.  I could make the same comment with regard to the other amendment. </p></speech>

Several public transport projects have been proposed and we want them to be pursued.  We have to perform a balancing act here.  Project Ireland 2040 is projected to deliver a 30% reduction in emissions, as was outlined.  We also have to look at this economically and socially.  We have to consider it in light of the <i>status quo</i>with regard to infrastructure and how to get from here to there.  We cannot move from one transport infrastructure to another without a transition.  We are always talking about transitions.  It is important to manage that.  Reading the recommendations, I note that a 2:1 ratio will have huge impact on the building of motorways and projects that are already moving through the planning process, projects that are shovel-ready and projects that are now under construction or to which commitments have been made.</p><p>Examples include the Cork to Limerick motorway and, to be parochial, the Limerick to Foynes motorway through County Limerick.  These are all major infrastructural projects that are economically required.  The country needs them.  Distance is now measured using time rather than kilometres.  We talk about getting from A to B in half an hour instead of it being 40 km.  This is important for our economic development, particularly for areas such as Shannon-Foynes Port.  Some traffic is already using the motorway to come there from Kildare.  That will probably increase and the best possible competitive advantage is needed.  </p><p> The other side of this matter concerns rural Ireland.  I understand Deputy Eamon Ryan may be speaking about Dublin city but I am referring to people in rural Ireland, who rely on cars and related infrastructure.  What kind of knock-on effects will this recommendation have for road budgets and the resurfacing of rural roads?  We will have to examine the implications of this recommendation for a 2:1 spend when a road budget is being drawn up for rural roads in County Limerick, or any county for that matter.  We want to see an increase in public transport, of course, but to suggest there is going to be public transport in every town and village in rural areas is unrealistic.  We are fighting to get public transport as it is.  I am trying to think of the practicalities of this recommendation.  I have major reservations.  We have to think critically about this.  We need to balance the reduction of emissions with economic development and how people in society currently interact.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.439" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1386" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032700002#LL00200"><p>I also have an issue with this, particularly the 2:1 spending aspect.  Regarding lack of investment in public transport, we have to talk about what is actually happening.  A bus running on renewable gas, which is carbon neutral, was launched in Cork yesterday.  We cannot just be talking ourselves down.  We have to acknowledge positive stories like that and what is happening on the ground.  There has been significant investment in bus services in my area.  The public wanted that.  Bus services from Kinsale to Cork have doubled in the last 18 months.</p> <p>  When it comes to the bare bones of infrastructure, we have 12,733 km of roads in County Cork.  Maintaining those roads is one of the biggest challenges we have, never mind building new ones.  That is what people want in rural Ireland.  They probably do not have broadband but they want to have a road and the ability to get to and from a location.  People are struggling to do that at the moment.  If we were to bring a recommendation forward of a 2:1 change regarding public transport we would lose a huge cohort of people.  We would lose a real aspect of society.  </p> <p>  This report could become centred on Dublin and that is a real worry for us.  I refer to bringing people with us.  I fear this proposal will do damage not alone to rural Ireland but to the report itself.  I refer again to 12,733 km of roads in County Cork.  There are no new roads being built and they are not needed.  We need to maintain those we have.  The budgets, unfortunately, are not available for that to happen at the moment.  If budgets were to be slashed tomorrow morning, we would have a major problem in society.</p></speech>

I wonder if the two can be separated and whether there can be compromise regarding the amendments.  If we have to recommend that all current transport infrastructure programmes be revised, I imagine the assumption is a revision downwards or away from investment in some of the projects Deputy Neville, for example, outlined.  The people I represent rely heavily on cars.  Deputy Eamon Ryan hopes there will be a transition from diesel and petrol cars to hybrids and electric vehicles, EVs.  He is hoping that will happen as soon as possible and transport will be decarbonised in that way.</p> <p>  My fear is that large infrastructural projects will be taken off of the table.  I refer to those necessary to move people and sustain their livelihoods.  These projects are required to allow people get to their places of work, to college and to hospitals to access medical appointments and services.  The transition from car to bus or train will not happen quickly enough if we start questioning or recommending another mechanism.  I would like to see the standing committee take part of this amendment and have robust engagement on what a 2:1 ratio actually means.  I refer to having real analysis of that suggestion and bringing in witnesses regarding what that means.  </p> <p>  I am broadly in favour of what Deputy Eamon Ryan is trying to achieve.  It would mean having to axe current infrastructure projects in the short term, however.  That could have a detrimental impact on livelihoods.  What the Deputy is proposing can be done in Dublin, Limerick or Galway.  I am not sure it can be done in the towns and villages in between those cities.  I would like to keep an open mind, however.  I would also like the standing committee to engage further on this matter, if we are keeping in line with the recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly.</p></speech>

That does not necessarily mean a massive revision downwards.  This is about increasing the ambition for public transport.  If we are to get anywhere near achieving our targets, we are going to have to massively increase our ambition for public transport.  New strands of funding can and should be drawn on to do that.  EU Invest has been unveiled at a European level.  Sustainable infrastructure is a theme within that and, potentially, includes public transport.  We need a clear and ambitious target for public transport investment as there is a chicken and egg effect in that we will not be able to access those EU funds unless we have clear plans for delivery.</p> <p>  I grew up in the west of Ireland and I sympathise with Deputy Neville.  He spoke about it already being difficult to access public bus services in towns and villages.  I worked with young unemployed people in rural areas who told me about their difficulties in being able to access employment opportunities.  The problem at the moment, however, is that the case for rural public transport tends to be presented counting only people who may want to use the service from that a certain town or its environs.  To my mind, that actually strengthens the case for public transport in our towns and villages.  Public transport might, indeed, include school transport.  There is potential for us to examine many more layers to public transport in seeking to fulfil what is an ambitious target.  </p> <p>  I also support the target for cycling.  While we are looking at 10% of journeys, let us also have 10% of infrastructure.  That might change down the line.  At this stage, we need a big capital investment in cycling infrastructure because it is missing.  It should not, however, be the case that people in rural towns and villages feel they cannot cycle.  People often feel safer cycling in the city than in the countryside.  That is ridiculous and it is just because the infrastructure is not there.  This is an all of Ireland proposal.  It would be constructive and the co-benefits are immense.  </p></speech>

Reference was made to the standing committee working on this matter.  It is already in the report that:</p><blockquote>the Committee recommends that the public transport elements of Project Ireland 2040 be prioritised and that further public transport projects should also be re-evaluated with a view to their inclusion after the mid-term review of the NDP.  The Committee further recommends that the Standing Committee on Climate Action should examine the changes in infrastructure, planning and delivery that would be required to give effect to the 2 to 1 recommendation of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly. </blockquote><p>That is in the body of the report.</p></speech>

I do not think we are really getting it when I hear Deputy after Deputy saying, "Yeah, but."  There should not be "buts" in revising our expenditure on transport with the ratio suggested by Deputy Eamon Ryan which would favour public transport by 2:1.  It should be a no-brainer.  We have to get cars, trucks and all other vehicles that are spewing out carbon off the road.  I really do not understand the fears of Deputies.  Years ago, there used to be loads of rural bus and train links.  When the country had very little money, it had railway tracks to every lpart of east Cork, Kerry, Donegal and Sligo.  We destroyed them and made a bags of public transport as the State developed.  We could get them back by implementing these amendments.  In rejecting them on the basis of fear we are not living up to what the IPCC report, the United Nations and the plethora of stuff that has hit us in the last while are telling us about climate change.  We need to keep reminding ourselves of it.  I have a radical amendment at the end that we commit to the implementation of free public transport, not tomorrow but eventually.  That is being rejected all the time.  We have to start thinking outside the box.  It cannot be business as usual tomorrow.</p></speech>

It is not that I am in disagreement with Deputy Eamon Ryan in where he is coming from.  In terms of behavioural change, for me, what we need to try to do is get the carbon emitters off the roads.  We are still going to need roads for public transport vehicles and so on.  We really need to focus on having people switch from fossil fuel generated carbon spewing vehicles to electric vehicles.  There are significant road blocks, the removal of which needs investment.  We would be burying our heads in the sand if we were to suggest they should somehow go away.  The ratio of 2:1 is a nice one, but what would it mean in effect?  We have rightly identified the necessity to look at the carbon emissions impact of projects in the plan to 2040 to see whether they make sense in that respect.  On putting another limiter on it that does not look into the detail, it is overarching and I do not know how it necessarily deals with the issues that arise, but it should not be seen as not wanting to invest in public transport.  We need to invest aggressively in public transport, but I do not know if setting it against what we spend on roads on a ratio of 2:1 would benefit anyone or if it is necessarily the right thing to do.  We should develop a comprehensive framework for what we need to do with public transport.</p> <p>  We can have a misty-eyed view of the past and expect everybody to toddle onto trains, but that is not going to happen either.  We cannot expect people to somehow wait for the bus that comes every two hours, even if we were to increase provision massively and provide a service where there was none heretofore.  In the rural constituency I know best we would need to put a lot of money into the roads to service the buses that would need to be put in place to provide a comprehensive service to meet the needs of a society that has largely become dependent on the just-in-time service provided by their own personal vehicles.  We have seen an evolution away from crowds walking the roads together when they wanted to go to wherever they wanted to go.  That does not happen anymore.  Sadly, we are in a situation where there are three or four cars in many homes throughout rural Ireland, where sons and daughters still live at home.  The first stage is to reduce emissions from the vehicles in which people travel.  Over time we need to enhance and increase public transport in densely populated areas.  That involves dealing with issues in planning and how we will develop cities into the future.  We talked about this issue in the past of urban and suburban planning.  I agree with the vast majority of what came from the Citizens' Assembly and would not like to fall out with it over this, but the 2:1 ratio is somewhat crude in meeting the objective we are trying to achieve.</p></speech>

The reality is we have had no focus on public transport anywhere in society.  That is the problem.  We need investment in roads.  We are not saying there should not be any as we will need roads to carry the buses that will provide transport because there will not be trains services all around the country.  We should have it as a guideline to push us on to make sure it will happen.  We need to find innovative ways to deal with rural transport to ensure services will be provided in rural areas.  Not everybody can afford to buy an electric vehicle.  Not everybody can afford to buy a car, but people do need to access employment also.  Public transport will be the way they will access it.  Everybody is going to have to be able to do it.  We are all going to have to change in that way.  I have no problem at all with the ratio.</p></speech>

I thank everyone for his or her honesty in responding and think people will agree with a lot of what has been said.  It shows the scale of the challenge we face.  Someone said we could not have public transport passing through every town and village.  We should set ourselves a target that every single village and town will have a public transport service.  That is exactly what we should be doing.  On cycling infrastructure, the first priority is that we set ourselves a goal that there will be a safe route to every school in the country.  We should start with secondary schools.  Currently, more secondary schoolgirls are driving than cycling to school.  That is the reality in modern Ireland.  It is also the reality that 30% of morning rush hour traffic is taking kids to school.</p> <p>  The car adverts always show us the ideal of a car moving down an empty road, while Deputy Dooley mentioned a just-in-time service, but we all know that has gone out the window in this country.  There are cars everywhere.  When officials of the Department were before the committee, one of them said we were at peak car use.  We literally cannot cope.  Adding two roads will not solve the problem.  All it will do is add further to maintenance costs.  Deputy Neville is right, or perhaps it was Deputy Dooley - I cannot remember who said it - that there is a terrible maintenance cost.  If we keep building more roads, we will have greater maintenance costs and less for public transport.  I do not believe, as I see in the national development plan, we have given up on the rail network.  If we are thinking big and long term, we should be looking to electrify the entire rail network and have one-and-a-half hour journey times to Galway, Waterford, Limerick and Cork.  At present, one cannot tell in leaving Dublin at 5 a.m. to travel to Cork if the journey will take four or six hours.</p></speech>

Once we move outside the conurbation or the major interurban routes, we are not at peak car use.  In the villages most people here and I know best, where there is a service, even if we were to quadruple it, there would still only be a bus every four or five hours.  I do not know from where the investment is going to come to have a bus service every ten minutes.</p></speech>

The proposal will lead to a high speed train running through Sandyford, Harcourt Street and the city centre every three minutes.  Of course, that is required and it is right to invest in such transport services in densely populated areas.  However, we do not want a situation to arise where we will allow road infrastructure in rural or semi-rural areas to deteriorate to such an extent that people will give up living there.  A plank of government policy is in place to try to address that issue.  I support all of the points made, but one cannot be at the expense of another.  They are not competing interests, nor should they be.  We should seek to address the issues in less densely populated areas in a different manner.  We cannot expect people to be happy that roads are not maintained to an acceptable standard.</p></speech>

There is a similar amendment described as a new priority recommendation which states all current transport infrastructure programmes should be revised immediately to achieve a expenditure ratio of at least 2:1 in favour.  My question is as follows.  When discussing all current transport infrastructure programmes, is the Green Party talking about all road programmes, including rural road maintenance programmes and local improvement schemes, as well as county council budgets for rural roads?</p><p>I am curious about how it would work.  I can see how it would work in a city, but I am curious about how it would work in at least 22 of the 26 counties.  I am thinking about the effects of the change.  If it were done over a period of two years, public transport services would not have roads on which to drive.  The aim is good and laudable and I can see how it might work within the four larger cities, in particular, as they are choked with traffic.  We all want to use public transport which I try to use as much as possible.  However, if one were to do this in the roads programme as it applies to any of the 22 counties which do not include a major city, the effect would be that there would be no roads.</p><p> The reality is as follows.  As a Deputy and, previously, as a county councillor, I have faced situations where a person operating a school bus has refused to use roads because of their condition owing to lack of investment and maintenance.  Where that happens, the 25 to 30 children using the bus have to be driven to school.  Deputy Eamon Ryan is correct in saying it is very frustrating to see children being driven to school in cars.  There is no car-pooling for a lot of them.  There are ten cars leaving one housing estate to drive ten children to school.  I see it happening and agree that we need to change these practices.  However, the effect of the proposal would be to stop the school bus from travelling on rural roads.  It would also affect Irish Rural Link which is being rolled out in some counties.  Irish Rural Link and rural transport services would cease to function because the drivers and owners of the buses would refuse to travel on a lot of roads.  While in my county, Laois, there are reasonably good roads by comparison with others, it is a huge challenge to maintain roads which are laid over peatland in neighbouring north Offaly.  While I have to be careful in referring to County Offaly, I am sure Deputy Corcoran-Kennedy who is not here and Deputy Cowen would agree with me.  If people do not believe me, they should drive from Edenderry to Portarlington via Cushina to see what I am talking about.  The county council is barely able to keep the tar on roads with the budget it has available.  Any area engineer in any of the municipal districts in our counties will say it is like Blue Band margarine - it must be spread so thinly to keep the roads covered and repaired.</p></speech>

Primarily, it shows that there is a major divide in relation to urban and rural areas in who will carry the burden in meeting our climate action and climate change ambitions.  In one fell swoop, rural areas are taking the wind farms and whatever other energy infrastructure and transmission lines are required.  For the most part, it is rural people who are being asked to do so.  In some quarters, they are talking about hammering farmers.  There is that narrative, not only among extreme elements but also in the mainstream media.  Now we are being told that we will not have roads.  In my county 71% of people are deemed to live in rural areas.  On average, in the west, taking out Galway, 66% of people are deemed to be living in rural areas.  Not only will we not be talking about new roads, we will not be able to maintain the roads we have.  Unrealistic and out-of-touch amendments like this make one despair, except in so far as we might, I hope, be able to have a more logical discussion about it.</p> <p>  During the period in which the Celtic tiger was roaring roads were not built everywhere.  I am talking about strategic roads such as major inter-urban routes.  As such, we are only playing catch-up in the west and the north west.  The first piece of that infrastructure was the Tuam bypass, but no major road was built into the west during that time.  We do not have a major inter-urban route.  We would love to have a high-speed train service, but we do not even have that, although we have a train service.  The roads are for the socio-economic benefit of the people living in the region to permit it to grow, develop and compete in some way with the rest of the country which it is unable to do at present.  It makes a joke of conversations on a just transition and how this and that will impact when people in some areas are coming from so far behind in terms of investment in infrastructure.  It is holding them back.  Farmers in these areas need to work with multinational companies because their small farms are on marginal land, meaning that they cannot derive a living wage from producing food.  There has to be a reality check in what we are about and how we are asking a lot more from some people than others in meeting our climate action ambitions.</p> <p>  This proposal is off the radar in the case of regions that have not seen investment.  It is all very well to say we already have the roads we need when we do not have the major roads we need to serve our areas.  The idea is to revise everything, throw it on the scrap heap and say, "I am sorry guys; you missed out."  These are the same areas that are crucified by environmental designations as European sites under special areas of conservation rules and the habitats and birds directives.  We cannot have a road or a bridge built because of the freshwater pearl mussel, alluvial woodland and a list of species we have to protect, while at the same time there is no regard for humans in the equation.  It is only wildlife.  The green agenda is that this will be a wildlife preserve and that human beings can be tagged as wildlife in that picture, which is the only one being painted.  It is absolutely ridiculous and I will not stand for it.  I would not be worth my salt, coming from where I do, knowing and living among the people and seeing their struggles, if I was to listen to this.</p></speech>

There are 13,000 km of road in my county alone, which is a huge issue in respect of a 2:1 expenditure ratio away from public transport.  However, we have to acknowledge what has happened.  We have good stories to tell.  People might not be walking to school, but they are driving part of the way and then joining school trains.  These things are happening in villages and towns all over County Cork.  We must acknowledge the positives, as well as the negatives.  It is unfortunate that a negative twist has been put on it with the suggestion that every single person in a rural area drives a car.  We do not.  We car-pool because that is what one does in rural Ireland.  We work together because we need to do so to survive.  As such, the narrative used in the amendment is unfortunate.  It has been very divisive and the urban-rural divide has really shone through in the last half hour of this debate.</p></speech>

During the break I asked for the IPCC quote to be inserted in the report, but that request was denied.  I read it again:</p><blockquote>Pathways limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;C with no or limited overshoot would require rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial systems ... These systems transitions are unprecedented in terms of scale.</blockquote> <p>Either we accept that or we do not.  If we do not, it means moving into the realm of climate change denial.</p><p>I accept it, but I would like to respond to the contributions of the two previous speakers by saying I believe they are grossly misinterpreting what is intended by the amendments we are dealing with.  Deputy Eamon Ryan's amendment proposes that "All current transport infrastructure programmes should immediately be revised to achieve expenditure at least 2 to 1 in favour of public transport."  By the way, that includes roads which need public transport going up and down them to take kids to school and to bring rural villagers from one village to another.  It includes infrastructure on roads which will be used by public transport.  I think it is over-egging the pudding to say that those of us who come from urban areas, particularly Dublin, are somehow attempting to lash out of it the people who live in the west and in the far-flung regions.  It is absolute nonsense.  We are trying to reverse the damage that has been done to the planet and live up to our responsibilities.  As politicians, we have a responsibility to look beyond the business-as-usual negative way of seeing our daily lives by trying to change them for the better.  The Green Party amendments go a long way towards dealing with that without being punitive on anyone.  I remind colleagues that Deputy Eamon Ryan said that these amendments apply particularly to rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I have been more of a witness here this evening.  Amendments Nos. 41 to 43, inclusive, seem to be related.  I want to ask a simple question.  I am looking for proper clarity on this.  Will the roads budget for local authorities be affected by this 2:1 proposal?  I suggest it will have to be affected.  We are absolutely struggling at present.  The idea is perfect, but I do not think it is doable because it will absolutely decimate rural Ireland.  When I speak about rural Ireland, I am not suggesting that this is an attack on rural Ireland.  I am talking about urban areas as well.  As many speakers have said, there are almost 13,000 km of roads in County Cork alone.  Councils are struggling to keep those roads surfaced,  As Deputy Stanley said a while ago, we need the existing surface that is there to try to work with the transport we have.  I could not see this being doable if it is going to affect budgets.  I need clarity on that.</p></speech>

There is a focus on trying to stop people from using their cars so frequently and encouraging them to use public transport instead.  If the intention of these amendments or recommendations is to take away the road transport budget that is used for the resurfacing and construction of roads, it is a ridiculous idea, as other people have said.  I am not just talking about rural areas because this point applies to Dublin as well.  When we had a bad winter, all the roads in Dublin crumbled because of the cheaper materials which had been brought in.  I spent years on the council trying to get those roads repaired after they had completely crumbled.  Buses would not go up and down different areas.  This is not just a rural issue.  I accept that rural areas seem to be taking the heavy hitting on this.  When I was on the Dublin Bus forum, I learned that Dublin Bus drivers will not go down certain roads in this city because of health problems like back pain caused by jumping up and down on potholes.  Poor road surfaces can have an impact on car transport, but it has a particular impact on buses as people try to get to and from their daily work.  Will all of that money disappear in favour of public transport, with the juxtaposition of not having a road to drive on?</p></speech>

I live in rural Ireland, but I do not live in the sticks if I can put it as such.  My county town has a population of 25,000 people.  We are encountering challenges as we seek to develop public bus infrastructure within the town.  I am not talking about getting people into the town; I am talking about public transport within the town itself.  When people try to get from one side of the town to the other, they find it is nearly impossible for them to do so.  In my opinion, the ring-a-link service that links certain towns could be developed further.  We have to accept the reality that roads in rural Ireland need to be maintained to an acceptable standard.  We are not looking for more roads.  Others have made this point already but it has to be emphasised again.  Many people inside and outside this room have complained time and again over the years about the standard of the roads infrastructure in rural Ireland, and indeed in urban Ireland as Senator Devine has mentioned.  It would be a sad day if we were to go down the road of letting our roads crumble, which would be the implication of this amendment.</p></speech>

I would like to give reassurance, if I can.  Obviously, safety comes first.  The first priority in the roads budget must be maintenance.  We must make sure our existing roads are safe.  I believe that can be done while at the same time allocating two thirds of the budget to public transport - to rail and bus services.  That is in line with the national planning framework, which was very good and very clear.  It made it clear that we needed to bring life back into the centres of our towns and villages, to decarbonise and to pursue a completely different planning and development model, which would come with providing public transport.  Unfortunately, the national development plan abandoned that and maintained the existing system of roads-based development.  The best example I can think of is in the Chairman's constituency.  I am aghast when I look at the development plans for Galway because they are out of date, old-fashioned and not properly sustainable.  Galway is going to develop out to the motorway that has been planned.  I would prefer to spend &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million on the western rail corridor than on such a motorway.  This would ensure the 30,000 people who drive into Galway from distant locations every day are not stuck in roundabouts outside industrial estates.  I think that would make for a city that works.  If we keep going with the sprawling road-based development model, it will cripple our economy.  It affects people's quality of life to have to spend so much of their time in cars rather than with their families and friends.</p> <p>  I want to reiterate that this is not anti-rural.  I will cite my own example in support of that.  My main job for 15 years of my working life involved getting people to Mayo and Kerry from Shannon and Dublin airports.  Every time a tourist from Germany or elsewhere rang me to say he would be arriving in Shannon Airport at midday and wanted to know how he could get to Mayo or Kerry that day, I was mortified to have to say it could not be done in the same day.  That was my lived experience.  It was the same experience all over the country.  We do not have a proper rural public transport system.  I agree with Senator Lombard that we need to think about this creatively.  The switch we need to make in transport does not just involve a move from petrol cars to electric cars - it also involves all sorts of clever and sophisticated car-sharing models which, first and foremost, should benefit rural Ireland.  We should be looking at the other services that school buses can provide in local communities after the school run has finished for the day.  We should make sure every post van that delivers to a rural community has seats in it so that it can turn into a bus.  We can be creative and innovative in this area.  The first priority should be rural Ireland because people in rural Ireland are suffering worst from the deficiencies in our public transport system.  We will not be able to do that unless we spend money on public transport.  If we keep going with a roads-based system, as the existing national development plan does, we will not deliver on the objective of the national planning framework to deliver public transport.  All our people in rural and urban areas are being crippled by being stuck in our cars all the time.  If we make a switch, we will have a better quality of life.</p></speech>

Efforts are being made already by county councils to reduce speed limits on many roads within their functional areas.  Are we talking here about the speed limits on motorways and national secondary routes like the N80 and the M52 or are we talking about regional roads like the R564 as well?</p></speech>

It did not have any plan or clear pathway over the next ten years for closing the 100 million tonne gap that we have.  However, the one initiative that the Department did cite was a reduction in the motorway speed limit by 10 km/h, to 110 km/h for cars and 80 km/h for HGVs, which it estimates would save 2 million tonnes.  That is not a small amount and the initiative might also improve safety too.  It is a very practical measure.  We have to figure out where we are going to get the 100 million tonnes in savings.  It is all about the carbon and the speed limit reduction would yield a 2 million tonne saving.</p></speech>

The Green Party proposal is to reduce the top speed limits to achieve immediate cost-effective emissions reductions, but Deputy Ryan has just said that the carbon saving that this would yield is only an estimate.  I do not know if there is enough evidence available to warrant supporting this proposal.  I would imagine that the estimate is probably correct and I do not want to walk away from the proposal.  However, there is insufficient evidence to support it right now.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 46 from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith recommends the introduction of free public transport.  I know that this has happened already in a number of European cities but I am not sure how effective it has been.  There is also the issue of ring-fencing funding for the promotion of public transport.  I know that many European countries subsidise their public transport systems to a far greater degree than we do here.  The public transport network in Ireland has been run down and neglected in comparison with Europe.  That said, I would like this amendment to be referred to the standing committee because I cannot make an informed choice at the moment in the absence of sufficient evidence.</p></speech>

I was hoping she would grasp the irony of what I was saying.  The reason I put forward the recommendation was because I believe we will find over a short period that it will be the way to go across many nations in Europe and beyond.</p> <p>  We costed this as a budgetary measure in our last pre-budget submission.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport gave us separate figures and the figures tally.  Lo and behold, it was approximately &euro;600,000 per year to provide free public transport on all bus and railway networks.  Obviously, the previous discussion included how the bus and railway network we have is not sufficient and we would like to see it expanded.  Would it not be wonderful as a start at least to make a commitment?</p> <p>  I appeal to colleagues to read the recommendation.  I am not saying we should ditch everything tonight and go for free public transport in the morning.  People should not misinterpret it.  The committee is being asked to recommend that the Government would make a commitment to introduce free public transport as a long-term policy goal to help reduce our emissions and to take people out of private car usage.  Advanced states like Luxembourg are moving rapidly towards this.  That is evidence of how it helps to change people's behaviour.  The discussion tomorrow, like an earlier discussion, will all be about how we change behaviour.  This is a sensible measure to change people's behaviour and get them out of cars, and I hope committee members will support it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1328" speakername="Tom Neville" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032700002#UU00400"><p>I wish to comment on the speed limit.  Again, it goes back to practicality especially when we are talking about distance and time.  What matters is whether we are half an hour or an hour from a given destination as opposed to thinking in kilometres.  I share the view expressed by Senator Devine about the facts and figures around this.  We have different types of cars and fuel consumption as well as different driver behaviour and habits.  It is different depending on whether there is congestion.  All these different parameters are relevant if we are to find out by exactly how much we could reduce the figures.</p> <p>  If anything, we should focus more on implementing and policing the speed limits we have currently.  Many drivers are driving above the current speed limits.  Maybe we could look at it in that way.  I have reservations around bringing the speed limits back.  It might get people's backs up too much.  We are trying to bring the public with us in trying to address climate change.  It could be a matter for discussion in the standing committee further down the line.  At the moment I have reservations about it.</p> <p>  The flip side of free public transport is that we have to see how to pay for it.  Again, that is a matter of practicality.</p></speech>

The first recommendation suggests reducing top speed limits.  It makes perfect sense.  We are talking about reducing the speed limits by 10 km/h.  A major advertising campaign is under way to reduce the speed limit on the M50.  It is counter-intuitive but it makes everyone get through quicker because all the traffic goes at the same speed and everyone moves better instead of some of us racing on and getting into a traffic jam and sitting there waiting.  It makes sense.  I drive from Donegal every week to this place.  I know that I can drive like a madman and get here ten minutes quicker.  It makes sense to reduce the speed limits.  We should consider our cars.  They perform far better at a lower speed.</p></speech>

I am sorry for cutting off Deputy Pringle.  I am trying to get through my speakers.  I gather he wants to speak on the two recommendations.</p></speech>

We are not talking about the world of communism when we are referring to places like Luxembourg.  Free public transport makes perfect sense.  We need to think outside the box.  We need to look at alternatives to make this work and it makes sense.</p></speech>

We built motorways to speed up connectivity between cities and so on.  If we are moving towards electric vehicles in future and they are travelling on the motorway at 120 km/h, there is the possibility of zero emissions.  The question of balance arises here.  There is also the effect on business and deadlines and whatever goes through.  I do not see it.  I could possibly go with Senator Devine's suggestion and put it back in for further discussion, but I think the situation is ludicrous at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.535" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1237" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032700002#UU01000"><p>I wish to comment on recommendation No. 45.  We have the experience in Kildare of the M7 where the third lane is being built at the moment.  The cars are reduced to 60 km/h.  I can assure committee members that those cars are on the road for longer.  There is a question of balance.  They are on the road pumping out fumes for longer.  As Deputy Neville has said, there is a question of balance between time and distance that needs to be factored in.  I would struggle to support recommendation No. 45.</p> <p>  Recommendation No. 46 calls for free public transport.  We need to be realistic when we talk about a panacea and lovely ideas of free transport for all, something we would all love.  Ultimately, that would take away from the likes of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and others.  The part of their income that does not come from the State subvention comes from paying passengers who use the service.  The experience in some countries of this measure is that people who would walk small distances take the bus when it is for free.  They hop on because it is available free rather than pay a &euro;1 fare.  It could have a negative impact in terms of usage.  Certainly, it would mean that the taxpayer and the State would have to fill the gap that would be lost.  This coupled with principle from the same Deputy of not increasing income from carbon pricing suggests it is simply fairy-tale economics.  Who is supposed to pay for all this?</p></speech>

There is no such a thing as free anything in this world, or if there is I have not found it yet.  Someone has to pay from somewhere.  If there is to be free transport or free water, dare I say it, or whatever, someone has to pay.  It will have to come out of the overall kitty and it will not be free.</p> <p>  Another point arises on speed limits.  I remain to be convinced on the matter.  I suggest that as a compromise the idea should be referred to the standing committee for further investigation.</p></speech>

We need to acknowledge the difference between one part of the world and another.  In my part of the county there are villages and major towns with poor transportation links.  If we were to take away the funding in place at the moment, we would have a major deficit to try to promote more actual transportation, especially rural transportation.</p> <p>  We really need to think about the motorway issue.  Are we really going to say that Cork is an extra 50 minutes from Dublin?  How would that work out for a regional spatial plan?</p></speech>

There is also the question of whether Ireland is in compliance with EU directives in respect of the safe migration of fish, particularly salmon.  That is causing significant consternation for fishing interests on the ground but also there is the question of whether the Government is to fund the repairs or whether because Cork County Council is the owner of the weir it has the obligation.  There is also the question of what that budget would be.

We received a note from the petitioner who said it should be noted that the Office of the President is subject to public scrutiny via the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and the President&rsquo;s office was very topical last October.  People questioned whether we should be delving into that particular area.  We published our fifth periodic report two weeks ago and it included a chapter on this issue.  I note what the petitioner said, namely, that as a citizen of Ireland who pays his tax, he feels concerned that the spending of the President is not made public in detail.</p> <p>  The Office of the President has a spend of X that is public and it comes before the Committee of Public Accounts.  There is an audit committee which we probed as well in terms of how it met our requirements.  That was laid bare prior to the election and indeed since as well.  While there is a spend of X on the Office of the President, what is not taken into account is the whole plethora of associated expenditure for the President, let us call it Y, which does not come under the auspices of the Office of the President but comes under the remit of several other Departments. The petitioner&rsquo;s point in terms of the President being answerable to the Comptroller and Auditor General is correct and there is an audit committee up and running as well.</p> <p>  We brought the relevant Accounting Officer before the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach is answerable on the Office of the President but he does not answer for all the other additional expenditure.  I refer, for example, to the Garda, which is the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality, and the OPW, which comes under the remit of the Department of Finance.  It is just like local government, which is not answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts, which has a plethora of different funds flowing into it, a myriad of things as the Comptroller and Auditor General has said.  The Office of the President is nearly on a par, although nothing could top the local government situation, as other Departments are involved.  What we said at the Committee of Public Accounts is that committees in previous D&aacute;ileanna were perhaps lax in not having that Vote examined.  It is part of a number of Votes that come before the Committee of Public Accounts, as it should, and in that respect there is a more stringent examination of what is being spent there.  That should be noted as well.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleague, Andrew Murphy.  Andrew is a project worker with the IFCA national support helpline.</p> <p>  The Irish Foster Care Association is the representative body for foster care in Ireland and promotes excellence in foster care.  IFCA has 2,036 members comprised of foster families, social workers, social care workers, academics and those with an interest in foster care.  I have included information about IFCA in Appendix 2 of our submission so I will not dwell on the details further.</p> <p>  Foster care is the backbone of care for children who are in the care of the State in Ireland.  Ireland is unique insofar as the majority of children who are in the care of the State grow up experiencing family life.  This is testament to the value of the importance of family in our society and is reflected in our legislation.  We need to celebrate the fact that the majority of these children are growing up as happy confident young people who attend school every day.  Children in foster care are thriving and foster families offer secure happy and fulfilling childhoods to children while supporting them to reach their full potential.  A recent report by the Irish Penal Reform Trust found that, in general, children in foster care are not involved in juvenile justice.  This is another positive indicator for children who grow up in foster care.</p> <p>  The committee has invited IFCA to appear this morning to talk about the recruitment and retention of social workers in Tusla.  The role of the social worker is central to the care system in Ireland and for foster families.  The majority of children in the care of the State live with foster carers.  At the end of September 2018 there were 6,044 children in care, of whom 92% were placed in foster care.  Some 26% of these were with relative foster carers.  During the same period, there were 3,287 foster carers on Tusla foster care panels. </p> <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has the statutory responsibility to approve foster carers and place children with them.  The National Standards for Foster Care document makes provision for Tusla to contract other agencies to provide foster care on its behalf.  The national standards document also requires Tusla to ensure that foster care placements are adequately supported and that children in care have an allocated social worker.</p> <p>  The process of becoming a foster carer is rigorous and is governed by Tusla procedures and guidelines for foster care committees.  The procedures outline the assessment process of prospective foster carers conducted by social workers.  Foster care committees are convened by Tusla and approve foster care applicants.  Reports on the review of foster carers, recommendations to remove a foster carer from the fostering panel, the outcomes of investigations of allegations made against foster carers and placement breakdown are also adjudicated at the local foster care committee.</p><p>The role of the social worker is, therefore, central to all aspects of foster care.</p><p> The national standards for foster care set out a range of standards to be attained for the child, the foster carer and Tusla.  Specifically, there is a requirement for the child to have a dedicated social worker and the foster carer to have a dedicated link social worker who provides support to the foster carer.  A child and family social worker visits the child in the foster home and maintains links with the child's birth family.  This role centres on a responsibility for the safety and welfare of the child.  The national standards for foster care set out the requirements of the roles of the child in care social worker, and the link social worker.  The specific requirements of each of these roles are outlined in appendix 1.</p><p> Standard 5 requires a designated social worker for each child and young person in foster care.  Standard 14 requires the assessment and approval of foster carers by a trained and qualified social worker.  Standard 15 requires that approved foster carers are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker, also known as the link social worker, to ensure that foster carers have access to the information, advice, and professional support to enable them to provide high quality care.  Standard 16 requires that foster carers participate in the training necessary to equip them with the skills and knowledge required to provide high quality care.  Standard 17 requires foster carers to participate in regular reviews of their continuing capacity to provide high quality care and to assist with the identification of gaps in the fostering service.  The provision of both standards 16 and 17 are also a requirement of the link social worker.  All of these standards are clear in the requirement for social workers to carry out these statutory functions.  Without the required numbers of social workers, there are significant pressures on our children in care system.</p><p> The committee has invited IFCA to discuss the challenges to the retention and recruitment of social workers in Tusla.  The requirements and roles of the social worker are many and varied, and it is for this reason that I have listed those requirements as set in the national standards in appendix 1 of this paper.  The child in care is required to have his or her own social worker and the foster carer is also required to have his or her own link social worker.  There are currently more than 6,000 children in care and more than 4,500 foster families, and they all require the services of social workers.</p><p> IFCA is aware of the current shortfall of social workers and of foster families and children who do not have an allocated social worker.  The shortfall is acute in some local Tusla areas.  The challenge is that the many requirements for children and foster carers, as required under the national standards, are not being met.  For example, some foster carers do not have a link social worker.  The impact of this is that they do not have access to supports required, particularly when the foster carer requires support in identifying pressures building within the placement.  Research indicates that prior to the making of an allegation of abuse against a foster carer by a child, the foster carer noted increased behavioural problems, and many requested respite supports prior to the allegation being made.</p><p> For the child, the absence of a dedicated social worker does not allow the child to build and maintain a meaningful relationship with the person who is charged with being his or her corporate parent.  It is important for children to develop a trusting relationship with their social worker, particularly if they are unhappy with any aspect of their placement.  On a practical level, the child's social worker is responsible for giving consent for all aspects of the child&rsquo;s life such as going on school tours, sleepovers with friends and travelling with the foster family.  The absence of a social worker to give written consent may mean that the child cannot participate in the normal everyday activities of other children.</p><p> IFCA is aware of the ongoing strategies of Tusla to recruit more social workers and as is true with any employer, retention of staff is key as well as recruitment.  During 2018, while 142 social workers were employed within Tusla, 158 social workers left, as a result of retirement and movement to different sectors.  This places great strain on Tusla to meet its statutory requirements for children in care and for foster carers.  Analysis of the reasons for movement to other employment of any staff through exit interviews informs an employer's staff retention strategies and may inform Tusla of the causes of such movement.  It has been suggested in presentations to the committee by other contributors that the number of social worker graduates annually falls short of the requirements of Tusla, and that the Minister and her Department have initiated discussions with third level institutions to seek solutions.</p><p> The rationale for setting out the role and responsibility of the child in care social worker and the foster carer link social worker is to propose that some aspects of the role could be carried out by a transdisciplinary team, including a range of suitably qualified professionals.  Tusla could develop teams of social workers and allied health professionals which provide a range of services and supports to children in care and to foster carers, supervised by a team social worker.  The combination of roles and responsibilities could enhance the service to children and foster families appropriately but also reduce some of the requirements of the social worker, enabling them to focus on the key statutory requirements of the role.  For example, a social care worker or allied health professional could support the children during access visits with their families if they are uncontested.  They could also assist in co-ordinating care planning meetings or professionals' meetings and make referrals for specialist services for the child under the direction of the social work team leader.  Allied healthcare professionals could support foster carers in aspects of their role, doing one-to-one work with children, whether practical or therapeutic, and offering timely support to foster carers with the link social workers retaining the supervisory role.  All of this work would support the work of the social worker who always holds statutory responsibility.</p><p> Greater enhanced rights for foster carers could eliminate the requirement for the social worker to give consent and where a child is in a long-term stable placement, the foster carer could assume more autonomy.  IFCA has included this suggestion to Department of Children and Youth Affairs in its submission in the review of the Child Care Act 1991.  Such supports to current social workers would reduce some of their core role as well as having more manageable caseloads, and thus support retention.  Other supports to the role of the social worker could be to engage an organisation such as IFCA, the representative body for foster care in Ireland, to co-ordinate and offer training and support groups to foster carers, in collaboration with and on behalf of Tusla.  IFCA is in the unique position in that it currently provides such services already.</p><p> Tusla takes a child into care where there is a concern for his or her welfare or protection.  Front-line social work is demanding and challenging, and social workers working in this area require manageable caseloads and higher levels of support.  Consideration could be made to having a lessened caseload, higher levels of support and supervision, and offering additional allowances to those working at the front line to ensure retention of skills and knowledge.</p><p> The challenges of entering social work can be great and overwhelming for any new graduate.  Consideration could be given to offering new social work staff a mentor for the first 12 months in their new role.  This will support the new social workers and provide them with access to expertise and knowledge as they embark on their new role within Tusla.  Group supervision and peer support is evidenced as being of great support and learning to all staff.  Having forums which offer regular peer support and shared learning would enhance the employment environment for new staff.  UK and Northern Ireland universities offer social work qualifications to social care staff who wish to attain a qualification in social work.  These qualifications are gained through a combination of in-work placement and part-time study.  Currently, any postgraduate student who wishes to study social work in Ireland must return to college on a full-time basis.  This is not feasible for many employed social work staff.  In addition, social care staff generally work in the areas of residential care, addiction and homelessness services, which offers them comprehensive insight into the challenges faced by children and families.  These staff have a wealth of knowledge, skills and expertise to bring with them to study the requirements of social work.  To attract such students, bursaries could be offered by Tusla to attract social care workers to study social work in third level institutions which will provide this mode of study, who would then be required to remain in employment with Tusla for a defined period.</p><p> IFCA welcomes this opportunity to share its knowledge and experience of foster care in Ireland with the committee, and our suggestions for the recruitment and retention of social workers in Tusla, who play a vital role in the area of children in care in Ireland, of whom there are 6,044.  IFCA advocates for excellence in foster care in Ireland on behalf of our members and we work in close collaboration with Tusla to achieve this.  We are fully supportive of Tusla&rsquo;s drive to recruit and retain social work staff and offer our suggestions to support this.  Foster care is the backbone of childcare in Ireland and requires robust infrastructure to support it.  Without social workers and the required supports, this cannot be achieved.  Foster carers must receive the supports required to enable them to care for children with very complex problems on behalf of the State.  Supports must be timely and available, and foster carers should not have to lobby for services which are a right for children, or for the right to have a dedicated social worker to support them in their fostering role.  The national standards for foster care requires that both children in care and foster carers have dedicated social workers.  IFCA acknowledges that Tusla has made improvements in the allocation of social workers.  However, to achieve a full complement of staff to meet the needs of both children in care and foster carers, we need to identify other ways to ensure that the requirements of the standards are achieved.  This may be achieved through the implementation of the suggestions proposed by IFCA today.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is just me, but I was very shocked to read that there are more than 6,000 children in State care.  It is a far higher number than I expected.  It is sad that so many children have to go into State care.  It puts substantial pressure on the system and on foster care families.  What is case load for a social worker?  How many families would a link social worker ordinarily have in his or her workload?  How many children in foster care do social workers working in that area have to manage?  Are social workers working way beyond capacity?</p> <p>  The witnesses said that the national standards for foster care are not being met because of the shortage of social workers.  Can they identify the standards that are not being met?  A list was provided at the back of the appendix, but which standards are being left to one side?  They also said that there is a shortfall in the number of social workers, but that it is more acute in some Tusla areas.  Where are the problem areas in the country?</p> <p>  I take on board and agree with some of the solutions offered by the witnesses.  It is great to see that solutions are being offered.  There are only so many graduates that can progress through college at any one time.  Enhancing the rights of foster parents to do more, including signing consent forms, for example, seems very practical and reasonable.  What was the response of the Department when that suggestion was made?  Are the witnesses still waiting for a response?  I am also particularly interested in the fact that social workers here have to go back to full-time education whereas in the UK in-house training and part-time study options are available, which makes far more sense.  If one is in full-time work, paying bills and looking after a family, leaving work to go and study full-time is just not feasible.  Has that been put to the Department?  What was its response?</p></speech>

There is an approximate guideline of around 30 cases per social worker, but that can be quite a high number, depending on the complexity of the issues facing the children in care.  We also note from our members who are foster carers that if a new infant is placed in foster care, a court can direct that the foster carer bring that baby to access four or five times a week to attain and retain an attachment with the child's birth parent.  It is crucially important, but it requires that a social worker ensures that access happens.  The courts are also directing that social workers report to the court more frequently , especially with younger patients.  While these are all very important tasks, they are very time-demanding for social workers.  The question of weighting case loads is something to which Tusla should respond.  There are structures within the agency to allow for weighted case loads.</p> <p>  In terms of standards not being met, the most recent HIQA report, which was a combined report on foster care standards, highlighted the need for foster care reviews to be undertaken.  This was not work that was conducted in the past.</p></speech>

Within the national standards for foster care review, foster carers are required to undergo a review every six months after the first placement and regularly for a number of years thereafter.  This is an opportunity for the foster carer to reflect on the foster care placement, on his or her own learning and development and the needs of the children for whom they are caring.  The increase in the regularity of reviews for foster carers is also placing more time restrictions on social workers.  It is about finding a balance between the increased demands on the need for foster carers and the increased demands by children in care.  We have to consider what is reasonable and realistic for a social worker to do in that respect.</p> <p>  As my colleague mentioned, there is a requirement for social workers to provide regular support and supervision to foster carers.  That is a requirement and regularly occurs-----</p></speech>

It provides an opportunity for both the link social worker and the foster carer to identify the supports required for the placement, but it does not always happen because of the demands on social workers.  On the flip side, it leaves foster carers feeling very vulnerable and volatile.  If they are dealing with a child with very complex behaviours and needs and contending with that in their family unit all day, every day, without the associated supports, it can be very challenging.  In turn, it can contribute to placement breakdowns.</p> <p>  In terms of the areas with more acute problems, we are aware from meetings with the local area manager in the Carlow-Kilkenny area that there is a severe shortage of social workers in that geographical area.  While the local team are making a great effort to ensure that services are delivered, they are spread very thinly because the number of social workers is not being recruited in some of those areas.  Laois-Offaly is another area where new social workers had been recruited, but because others left, there is a shortage again.</p></speech>

New social workers are coming in but are moving on very quickly.  I refer to our opening statement where I said that it is critical for a child in care to develop a very open and trusting relationship with the social worker overseeing his or her care.  It is very important that the child is allowed to build up this relationship.  If he or she has anything he or she wants to say or is unhappy with a placement, it is important that he or she has a named person with whom a relationship has been developed and who is available so that anything that needs to be disclosed can be disclosed.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is working to respond to our submission under the review of the Child Care Act.  We will seek an update on that.</p></speech>

The review of the Child Care Act is looking at the concept of permanency for children in foster care.  There are many children who spend many years with foster families who may not require the same high level of social work support, and subsequently the family could be allowed more autonomy.  The concept of enhanced rights for foster carers allows that they can give consent in certain areas in the child's life if the child has been with that foster carer for more than five years.  The foster parent in that instance would not be required to contact a social worker if a child is to go on a school trip, for example.  At the moment, a social worker has to give consent to that, meaning that he or she has to go to the house to give consent or the foster carer has to go to the Department to get consent.  Those are regular, normal, nice things for children, and the last thing anyone wants is for a child in care not to be able to go on a school trip because nobody was available to give the consent.  The area of enhanced rights for foster carers has to be looked at so that consent can be offered for certain areas of the child's life.  This proposal formed part of our submission to the Department.</p></speech>

That might involve a school outing or holidays with the foster family.</p><p>There is a lot of red tape involved.  It could be beneficial to revisit the enhanced rights which were part of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2007.  A child who is doing well and is in a stable placement is most likely to stay with that family for his or her entire life.  Many members of the Irish Foster Care Association, IFCA, have children who came to them as babies and are now with them into adulthood and beyond.  They are not going anywhere.  It regularises life for the child and the family.</p></speech>

This meeting is certainly assisting us in understanding the dynamic between the IFCA, the people it represents, and officialdom.  How would the witnesses characterise the IFCA's relationship with Tusla?  Is it a positive relationship?  Does the IFCA leadership feel it is being listened to and its recommendations are bearing some fruit?</p></speech>

We meet Tusla at senior level, including with the CEO and director of operations, and at local level.  It is a constructive relationship through which we can raise issues of concern for foster carers.  That is what our organisation is there for.  It is also a constructive relationship in that we seek to find solutions together.  Ultimately, everybody is working in the best interests of children and to ensure that foster care retains that very valuable status in society.  We are quite unique in Ireland in our approach to children in foster care.</p></speech>

That suggests to me that there is a big gap.  The foster carer and the child have the right to a social worker.  Could the risk increase dramatically if the relationship between the carer and the child deteriorates in any way?  If we do not have an accurate figure for how many of the 5,000 children in foster care arrangements are without a link social worker, there is a possible or potential risk of some of those relationships being in a state of disrepair.  We might not know that.</p></speech>

As it stands, foster carers have access to a social worker.  There is no gap.  Foster carers have a number by which to contact Tusla if they have a concern.  Foster carers generally use the Irish foster carers' helpline quite frequently.  If they have a problem, they resort to our helpline and we put them in contact with the most appropriate person.  Foster carers are assured that there is somebody to call, but the relationship is very important.</p></speech>

We are trying to plug that gap, so to speak.  If there is no link social worker for a particular family and issues arise for the foster carer or the child, the risk is offset by a mechanism allowing the foster carer to contact the IFCA via the helpline.  Does recourse exist for a child where he or she is at risk?  We assume the relationship is benign and positive and we concur with Ms Bond about the good work done by people who care for children in a fostering arrangement.  We have to have regard, however, to the fact that if there is a shortage of social workers, the risk profile increases and child protection issues become even more prevalent.  If there are 5,000 children in foster care arrangements, and like the witnesses we do not have exact figures, there is a major gap in the service and the risk to children is potentially increased.  That is my impression.  Perhaps the witnesses can disavow me of that or help me to understand further.</p></speech>

If there has been a break, for example, when a foster worker has not had a social worker for some time and is then allocated one, it can take time for a relationship to build.  Decisions may have been made during the period without a social worker.  A new social worker might have to backtrack and fix some of those decisions.</p></speech>

The foster care committee guidelines are quite prescriptive.  The committee includes an area medical officer, a psychologist, a principal social worker and a range of other professionals.

The former Deputy Pat Rabbitte is now chair of Tusla.  He came before the committee some weeks ago and the recruitment and retention of social workers was a key area that he wanted to discuss.  In parallel with the IFCA, he also raised bridging education that would upskill social care staff.  If people have identified this as an issue that has been ongoing for many years, why has the system not bridged that gap?  Why is it that instead of going back into full-time education, social care staff cannot do a bridging or postgraduate course that would see them suitably qualified?  What is the IFCA's perception of the gaps there?  Why has that not happened?</p></speech>

It takes a lot.  A member of staff will have gone through a degree in social care.</p><p>They will have a certain level of training and a certain perspective on their training.  Social work is a different profession from social care.  There should and could be a practical way to solve that issue through some mechanism such as the Deputy described.  It should be possible to bring qualified social care workers who have a degree into the other profession in a more streamlined way than what is required at the moment, which is to go back and do a full-time, two-year master's degree.</p></speech>

It is about trying to be creative and seeing what could be possible.  Something like that certainly could be attractive to people.  On the flip side, they would have to sign up to being with Tusla for a period of time if they were in receipt of that kind of bursary, which would assure the retention of those staff into the future with Tusla.</p></speech>

The figures are approximately 6,000 in care and 5,000 in foster care.  How do we encourage people to become foster carers or foster parents, to use that expression?

It is a two-week promotion of foster care and the benefits of being a foster carer.  In parallel to it, we run an annual survey.  We ask foster carers what attracts them to being a foster carer and what they offer.  The majority would say if that anyone who wants to become a foster carer should talk to another foster carer as that is the best way to get information, as well as doing their own research.  That is what our survey showed.</p> <p>  We really need to ensure that we retain our current foster carers as well as creating the environment for others to enter into becoming foster carers.  It all comes back to the importance of supports for foster carers.  It is really critical when somebody says they have a child with very complex needs, the placement is getting very stressed and they are all very stressed in the household, that somebody is there to respond and de-escalate the situation.  If somebody has the supports that are required, he or she will stick with the task.</p></speech>

The perception I have is that for foster carers, the placement can be quite difficult if they do not have supports.  Presumably foster carers are constantly fighting with the HSE and Tusla for additional services.</p></speech>

Our national support helpline took over 900 calls last year from foster carers, who were generally seeking help.  As I would always say, people do not generally ring our helpline to say things are fantastic and life is great.  They call when they are experiencing a difficulty or require assistance and supports.  That is the objective of our helpline.  We have part-time national advocates who can meet with foster parents, as well as national support volunteer advocates.  Prevention is always the best cure.  If the supports are there, foster carers are feeling held and supported and they have the necessary tools to do the job they are tasked to do, that is a good news story for foster care.</p></speech>

We can provide breakdowns of the counties in which issues are quite prevalent.  In the past, the vast majority of calls were around how to become a foster carer but that is decreasing now.  The predominant ones now would be, for example, where an allegation of some kind has been made against a foster carer and he or she has just received the news, is very distressed and picks up the phone.  I might pass this on to Mr. Murphy because he is dealing with these issues at the coalface.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.625" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019032700002#F01100"><p>The areas that are particularly prevalent are allegations; difficulties with access, demands placed on foster carers, difficulties around arrangements, all of that kind of stuff; and after care.  We have come a long way in dealing with the after care issue.  There is a national standardised process rolled out around that which has worked really well.  Underlying all of the issues is a communications issue in terms of with working with Tusla, the demands placed on foster carers, their understanding of the limits of their role, their desires to be able to be parents to these children while being able to enjoy family life, being able to provide these children with the normal experiences.  Sometimes that goes wrong and things do not go to plan.  Things can be reported on or understood in different ways and there can be difficulties in trying to work all of that out so that everybody can come to an understanding of the situation.  Relationships can be eroded during those times of conflict, particularly in respect of allegations if a child has a perception that he or she was mistreated.  A foster carer might have a totally different understanding of what happened but that child might have to be removed for their own safety and the placement might naturally have to end at that point.  It is a very complicated and convoluted situation.</p></speech>

Obviously the desire is always that a new infant would go home to the natural parent and all attempts are made to ensure that happens.  However, if there is a requirement for the foster carers to attend access four, five or six times a week, their family suffers and their own children do not get to go to soccer practice or dance practice.  We must remember that foster care is taking place in a family home, not in an institution.  It is around the demands on the foster carers and the need to be realistic that they are providing care to a child but it is within the context of a family home.</p></speech>

There are about 6,000 children in foster care in the State.  Would the witnesses have any figures or any idea as to how we might compare with some of our near neighbours in terms of the prevalence of foster care as a support for children growing up in environments inappropriate to a successful upbringing, if there is such a thing?  Based on our population is there comparative data?</p></speech>

We have the highest number of children growing up in family care as opposed to institutional or other types of care.  The Irish Foster Care Association would always say that foster care is the jewel in the crown for children in care in the Irish State.  It is an area that needs to be protected, supported and invested in.</p></speech>

I think the Irish Foster Care Association represents 1,300 foster families, is that correct?</p></speech>

There is a need for social workers and if there is a shortage, there is a need for other types of social workers.  Everyone has had the same level of training regardless of who their employer is.</p></speech>

The idea around children in care is to have as permanent a situation as possible for children in families, if that family is permanent, and for the people who are supporting that family to have a permanency around them also.  Obviously there are times that people have to move on and change but the current level of change is seen as a lot to absorb by many families with regard to different styles and personalities and so on.  If agency staff are being used there will, invariably, be a tendency for agency staff to move on quicker than permanent staff.  Employing agency staff before permanent staff gets back to a level of risk.</p></speech>

Foster carers, however, routinely would say to us that they have to go back to the beginning and tell the story all over again with each person.  The children in care would also say the same.  It is not fair to ask children in care to keep rehashing the reasons they are in care or so on.</p></speech>

If a child is referred to and reared by a foster family, how many social workers would the foster carer or child go through over the course of the fostering of that child?  I am not sure of the length of the average stay, but let us say it is ten years.  In the normal course of affairs how many times will the child and the family have to retell the story?</p></speech>

There are some black spots, which Ms Bond mentioned when responding to Deputy Chambers.  Of great concern to me is the area of Dublin's inner city.  Have we seen a rise in the number of gaps in the system with children or foster families not being allocated a social worker as a result or is the figure plateauing?  I appreciate that there is a deficiency in the service.  This goes without saying.  We know there are not enough social workers.  Part of the role of this committee is to determine how we get more into the system, based on the output.  Unfortunately, the output is insufficient and so we have to be creative.  That is why the representatives' input is so important to us.  Perhaps they could try to provide further information on that.</p></speech>

The anecdotal evidence from foster carers is that in one particular area they did not have any social workers for a while, then they got a great and wonderful team and things were going really well and everyone was delighted.  Then those social workers left again very quickly.  Maybe it goes back to getting under the rationale of why people are leaving.  This is why exit interviews are very important.  If possible, they could be done anonymously on a portal or online.  We need to know why people are taking up jobs and then leaving the jobs.  Until we have that data we will not really know how we can assist in retaining social workers.</p></speech>

There is probably a cohort that is contemplating leaving or wondering about their future.  It would be worth doing something like that to capture that and try to prevent it from happening.</p></speech>

I want to ask a few brief questions because there was much touched on there.  Ms Bond has said that the Irish Foster Care Association, IFCA, has 2,036 members.  How does a foster carer become a member? Are the foster carers aware of the organisation? There are 4,523 foster carers so it appears to be nearly half and half.  Perhaps Ms Bond could address this first.</p></speech>

When a person has been before a foster care committee and has just been approved as a foster carer it is a wonderful day but it important that the information is disseminated by the committee to a new foster carer to point out the support organisations that will support and assist the foster carer.  We achieve membership through promotion of fostering fortnight and through various campaigns we run.  We have also been in discussion with Tusla to look to see how more new foster carers can become members of IFCA.  We offer an insurance policy to foster carers that protects them in the event of any allegation being made against them.  It offers the foster carers legal protection.  It is essential that foster carers would become members of IFCA.  It is always a challenge to seek and promote to get new members in.  This is one of our key objectives.</p></speech>

In my eyes social workers are amazing because not only are they the child's social worker, he or she also becomes the child's best friend.  Children turn to them.  It is exactly what the witness has said.  It is not only about replacement: it is every aspect of the child's life.  It is important that we hold on to staff.  Reference was made to families turning in.  I am aware of young children who went through eight social workers.  That has an impact.  Why are we losing this great resource?  There are fantastic people in Tusla.  Why are they walking away?  Is it down to the workload?  Is it the stress of the job?  Ms Bond has said that it could affect up to 30 cases per social worker.  Am I correct in saying that the social worker could be doing access with the children plus arranging all of the child's needs, including therapeutic?  One placement could have four children being looked after by the social worker plus the other 29 cases.</p></speech>

That figure would have to go back to Tusla to be clarified.  The Deputy is correct that for every child in foster care, and every foster carer who is parenting a child in foster care, that foster carer would have to have the foster care review, the support and the supervision and information about access.</p><p>It is that sort of work.  We may need to go to court on a number of occasions for that child.  That is why it was important to outline specifically the roles and responsibilities of both the linked social worker and the child care and social worker.  The task is enormous and we need to support our social workers to do this serious and important job.  We must provide whatever supports can be offered to allow them to do that job to the best of their ability, to retain our foster carers and support our children in care because it is incumbent on everyone to ensure we retain what we have.</p></speech>

There is a lot of work for a social worker to do in the review stages.  In some cases where voluntary care orders have been made, a review may take place twice or three times a year.  Is there a role, therefore, for foster carers who sometimes feel some of this can be a box-ticking exercise and that they have no responsibility under it?  When it comes to Garda vetting is there a way to give responsibility to foster carers to have these in place themselves?  When one's car is due an NCT, one gets a text message.  Is there a way foster carers could help to reduce workloads by doing this themselves?</p></speech>

However, I would advocate for and support foster carers to prepare themselves in respect of what they bring to a foster-care review.  We have offered training to foster carers in that regard lately and will continue to do so.  That is very much around the foster carer who comes to the foster-care review being informed and knowledgeable, identifying continuing professional development needs and issues in the foster care placement and bringing solutions forward.  The review involves a two-way relationship.  It is a two-way process rather than simply a box-ticking exercise.</p> <p>  In respect of Garda vetting, the person who is charged with doing the vetting must provide the links to the vetting service.  Someone will have to push that button to allow the foster carer to respond.</p></speech>

Does the association receive many calls from foster carers with concerns about increased access?  This also affects social workers.  If it is a supervised situation, staff are required to supervise the additional access.  Circumstances can vary.  When a placement commences, there might be access for just one family member but down the line that can change.  Is that an issue the association gets calls about?  It places a strain on people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.665" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Andrew Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019032700002#H00500"><p>Access presents one of the higher levels of difficulty that we experience on the helpline.  Some children have sibling access and grandparent access with lots of different access meetings to attend.  Social workers have to co-ordinate that and foster carers have to respond to it.  They have their own lives to arrange around all of that which can be very problematic, in particular where an increase is court ordered and has to be adhered to.  Strains will be placed on every party in that relationship to achieve the access for the child.  Access can be emotionally difficult for children who can have behavioural problems before and after access visits.  That can place a great strain on everyone involved and the emotional labour can be difficult.  Sometimes, we fail to take sufficient account of the emotional labour for everyone involved in those dynamics for children.  It can be very stressful.</p></speech>

I am not taking from the fact that children need to have access, but I am concerned that every access visit requires a report from the social worker.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

One other aspect of access is that the geographic location of the placement may be some distance from the child's family of origin.  That places a huge strain on foster carers because they have to put up substantial mileage to get from A to B on a given day, in particular if the child has been placed outside his or her community.  That has certainly introduced higher demands in respect of access for both social workers and foster carers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.670" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1372" speakername="Fintan Warfield" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019032700002#H01000"><p>I thank the witnesses for their informative submission and responses.  This time last year, I was driving to Leinster House during what must have been fostering fortnight, to which they referred, as an interview on Sean O'Rourke's programme with a couple who had fostered many, many times and gone on to adopt was broadcast.  It raised the matter in my consciousness as something to be explored later in life.  It was such a powerful piece.  Everyone needs recognition and acknowledgment.  One of my other policy interests is the arts.  Artists go continually ignored and unrewarded.  How can we give greater recognition and acknowledgement to social workers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.671" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Bond" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019032700002#H01100"><p>Everyone needs recognition and support in any job.  That requires firstly recognition and appreciation of the work one does.  That is very important but sometimes negative comments may be made about social work and social work staff.  Even changing the narrative to a positive one could be helpful.  Great work is being done within Tusla to support staff with research and development functions and portals where staff can link to more information and peer support.  It always comes back to the need for society to recognise the value that someone brings to whatever walk of life they are in and then the need for the employer to recognise it.  Employment recognition can take many forms whether it is remuneration or in the terms and conditions of work.  It is very much around changing the narrative initially.</p></speech>

However, public support is not so high profile here.  Ms Bond mentioned terms and conditions and pay.  Is pay an issue?</p></speech>

That is part of public service pay agreements.  Certainly, it is very much around what the Senator mentioned himself, namely public recognition.  Social workers work in different fields.  For example, medical social workers work with families at times of great distress and illness.  One also has social workers engaged with children in care and child protection social work, which can be very complex.  Social workers may work with families to protect children, which can mean removing the child from the family.  That can be contentious.</p></speech>

It straddles all of those forums but ultimately as a social worker, one works in the area of human rights and the rights of children and the work should be valued as that.  There needs to be a general awareness of what the role of social workers is.  It should be seen as a practice and a therapeutic endeavour social workers are trying to achieve.</p></speech>

We occupy public spaces when we make or write speeches.  In making contributions, we should recognise those positive effects.  The witnesses replied to the question of whether there was a shortage of prospective foster carers but do they think issues relating to social worker retention affect the number of persons who will consider providing foster care?</p></speech>

If somebody is hearing of negative experiences, it is not going to be quite as attractive.</p> <p>  There is always a need for foster carers because children are always coming into care.  There is an acute shortage of foster carers at present.  Foster carers who are retiring are not being replenished at the back end, as it were.  As Senator Warfield said, foster care is in an unique position.  Foster carers play a fantastic role in what they offer our society.</p></speech>

I suppose everybody knows that the optimum for a child is to grow up in a family and to have regular normal family life.  That is what foster care is offering to all 6,000 children who are growing up today in foster care.  The Irish Foster Care Association has a national annual conference every autumn and the foster carers and all the children come to that conference.  It is the best sight in the world to see all of children, the birth children, the foster carers, and the families all together and everybody having a really good time.  One sees the children in foster care who are doing so well, and even the children who are not doing so well, but all are cared for and loved.  It would do anyone's heart good to see it.</p></speech>

Was there a reason that information was front-loaded?  I would have no expectation that children in foster care would be involved in the juvenile justice system.</p></speech>

The Irish Foster Care Association assisted in the research by providing access to foster carers.  There may be a requirement to strip that report back a little bit more as to whether there are children who are presenting with high levels of difficulties in placements and high levels of aggression.  Foster carers are very resilient and robust and are less likely to report this to anybody.  It is another good outcome and it is a measured outcome for children in foster care.  Any new research that indicates the positive aspect of family home care for children is another testament to its benefit and value.</p></speech>

One can look at that and compare it with the transition for young people leaving foster care who have a longer transition period.  They might get aftercare and they might have that experience at a later time in their lives.  Research might be needed.</p></speech>

There is a dash to get the consent signed by the social worker, and the social worker might be in court for three days.  They know the foster carer is looking for them and the foster carer continues to look for them but they are tied up doing other things.  There can be the risk that the child does not get the consent and the child does not go on the school tour.  That is not what we would want and that is the reason the enhanced rights for foster carers would be very important.</p></speech>

I welcome the members again, as well as viewers who may be watching proceedings on Oireachtas television, to the public session of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>Before we commence, I am required to draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to switch off their mobile phones as they may interfere with the recording systems and prevent parliamentary reporters from fulfilling their task.  It also has a habit of interfering with the broadcasting of the proceedings.  I advise the witnesses that any submission or opening statements they make to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  After their presentation there will be engagement from the members.  I call on Ms Aine McGuirk to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am Aine McGuirk, chair of the Irish Association of Social Workers, and with me today is Joe McCarthy, one of our members of long standing who has much experience in this area.  I will keep this statement to five minutes so that we can explore issues and take questions.  It will be quite short because I discovered that five minutes is quite short when one times oneself.</p> <p>  Social workers employed in the area of child protection and welfare practise their skills in a high-risk environment where there are no perfect solutions and where their efforts are rarely recognised or acknowledged.  The nature of social work is dealing with risk, making the best professional judgment one can when one assesses a child&rsquo;s situation to be good enough for one to close the door and move on to the next child&rsquo;s story.  These are incredible professionals and we must consider how we can promote a positive view of the work they do for children and families in crisis.</p> <p>  Social workers bring a range of skills to their work as they help clients negotiate the difficult and complex systems of Irish society in the 21st century.  Families never complain when they have been waiting for a while for Tusla to come and complete an assessment of a child welfare concern.  These are largely silent, involuntary clients in an imperfect world and the social worker&rsquo;s skill is in facilitating the family or child to achieve good outcomes often against impossible odds.</p> <p>  Social workers need to be properly supported to do this difficult work and to be acknowledged by society rather than being constantly blamed.  Social workers championed the development of child protection services.  It was social workers who began to respond to child abuse in the 1970s beginning the process for a slow uncovering of a difficult and shameful past over the next decades.</p> <p>  The profession needs to attract the best to take on this work.  It needs to be carried out to the highest standards.  Social workers need to be bright, well educated, resilient, enthusiastic professionals with a drive for social justice and ethical practice.  Members should consider if they would encourage their child to pursue this career and if not, why.</p> <p>  In the IASW we have been concerned about the recruitment and retention issues in Tusla for some time.  We meet its chief operations officer, Jim Gibson, and its director of human resources, Colette Walsh.  We see no evidence of a national recruitment campaign and potential candidates must go to the Tusla website to see if there are vacancies.</p> <p>  While recruitment is certainly a significant issue leading to an overuse of expensive agency staff and presents as a significant issue nationally, retention may in fact be the more significant problem.  Just-qualified staff quickly find themselves dealing with complex child welfare and protection cases, complicated legal proceedings, and making life-changing decisions for children and families.  To support staff we must also retain in-post team leaders and principal social workers who provide essential leadership in the provision of front-line services to children and families.</p> <p>  While all social work has stresses, the children and families sector is recognised as the most difficult work.  These social workers exercise a statutory role, including the taking of proceedings under the Child Care Act 1991, and ensure the operation of State regulations with regard to children in care.  The provision of care to children and families is complex with high demands from the law, the court and its agents.  Social workers appear as applicants in the court for Tusla.  Here, their professional actions and opinion are subjected to the highest scrutiny in a different way to other professionals who appear in the case as either agents of the court or professional witnesses.  This can be extremely difficult and stressful for inexperienced social workers who are just doing their best to provide a professional service to the child who is the subject of the proceedings.</p> <p>  The work of Tusla comes under the scrutiny of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, whose representatives spoke to this committee on this issue last month.  The child and families sector is now the most regulated, inspected and audited area of social work.  While regulation is necessary and useful in ensuring compliance with agreed standards, this scrutiny is grounds for further stresses, placing an emphasis on paperwork as evidence of work done, rather than on the practice of social work.  The attendant negative attention from the media long after the inspection causes further stresses for perhaps already demoralised staff who work well beyond a standard working week to deal with the families on their caseload.</p><p> In 2019, social problems are more complex and acute than ever, and are more plentiful and concentrated in large urban centres.  Abuse, ill-treatment and neglect are found across all communities.  These situations are characterised by secrecy, emotional isolation, neediness, stress and lack of respect, often hidden under a cloak of normalcy.  Social workers become very skilled in working with this kind of family but they require time and guidance to develop such competencies.  Addiction, poor educational outcomes, abuse, unemployment, mental and physical health problems, intellectual disability, homelessness and injustice are the backdrop to the day-to-day work of a social worker.  Today, drugs are available country wide, with their attendant social problems, deprivation and marginalisation.  If one walks up Merchant's Quay, Dublin or see a wet, dirty sleeping bag filled with a sleeper in a doorway, one may well be looking at the face of a parent of a child in care, or an adult that was raised in State care.  These realities are a construction of society, not social work. </p><p> Tusla social workers deal with people in their homes and communities.  Some communities have become hostile places increasing the risks associated with home visiting.   Violence as a solution has become more commonplace, and guns and other weaponry are the tools of the drug dealer.  Tusla social workers must deal with families in all these environments, including areas that other services sometimes refuse to enter.</p><p> Today, in some social work offices, there is security at the door, restricted entry to their buildings and meeting rooms monitored by closed-circuit television cameras.  As a result, the social worker draws on all of their professional knowledge and training to deal with these families in an empathetic, supportive and helpful way.  I am increasingly struck by the capacity of these young professionals to build relationships with individuals and families in this context, and give children a chance at a better life either with their parents or in the care of foster or residential carers.  Fresh from college the young graduate may face an inevitable future as follows: work for Tusla for a couple of years - because that is where the jobs are - to get experience, and then move on to an agency where work is less high risk, clients are happy to engage, hours of attendance are predictable and conducive to a better work-life balance, and where public opinion is more positive, or work for a couple of years to earn enough money to travel and consider the future from far away sunnier climes.  Tusla must work hard to become an employer of choice where the benefits of staying outweigh the stresses of the work.  We understand that this is a difficult issue to solve quickly.  We have made suggestions in our full submission, which members received.  We are to address them now and answer any other questions they might have. </p></speech>

Five minutes do not do justice to the wider submission IFCA supplied to the committee and I sincerely thank them for articulating a way forward for us, as a committee, to deal with the issues of recruitment and retention.  I also thank Ms McGuirk for defending her colleagues because we live in times where it is easy to beat up on the social worker and he or she, in a judicial or societal setting, can be seen as the easy target for public opprobrium.  While there have been cases in the recent past and historically, relating to the quality of engagement with social workers, that was the exception and not the norm.  I have an appreciation on the basis of the submission and our deliberations on this issue of recruitment and retention generally, that it is the hidden work, which is undocumented, defines the quality of the engagement.  One cannot put a HIQA, stamp on or tick a box for the relationship building, which is vital to sustain the very system that we have.  Again, I thank the witnesses for their attendance here today and for their important submission because we now have something on which we can roll up our sleeves.</p> <p>  I would like to be educated on the day-to-day role of a social worker.  My first question is on child protection and the welfare of children.  We have had a very good interaction on foster care but I want to better understand how a case is triaged when it comes in the front door of Tusla or any other agency.  How does a child protection case land on the desk of a social worker?  We have a good interaction on foster care but I would like to discuss child protection.  How does a social worker, typically, secure a care order?   Where is the social worker in the pecking order in respect of the legal framework to secure a care order?  Let us say a social worker must go to court.  What does a typical social worker have to do from the time a case lands on the desk front-of-house to securing a care order?  How much paperwork is involved?  Once the care order is successfully applied for, what is the ratio of contact time to administrative time?  Is it 50:50 or 80:20?  Does a social worker now have to do much more administrative work with much less contact time?  Is that, within the existing cohort of social workers, having a bearing on outcomes for the relationship between the social worker and the child?  Has that contributed to a malaise or a set of circumstances whereby a social worker, after a couple of years, faces burnout and decides to leave his or her post citing an inability to deal with the work any more?  How can the nature of the relationship be changed in such a way that there is a larger quotient of social workers, a manageable workload and family-friendly hours?  Social work is a female dominated profession.  Women, in particular, will inevitably have families.  What arrangements are put in place for a female social worker who wants to continue in her profession yet wants the requisite time off and work within hours that meet the needs of her own family while allowing her to continue professionally, progress careerwise and so on?  </p> <p>  I have offloaded a load of issues.  I have a picture in my own mind about social work but the witnesses will present a picture that will help us to deal with the key issues of recruitment and retention.  I ask them to paint a picture for us of some of the points that I have outlined it will prove very useful. </p></speech>

Regarding the process when a case is referred to a child coming into the care of the State, that is dealt with at several levels.  We now have intake teams who triage the case.  The case may be passed on to the child welfare team who try to work with the family and, perhaps, in time the child has to go into care.  Mr. McCarthy has much more recent practice of this matter having served as a principal social worker and I would be grateful if he would address this.</p></speech>

I was a principal social worker for over 17 years, I was in child protection before that and I have been on the board of the IASW for a significant number of years.  The Deputy asked many questions, which reflect his curiosity to understand and highlight the complexity of social work.</p><p>As a preamble to that, let me say that I am delighted to be here because I consider the D&aacute;il to be hallowed ground and a very important place for all Irish citizens.  I am always somewhat in awe on the few occasions I have come here and I have always been interested in politics and how important it is.  I appreciate the value and worth of what politicians do on behalf of us as citizens.  I tinkered with the idea of entering into the field but my constituency is very well-served with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and with Deputies Miche&aacute;l Martin, Michael McGrath and Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire.  I will give it a miss and this will be as far as I get.</p></speech>

We are talking more specifically about staff retention and recruitment within child protection and welfare services.  When we talk about the recruitment and retention of social workers within child protection and family welfare, we are talking about child protection.  In essence, we are talking about the regard we give it, how we value it, and what we are doing about it.  Politicians know better than I do that child protection in the history of our relatively new Republic and State has not always been a priority, and the contrary has been the case.  This is what gave rise to our industrial schools and the various scandals of the Magdalen laundries, mother and baby homes and institutional abuse at various levels.  I am delighted that child protection and welfare is within the political arena, which is where it belongs.  We are talking about political commitments and priorities.  It has not always got the priority and the commitment it deserves.  We are talking here about the most vulnerable of society, the hidden side that has been referred to by Ms McGuirk.</p> <p>  I was following very closely the conversation the committee had with the Irish Foster Care Association, and that raised some very interesting topics which were raised also by speakers on other days.  One of the dangers is that we run the risk of reducing the very complex work of child protection and social work to a set of tasks and duties.  There is almost the impression that anybody can do this work.  I do not believe it is as black and white or as simple as that and is far more complex.</p> <p>  It would be very difficult to give the committee a picture of what a social worker does at any given time because they have different roles.  Once referral comes in and is activated, the assessment begins immediately of what is to be done, what the identified needs are, followed by the putting in place of a plan of action and engagement with the family and children to see what is to be done.  There may be different people involved with that.  The duty and intake section does the screening and initial contact, and then decisions are made whether further contact or assessment is needed.  The decision may be to go to court or not or to work in the community with preventative and supportive work.</p> <p>  One thing that was mentioned earlier and which is key to all of this, and this was mentioned by one of the previous speakers, is that social work, be it child protection or otherwise, is about getting involved in people's lives, intervening with them, trying to make a difference, and having good outcomes.  That depends very much on the individual and training, but essentially it rests on the relationship that can be built up between the social worker and the child or the family.  One of the aspects at the nub of the current crisis is that for various reasons and due to a lot of significant developments recently, social workers in child protection have transformed that role from what it was 15 years ago and it is not recognisable now.  That core piece of work in having enough time to develop a relationship with a child or a family to make a difference over time, which for many is at the core of social work in any setting, is not possible.  Perhaps the committee might be able to explore a little further the developments that have taken place in the past ten to 15 years.  Social work, like any other profession, happens in a particular context.  This was mentioned by other speakers on other occasions, where it is acknowledged by observers in the social work field that the decision to create a Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the subsequent establishment of Tusla as the child and family agency was a political imperative and very welcome.  It was set up far too quickly with a totally insufficient budget. That accounts to a great extent for the immediate problems we might be experiencing.  Tusla was expected to do an awful lot and did not have the wherewithal to do it.  It was set up too with a budget that was and still is totally insufficient.</p></speech>

I will be as brief as possible, allowing for the amount of time I have available, and forgive me if I took a lot of time at the start.  What is the status of the social worker in the court setting?  What is the contact time versus the administrative time?  I would like to have an understanding of those two dynamics from our committee's interaction today with the Irish Association of Social Workers.  The new chair of Tusla spoke about bridging courses to get people from social care to social work.  What are the views of the association on that suggestion?  How are academia and Tusla dealing with this idea?  Everybody has acknowledged and knows the problem of recruitment.  Should we be putting better therapeutic solutions and counselling in place for social workers themselves who work in child protection settings?  Should we be designing family friendly policies for social workers?  All of these thematic areas could contribute to a better outcome for social workers themselves and, ultimately and most importantly, for children and families.</p></speech>

When I came into social work, and I have been around for a long time now, I was just as young and inexperienced as any graduate walking out of college.  In those days, we had time, because in 1978 we had not really heard of child abuse then.  Over the next decades, those issues emerged.  With social workers like me, we had time to develop with this new knowledge and practice.  The young social worker today comes straight out of college into that world where he or she may find him or herself very quickly in a High Court dealing with a young person who has very high needs. He or she is in court as an applicant for Tusla.</p></speech>

The graduates are very capable but it is a bit like being handed one's driving licence and spending one's first day on the motorway.  That is difficult.</p><p>One has to learn with experience and over the following few years young social workers gather that experience.  There is evidence to show that if one can keep people in the field for approximately five years, they seem to get to a point where they have settled into it, feel more professional, feel they know what they are doing a little better and want to stay.  The challenge is holding the young professionals in those first few years.</p></speech>

It is stressful and daunting.  Other professionals are often given more credence and weight and the role of the social worker is gradually being eroded.  I can give the example of guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  The social workers in child protection see themselves as being there to protect and to advocate for the child but often that role is handed over to a guardian, who does not hold statutory responsibility, can develop a relationship with the child and whose function is different.  That role is taken away from the social worker.  Court has also become adversarial.  Due process must be respected and I am aware some work is being done on this but it can be extremely adversarial where everybody has a lawyer.  If one puts young social workers into that setting and they do not have the time to gradually get used to it-----</p></speech>

What is happening as well, and this is linked to court proceedings, is that social work practice is increasingly being dictated by the legal world and by other professionals.  Another example is where a social worker is involved with a family coming into care or otherwise.  A parental assessment, which is the bread and butter of social work, is important work but that is being contracted to other professionals.  One can see that, bit by bit, the essential role of the social worker is increasingly being limited, but to highly pressurised work and not necessarily specifically social work.</p></speech>

If the social worker goes into court he or she is represented in an adversarial system.  Presumably, the social worker historically would have made the assessment and made a recommendation that the child should go into whatever setting is the most appropriate.  Historically, that would have been accepted by the judge of the day.  I am assuming this and Mr. McCarthy can correct me if I am wrong.  We now have a system where there is a guardian <i>ad litem</i>and a social worker.  Presumably the guardian <i>ad litem</i>has legal representation, the social worker has legal representation, the child is represented by the guardian <i>ad litem</i>and then there is the respondent.  There could be five or six lawyers and probably a layer of experts on top of that again.  There could be a psychologist or psychiatrist in the court.  Is Mr. McCarthy saying that the psychologist or psychiatrist - he can tell us which is the appropriate profession - is then tasked with doing the assessment of the need or of the parent before a judgment is made?</p></speech>

Each case varies.  Everybody can be represented legally so if one includes the parents as well, one is talking about a lot.  That is right because there must be due process.  We are concerned that the weight is developing.  Do childcare proceedings have to take that form and be in that setting?  Do they have to be so adversarial?  It is a stressful time for everybody, including the social worker and parents.  When a young social worker is handed a caseload where there might be court proceedings that can be overwhelming, daunting and huge pressure.  Without manageable caseloads that are well supervised and a gradual induction into the process, it can be very overwhelming and quite soon a social worker will think, "I need to get out of here".  When talking about recruitment and retention of social workers, the priority should be what can be done to keep what we have.  The court is a small aspect of it, but very significant.</p></speech>

I have some brief questions on recruitment.  I am a member of a mental health committee and recruitment issues have arisen in that area because much of the recruitment takes place on a national platform as opposed to locally.  Second, people are on panels, which are quite restrictive.  They need to be more flexible.  Is there a correlation between both?</p> <p>  Ms McGuirk referred to the pressure graduates feel coming into the workforce.  I am a former teacher and when I graduated and went into the school on the first day, I went into the classroom alone and started there.  It is quite daunting, but there is a time when one gets up to speed.  However, I had senior staff I could call on, not directly but indirectly, as part of the collegiality that one would work on for advice.  A principal teacher or vice principal teacher would offer advice.  I taught woodwork and there were other woodwork teachers there I could speak to about a class.  Is there something similar to that for social workers?</p> <p>  I understand there is a points system to get onto the course.  In bygone times there would have been an interview process for some courses in college.  Is there any value in that being reintroduced?  It might alleviate the dropout rate.  This is no disrespect to people but when they are aged 16, 17 or 18 years and are asked what they are going to do for the rest of their lives, it is a difficult question to answer.  At that stage people should get a flavour of these vocational types of professions such as nursing, teaching and social work and an understanding of what they are going into as opposed to just getting the points, going into the profession, getting the job and then realising after two years that it is not for them.  A career guidance path could be used.  Have there been talks about that?  It is a demanding and rewarding profession and, as with any profession, certain people are fit for it.  That, coupled with supports, could alleviate the pressure and dropout rates.  What supports are in place for people who are starting in the profession to reach the five-year point where they feel confident and able to deal with their role?</p></speech>

With regard to getting into college, by and large, many people do a primary degree.  Social science was the traditional one, but it could be in social care or in a few allied courses.  Then they do a masters in social work.  There is also a four-year degree in Trinity College Dublin and University College Cork where people go straight through.  The degree and the masters are similar to many professions.  One must be interviewed to get a place on any of those courses.  There have always been interviews to get into social work courses because the Deputy is correct that social work is not for everybody.  The interview is part of the process to help the course providers decide who is more suitable.</p> <p>  On the issue of panels, the public service way of recruiting appears to be a very intricate system of national recruitment with panels and a very long, long way of getting from application-----</p></speech>

It strikes me as a very convoluted way of doing things.  In the past there were more local ways of recruiting but to do things in any large national way seems to take a long time.</p> <p>  In respect of supervision, Tusla has increased the number of team leaders and the team leader is the immediate supervisor of the social worker.  A team leader will have between four and six social workers to supervise.  That becomes difficult if, for example, three people leave that team of six because there are three unallocated caseloads that are the responsibility of that team leader.  The leader is trying to plug the gaps when the foster carer telephones or the child runs away from the placement, or a case has to return to court.  The support is then diluted because it is more difficult for the leader to support the team when he or she is overwhelmed with work.  How to support those first line supervisors to do that job needs to be addressed so that the young social worker is encouraged to stay and gain experience.</p></speech>

One was the centralisation of recruitment.  There was a time up to recently when there were multiple national panels, and with the emergence of Tusla Recruit there is the possibility of having regional panels and maybe bespoke panels.  It would be really helpful if the recruitment could return to being done locally because as it stands the local manager does not have any say in who comes to work with him or her.</p></speech>

It is a fact that there are more posts in all forms of social work than there are social workers.

If I were Tusla and watching this debate then I would pick up the phone and have a chat with the association as soon as possible in order to address some of these issues.  We have raised the issue of providing skilled administrative assistance with the Minister and she said she would look into the matter.  Providing such assistance makes sense.  We are not re-inventing the wheel here.  Following this meeting, perhaps the committee should take the initiative and invite Tusla here to ask its officials whether they have considered any of these options.</p></speech>

There is no shortage of suggestions on what needs to be done to maintain staff.  The obvious ones are a good working environment and provide support staff, including administrative staff.  The key point must be that the workforce is the most valuable resource one has when delivering a service.  It is important to note that not all social workers within Tusla are leaving. The turnover rate of staff is more specific to this cohort of people who work on the front line of child protection and family welfare.  There have been a lot of good developments happening in Tusla, such as preventative work and the involvement of practitioners in research but there is one key question, namely, who is going to do it?  Retaining what one already has and building supports in order that people who come in will want to stay is key.  If one can stop the exodus of so many social workers, then one can build up one's cohort bit by bit and people will be attracted to the work.  That is why we need to be cautious when we talk about recruitment and recruiting more social workers.  There is an assumption that all childcare leaders or workers will want to become child protection social workers.  Maybe they would if the role was defined in a different way and they had the capacity to do all aspects of the work that they want to do.</p> <p>  There is a danger if one follows the example in England where one has a quick course to convert people from certain professions into child protection because that option is not working there.  We must also be careful not to dumb down the profession.  Many other professions would not accept conversations of having a quick entry and dumbing down the profession.  Also, there is a danger of reducing social work to tasks, and the situation whereby the nice tasks are taken away from social workers and given to someone else, while leaving the social workers with the heavy lifting, must be avoided.  I wish to respond to the point made about access to fostering.  Other people can do access.  If one talks about the social worker having statutory responsibility, then access can be a very important part of that, as is building up a relationship with the child, the family and the foster family. </p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy hit the nail on the head with his comments.  There are children and families who have fantastic relationships with social workers and some of those relationships have continued after the children left care.  Children are key and we need to retain the quality, skilled staff we have.  The organisation needs to do stuff in terms of staff well-being because social work is a hard and emotional job.  I sometimes wonder how social workers unwind when they return to their family environments because social work is hard.</p></speech>

I mean people who are able to experience the worst because the lives some of our children have are very traumatic.  A social worker in this sector must experience that, yet go home to his or her own children or family.  That is why I say that social work is not for everybody.</p> <p>  In terms of additional courses, Institute of Technology Sligo has provided a course this year and hopes to get accreditation from CORU, and Maynooth University will provide a course from next September.  One should remember that social work was the first of the allied health or social care professions to be regulated.  Social care is a regulated profession and a protected title.  The courses that qualify people to use the protected title must fulfil CORU's remit for what constitutes a good course.  We have heard and know that CORU are not happy with the courses in England where social workers are being qualified to work in a child welfare sector only.  Social work, typically, is a broad qualification.  One does not qualify a lawyer just to work in family law.  One qualifies people to be a lawyer and then they will get experience and specialise in an area, which is the same with doctors and everybody so it is important to keep that.  </p></speech>

Typically, our social workers spend six months in placement.  When one hears people talk about doing these courses where people spend part of their time working, that is the professional social work course anyway.  People do two long placements of three months each with one placement in a sector such as probation or Tusla child welfare and the other placement in a different sector such as mental health, medical social work or whatever.  Therefore, at the end one has a person who has trained in and experienced a couple of areas of social work.  He or she can make a decision about what they might like to do in terms of their work but they do so from a broad educational and knowledgeable base.  By contrast, the aim of the courses in England seems to be to produce people to work just in this sector.</p></speech>

All of these issues can be worked out in every profession, of which I am aware.  There will always be an element of somebody learning on a part-time basis over a period of time, with the required nine-to-five full-time setting at the end of the process.  This can be done by way of the universities, the institutes of technology or the new technical college-----</p></speech>

I am sure it will feature heavily in any report or recommendations we, as a committee, will write.</p> <p>  For me, hearing that there is potential for the accrediting body to state, "No", that such a course is not good enough, is slightly concerning.  That is why I would like to get to the bottom of why Ms McGuirk made that statement.  I apologise for repeating the question, but she will understand why I question the assumption that the body may not provide accreditation for the course.  It is key to our ability to meet demand.  I am not sure whether this is the view of the accrediting body view or that of Ms McGuirk, but I would rather get social workers in the door with a narrow based qualification in the area or field within which they wish to work, rather than not have accreditation for the course and, therefore, not have that throughput of motivated individuals who want to move into a specific area of social work.</p></speech>

There is plenty of room where Tusla and the Department can enter into negotiations with the colleges and think creatively about all of the points mentioned by the committee, all of which is possible.  The working environment and what needs to be done to keep people in, once they come through the door, however they come through it, are the key issues that cannot be forgotten.</p></speech>

For every recommendation, it will have to be stated, "to be considered in tandem with X, Y or Z".  There is no one single solution, whether it be terms and conditions, workload, or dealing with a supervisor with whom a person does not get on.  At the end of the day, they are human beings; therefore, there will always be such issues.  It might also involve circumstances outside our current thinking.  Of course, there has to be a broad approach in dealing with this issue.  We are not at cross-purposes.</p></speech>

There is scope in that regard.  Many community welfare officers took the requisite courses and became social workers.  They received some funding from their employer at the time to do so.  These are not new.  The Irish Foster Care Association also mentioned the idea of bursaries.  Giving somebody a contract under which they have to work for the organisation for two or three years or whatever the appropriate period is is different from having a course and stating one is going to qualify as a social worker but can only work in Tusla.  The association would not be in favour of having such a course.</p></speech>

Some 15 years ago the position was the same.  I was sent to Chicago once by the then Southern Health Board to recruit social workers.  Therefore, this is not something new.  Around that time, in certain areas, it granted two-year bursaries to students to take a master's degree course.  They then stayed on in Tusla for a year.  Interestingly, a lot of those who received that support remained in Tusla.  If one invests in and encourages a student and there is a welcoming and manageable environment, people will stay.  Exit interviews have been mentioned.  I am not aware that such interviews are carried out routinely, but the reasons the majority leave are known.  The social workers <i>in situ</i>who would love to continue working in the area of child protection and family welfare could indicate very clearly what needs to be done.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and her officials from the Department.  The Minister of State, Deputy Breen, is taking a Topical Issues debate in the D&aacute;il and will join us shortly.  I thank the officials for the briefing material provided which has been circulated to members.  As they are aware, Vote 32 covers three primary areas of expenditure.  Programme A covers jobs and enterprise development; programme B covers innovation, while programme C covers regulation.  I propose that we examine the Revised Estimates programme by programme.  We will start with programme A which deals with jobs and enterprise development; agency legacy pensions; InterTradeIreland; IDA Ireland; the National Standards Authority of Ireland; Enterprise Ireland; local enterprise development; the credit guarantee scheme; the INTERREG programme; subscriptions to international organisations; commissions, committees and special inquiries; legal costs and other services; the future growth loan scheme; and the humanitarian relief scheme.</p></speech>

My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for trade, employment, business, the EU digital Single Market and data protection, Deputy Breen, will be with us shortly.  My other departmental colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for training, skills, innovation, research and development, Deputy Halligan, has asked me to offer his apologies as he is unable to be here owing to another commitment.</p> <p>  With the committee's indulgence, I propose to make some overall introductory remarks about the capital and current moneys being provided by my Department in 2019.  The Minister of State, Deputy Breen, hopes to make some brief remarks about the Department's regulation programme and his specific areas of responsibility.  I understand my officials have provided a briefing for members of the committee on the details of the Department's 2019 Estimate which I hope has been of assistance.  </p> <p>  As regards the financials, the 2019 Revised Estimates published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provided my Department with a gross allocation of &euro;950.2 million for use in 2019.  This represents an increase of more than &euro;79.2 million or 9.1% on the 2018 Estimate of &euro;870.96 million.  In addition, approval was secured to carry over &euro;27.6 million in unspent capital moneys from 2018 to 2019.  In essence, the total gross funding available for use by my Department and its statutory agencies and offices in 2019 is &euro;977.8 million.</p> <p>  As regards capital funding, the 2019 allocation of &euro;620 million is the highest capital allocation ever received by my Department and represents an increase of &euro;65 million, or almost 12%, on the 2018 capital allocation which was also a record allocation.  On current funding, the &euro;330.2 million being provided by my Department in 2019 represents an increase of more than &euro;14.27 million on last year's allocation.  </p> <p>  Before dealing with the specifics of some of the 2019 allocations, I will say a word about what my Department achieved with the moneys it received in 2018.  Last year was another very successful year in job creation by the clients of the Department's enterprise agencies.  In 2018 these clients delivered 26,815 net new jobs.  Of this total, 9,119 net new jobs were created by clients of Enterprise Ireland, 14,040 by clients of IDA Ireland and 3,656 by clients of the local enterprise offices.  Our agencies now directly support more than 480,000 jobs, which represents more than 21% of all jobs in the economy.  These jobs are in all sectors of the economy and all regions of the country.  Regional development continued to be a particular focus of our enterprise agencies in 2018, with the result that over 58% of jobs supported by IDA Ireland and 64% of Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs are located outside Dublin.  </p> <p>  A very significant amount of resources and effort was devoted by my Department and its agencies and offices in 2018 to the challenge of Brexit and preparing businesses for that challenge.  Some of the specific initiative supports my Department and its enterprise agencies have undertaken to help businesses to compete include the Brexit loan scheme, the Enterprise Ireland Brexit SME scorecard, Enterprise Ireland's "Be Prepared" grant, the Enterprise Ireland Act On programme and the roll-out of the regional enterprise development fund.  Enterprise Ireland's Brexit advisory clinics have provided assistance and advice on matters such as financial and currency management.  The local enterprise offices technical assistance for microenterprises grant has been designed to support qualifying businesses to diversify into new markets.  The local enterprise offices' "Lean for Micro" programme is available nationwide to help small businesses to become more efficient and competitive.</p> <p>  Turning to 2019, Brexit will undoubtedly continue to be the primary focus of my Department and its agencies and offices.  The additional funding being provided for the Department's Vote in the 2019 Revised Estimates will enable us to step up our response to Brexit and introduce a further suite of measures to enable businesses to prepare for the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union.  The measures build on the specific initiatives undertaken in budget 2017 and budget 2018 and have been designed to support the pillars of my Department's strategic response to Brexit.  </p> <p>  In terms of specifics, 2019 will see the roll-out of the initial phase of the new future growth loan scheme.  The scheme which I had the pleasure of launching this morning will provide up to &euro;300 million to support eligible businesses to invest strategically in a post-Brexit environment.  It will bring much needed long-term lending to the marketplace by offering loan terms of eight to ten years.  It will be competitively priced with better terms and conditions than those available in the marketplace.  The scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland through participating finance providers.  </p> <p>  The year 2019 will also see the roll-out of Enterprise Ireland's revised seed and venture scheme.  The revised scheme with funding of &euro;175 million is being oriented towards seed and early stage investments where an evaluation has shown that there is a clear market failure.  It will actively direct investment to key sectors that have been identified for development as part of overall enterprise strategy and will be closely aligned with other key enterprise support programmes.  </p> <p>  The 2019 Revised Estimates also provide an additional &euro;8 million in funding to enable the Department, its regulatory bodies and enterprise agencies to increase their staffing resources and fund additional promotional and regulatory activities to assist in the response to Brexit and in preparing business for this challenge.  Of the additional funding, &euro;3 million is being provided for Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2 million for IDA Ireland.  This builds on the increased Brexit-related resources given to the Department's enterprise agencies in 2017 and 2018.  An additional &euro;1 million in funding is being provided for InterTradeIreland this year in recognition of the unique role it plays in promoting cross-Border trade and the significantly increased demand for its services arising from Brexit.  </p> <p>  The importance of attracting greater foreign direct investment into regional locations has also been given greater impetus by Brexit.  To this end, an extra &euro;10 million in capital moneys has been provided for IDA Ireland in 2019 to enable it to augment its regional property programme by providing additional property solutions in a further number of regional locations, including Sligo, Dundalk, Athlone, Waterford, Monaghan, Longford, Galway, Limerick and Maynooth, thereby enhancing the offering of these regions to companies interested in foreign direct investment.  It is important to point out that all properties completed under the regional property programme to date are now occupied and creating jobs in regional locations.  </p> <p>  Another major regional funding initiative in 2019 is the additional &euro;5 million in capital funding being provided for local enterprise offices.  The increase of more than 22% in funding will allow the local enterprise offices to build on their specific strengths in furthering enterprise development and job creating in their local areas.  The Minister of State, Deputy Breen, will provide further details of the LEOs' plans for 2019 in his presentation.</p> <p>  With regard to helping enterprises to innovate in the face of the challenge of Brexit, the 2019 Estimates increased the funding for my Department's innovation programme by more than &euro;42 million, an increase of almost 12% on the 2018 allocation.  The additional funding will allow us to roll out the first phase of the disruptive technologies innovation fund, DTIF.  The fund is one of four headline funds announced in Project 2040.  The &euro;500 million DTIF is a challenge-based fund and represents a significant investment in developing Ireland's innovation ecosystem and responsiveness.  It will be implemented through the Department and its agencies, working with other research funding bodies.  In December I was delighted to announce that 27 projects had been approved in principle for funding in the first call of the DTIF.  The projects will receive more than &euro;70 million in Government funding between now and 2021.  The additional funding being provided for the innovation programme in 2019 will also ensure Science Foundation Ireland can continue to invest in research centres and other established programmes.</p> <p>  As the committee will appreciate, Brexit is an unprecedented challenge which involves all Departments and many of the agencies.</p><p>The Government published its contingency action plan in December 2018, setting out the comprehensive cross-Government preparations that have been in place since even before the Brexit vote.  The Government has already taken actions to get Ireland Brexit ready, with dedicated measures announced in budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019.  Budget 2019 included an allocation of more than &euro;110 million for Brexit measures across a number of Departments.  Nevertheless, the uncertainty and difficulties with negotiations on the UK's departure from the European Union have required that preparations be made for all eventualities.  Contingency planning has moved to taking actions to mitigate the risks of a no-deal Brexit.  The Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019, which has passed through the Houses, is designed to protect our citizens and support the economy and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors that are most exposed, to mitigate the worst effects of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p> Aside from Brexit, there are a number of other challenges facing us which I would like to mention briefly.  A particular challenge is to prepare our citizens and enterprises for the economy of tomorrow.  To that end, I recently launched Future Jobs Ireland 2019, a new whole-of-Government initiative organised around five pillars.  These are innovation and technological change; improving productivity, particularly in Irish small and medium sized enterprises; enhancing skills and developing and attracting talent; increasing participation in the labour force; and transitioning to a low carbon economy.  Future Jobs Ireland 2019 has set targets for each pillar and measurable performance indicators.  Through the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department, we will ensure every Government Department and agency steps up to the plate in delivering this ambitious new plan for our country.</p><p> The additional capital provision being provided to my Department in 2019 will enable us to progress further some of my Department's priority investment projects identified in Project Ireland 2040.  Among the specific projects that we will progress further in 2019 are the disruptive technologies fund, IDA Ireland's regional property fund, the future growth loan scheme, the new seed and venture programme, further supports to local enterprise offices and a refresh of Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, research centres.  I will be happy to take any questions members might have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.810" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019032700002#C00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank her for presentation on the Estimates.  We have to acknowledge that the Government's focus in recent times has been on Brexit.  We have Westminster debating various options <i>ad nauseam</i>but we are still unsure as to what our relationship with the UK will be hours, days or weeks from now.  There is grave uncertainty and uncertainty is the enemy of investment because it undermines confidence, particularly in business.  Our role is to challenge the Government on its ability to react to that.  From that perspective, we need to accept that significant resources have been allocated to dealing with Brexit.  Fianna F&aacute;il will always argue that the Government should do more to assist companies, business advocacy groups, trade unions and other organisations that have a stake in ensuring the State is able to withstand the potential damage Brexit could cause.  Whether we see an abrupt exit or a phased winding down of the UK's involvement in the European Union, either way we need to make sure we are Brexit ready.  From that perspective, I urge companies to engage on an ongoing basis with the Department and the programmes it has established.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il criticises and compliments the Government in equal measure when it is warranted.  From the perspective of IDA Ireland and regional development, I have consistently tabled parliamentary questions on this issue and I always get very prompt replies from the Minister.  One of the great difficulties facing the State is that a huge swathe of the economy is located inside the M50.  No other country in the European Union or western world has such a dependency on economic growth from its capital city.  That is evident if one looks at figures on GDP, employment, economic activity and industrial output.  Dublin has been powering ahead of the regions for some time, which is bad on a number of fronts.  It is bad because of the pressure this places on the capital city as it seeks to meet challenges in transport, infrastructural development, housing and other issues.  In that context, IDA Ireland has a critical role to play in ensuring the policies it is enhancing and advancing attract and encourage companies out of Dublin and into the regions.</p><p>Deputies will obviously highlight the reasons they want companies to move to their areas.  The Border region has had very little growth in investment from multinational companies.  The midlands and south east are two other regions in a similar position.  Cork and Galway are doing reasonably well, whereas other areas are not.  Why are we consistently failing to encourage and develop policies that will attract multinationals out of the capital and into the regions?  The pay rates companies are required to offer in Dublin place them at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>rents and the cost of living in general versus living in one of the regions.  We should further explore this area in seeking to encourage more companies to consider the option of relocating to a region.  It would be easier for them in terms of pay pressures and international competitiveness if their employees were residing in areas outside of Dublin.  That would be good for Dublin and the regions.  The figures do not lie.  There is a difficulty in this regard and IDA Ireland has to be more proactive in underpinning Government policy on regional development.</p><p>Regional development is not just a matter for IDA Ireland.  We must also ensure investment is made in infrastructure, broadband, educational facilities and other areas that are required to attract multinational companies.  While I welcome the increase in expenditure for capital investment by IDA Ireland, much more work needs to be done in that area.</p><p>Science Foundation Ireland is a dynamic organisation but it seems to have fallen off the radar in recent times.  I wonder why that is the case.  Is it overlapping with or becoming intertwined with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland?  The agency no longer seems to have its own identity.  Why is that the case?  Is it the result of its close co-operation with Enterprise Ireland or is it because it is not being proactive in promoting itself?  Either way, I would like the Minister to comment on why Science Foundation Ireland does not feature as much in public discussion as it should in light of its critical importance.</p><p>The Estimates do not necessarily reflect the need for regional balance and investment.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, take a bottom up approach.  We still have a difficulty with credit and access to credit.  I know this is not an issue for the Estimates but it is critically important for the development of the economy and the SME sector.  We have a large cost built into our credit facilities.  Interest rates here are more than twice the EU average.  That is a serious inhibitor to competitiveness in the economy.  The problem is not only the cost of credit but also access to credit.</p><p>In assessing the competitiveness of Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the UK and the rest of the European Union, there is still much work to be done.  When we look at the role of the local enterprise offices in trying to establish and support companies to expand to the point where they achieve critical mass and make the leap from the LEO to Enterprise Ireland and internationalising, the issue of credit is bound to be a great challenge.  It is not just access to markets and assessing the types of markets that are out there but how such expansion would be funded.  I ask the Minister to comment.</p><p>From the point of view of capital expenditure, I welcome the Estimates.  I am not being critical but we need to do an audit of IDA Ireland's lands.</p><p>I know that it does this continually.  We have IDA Ireland centres that effectively do nothing, including, for instance, the one in Kilbarry in my constituency of Cork North-Central.  Barley has been sown at the centre for 25 years.  There are no factories there.  If IDA Ireland is not going to use it, surely it should be used for something other than the growing of barley, with a yield of about three tonnes to the acre.  That is not really what IDA Ireland is about.  We are beginning to lose focus at of some centres that have not been prioritised in the past 20 years.  They seem to have fallen off the cliff completely.  Perhaps it is time to carry out a full strategic audit of what is required for IDA Ireland in the years ahead to see what its needs will be.  If the land is not deemed to be suitable for industrial development, it should be disposed of for housing or to some other entity in accordance with local development plans.  The Minister might comment on that issue also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.812" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019032700002#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I will try to address all of them.  </p> <p>  On regional development, 58% of IDA Ireland supported jobs are now outside Dublin.  IDA Ireland has been very proactive in working in the different regions to identify opportunities.  I have launched nine regional enterprise plans across the country and can assure the Deputy that one of my priorities is to put the focus on the regions.  The nine regional enterprise plans have been very successful in encouraging collaboration and a ground-up approach.  We have enterprise and use all of the agencies, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise offices and the local authorities which, as we all know, play an important role in the economic development of their counties.  They are all coming together with the education providers and the future skills fora in the nine regional enterprise plans.  Together they are looking at the strengths of the regions and how to capitalise on them.  They are examining clustering, where possible; identifying suitable initiatives or plans and what they need to do to build on the strengths of a region, as well as identifying weaknesses and addressing them.  We have launched nine plans, each of which has its own strategic objectives tailor-made for the region.  The regional Action Plan for Jobs has been very successful, but we need to refocus it.  That is what the regional enterprise plans are about.  They are about highlighting the benefits of investing in the regions and putting forward the different strengths of each region.  It is about taking a bottom-up approach and seeing how we can create more jobs in the regions.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the Border region and the midlands.  That is why I have specifically focused in on the regions in the regional property programme.  A new IDA Ireland factory will go up in Athlone and there is one identified for Sligo.  The Deputy mentioned the south east.  There is also one identified for Waterford.  As the two already in Waterford are now full, IDA Ireland is building a third.  There is certainly a focus on the areas where we need to increase employment, particularly in the Border region, where we need property.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned a particular site in Cork.  I think he is right that there are some sites at which perhaps IDA Ireland needs to look to see what their future is.  However, he should try to sell a local IDA Ireland site.  For example, there was one in Monaghan where nothing had happened for 30 years.  Now it is recognised and there are plans to build an advance facility.  We do need to review the matter, but at the same time, when I was a representative on the local authority, we certainly did not want to see any IDA Ireland lands being disposed of.  We always saw them as presenting an opportunity and exerted pressure on IDA Ireland to attract a facility.  However, I take the Deputy's point.  IDA Ireland does actively manage its property programme.  It is more difficult in some areas, but it is important that it have sites available for potential investors.  It has no interest in holding on to sites where there is no prospect of attracting foreign direct investment.  As the Deputy said, it also needs sites to which to bring people because, more and more, its existing facilities are being filled.  It needs a supply of new sites it can show investors.</p> <p>  The pipeline of new investments into the country continues to be very strong.  I am just back from a trade mission to Australia and Singapore where there is great interest.  We all know that IDA Ireland does a wonderful job internationally.  Other countries ask us how we manage to attract so many top quality global companies to Ireland and the great job IDA Ireland does in that regard is recognised globally.  There is certainly strong interest among companies that are looking to locate their European headquarters in Ireland.  Of course, it is ultimately their decision where they go, but certainly the offer of locating in the regions was very much put to them, for example, that they have an office in Dublin and a second site in one of the regions.  The advantages of locating in the regions were put to them.  The Deputy knows that when we go on trade missions, we realise the wonderful job IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland do on our behalf in promoting Irish businesses abroad and attracting investment into Ireland.</p> <p>  Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, is certainly playing a key role in implementing the strategy Innovation 2020.  It was given an additional &euro;16 million in budget 2019, bringing its total budget up to &euro;172 million.  There has been a lot of investment in research centres.  For example, another &euro;10 million will go towards a new SFI centre for research training to address the need for skilled PhD and research master's holders.  The programme will address a key action in Innovation 2020 to increase the enrolment and output of postgraduate researchers.  A sum of &euro;5 million will go towards the renewal of six world-class research centres.  SFI research centres have generated over 600 research contracts between academic researchers, NMCs and SMEs, with committed industry co-funding of over &euro;150 million and competitively won EU Horizon 2020 funding of over &euro;170 million.  Some &euro;1 million will go towards SFI's strategic industry partnerships which fund compelling research opportunities on a flexible basis that are not otherwise served by other national funding programmes.  SFI is doing a really good job in that space.  We have also just allocated the first round of funding from the disruptive technologies fund, in which SFI has a huge interest and on which it is working very closely with industry.  There was an SME involved in every single project funded under the programme, under which there is &euro;500 million available.  Just one third of successful projects have consortium partners located in Dublin alone; 18 of the successful projects involve enterprise partners based outside the capital.  They are located countrywide in Limerick, Cork, Galway, Kildare, Monaghan, Waterford, Louth and Tipperary.  The largest consortium involves 13 partners stretching from Dublin to Cork to Wicklow.  We are learning from call one.</p><p>We are going to have a second call and we expect to make some changes.  For example, these could be to the application form and the process.  We can say with some certainty that projects will still need to focus on the themes identified in the research priority areas.  We anticipate the second call will happen before the summer.</p><p> I take the Deputy's point on business access to funding.  My Department supports ongoing key small and medium enterprise, SME, access to finance initiatives, including the credit guarantee scheme, the Brexit loan scheme, the future growth loan scheme I launched, and the micro-enterprise loan fund scheme.  These are a range of schemes developed to provide finance to SMEs at low cost levels and at better terms and conditions than what was available on the market.  A number of new initiatives have been progressed recently, as I noted.  The future growth loan scheme launched today will make a fund of up to &euro;300 million available for loans of between eight and ten years, and that is something for which the market is not currently catering, particularly for companies that want to invest in capital expenditure.  This may be long-term funding for specific or bespoke plant and it can sometimes be difficult to access finance for that.  I am satisfied the new scheme we launched today should cater for it.</p><p> There is also the Enterprise Ireland seed and venture capital scheme that will operate from 2019 to 2024, and there are new economic indicators included in this scheme.  We conducted a review of microfinance in Ireland and we continue to support the work of Microfinance Ireland in helping Irish micro-enterprises to access the funds they need.  We are working with our colleagues across the Government to secure alternative means of finance for SMEs, including in the areas of crowdfunding.  As I mentioned, we have launched the future growth loan scheme and we are also finalising the development of a business finance advisory hub for SMEs in the second half of 2019.  There are a number of different schemes where businesses can access funding, and if they do not get funding from banks or there is a reluctance to offer funding, those businesses can go to the Credit Review Office.</p><p> I met the heads of the pillar banks a number of weeks ago and I will meet them again next week.  I raise with them continually the need to support businesses, especially in the face of Brexit.  There may be working capital facilities or cashflow problems, and I have impressed upon those banks the need to be willing to take that walk with businesses as they may face into more challenging times.</p></speech>

I believe she is moving to the Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, but it has been a pleasure working with her for the past number of years.  It is approximately two and a half years now that we have been working together, and from what I have seen and experienced with her, she has been an outstanding public servant.  I was not here at the start but I assume the others had some nice words for her.</p></speech>

The first relates to Brexit business supports and the Minister would not be surprised at that as I have raised this with her a number of times.  I am still concerned about the low uptake of Brexit business supports.  I have said a number of times that the figure I have now is 81 loans with a value of &euro;17.3 million being given from the &euro;300 million Brexit support loan scheme, amounting to 6% of the total pot.  There have been 241 market discovery grants approved and just 156 Be Prepared grants sanctioned.  Does the Minister believe these initiatives have not been successful?  If they have not been successful, what do we need to do to ensure better uptake of them?</p> <p>  I understand there is uncertainty around Brexit and the crazy position in which we find ourselves.  People are transfixed by their televisions and watching what is going on in Westminster.  It is difficult and Deputy Kelleher indicated that uncertainty is causing much stress in companies.  What more can we do to ensure the loans that are supposedly available are more easily accessible?  There is clearly a problem when only 6% of the pot has been given out.</p> <p>  The next question relates to Enterprise Ireland and specifically equity stakes.  We spoke about this before.  The most recent information I have is that of the 709 companies in which Enterprise Ireland holds shares, only two are investments over 30% and the vast majority of holdings are less than 10%.  What is the Government policy on this and has the Government a preferred policy regarding the percentage of holdings in companies supported by Enterprise Ireland?</p> <p>  The third question relates to the concern of many business groups I have met about diversifying markets.  Will the Minister outline the actions she is taking specifically to diversify our markets?  Figures from IDA Ireland-supported companies indicate a huge 54% of 753 such companies are from the United States.  That level of concentration would leave our economy vulnerable to external political or economic changes in any country of origin.  It is a particular concern.  Additionally, Enterprise Ireland's exports performance in the global market for 2017 indicated that just 1% of our exports went to Latin America, with just 9% of exports going to southern Europe, the Middle East and all of Africa and India.  Meanwhile, 34% still went to Britain.  We very much need to diversify our markets further.  Will the Minister update us on Enterprise Ireland's plans to increase its presence in those areas?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.825" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019032700002#E01300"><p>I went through some of the elements of Brexit related business supports, and there are a wide range of supports, whether through InterTradeIreland, Enterprise Ireland, local enterprise offices or the Brexit working capital loan facility and future growth loan scheme, which is a long-term Brexit loan scheme.  There are many supports and there has been a major national awareness campaign for these supports, taking in events, clinics and seminars throughout the country.  I have been getting very positive feedback on the various schemes that are available, including the start to plan vouchers from InterTradeIreland, the lean programmes from Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise office mentoring programmes, the market diversification fund etc.  Companies are using supports like these to make their businesses leaner and more efficient, which is very positive for businesses, irrespective of the final Brexit outcome.  Of course I want to see as many businesses as possible availing of these supports and I have had no feedback from companies telling me that schemes are cumbersome or hard to access.  Likewise, I have not had representations from Deputies telling me the programmes are hard to use and nobody has told me a company has indicated the supports cannot be used because they are hard to get at.</p><p>If committee members have specific examples of companies that have not been able to access supports, I want to hear about them.  They can send those examples directly to me and I am willing to hear about specific problems.  I have not received such feedback.  There are many supports and a recent article in <i>The Sunday Times</i>had the headline that Brexit was bringing out the best in Ireland's SMEs.</p><p>It outlines some of the supports available and how they have used them to the benefit of their companies.  They have made them leaner and more competitive.</p><p> On the global footprint and what we are doing to look for other markets, Enterprise Ireland will target the &euro;3 million in additional resources I allocated to it in the budget towards its global footprint plans.  It will get more boots on the ground and have more people working on behalf of Irish companies to identify new markets.  It will also use some of the funding to provide for promotional training activities such as the Irish advantage and online customs training.  As part of the global footprint initiative, it has identified a targeted expansion of its overseas offices representing our global ambitions to grow international markets, both emerging and established.  There will be new offices in Manchester, Germany, Le&oacute;n, Seattle and Melbourne.  The new office in Melbourne, to which I did not get, was opened a week ago.  There will also be new offices in Copenhagen and Vietnam.  The offices in Milan, Budapest, S&atilde;o Paulo, Boston in the United States, Auckland, Shenzhen and Glasgow are expanding.  There is a lot of work ongoing to increase numbers of boots on the ground.</p><p> IDA Ireland is working to diversify inward investment, both in the countries from which investment comes and the sectors involved.  It is also working hard to avail of new opportunities in non-traditional markets.  They include countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and South Africa.  I am very encouraged by our progress in China, South Korea and India last year.  I travelled to China last November and was in Singapore last week.  There are significant opportunities for us in the Asian market.  I know that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working extremely hard to maximise opportunities, increase our presence and get more Irish companies into that area to sell product.  I had the pleasure of launching a new restaurant in Singapore called Duckland.  It sources as many of its products as it can from Irish companies.  It uses Guinness, Irish pork, whiskey and duck.  There is one company in my constituency with which I am very familiar, right on the Border, Silver Hill Farm, which exports 20,000 ducks a week to Singapore.  It is about increasing these markets.</p><p> Of course, the United Kingdom will still be one of our closest trading partner.  We will continue to increase our business there wherever we can, but our reliance on the United Kingdom for our overall exports is reducing and we are increasing our market share in other countries.  Much work is ongoing in that space and we are supporting companies to diversify and it is working.  </p><p> The Deputy talked about Enterprise Ireland's equity stakes.  We have the seed and venture programme with funding of &euro;175 million which was launched last year.  Enterprise Ireland is one of the biggest seed capital investors in the country, if not globally.  We have increased its powers in the Brexit omnibus Bill in order that it will be able to lend to Irish companies that will be impacted on by Brexit, not just take equity shares in them.  Its equity stakes will be sufficient to fulfil its development role, no more and no less.</p></speech>

I raised this issue with the Minister during Priority Questions.  We both agree that there was significant awareness of them.  Some 90% of businesses stated they were aware of the available supports, but we still seem to have a problem with a low uptake.  The last figures I have show that just 81 loans were taken out.  Does the Minister know if there has been a greater uptake of the Brexit loan scheme?</p></speech>

It has gone up to &euro;20.6 million.  There is I believe also a reluctance among businesses to take on additional debt.  This is a loan and they will still have to pay it back.  The uncertainty Brexit will bring probably means that companies are not taking out loans because they are concerned which the Deputy can understand.  When there is more certainty with regard to Brexit, we will probably find that is more demand for the loan schemes.</p></speech>

Some 93 loan applications progressed to sanction at bank level, to a value of &euro;20.64 million.  </p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland has the Brexit scorecard.  Some 4,943 cards have been completed.  A total of 956 local enterprise office, LEO, clients have completed the scorecard.  Enterprise Ireland has approved 174 Be Prepared grants, while 133 projects have been approved under the Enterprise Ireland market discovery fund.  A total of 2,805 of Enterprise Ireland's Prepare to Export scorecards have been completed.  Its customs insights online course has had 1,112 participants.  A total of 47 agile innovation projects have been approved from Enterprise Ireland's agile innovation fund which gives rapid, fast-track access to innovation funding.  Enterprise Ireland has run 16 Brexit advisory clinics, with more than 1,200 in attendance.  Its Brexit: Act On initiative is a support which funds the engagement of a consultant to devise reports with recommendations to help clients.  A total of 210 Act On plans have been completed.  Enterprise Ireland's strategic consultancy grant is available to assist its clients to hire a strategic consultant for a set period.  A total of 1,060 consultancy grants have been approved.</p> <p>  A total of 476 clients have been approved for assistance under the local enterprise offices technical assistance for micro exporters grant and incentive to explore and develop new market opportunities.  The LEO Lean for Micro offer was developed in collaboration between Enterprise Ireland's lean department and the local enterprise offices.  A total of 227 LEO clients have participated in the programme.  The local enterprise offices mentoring programme has had 551 participants solely focused on Brexit.  The local enterprise offices' Brexit seminar events had 4,100 participants at the information events, as of the end of February.  Some 1,620 small and medium enterprises have engaged directly with InterTrade Ireland's Brexit advisory service in 2019.  That is in addition to the 4,175 engagements in 2018.</p><p>There have been 1,352 applications for InterTradeIreland Brexit start to plan vouchers, with 1,170 approved and 34 pending.  In the pilot online retail scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland 11 retailers were awarded funding in February 2019 and there will be a second call this year.  We can provide the Deputy with a list of these supports later if she wishes.  There is lot happening in terms of engagement by companies and &euro;74 million has been paid in funding to Enterprise Ireland support companies to help them prepare for Brexit.</p></speech>

I agree the take-up of the loan schemes is quite low.  Something that has come to my attention, particularly in recent months, is the chilling effect Brexit is having on business in terms of both drawing down loan moneys available and in making decisions to hire new staff, invest in the business, expand or sign new contracts.  Is the Department carrying out analysis of these impacts of Brexit?  Even if a deal is done, Brexit has already had a damaging impact on business.</p> <p>  Another complaint I hear is that contracts for businesses looking to sign deals with companies in the UK contain Brexit clauses that are quite onerous on Irish businesses.  Is the Minister engaging with the UK Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on this?  Some companies here that need a particular product because of the supply chain or that export heavily to the UK find themselves in a position whereby they must accept these Brexit clauses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.835" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019032700002#G00300"><p>Companies that find themselves in this situation should get in touch with Enterprise Ireland, which has a lot of contact with companies exporting to Britain.  The Department's focus is on supporting companies through the Brexit process.  A lot of work is going into giving them the supports they need.  I engage a lot with businesses through IBEC and the retail consultation forum.  I meet them and hear what they have to say.  If there are any issues I encourage them to come forward and we will deal with them.</p> <p>  The Copenhagen economic study sets out the economic impacts of Brexit on Ireland.  This points to lower levels of employment growth and GDP growth but not to job losses.  It speaks about depressed growth.  It will not be as good as we thought it would be but there will certainly be growth in the economy.  I know there are challenges for businesses, which is why we have this wide range of supports to help them.  For those companies that have not engaged I encourage them to do so.  Generally, the first port of call is the local enterprise office, LEO, which will give good advice.  If the LEOs cannot help they will point companies to the right place to go to get the supports they need.  Other studies that inform us have been carried out.  An ESRI study commissioned  by the Department was published last week.  The findings of all of these studies are generally the same.  They point to us having increased growth but it will be dampened and not as good as if there were no Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.836" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019032700002#G00400"><p>The Copenhagen economic report from the Department of Finance is probably a little out of date.  The ESRI report was published just two days ago.  It is more up to date and takes into account more recent research on the impacts of Brexit.  That is more of a macroeconomic look at the impact on the economy and jobs but my question was more specifically on the chilling impact on business, particularly the SME sector, that Brexit is already having.  The supports are tailored towards buffering companies that may be exporting to the UK and may have to make changes to their supply chains.  There has not been analysis done on companies and businesses, particularly in the SME sector, dealing with a loss of consumer confidence and people holding back by not making purchases or signing new contracts.  The two reports referred to by the Minister have not touched on this.  It is not really their focus.  Perhaps it is something for the Department to take a look at when Brexit stabilises.  Brexit will be with us for quite some time and when it stabilises we should look at the chill factor it has had.  I spoke to a manufacturing company based in Mayo and there are not too many of these types of jobs in rural constituency.</p></speech>

It stated its business has dropped considerably in the past two months.  It has noticed a dramatic drop in recent months.  Its view is it will never recoup those losses or make up that lost business.  It hopes for some certainly when Brexit stabilises and that it will be able to get back on track.  It has been able to take the hit because it is successful and has built up sufficient buffers.  I imagine there are many other small and medium sized enterprises in a similar boat.  This particular company was very positive about the supports it had been given in terms of training for customs and revenue but felt there was not any support to deal with the loss of consumer confidence, the lack of purchasing and the normal trajectory for sales in recent months.  This is something for the Department to look at in future when Brexit stabilises.</p> <p>  I have some questions on the Revised Estimates.  Subhead A8 on local enterprise development has an increase of &euro;5 million, or 15%, to allow LEOs meet increasing demand for their services.  Will the Minister give a breakdown of these increasing demands?  Have the LEOs requested specific additional funds for specific services?  Are they related to Brexit or expansion?  What is the money being used for?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.839" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019032700002#G00700"><p>The LEOs will roll out customs training.  They will provide more supports to businesses in terms of advice and programmes.  The LEOs play an important role as the first port of call for many businesses that want to find out what supports are available to them.  They have been increasing the services they roll out to local enterprises.  I felt it was important that we support them further.  They deal with businesses across the board.  In 2019, the LEOs have targeted the approval of 1,360 projects for grant support with protected associated job commitments.  They have created more than 8,000 jobs in the past year through their work with local businesses.  A total of 200 are participating in the newly expanded Lean for Micro programme being rolled out through the local enterprise offices.  The LEOs have delivered training to more than 34,500 participants and mentoring to just over 9,000.  They have a programme for preparing business for customs and are organising workshops to help businesses get to know and understand the requirements for customs because of Brexit.</p> <p>  An additional resource at business adviser grade, to focus on key clients with growth potential or in need of a plan to counteract the impacts of Brexit, will be recruited for the LEO network.  The LEOs have experienced an increase in the demand for their services in the areas of mentoring, training and developmental programmes.  The extra funding will be channelled towards supporting startups and developing businesses.</p> <p>  Each county LEO area has specific strengths, opportunities and weaknesses with regard to enterprise development and job creation.  For example, local natural resources, sectoral strengths and demographics, including commuters, could lead to business development opportunities and international connections through the diaspora or town twinning could provide opportunities.  It is important that all players, including the local authorities, LEADER companies and chambers of commerce, combine their efforts to maximise those opportunities.  They play a very important role and the additional funding is to help them do their job better, with a particular focus on Brexit because they will be rolling out those training programmes.</p></speech>

The six areas where research will be focused are machine learning, digitally enhanced reality, advanced networks for sustainable societies, the foundations of data science, artificial intelligence and genomics data science.  Research has served us well in this country and we need to continue to invest in it.  It is a question of how we can use research to our advantage to keep us at the cutting edge of what is happening in the new technology revolution we are undergoing at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.848" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1220" speakername="Mary Butler" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019032700002#H00800"><p>I have three questions.  The Minister was very welcome when she came to Waterford on Friday last for the launch of the ninth Future Jobs Ireland programme.  It was a very positive launch with a lot of energy in the room.</p> <p>  First, on an issue I raise with the Minister continuously and as she herself said on Friday, at 7.7% the south east remains stubbornly above the average unemployment level in the rest of the country, although I know there are issues in other regions.  I ask the Minister to expand on what specific areas she might target so we might come into line with the rest.</p> <p>  My second question concerns retail.  I was recently asked to meet the British head of a retail consortium.  Again, my question focuses on Brexit, from which, unfortunately, we cannot get away.  There are many jobs in retail in Ireland and I refer specifically to chain stores like Next, H&amp;M, Marks and Spencer and Debenhams, which are England-based English companies but have a lot of stores and workers in Ireland.  Has the Department had any interaction with these companies?  The word "uncertainty" is raised every day in regard to Brexit.  We do not know exactly what is going to happen and, as Deputy Lisa Chambers said, it changes on a hourly basis, never mind a daily basis.  Has there been interaction in regard to taking away the chilling effect and safeguarding these chain stores that have become such a part of retail in Ireland?  Although there is not a lot we can do about it, one of my concerns is that by the year 2020, apparently, 80% of all clothing will be purchased online, so retailers are facing huge challenges in any case.  The Minister might expand on that.</p> <p>  Moving completely away from that issue, my third question relates to subhead A15, which deals with the humanitarian relief scheme.  There was no allocation under this heading and the Minister might explain the reason for this.  Is there a carryover from last year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.849" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019032700002#H00900"><p>I will answer the last question first.  The humanitarian relief scheme is a flood relief scheme for businesses.  It is a new scheme in my Department and is demand-led.  Thank God, we have not had any serious flooding incidents this year but it is for those businesses that run into difficulties and need assistance.  The funding will come from my Department and although there is nothing in it yet, it is demand-led and I have a commitment that, should the necessity arise, the funding will be made available.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.851" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019032700002#H01100"><p>I have an agreement that the funding will be made available should the need arise.</p> <p>  With regard to the retail stores, I take the Chairman's point that there are many UK retail stores in this country.  I liaise with them through the retail forum and I meet them on a regular basis.  I have met the retailers and the food importers four times, in particular the big supermarkets, because they obviously have particular challenges in terms of Brexit.  Those four meetings have proved very useful because the companies have been able to bring to my attention issues of concern to them.  I have had the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine come in to talk about the sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks that will become necessary due to Brexit and I have had Revenue in with me as well.  We have had round-table meetings with Revenue, with Dublin Port and with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We have met them, along with the haulage sector and the logistics companies.  They have all been in and I have met them four times.  They have been very good meetings and the companies have had an opportunity to raise issues with me in terms of what we need to do to make sure those supply chains remain open and there is not a bottleneck due to a crash-out Brexit.  The retail stores are represented on the retail forum.  If there are particular issues regarding the retail stores, I am happy to hear them.  We will work with them in whatever way we can to make sure there is not huge disruption to their business.  I accept it is a difficult time for them.</p> <p>  It was a very good event in Waterford on Friday and I thank the Chairman for attending.  A good deal is happening in Waterford.  When I was there, I opened the new 3D manufacturing facility that is funded by my Department's regional enterprise development fund.  I launched the new project led by the STEAM research facility, which received &euro;2 million in funding under the disruptive technologies fund.  I visited Nutrition Research Centre Ireland, which is supported by the Government through Science Foundation Ireland, and is doing groundbreaking research work in that nutrition space.</p> <p>  There is a lot going on in Waterford.  I believe the launch of the regional enterprise plan will help to consolidate and build on the strengths that are there.  While I accept the figure for Waterford is higher than we would like, we will work hard to ensure it is reduced.  There are some areas which are just not as good as others.  However, there has been a lot of work on the ground.  I compliment the local committee.  This is why it was so important that I went around the country to attend the nine events, eight of which were outside Dublin, to recognise the work that is being done at a local level.  Whether it is done through the local enterprise office, the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, the education sector or the providers, they are all crucial in this regard.  It is about training the right people for the right jobs and, as the Chairman knows, about showing we have a pool of talented people and about clustering skills.  I am confident this plan will refocus on the strengths in that whole region.  I have no doubt it will bring benefits.</p> <p>  In the south east there are 76 IDA-supported companies employing 15,580 people, which is up 7% on 2017.</p><p>Recent IDA Ireland announcements include DMS Corporate Services' announcement of 50 jobs in Tipperary, INDOS Financial's announcement of 15 jobs in Wexford, Bausch + Lomb's announcement of 100 jobs in Waterford, and MSD's announcement of 170 jobs in Carlow.  That gives an idea of the figures.  We will certainly work with the committee to improve on them.</p></speech>

Subhead B6 refers to subscriptions to international organisations.  I raised this previously with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.  He seems to be on the same page as me but the Government has not got there yet.  I refer to the application to join European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN.  Have we done anything about that?  Has there been a meeting with CERN?</p></speech>

As the Minister is probably aware, Sinn F&eacute;in has been proposing this and has included it in budget submissions for the last several years.  Perhaps the Minister will update us on this.</p></speech>

Deputy Quinlivan and I are on the same wavelength.  Earlier this year representatives of CERN came before our committee.  There was unanimous agreement across the floor that membership would be good for us if we could afford it.  An update from the Minister would be appreciated.</p></speech>

Discussions between my Department and CERN have been ongoing at both official and ministerial level throughout 2016, 2017 and 2018.  Associate membership of CERN is available from 10% of the full membership cost, with benefits calculated <i>pro rata</i>.  The minimum cost for Ireland based on 2018 figures is &euro;1.3 million per annum.  That allows for associate membership.  Full membership of CERN at current prices would cost approximately &euro;13.6 million per annum.  In addition to the annual cost of full membership a special contribution would be due.  Based on a membership cost of &euro;13.6 million, this contribution would amount to &euro;17 million, due on the day the State becomes a full member.  This would mean a total cost of &euro;30.7 million for full membership.  This is a considerable amount of money.  In view of the demands on the capital programme and tight fiscal constraints, it is not possible to progress membership of CERN in 2019.  Nevertheless, membership remains on the policy agenda and my Department will keep the issue under active review.  My objective is to ensure that we obtain the best overall return on our investment in research and innovation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.874" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019032700002#J02300"><p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to say a few words on the Department's 2019 Estimates, particularly the allocations to the Department's regulation programme and my immediate areas of responsibility.  As the Minister has said, Brexit is an all-encompassing challenge for Departments and their agencies, including the agencies and regulatory bodies of our Department.  The Brexit challenge heightens the importance of ensuring that our business regulation environment facilitates business investment and development, competition in the marketplace, high standards of consumer protection and corporate governance.  It must also provide Ireland with a competitive advantage in the global market.</p> <p>  The 2019 Revised Estimates have increased the funding of the Department's regulation programme to &euro;85.8 million, which represents an increase of 5% on the 2018 allocation.  Much of the increase is to assist our regulatory bodies and agencies in meeting the challenges posed by Brexit.  For example, in the area of my direct responsibility, funding provided to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, in the 2019 Revised Estimates has been increased by &euro;500,000 to enable it to respond to the increased demand for services arising from Brexit.  This follows the additional &euro;400,000 provided to the HSA in 2018.  This has been allocated to augment the HSA's staffing resources, especially in its chemicals, market surveillance and accreditation business units, which are the business areas most likely to be impacted by Brexit.  In 2018, the HSA increased its staffing complement by almost 6%.  These numbers will increase again as a result of the additional funding provided in 2019.</p> <p>  The other area of responsibility in my Department's regulation programme which I would like to mention is the workplace relations programme.  As the committee will be aware, legislation is before the Oireachtas to expand the remit of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to include the Garda and Civil Service.  To this end, the funding provided to the WRC in 2019 is being increased by &euro;1 million to enable it to respond to the additional demand for its services arising from its expanded remit.  The increase in funding will increase the WRC's conciliation, facilitation and mediation services and will maintain its overall service provision, including to new Garda and Civil Service clients.  It will also enable the WRC's adjudication services to continue to advance the progress made in processing and scheduling times over the course of 2019 with a view to achieving the ultimate strategic goal of processing most cases within six months by 2022.</p> <p>  With the Chair's indulgence I would like to say a few words about the local enterprise offices, LEOs, for which I have direct responsibility.  Having worked closely with and visited many of the local enterprise offices throughout the country, I pay tribute to their achievements and that of their clients in creating 3,656 net new jobs in 2018.  That employment in LEO client enterprises is now in excess of 36,000 is a tribute to the efforts of all local enterprise offices in supporting local indigenous businesses to start up, grow and thrive in every region in the country.  Indeed during the recent local enterprise week held earlier this month, our 31 LEOs jointly ran more than 300 events, clearly illustrating the panoply of supports they can provide to startups, aspiring entrepreneurs and small businesses in their respective areas.  I recently had the pleasure of attending the Clare county enterprise awards and witnessing the success of enterprises that have been created as a direct result of the support of the local enterprise offices in my county.</p> <p>  I am delighted therefore that additional capital funding of &euro;5 million has been provided to local enterprise offices in 2019.  This significant increase of 22% in the LEO funding will enable them to meet the growing demand for their services, particularly in light of Brexit.  The additional funding provided to the LEOs will be targeted to ensure that they can continue to roll out the Brexit customs training workshops and EU workshops, facilitate clients' access to the Enterprise Ireland Brexit SME scorecard, assist clients through the technical assistance for micro-exporters grant process, respond to the increased demand for the Lean for Micro programme, roll out the second iteration of the LEO innovation investment fund programme, provide tailored mentoring, targeting and training on specific Brexit challenges, promote the very important trading online voucher scheme, assist clients in accessing credit through Microfinance Ireland, MFI, facilitate clients in accessing the &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme, and of course facilitate clients in accessing the Enterprise Ireland agile innovation fund.  While Brexit presents a challenge for all businesses, the challenge will undoubtedly be greater for indigenous small businesses.  I therefore welcome the fact that each local enterprise office has appointed a dedicated Brexit adviser to assist companies in preparing for Brexit in their respective areas.</p> <p>  I would also like to say a few words about the challenge of digitalisation and the digital Single Market.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, referred to the importance of preparing for tomorrow's economy and the targets identified under the recently published future jobs initiative to shift our enterprise and jobs focus to create quality jobs that will be resilient in the future.  There is no doubt that the enterprise and jobs of tomorrow will be significantly shaped by the increasing impact of digitalisation.  Digitalisation and digital transformation will have far-reaching impacts for our economy and society.  It is imperative that Ireland is well positioned to maximise the economic and social benefits from digitalisation and ensure that we are in a position to enjoy these benefits.</p><p> It is my privilege as Minister of State with responsibility for the EU digital Single Market, DSM, to chair the interdepartmental committee on DSM.  The committee was established to ensure a whole-of-Government approach and cross-Government co-ordination of the DSM agenda at national and EU level.  The committee is a co-ordinated team of representatives of relevant Departments who collectively implement the comprehensive DSM agenda.  From a national perspective, a new national digital strategy is being prepared.  It is co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach and other Departments, including my own, are feeding into the process, which will include extensive stakeholder consultation that was completed last year.  The mission of the strategy is to deliver a number of important recommendations around connectivity and security, Government services, addressing the digital divide for citizens and businesses and innovation and skills in order to advance Ireland's digital process.  Work on the development of a national strategy on artificial intelligence is to begin very shortly and will be completed by September 2019.  The strategy will be aligned with and contribute to the broader EU strategy and will present a cross-Government framework as well as setting out how Ireland will engage with the dynamic and challenging developments in areas such as artificial intelligence technologies with a focus on nationally significant areas of opportunity.</p><p> I welcome the establishment of the small and medium enterprise and entrepreneurship, SMEE, consultation group which held its inaugural meeting today at the Royal College of Physicians.  The group was established arising from the OECD review commissioned by the Department of our SME and entrepreneurship policies.  The meeting, which I chaired, was attended by almost 50 people.  The role of the consultation group is to provide a platform for structured engagement between Government, agencies, representative bodies and small businesses.  Its establishment is a concrete demonstration of the Government's recognition of the importance of ensuring that appropriate structures are being put in place to enable the voice of small business to be heard in policymaking and reflects the reality that there are 219,818 micro-enterprises operating in all regions, accounting for 92% of active enterprises in the State.</p><p> I hope that the foregoing flavour of my areas of responsibility within the Department and the funding being provided by the 2019 Revised Estimates in those areas will be of assistance to the committee.  I am happy to take questions from the one committee member who is present.</p></speech>

Under subhead C8, an extra &euro;350,000 has been allocated to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.  For what specific purpose is that allocation?  My understanding - I could be wrong - is that an EU directive to tackle unfair trading practices has been agreed and a competent authority in Ireland will be needed to enforce it.  Is it the plan of the Government to make the CCPC the competent authority for that directive?   Does the Minister of State accept that that would severely constrain the CCPC in its current work as it would burden it with substantially more responsibility and possibly create a conflict of interest between consumers and farmers?  What is the current situation in that regard?  Has it been discussed with the CCPC?  What is its position on the matter?</p></speech>

Consumer protection is of significant importance, given what is happening in today's environment.  As the Deputy is aware, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission was established in 2014 as a result of the merger of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  It is important to point out that it is a statutory body with responsibility for enforcing consumer protection and competition law in Ireland.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, it has been allocated an additional &euro;350,000 in the Revised Estimates.  As I stated, a new directive establishes a minimum list of prohibited unfair trading practices between buyers and suppliers in the agricultural and food supply chain and lays down minimum rules concerning enforcement and arrangements for co-ordination between enforcement authorities.  The measure seeks to protect suppliers who sell agricultural and food products to buyers with a turnover of &euro;350 million, with differentiated levels of protection provided below that threshold.  The text identifies nine unfair trading practices which are completely prohibited between suppliers and buyers and a further six practices which are prohibited unless they have been previously agreed in clear and unambiguous terms in the supply agreement.  As the Deputy is aware, the Commission issued a draft report in April 2018 dealing with unfair practices in the food supply chain.  Agreement on a compromise text was reached by the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the Commission in December 2018 following six sets of negotiating trilogues led by the Austrian Presidency.  As the scope of the directive aims to contribute to a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine held lead responsibility for the file during EU negotiations.  The measures will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union as soon as the Council of Agriculture Ministers formally approves the text proposed in December 2018.</p> <p>  The additional funding of &euro;350,000 for 2019 is to help the CCPC inform consumers on the impact of Brexit.  It is another part of the Government's response to Brexit and aims to ensure that consumers are aware of the potential impacts.  The money is allocated to the CCPC for that reason.</p></speech>

In layman's terms, it looks at making the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, a statutory body.  I note that an additional &euro;1 million has been allocated to the ODCE to help prepare for its establishment as an agency.  That represents a 20% increase on the 2018 allocation.  Will that amount be sufficient?  Is it envisaged that additional funding may be needed once the ODCE is established as an agency?</p></speech>

As the Chair stated, the legislation is before the committee.  In fairness to the ODCE, it has been doing great work.  It has increased its staff, built on its expertise and strengthened its capability to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law.</p><p>It is building on the organisational and procedural reforms that have been implemented.  It is doing good work and has had quite a lot of successful investigations and I am satisfied that the &euro;1 million will be sufficient so that it can be set up as an independent agency.</p></speech>

This committee did a body of work on the atypical, non-EU fishing scheme and touched on a lot of things, especially inspections.  I noticed there is an extra allocation of 6%, or just over &euro;1 million.  The Minister of State might be able to expand on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.885" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1272" speakername="Pat Breen" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019032700002#L00500"><p>It is important that we continue to resource the WRC when it comes to these matters.  Given that proceedings relating to some of the issues to which the Chairman referred are pending before the High Court, it would be inappropriate for me to talk about some of them.  We have been able to ensure that we can continue to resource the WRC and give it additional resources particularly for the personnel necessary for these inspections.  The Chairman mentioned chefs and those in other sectors.  The fisheries sector is important.  The WRC has had a great deal of success in the past number of years particularly in the context of inspections relating to fisheries, an issue that has been raised on many previous occasions.  There were a number of security operations in 2018 about which the Chairman might know because Waterford has a big fishing industry and operation.  Operation Neptune took place in March 2018 and there was another operation in June.  Operation Egg Shell took place in 2016.  Those have had many effects and surveillance is also important.</p> <p>  To the end of 2018, the WRC can report that there were 227 contraventions of employment rights and employment permit legislation detected by the WRC across 169 vessels.  Many of those were to do with failure to keep records, failure to comply with inspection requirements etc., payslips, failure to comply with the conditions of the atypical scheme and failure to give pay entitlements.  The additional resources we have given these bodies are important but we must continue to do so because we are up against many challenges at the moment.</p> <p>  There is a good news story from the HSA about work-related deaths in 2018.  This is a matter on which the HSA has been focusing in recent of years.  There were 37 people killed in 2018, which is 37 too many and 37 families which lost loved ones, but that represents a fall of 23% from the 2017 figures.  Our policies are going in the right direction and that is to do with extra inspections that we are putting in place.</p> <p>  There is also good news from the farming sector which affects many people and is constantly seen as one of the most dangerous sectors in which to work.  There were 15 deaths related to farming last year compared to 25 in 2017 which is a fall of 40% and the work being done by the HSA and ourselves should be acknowledged.  I have worked with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, in this area.  It is a good news story - not that any death is a good news story but at least fewer people are dying and we want to continue our focus in that area.  I pay tribute to everybody working in that area within the HSA.</p> <p>  As the Chairman knows, we are also working with the WRC in other areas and that is why we have given them additional funding for inspections.  We will also be giving additional funding to the WRC amounting to &euro;15 million, an increase of &euro;1.2 million on the previous year and it is important to look at its additional responsibilities with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and civil servants as outlined in my initial contribution.  That legislation will be coming through the House very shortly.</p></speech>

I thank Helen, Noel and John for the submissions they have made and for attending here this morning.  At the outset, I want to give a brief overview of what the legislation is intended to do and the manner in which I seek to achieve this.  The Bill was introduced in the D&aacute;il on 2 March 2017.  The Second Stage debate took place on 4 October 2018, and after that it was agreed by the D&aacute;il that the Bill would proceed to Committee Stage.  Since it is a Private Members' Bill, it is important that we do pre-legislative scrutiny on it.  That is the process we are engaged in today.</p> <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to amend our civil law so that it includes within it the principle that someone who kills another should not be entitled to benefit from that killing.  The Bill seeks to achieve this through an amendment of the Civil Liability Act 1961 and through amendments of the Succession Act 1965.  I will start by describing the law at present in respect of persons who kill others and the extent to which they are entitled to inherit.  There is law on the Statute Book which deals with this to a certain extent.  It is contained within the Succession Act 1965, Part X, section 120, which provides that anyone guilty of the murder, attempted murder or manslaughter of another shall be precluded from taking any share in the estate of that other.  That has been on the Statute Book since 1965 but it does not regulate a situation that can arise frequently in Ireland, particularly when somebody has been killed by a spouse, namely, what happens in respect of a joint tenancy where a couple hold property as joint tenants.  The distinguishing feature of a joint tenancy is that it operates under the rule of survivorship, which means that if one person dies, the other person automatically inherits their interest in the estate.  That is the way most Irish couples, regardless of whether they are married, own their property.  It gives effect to difficulties, if we can use that word, in circumstances where one spouse is responsible for killing the other spouse.</p> <p>  Like many Bills that are drafted and indeed much of the work carried out by the Law Reform Commission, what induced this was a tragic and traumatic event that happened back in 2008 when a woman called Celine Cawley was killed by her husband.  He was subsequently convicted of her manslaughter in 2011.  After that, the law provided that the person responsible for the death was the person who inherited the deceased woman's interest in the joint tenancy.  Her family were very concerned about that.  As a result, they decided that they wanted to institute proceedings.  They brought a case in the High Court, which was heard by Ms. Justice Laffoy.  She noted that there was no legislation dealing with the issue of joint tenancy.  She stated that the interest of the deceased was thereafter held by the husband responsible for her killing, but that he was holding it on constructive trust for the benefit of their daughter.  Constructive trust will arise when a court of equity believes it should intervene to ensure that property is not held by somebody in a way that would be regarded as being unconscionable.  She also importantly pointed out that this was an area that required reform and legislation by the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  After that, the Law Reform Commission decided that it was going to do a report in respect of this area.  It completed a very extensive piece of research and subsequently published a report in July 2015.  Its report made a number of recommendations.  It is common cause here that this is a complicated area of law because it involves property rights that are held by a person who has been convicted of a serious criminal offence, namely, murder or manslaughter.  The argument can justifiably be made that such a person has property rights which should not be affected by their criminal offence.  Notwithstanding that, it appears to me to be very anomalous, to put it mildly.  It is very unfair that somebody who is responsible for killing another person could gain the financial benefit of inheriting their part of the joint tenancy.  The Law Reform Commission report recommended that comprehensive legislation should be enacted to prevent a person benefiting from committing murder, attempted murder or manslaughter.  It said that the legislation not only should apply to the succession and inheritance setting dealt with in the Succession Act but also should prevent the offender benefiting from any property interest of the victim.  That is where we get into items such as life insurance policies, pensions or joint tenancies being covered by the legislation which, at present, are not covered by the Succession Act.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that the offender should be precluded from obtaining the benefit of the right of survivorship and that the legal and beneficial interests of the property held under the joint tenancy between the victim and the offender should be deemed severed from the date when the offence took place.</p> <p>  This is where it gets especially complicated. The Law Reform Commission also recommended that the actual amount and value to be held by the offender could be decided by a court.  In the case of a couple who own property as joint tenants, each of them has an equal interest in that property.  What is definitely wrong is that the interest of the deceased who is killed by the other spouse automatically vests in the killer or offender.  There is the situation, however, where the offender does have an ownership of half or part of the property at present.  The extent to which that can be diminished has to be determined through an application to the courts.  We could not automatically have a situation where an offender would lose his own interests in the property.  The Law Reform Commission therefore recommended that the court should be able to determine the extent of the offender's interest in the property.  The report also recommended that the new legislation should continue to apply to the three most recognised types of homicide, namely, murder, attempted murder and manslaughter.  It recommended that it should not apply to circumstances such as dangerous driving causing death.</p> <p>  I note that Professor Mee mentioned in his report that it would be unusual if somebody could order the killing of his wife by another and it would not be covered.  In respect of that, I would note that persons who are involved in a conspiracy to murder in Ireland in general are prosecuted as principals.  If I asked somebody to kill my spouse, I would be prosecuted as a murderer.  I agree, however, that the Bill could be amended to include conspiracy to murder along with the offences of murder, attempted murder and manslaughter.  The commission also recommended that where the offender has committed manslaughter, a court should be empowered to modify or disapply completely the rule that prevents the offender from benefiting only if the court is satisfied this is required in the interests of justice.</p><p>Because this legislation deals with civil law, the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission is that it is not necessary to have a conviction for murder, attempted murder or manslaughter for a family to bring an application under this legislation.  Because it is a civil remedy, the civil standard proof, which is on the balance of probability, would apply.<br/><br/>As with all Law Reform Commission reports, it set out its recommendations and then helpfully it drafted the relevant legislation as an appendix.  The legislation I introduced in March 2017 replicates that.<br/><br/>As I said at the outset, one of the issues relates to joint tenancy.  However, other examples have come to light in more recent times.  I have been in contact with the family of Clodagh Hawe who expressed considerable concern that after she was murdered by her husband, he was able to transfer assets from their joint bank account into his own account thereby depriving her estate of any benefit and ensuring that his estate exclusively benefited.  I am sure Mr. Byrne and Ms Doyle will give further examples in respect of it.<br/><br/>The legislation proposes to insert a new section 46 into the Civil Liability Act.  Section 46B will set out the principle that &quot;a person... who is convicted of the murder, attempted murder or manslaughter of another shall be precluded from taking any share in the property or estate of that other&quot;.  I have no difficulty in amending that at a later stage to include conspiracy to murder.<br/><br/>A further subsection states it &quot;shall not apply to any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence&quot;.  Somebody who asks somebody to kill another person would not be prosecuted with the crime of aiding or abetting; they would be prosecuted as a principal or prosecuted under conspiracy.  Aiding and abetting is obviously a lower level of involvement in any criminal act.  If needs be, we can adopt an open mind in respect of that.<br/><br/>Section 46C deals with the joint tenancy provision.  It states: &quot;Where the offender and the victim held property under a joint tenancy, the offender shall be precluded from obtaining the benefit of the right of survivorship.&quot; The right of survivorship stands severed at the time of the commission of the offence and &quot;the property shall be held in trust and subject to the respective beneficial interests of the victim and the offender&quot;.<br/><br/>Section 46C(2) states: &quot;Where proceedings are brought under this Part, the amount and value of the offender&rsquo;s interest in the property shall be determined by the court.&quot;  A number of factors need to be taken into account when assessing and appraising the level of interest and ownership that the offender can have in the property.  They are set out in section 46B(4).<br/><br/>Section 46D deals with the circumstances in which the court can modify or disapply the application of the provisions of section 46B if somebody has been convicted of manslaughter.  There may be circumstances pertaining to that which may direct a court in ensuring that it probably should not apply because exceptional circumstances operate.<br/><br/>Section 46E deals with civil proceedings.  It provides that where there is no criminal prosecution of the offender, an application can still be made under this Act to disqualify a person, who in the Act is described as an offender, from benefiting under the legislation.  Obviously it is unusual that a person who has not been convicted of a serious offence before any court of law would still be held liable under this legislation as somebody responsible for the death of another.  However, since it is a civil remedy, there is no reason it cannot apply.  People can be sued for wrongful death or for killing another person even in circumstances where there has been no criminal conviction.<br/><br/>Section 46F provides that the costs in proceedings should be borne by the offender.<br/><br/>I have had the opportunity of speaking to the family of Celine Cawley.  They were concerned that they had to bring an application that went to court.  They found it lengthy and very demanding on the family.  Their preference would be not to require an application to be brought to court and to ensure that the ownership rights of the offender would immediately be severed or abolished on the commission of an offence.  They just want to make the process easier.  That would be difficult to achieve.  When dealing with individuals' ownership rights, providing that their ownership rights are hereby being quashed would be susceptible to constitutional challenge.<br/><br/>More important, this will not be of any benefit for people whose family members have been killed in the past because it cannot operate retrospectively.  However, it is important to listen to the words of Ms Justice Laffoy in the decision of Cawley <i>v</i>. Lillis.  It is important for the Oireachtas to set out a legislative framework so that families and people will be aware of what rights operate particularly in respect of joint tenancies in circumstances where one spouse has been killed by another or one partner has been killed by another with whom they share a joint tenancy.  We should introduce legislation to deal with it.<br/><br/>I would be interested to hear what Professor Mee, Mr. Byrne and Ms Doyle have to say in respect of it.  They should feel free to be critical of it.  I would also appreciate if they could indicate what they believe should be done to deal with what is clearly an anomalous and inappropriate situation that somebody can kill another and yet benefit financially from that crime.</p></speech>

I am the brother of Paul Byrne who was murdered in September 2009.  Paul was murdered by his estranged spouse Tanya Doyle.  Paul was a project manager with a well-known company that carries several contracts for major companies throughout Ireland.  Paul's income was in excess of &euro;100,000 at the time of his death.</p> <p>  I will go through the background and how Paul and Tanya split up.  Paul had been stabbed in the back some years before his death.  This stabbing punctured his lung and was 1 cm short of puncturing his heart.  He was in hospital for about two months and on leaving hospital, he and Tanya went through a small stage before their separation.  Due to this separation Paul supported and provided money for an apartment and other financial implications in respect of their separation.  There was no legal responsibility for him to do that, but Paul lived up to his financial obligations as her husband.</p> <p>  Shortly afterwards, Tanya decided to go away.  I believe she went to Portugal.  She stayed in Portugal and Spain for a number of years.  Tanya and Paul remained in contact.  She said she had some difficulties there and Paul paid for her flight back to Ireland.  She then resumed living in the house with Paul.  They lived there together but had separate bedrooms.</p> <p>  They were in the process of going through a legal separation.  They had come to an agreement on the terms of that.  That settlement was due to be signed on the Tuesday after his death.  On the weekend of his death there was a 21st birthday party for our niece.  We live just outside Thurles.  We had made arrangements to call for Paul on the way over.  The intention was that we would go out for a drink with my father and the three of us would chat for the evening.</p><p>We were running a little late and hit the M50 at approximately 7.10 p.m.   We tried to call Paul to say we were heading to my sister's house and would meet him later.  However, his phone was engaged.  Due to the previous incident with Paul's stabbing, I decided, especially with Tanya living in the same house, that I needed to call him every day to ensure he was okay.  This fizzled back to ringing him mainly over the weekends and into Tuesday.  Because of his business, he would normally be away at some company around the country from Tuesday to Thursday night.  Such was the intensity of our fears that at one point he did not answer the phone and I was so worried that I decided to ring Tallaght Garda station to get them to drop around to the house.  We had second thoughts when I discussed it with my wife and sister.  When he rang me back in the morning, he thought it was quite funny that I thought I needed to take that step.</p><p> Paul's murder was pre-planned in the days running up to that Friday.  A carving knife was bought in a local store and a pre-arranged plan to kill him was set in action.  Paul called for a taxi at approximately 7 p.m. on the evening of his death to bring him out to my Dad's house.  A short while later, Tanya Doyle called the taxi company and cancelled the taxi.  The coroner's report as read out in court recorded that Paul was stabbed over 68 times and five of his vital organs were punctured.  Any one of those injuries would have caused his death.  He dialled 999 and the eight and three quarter minutes of the remainder of his life was recorded.  I will not go through the conversation recorded on the 999 call as Paul died.  Suffice it to say, the number of defensive wounds were critical.  There was one slash wound on his arm that peeled the skin back four inches.  At one point, he asked Tanya to call an ambulance.  She had stabbed him in the heart.  It is my belief that the last stab wound happened as he lay on the bed and the carving knife pierced one side of his neck and came out the other.  It took just under nine minutes for Paul to bleed to death.</p><p> Tanya was arrested at the house.  She was washing herself down and changing her clothes and was just about to leave when the police turned up.  Under questioning that evening, Tanya admitted to garda&iacute; that she had killed Paul for the house and his money.  She told garda&iacute; that there was no point in just stabbing him.  Our understanding of that was in reference to what happened before.  That would mean she would not get enough.  Tanya was convicted of murder in 2013.  If we look at the wider picture in relation to Paul's death, after the conviction took place and the estate went through probate, we received legal advice which recommended that, as a settlement, we needed to purchase her portion of the tenancy of the house.  Otherwise, she would be entitled to a key and to return there following her release from prison.  On contacting immediately after his death the financial controller in the company Paul where worked, we were given an undertaking that no moneys would be paid to Ms Doyle.  The financial controller changed a number of years afterwards.  After the trial, we contacted the financial controller, who was chair of the pension fund, and were told there was an obligation on them to pay her the spouse's portion of the benefit from the pension.  All other portions of the pension were paid to the family.  The amount of the pension was nearly &euro;23,000 a year and this is why Paul was murdered.  It was for the house and this money.  She stated that categorically to the police.  If she lived the average life expectancy of a woman, it would amount over that period to approximately &euro;1 million.  We were in contact with the insurance company that held the pension.  I ask the committee to note that I make no reference to the names of either his company or the insurance company.  I think that would be improper.  The insurance company said it had an obligation to pay this money.  We cannot understand how an insurance company would pay a convicted murderer who admitted killing a person for that money.  We cannot understand that person receiving any benefit whatsoever.  In 2016, the trustees of the pension sent us an email stating they had arrived at an agreement that no moneys would be paid.</p><p> It is a shame to think that this September, it will be ten years since 2009 and that a person who committed murder for gain is still in a position to receive that gain.  It is perhaps another issue but Tanya Doyle was up for parole in 2017 and will be up for parole again in June 2019.  As a family, we have been consistently struggling since 2009 with the events of this murder.  As a family, my wife, two sisters, their partners and I cannot understand how a person who admitted murdering somebody can benefit from that crime.  It is unbelievable that the Members of the Oireachtas have not done something sooner.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">A Women&rsquo;s Aid Femicide Watch report</font>found that on average, ten women are killed each year by their partner or spouse.  That is more than 100 people who have been murdered by their partner or spouse since 2009.  The families probably find themselves in similar situations to us and have to battle through with the same legal jargon and issues surrounding the deaths.  I find this very distressing.<br/><br/>Since the first report came out in 1996, the average is ten deaths per year.  Between 1996 and the end of this year, that will come to more than 225 deaths.  The families of those victims will have gone through a similar situation to us and nothing has been done about it yet.<br/><br/>I appreciate members' time this morning.  I apologise for going way over time.  I had talked through this presentation and was closer to my timing then but I appreciate the committee's tolerance and patience this morning. </p></speech>

It was very courageous address to us, which is greatly appreciated.</p> <p>  I now wish to introduce Professor John Mee, from University College Cork, and invite him to address the committee on this subject.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.903" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John Mee" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019032700002#J00300"><p>Mr. Byrne's statement was a very moving explanation of why this issue is so important.  I agree that we need legislation here and we are all here in our different ways to try to help the families of victims.  As someone who has thought about this for a long time and as a person who understands the law, all I can offer is to try to bring some kind of precision.  This sounds like it is very much at odds with the human pain experienced by these families but on the other hand it is the way to try to get it right and to help people.  There are some differing perceptions about the state of the law here and I believe that I can help in that regard.<br/><br/>My overall opinion is that a lot of work needs to be done to the Civil Liability (Amendment) (Prevention of Benefits from Homicide) Bill 2017 if it is to achieve its purpose.  No Bill is enacted the way it begins, but if this Bill was to be enacted, it could make things considerably worse.  It focuses on a perceived loophole that, as I will explain, is not a loophole in any conventional sense.  The Bill does, however, open three or four bona fide loopholes whereby criminals or murderers could profit from their crimes.  One could consider, for example, the tragic Nevin case.  Tom Nevin was murdered 23 years ago but because of bad drafting the last time the Oireachtas tried to deal with this matter, there is still a claim being made 23 years on.  The Act said that if a person was guilty of murder he or she would lose out.  The legislation did not say, as other jurisdictions do, that if a person is convicted of murder, that constitutes conclusive proof that the person is guilty.  Because of that bad drafting, the family have had to go through the courts.  Deputy O'Callaghan<b></b>referred to the difficulty of the family of Celine Cawley which, amongst the worst of things, is being dragged through litigation.  I would urge the Oireachtas to ensure the Act is properly drafted.<br/><br/>In a way, the most difficult part of what I have to say is on the perception that there is a loophole in the law, which I saw very strongly during the Second Stage debate on the Bill.  We have to understand that the law cannot be both ways.  The current law is that if a person murders another person and they had a joint tenancy, the killer retains his or her half share.  There is no sense in which it can be said that the killer takes everything.  The killer becomes the legal owner but there is a trust imposed.  This means, in practical terms, that the killer does not derive any benefit.  That is the mechanism this Bill will use.  This Bill states that from the time of the murder, there is a trust.  It is the same result.<br/><br/>In England none of this is legislated for and it is just a common law rule, as it was in Ireland until 1965 in relation to inheritance and as it is still with regard to joint tenancies.  Ireland's law is the same as that in England, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.  All of these are the only countries that have the joint tenancy provision.  New Zealand, for example, carefully legislated for this in detail in 2007 and they retained the current rule that we have.  It cannot really be described as a loophole.  One might think that maybe Ireland should be different to all of the other counties and do something that would be innovative but that is not really a loophole in the legislation.  Unfortunately, and I will explain if the members care to ask about it - I believe it would be unconstitutional.  I do not hold any brief for murderers or other criminals: I only care because the Constitution says that I have to care.  It would be unfair to families to pass legislation that when it came to be tested turned out to be unconstitutional, and what they had wanted to avoid happened anyway.<br/><br/>There are loopholes in the Bill, however, and there are smaller issues.  I will turn first to the main issue with the Bill, which is the exclusion of accomplices or accessories to murder.  I differ slightly on this point from Deputy O'Callaghan.  The point is that &quot;a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures&quot; is the definition of accessories in section 7(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1997.  It is not a lesser degree.  The Law Reform Commission clearly wanted to address this.  In pages 45 to 47 of its 2015 report on the subject, the commission singled out this aspect of people who are guilty of murder and decided that they deserve special treatment and that they should be exempted.  To be honest this is very surprising but it is not some kind of lesser thing: it is those people who have indeed been convicted as primary offenders.  Under Irish law, if one is an accomplice - if one drove the getaway car or hired the hitman - then one is guilty or murder.  Strangely, the Law Reform Commission wanted to exclude them and I believe this is simply indefensible.<br/><br/>There are other issues with the Bill that are less obvious, such as with fitness to plead.  The law says that if a person lacks mental capacity then he or she is not guilty of the crime and therefore the forfeiture rule does not apply to that person.  The Bill refers to unfitness to plead, but this is actually an error because unfitness to plead is an exemption that applies at the time of the trial - perhaps many years after the crime.  The point is that if a person with full mental capacity kills somebody with the intention to profit and then is not caught for five years, by which time he or she has dementia or as was said in one Australian case, perhaps the trauma of having committed the crime meant that the killer began to suffer from a mental illness, then that person will then be exempted.  That is just wrong.  Under this Bill even if one is dead one can be prevented from inheriting.  There are terrible cases where a person kills their family and then kills themselves.  There will never be a trial but this Bill correctly captures them.  If the killer is unfit to plead it should not be treated any differently than if the killer had died.That is a mistaken provision.<br/><br/>The next issue does not apply to murder but rather to people who commit lesser offences against their spouse or the child of their spouse.  Members may be familiar with the fact that a spouse is entitled to a fixed share in the other person's estate.  It may be one third or one half.  There needs to be something in the legislation that says that while it is an automatic right, if a person does something very bad to disqualify him or herself, such as commit a crime punishable by two or more years' imprisonment, then he or she loses that automatic right.  The Bill currently provides that &quot;Section 120(1) and (4) of the Succession Act 1965 are repealed&quot; without replacement.  This means that if a person raped his or her spouse or molested the children of the marriage, unless there had been a formal divorce or something else that interfered with his or her right to inherit, the person would be automatically entitled to take his or her legal right to the share, even if the spouse had disinherited him or her.  If the spouse had left all of the estate to somebody else, the person can say &quot;Well, we are still married and I want my half.&quot;  The person can insist on their half even though he or she committed these terrible crimes.  That is currently covered in the law.  The Law Reform Commission seemed to make an error in this regard.  It has said that there is a similar rule in relation to children and any provision for children is discretionary so it can be dealt with there.  The commission has overlooked the fact that the provision for spouses is not discretionary.<br/><br/>Another issue that is very hard to understand is why the offence of attempted murder is included.</p><p>The key principle here is the prevention of benefiting from one's crime.  If one kills someone, one inherits from that person's will.  If one kills someone in a joint tenancy, there is a danger one will benefit under that.  If one does not kill the person, he or she is not dead and there is no change to the legal position.  If the person dies 40 years later without disinheriting one, one will inherit.  It does not really make sense to pick out attempted murder when one does not include other serious crimes like rape or murder of a spouse.  This was challenged in 1965 when this difference was pointed out.  At the time, it was not taken on board.  It actually operates in a random way in relation to joint tenancies, if one thinks about it.  When one murders someone else, it is obviously bad for the killer to be prevented from inheriting under that person's will.  We think it is fair that the killer should suffer.  Under a joint tenancy, however, if a severance is created while the joint tenants are still alive and the right of survivorship is disapplied and each person can leave it to his or her own families, it will benefit whoever dies first.  One thinks of the terrible Hawe case.  If the man had attempted but failed to murder his spouse and then killed himself, the severance would mean she would be deprived of inheriting under the joint tenancy, as she otherwise would have.  It is random whether one severs it or not.  I should explain one aspect of the background.  Turning from severing the joint tenancy to the different type of co-ownership called "tenancy in common", it is the same thing except that there is no right of survivorship.  As such, there is no change in the status of the attempted killer and the other person.  They are still in a co-ownership situation together and the court has a discretion where someone applies to sell the house as to whether to consent.  It is important to understand the difference.</p><p> Those are the main points.  I would be happy to expand on the constitutionality point.  I might say a couple of sentences about it before I finish.  The key point of the Bill is the prevention of benefit from homicide and that must be its organising principle.  If something is a benefit one gets from the homicide, one cannot have it.  There is no constitutional objection.  The difficulty is if something is not a benefit and is the pre-existing property of the person.  In that case, no amount of discretion makes it okay to take it from that person.  It means taking the person's own property from him or her and it is not stopping him or her from getting a benefit.  Until 1870, there was a feudal idea that a killer suffered civil death and lost all of his or her property, which was taken away.  We stopped that in 1870 because it was said that the criminal law decided on the penalty and had various purposes, including the imposition of fines or the removal of some property.  A person is tried by a jury and given a sentence at the end.  He or she does not get an extra sentence on top of that.  It is not that I am feeling sorry for people.  If they are very bad, why should we not inflict more punishment on them?  The difficulty is that it is unconstitutional because one is taking their property.  The test for whether something is unconstitutional in relation to property is whether one is trying to achieve an important social objective that is of pressing concern.  The question arises as to whether the methods one is using are proportional.  In other words, are they arbitrary or irrational or are they connected to the objective?  If our objective is to prevent someone profiting from murder, providing a discretion to take from them something that is not a profit is unrelated to that objective.  The irrationality and arbitrariness relates to the fact that it is only focused on property that happened to have been held jointly before.  One cannot take any other property from them.  Part of the perceived and real injustice in the Cawley case was that she had contributed more to the marriage and put property in joint names, which he was getting to keep.  If he had given her the outright gift of a house, it would not have been covered.  However, if he gave her half the house, it would be covered.  Can members see the element of arbitrariness?</p><p> Deputy O'Callaghan asked the very reasonable question as to what should be done.  We should have the same law as we have at the moment except that it should be clear to save costs and pain for families.  The rule should be enshrined in legislation that one has a severance.  It is a joint tenancy in which the killer retains his or her half and the victim's family, excluding the killer, gets the other half.  One does not have the pain for the families then.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, the Cawley family wanted certainty.  They did not want to have to go to court and argue against the other person or for there to be a discretion.  The discretion in the Bill might allow a killer to get more than half, bizarrely.  The killer could make the application and point to the discretion, arguing that he or she should get more than half as he or she contributed more.  While it is complex, the avenue to be explored, albeit not, perhaps, in this Bill, is whether the killer gets a benefit by depriving the victim of the chance to sue in family law proceedings.  If I put a lot of money into a marriage, I would be able to sue my spouse in divorce proceedings and get money.  If my spouse kills me, that might be a benefit.  Possibly, the estate of the victim should be allowed to make a claim under family law legislation.  That might help the Hawe family, who would in no way benefit from the Bill as drafted.  Arguably, they might benefit under family law.  As I understand it, the man in that case took out &euro;24,000 from a joint bank account, thereby making it his own.  In a divorce situation, the court would normally find he had no right to that money and put it back into the pot.  This could possibly be done, albeit it is complex and would require careful thought.  Other countries do not do it, except New Zealand, which has stand-alone legislation.  There should be a stand-alone Act.  There is no justification for making it part of the Civil Liability Act.  In New Zealand's stand-alone legislation, there is a provision to give a victim's family the chance to make a claim under family law legislation.  The difference there, however, is that there is an automatic right to half the property, which is why that makes more sense.  My suggestion is that it is something that would have to be looked into and is not something that could be done in this Bill.  I am afraid, however, that the idea of a discretion in relation to the joint tenancy is unconstitutional and arbitrary.  The Law Reform Commission said that the majority of people suggested a different approach and that the hard situation was appropriate, but then this new idea was made up without any consultation.  That was ill-advised.</p></speech>

It is a complicated area and, as such, there are many things I did not say.  It would be better if there were legislation to introduce clarity and to deal with unusual situations such as circumstances in which there are three joint tenants and it is difficult to work that through.  It is also the case that a complication has been introduced, which is the main reason Ms Justice Laffoy suggested there should be reform.  However, this complication has been lost.  The complication is the special rule in respect of land only.  Previously, one could sever the joint tenancy at any time so it was very clear there was no profit for the killer in getting it converted to a tenancy in common.  He could have achieved that at any time without the consent of the other person by creating a unilateral deed to switch to the other type of co-ownership.  As such, there was no benefit.  However, section 30 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 introduced a rule that said one could not sever a joint tenancy without the prior written consent of the other joint tenants.  In relation to land only, and this is a matter of opinion and might not happen, one could see a situation where the killer could benefit.  Let us say the killer was suffering from a terminal illness and was going to die first and lose out on the survivorship, he or she might say he or she wanted to sever the joint tenancy but the other person would be entitled to refuse.</p><p>The person dying of cancer could go to court and say, "I want you to dispense with the need for consent on the basis that it is being unreasonably withheld."  If the court was to state "No", that person would be at the point of losing out completely and would then murder the other person.  If the two had a tenancy in common, they would achieve something they could not otherwise achieve.  It is complex point.  The suggestion made in my submission is that the principle is we want to stop the killer from gaining a benefit.  The court would have to try to identify the benefit and deprive him or her of it.</p></speech>

What happens is that there is a constructive trust, with half for the killer and half for the estate of the victim.  When we are deciding what the estate of the victim is, if he or she left everything to the husband who is the killer, separately he or she will be deprived of the right to inherit part of the estate.</p> <p>  The Deputy's main question is what profit does the killer receive when there is a severance?  In the Cawley-Lillis case Ms Justice Laffoy said there was no benefit.  She said there were all these imponderables.  We cannot which person would have lived longer.  She said that at the end of the day there was no benefit, that she was satisfied that creating this severance, which meant that everything stayed the same, except that there was no right of survivorship, would not benefit the killer.</p></speech>

The nature of a joint tenancy is unusual, but the idea is that both own everything.  When a person is callously murdered, his or her interest disappears and the other person continues to have everything.  We say that is not fair and that we cannot have it.  To solve the problem, we could say we would split it in half, the potential half share everybody had at the beginning.  The killer would go from having something that was really worth half, a joint tenancy that entitled them to occupy everything, to be turned into a half share in the future.</p></speech>

As members will be aware, AdVic is a registered charity run by volunteers - by the families bereaved by homicide.  We are there for the families and friends bereaved by homicide.  Apart from providing information and support, a key objective of AdVIC is to advocate for change in the criminal justice system because we have found that there is a lack fairness for victims, their families and the wider community.  </p> <p>  During the years, as an organisation, we have become aware that there is an egregious situation where the perpetrator of a homicide can benefit from his or her act in clear breach of core public policy principles.  Article 43 of the Constitution acknowledges the right to "private ownership of external goods" and goes on to recognise "that the exercise of the rights ... ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice".  In accordance with Article 43, the Succession Act provides that a person who is guilty of the murder, attempted murder or manslaughter of another person is prohibited from taking any share in the estate of the other person. The Act also provides: "Any share which a person is precluded from taking under this section shall be distributed as if that person had died before the deceased".  While the Act logically and effectively deals with the prevention of benefit from homicide under a will or intestacy, it does not address property that falls outside wills or intestacy, for instance, property held jointly - that is the default position for married couples or civil partners - and certain pensions and insurance policies.  In these instances, the perpetrator of a homicide can obtain substantial benefits from his or her act owing to the presumption of survivorship in the case of jointly owned property, or by receiving the proceeds of an insurance policy or pension.  That is the default position without the taking of a court case to have a constructive trust applied.</p> <p>  We very much welcome the Bill sponsored by Deputy O'Callaghan, as there is an extremely urgent need to address this travesty.  While we broadly agree with the provisions of the Bill, we are deeply disappointed that it fails to do what we believe is essential in these circumstances, that is, as a presumption, to sever the joint tenancy and vest the entire interest in the relevant property in the estate of the victim.  That is where we differ.  AdVIC also believes the provisions of section 46B(1) should also apply, in appropriate circumstances, to any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of a homicide, which is also in contrast to section 46B(3). </p> <p>  In 2015 AdVIC wholeheartedly supported the provisions of a Private Members' Bill drafted by former Senator Feargal Quinn, the Succession (Amendment) Bill 2015, which was debated in the Seanad.  It was held back because a Law Reform Commission report was being prepared.  That Bill dealt with the issue of joint tenancy by terminating the joint tenancy and vesting the entire interest in the property in the estate of the victim.  That is in contrast to the current Bill, in which the joint tenancy is severed and the property divided, meaning that the killer may avail of a share of the property, to deal with as he or she pleases.  We are told that this is to maintain the constitutionality of the legislation, as former Senator Feargal Quinn&rsquo;s Bill was considered by some to be at risk of a constitutional challenge.  We strongly disagree with this contention because the Succession Act, rightly, goes so far as to erase the "legal right share" of a spouse or civil partner who is guilty of homicide.  This is on a par with the provisions contained in the former Senator Feargal Quinn's Bill.   </p> <p>  I cut some of the presentation because I would have exceeded the time allotted.  I will address the severing of a joint tenancy which is prohibited by section 30 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act.  It is our contention that this Bill gives a clear benefit to a killer because it allows automatic severance and gives half, with court discretion, to him or her which he or she might never have obtained in the normal course of life.  What is being forgotten is we do not know what might have happened in the future.  Why should we presume that the person who was murdered would have died first and not the killer?  The Bill gives the killer the benefit of the doubt and that is where we differ.  There are some jurisdictions that have gone as far as stating it is against public policy to give a benefit to a killer, despite the property rights being argued for all of the time, because social justice should overcome property rights in circumstances such as this.</p><p>The argument is made that property rights exist but there are plenty of circumstances where existing property rights are challenged.  Under the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act, for example, property can be seized.  It was argued in almost every jurisdiction in the world that such a law would not work but it has worked.  Sometimes we have to work against the norm and take a step further.  In the case outlined, the family had to buy out the killer's share of a property that he may have never have owned in full or in part in the normal course of life but for his acceleration of the severance.  That is the core of our contention.</p></speech>

If one looks at places that have joint tenancies, like the 50 jurisdictions in America and the 30 to 40 other places, only two or three do what is being suggested.  In those jurisdictions in America, people have said that it is unconstitutional.  Nobody else does it but at least it is on the list of things one might want to do.  What is in the Bill is not on the list of things one might like to do.</p> <p>  The land situation is different, as I was trying to explain.  There is a complexity there with regard to land.  The worst that could have been done to the killer was that it would have lasted for the rest of his or her life.  We do not know when the victim would have died but we know that the killer could never have lost out until he or she died.  If the killer is in jail and alive for another 30 or 40 years and one takes the property from him or her, one is clearly putting the killer in a worse situation in terms of pre-existing property rights than he or she would have been in.  People are casting around for ways to punish the killer and the best they have come up with is to give him or her the property for the duration of his or her life and to take it from the killer then.  If one takes the property from the killer now, one is clearly punishing him or her.</p> <p>  An important question was asked about the application.  In any situation, there will have to be an application, even under section 120.  The law-----</p></speech>

One is to have a severance, with half given to each party, except where land is involved.  The alternative would be for the killer to lose all rights.  There would still have to be some kind of court action because one would have to prove that the person was convicted.  There would be-----</p></speech>

Let us say this terrible thing has happened and the family has to go to court to see by how much they can get the killer's share reduced.  It could be 10% or 20%.  If it is only 10%, they will feel bad and ask why the reduction was so small given the hideous nature of the crime.  The discretion in that context is not a good thing.</p> <p>  The difficulty here is with the Constitution.  Joint tenancy is an unusual thing in that rights are mixed up with each other.  What one wants to do, and what I would completely support, is to stop any benefit being achieved.  There is, however, the complexity of deciding what is a benefit in this situation.</p></speech>

We need legislation that says that to clarify the situation for families and reduce the chances of the killer bringing an action.  A killer can always initiate some vexatious action, but if it is written in black and white, the chances of that are reduced.  To be fair, it has already been established in the Cawley <i>v</i>. Lillis case.  It is clearer if it is all laid out in terms of procedures and something which says that the killer is liable for costs.  That is the advantage of legislation.  It allows us, as far as the law permits, to set it all out.  There would still have to be a certain element of flexibility but no discretion.</p></speech>

First, it puts the family through this uncertain, open-ended procedure under which, in theory, the killer could get more than them.  Second, the factors that are listed out have no resemblance to the key point in question.  Issues like the severity of the crime, the age of the killer, his or her needs and income, the age of the victim, his or her income as well as all sorts of factors that relate to divorce-type legislation, such as the contribution of each party to the particular asset, are only relevant to the idea referred to earlier in terms of it being like a family law case.  In that scenario, one could make an application for any of the property of the killer on the basis that the deceased would have got that in the event of divorce.  These factors are not relevant to the question of what constitutes a benefit. The key question is that of taking a benefit from the person, but we then look at factors like the person's age, the severity of the crime and what contributions the person made to the property before acquiring it.  Does the Deputy see how I think all of that is irrelevant?</p></speech>

If the discretion relates to pinning down the benefit obtained by the person and then taking that off him or her, that is okay.  If one is just looking at random factors that have been taken from the divorce legislation, however, even though the parties may not be married or even in a civil partnership or co-habitation-----</p></speech>

Most countries do not bother giving the legislative time to this and there is an element of misunderstanding that has led us to this draft legislation, which is good.

I am doing my best to explain it but I am not creating the complication.  The simple answer of just taking the property from the person is unconstitutional, so the suggestion is to take half.</p></speech>

This is what the Constitution and jurisprudence looks at.  We cannot just say killers are bad people and we want to take something off them.  That is fine but we must take it from everybody.  We cannot just say that if a killer happens to have jointly owned property with the victim, we will take it off him or her, but if not, he or she can keep all of his or her other property.</p></speech>

There were no children involved in our case.  When the estate went through probate, our family were entitled to half of the estate.  The other half was assigned over to Ms Doyle.  I imagine that answers Deputy O'Callaghan's question directly.  That was the position following probate.  To stop her from coming back to the house or from looking for possession of her portion of the house, we were advised that we had to buy her out.  That is was we are objecting to, because she received benefit from her crime.</p></speech>

This is about property that is tied in together in a scenario where we do not know who would have died first.  Presuming that the person who was murdered dies first, then giving the benefit to the killer is at the core of this.  That goes against public policy and all our constitutional principles.  We are giving a benefit to a killer to the disadvantage of the family of the person who was killed or we are giving the benefit to the killer's beneficiaries, who could be anyone.  All of the estate that would have gone to the victim if she had lived out her life normally would have gone to her beneficiaries.  What about their property rights?  I know they are not vested at that stage but those people are still being deprived.  That causes great emotional strain, as in this case where the family of the victim were forced to buy out the person who murdered the family member.  We have to go a little further and consider these situations.  It is not simply a case of splitting it because that is the fairest thing on grounds of property rights.  Currently, we are giving a benefit to a killer.</p></speech>

She has articulated the matter far better than I have.  Professor Mee made several points.  I will take them on board but I do not think it means the legislation is condemned.  Professor Mee made the point that it does not apply to any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence.  I am conscious of the discussion within the Law Reform Commission on the matter.  Of course, we could introduce an amendment to delete the provision.</p> <p>  Professor Mee also referred to the non-application of section 124.  That is a valid point.  If this legislation proceeds, that should not be amended.  It should be retained.  Professor Mee made an interesting point about attempted murder.  We could resolve that issue by removing attempted murder and replacing it with conspiracy to murder, which should be included.  I have taken up too much time.  I am conscious that others may wish to speak.</p></speech>

It is an incredibly traumatic discussion for many people.  It is an interesting question but a highly complicated area.  We may be in danger of overcomplicating it.  While these issues are incredibly emotional and personal to people and I am very sorry for the loss of the witnesses and the tragic circumstances, we cannot respond emotionally to these things.  We have a duty as legislators to put in place the best legislation.  It cannot be based on individual cases.</p> <p>  I have listened to all the contributions and my head is melting with much of the detail.  In some ways we may have overcomplicated the matter.  There seems to be a crossover.  Everyone agrees that no one should benefit from the proceeds of a crime.  Any right-thinking person would think that.  There is a major difference, however, between benefiting from a crime and the criminal being stripped of everything she owns.  If a person has a legal right to property, whether through a joint arrangement or whatever, that property still belongs to that person.  It is one thing if we are saying that as a penalty for the crime committed, the judge should look at everything and decide that because a person committed a crime, he should be stripped of everything he owns and should have no ownership rights, as per the old system, but I do not think we are suggesting that.  If we are saying there should be punishment for the crime provided that crime is ascertained, then I think that is in place.  The complication is that we are talking about the most horrific circumstances, in some ways, whereby people had a relationship or connection and joint ownership, but one person severed that link through a violent death.  We know when relationships sever it can be messy and highly cumbersome anyway.  If a person was killed in an accident, the survivors could be left with a mess if they did not deal with their separation properly and so on.  I am not clarifying the matter but the background is messy as far as I am concerned.</p> <p>  I was struck by Professor Mee's point that we do not have a particularly weird law here.  Already, cases have arisen where the 50% rule has been applied.  I am unsure where the benefit of Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan's Bill arises.  I think it overcomplicates the situation.  The point about attempted murder is relevant in that it is clear no succession arises.  We are only dealing with succession issues.  In cases of manslaughter, murder and other heinous crimes, the Bill would give a great deal of latitude to the courts.  Do we need it at all?  That is my question.</p> <p>  Reference was made to how this was motivated by the Cawley case.  The Cawley case was a manslaughter case.  The jury was asked at the time and the judge directed that it would have to give manslaughter if intent was not proven.  Intent was not proven in that case.  Another case is in the media at the moment.  There was a high-profile case of a woman, Sally Challen, in Britain.  She was convicted of the murder of her husband following an appalling life of abuse involving battered wife syndrome and so on.  Let us suppose she were convicted of manslaughter.  Would it be right in those circumstances that she should be stripped of the family home?  In that situation her children are 100% behind her.  What if there were other circumstances where one child sided with the mother and another sided with the father?  How would that pan out when the mother got out of prison?  Such a case could be a manslaughter case.  Under this legislation, is such a person, whom I would consider to be a victim, to be robbed of her home and everything?  That is something that I would like people to comment on.</p> <p>  I have some technical questions following my next point.  If the courts already tend to implement the 50:50 arrangement, what is the point of the legislation?  Is the purpose of this legislation to go further and strip the offender of more?  What is this about?  I do not really see benefit in this legislation at all.  I clearly understand why the victims of crime yearn for the benefit but I do not see them getting any benefit from this legislation.  I am unsure whether we need it given that there is already provision for prevention of someone benefiting from the proceeds of a crime.  I do not really get it.</p></speech>

The Law Reform Commission set out a lot of the areas that were not addressed.  Right now, we are dealing with the Succession Act only, and it deals with this under wills and intestacy, but the situation becomes more complicated when it is outside of that.  Where it is left to the courts to decide and they have no guidelines, this is where we should have legislation.  We believe the legislation should provide for the presumption that the entire property goes into the victim's estate, although it is always subject to discretion in the context of the particular circumstances, such as somebody being domestically abused at home for years.  We do not think everything should be taken from them in those circumstances.  However, we should have a default position and work from there and provide discretion.  Right now, there is nothing beyond the Succession Act to deal with anything outside wills and intestacy.  This includes an insurance policy or a pension policy to which someone would automatically be entitled, although it is being taken from the person they killed, because that is the person who had been nominated by the victim.  There is a lot to be dealt with in the legislation.</p></speech>

As things stand, the person in England, in the example that was given, would under Irish law just lose out.  However, as in England in 1982, Ireland under this Bill would be introducing a discretion that would only apply in regard to manslaughter.  Let us say there was a tragic case in England where the man was mentally ill, the wife stood by him and then she was frightened and got a shotgun, which went off.  Although it was technically manslaughter, she just got the Probation Act and they gave her relief against forfeiture and against losing out in that case.  This Bill would achieve that.  A problem with the drafting of the Bill is that, in regard to the joint tenancy, that discretion would also apply for no good reason in regard to murder.  If one thinks it should apply only to manslaughter, as the English do, it should not apply to murder.  That is a benefit of the Bill.</p> <p>  I want to restate why I think it would be a good idea to have legislation.  The Oireachtas usually would not get around to something like this but, having got around to it, it would give more clarity to the families and could clear up some technical points like the three-party situation and the complexity in regard to land.  It could also enact a protection for people who commit manslaughter but are not really that culpable where we would want to suspend it.  However, although there would be some benefits, it is not the crisis that has been portrayed.  It would be difficult for the families but it might be difficult also if it were enacted and did not have anything to strip the offender of more than their half.  In New Zealand, for example, a Bill was proposed to do what is being suggested here and to strip it down to nothing.  It went through the New Zealand Parliament, which decided it could not do that, and it put in what we currently have, which is the equal share.  It would achieve something but it would not be clarifying some huge anomaly.  It would just be making things a bit easier for the family, giving a discretion to relieve against manslaughter, and dealing with some other technical issues that are very complicated to talk about now, for example, the one about land.  It would achieve something but not as much as has been portrayed perhaps in the media.</p></speech>

It would be helpful but I do not think it is a panacea for many of the problems that are there.  I want to refer to some of the technical points.  When would the joint tenancy be severed?  Is it severed as soon as somebody is charged with the offence or when they are convicted?  What is the threshold for when that happens?</p></speech>

We do not know whether it happened, but later on, when we decide on the balance of probabilities that this crime happened, we know retrospectively that, at that instant, the severance took place.  It states in the Bill that it would only take place in equity, so there would be a kind of trust.  A part of my difficulty is that an awful lot of the wording in the Bill is unsatisfactory and unclear, and I wrote 30 pages talking about these very small things, any of which could drag the victim into court, so it has to be got right.  The Bill states that the legal and beneficial interest shall stand severed from the moment of the crime and, then, in the next section, it states that there will be a constructive trust, but those two parts do not mean the same thing, so the wording is off.  Something happens at the moment of the crime and only later do we know that.  To be honest, I do not think this is the way it would be in other jurisdictions but that is how the Bill is at present.  At the time of the crime there is a constructive trust but later on we have to prove that the crime happened.</p></speech>

I do not think that is problematic.  I do not think it is an issue that there is a severance and it is identified as being severed from the date of the offence.  It does not really alter it.  Obviously, there is a process for a court to determine whether it should stand severed, but if the court, based on the evidence, reaches a conclusion that the provision applies, it just applies it retrospectively from the date the offence was committed.</p></speech>

What if somebody got away with murder?  If someone got away with murder, in principle there should have been the severance and they should not have been allowed from that moment, but we never found out and they got away with it.  In other words, the law is constrained by the facts of reality and whether we know what happened.  If we know what happened, however, the family can go forward and say there is going to be a severance from that date.  In theory, if it happened but nobody knows that it happened, that is life.

In particular, I thank Mr. Byrne and I am sure it was difficult to go through those facts again.  I also thank Professor Mee and Ms Doyle for their testimony.  It is very difficult because, in the abstract, the person in the street would see it as a benefit to the killer to take full possession of the property or, in practice, his or her share of the property.</p><p>From what Professor Mee has said, it is my sense that under the joint tenancies law as it operates, the killer's 50% share after the point of severance is effectively constitutionally inviolable.  </p></speech>

In relation to land, however, it is a bit different.  I can see what the Bill would look like.  If I had to draft it I would get rid of that discretion: I would make provision for an automatic half share and say that in cases of land where the section 30 prohibition comes in the court can determine what benefit it thinks the killer got from getting around that section 30 prohibition on severance, and that the court can make an order accordingly.  It is messy but what can one do? Section 30 is an unpredictable thing but it is in there.  Legislators could get rid of it and I would be all in favour of that.<br/><br/>If the Bill does not get rid of section 30 then one could deal with it in the way I have suggested.  AdVIC would be getting some of what it wants in this regard around cases involving a house - one of the most important elements in such cases - and something that the court decided was a benefit would be taken off the killer, or sometimes he or she would get less than one half.  This would focus on the issue of prevention of benefit, which is what this is all about.  It is just hard to pin down what the benefit is but we do not want to give the killer the benefit just because it is hard to pin down.<br/><br/>There are other expert views on this, but my view is that this would not be unconstitutional if it was just to focus on the prevention of benefits from homicide, which is in the Title of the Bill.  Nobody thinks a killer should get a benefit from the homicide but nobody thinks that they should forfeit their constitutional right.  This would be easy from a theoretical perspective if there was no section 30 and the share would just be 50:50.  Section 30, however, creates complications.<br/><br/>Ms Justice Laffoy's opinion on the facts of the Cawley <i>v</i>Lillis case was that there was not any benefit to the killer.  On the facts of that case the killer would have got the half share.  In another case where the killer was much older or where there had been an attempt to sever the joint tenancy before the death it could be difficult to work in practice but I am not sure what else one can do in this regard because section 30 is there.  There is a lesson in that: section 30 is in statute but nobody else in all of the other jurisdictions has it.  Sometimes we just get ideas and enact legislation that is totally different from everywhere else.  It then complicates our law unnecessarily.</p></speech>

This is the crux of the issue: the assumption should not be that the person who has died would not have outlived the person who committed the offence.

It has happened because the people were connected legally and there is a joint ownership.  It was their relationship that gave them the ownership because they jointly owned the property.  In the tragic case of Mr. Byrne's brother, for example, if the separation had been completed we would not be here talking about this at all because the legal interest that his ex-wife had at that time would have been gone.  It was, however, her property up until the point they completed a separation.  It was their connection that gives the ownership right, not the death.

There is an assumption being made that he would have died first and that she would have been entitled to the estate anyway.  The normal course of events did not determine that.  If we leave aside why my brother was murdered and look at the other 225 cases that have happened since 1996 one cannot say that the partner who was killed or died would not have outlived the other partner.

Imagine that there was never any murder and 20 years later one of the couple dies.  The dead person's share is automatically extinguished and the other person's share becomes everything.  That does not happen by virtue of a will: it happens automatically because of the nature of the institution of the joint tenancy.  It is a key point.  If two people are joint tenants and we were to ask "who would die first?" the answer is that we cannot know.  In Cawley v Lillis Ms Justice Laffoy commented that one cannot tell which joint tenant would die first and that it was one of the "imponderables" of the case.  The other key point is that when the estate is not land anyone can sever at any time without permission from the other person.  They can go to their solicitor and make a deed that has nothing to do with the other person.  Outside of land it is hard to see how a killer would benefit because instead of murdering the other person he or she could just achieve it automatically, in an office and without permission from the other person.  This is partly what has motivated other countries.  A person could get there any time that he or she wanted.  The land situation is unusual because with section 30 one cannot sever the joint tenancy oneself.  Ms Justice Laffoy also felt that this problem is special with regard to land.  The equivalence is not so obvious anymore.  Instead of a man murdering his wife in a terrible way, for example, he could just have severed the joint tenancy and had the same result with regard to benefit and it did not really seem like profit.  With land, however, one could not do that.  On the other hand if the person refused to sign, one could have asked the court and the court might have allowed the severance.  It is very hard to pin it down.  </p> <p>  Section 30 is a very strange provision.  Let us consider two adults, say they are both 30 years old, and one wants to sever the joint tenancy but the other says "No because I think you are going to die first.".  The first person might ask "Why would you think that?  Please agree to sign.". The other person still will not and the case goes to court with the first person saying the other is unreasonable.  In my submission I suggested that the best one could do was to look at it to see if the court would have allowed the severance if the person had asked for it instead of committing a murder.  If the court would not have allowed it then we would try to think what benefit has the person got from achieving the severance.  There would be an element of actuarial calculations while the court tried to work out what benefit had been achieved and tried to undo that.  This is the best I can think of.</p><p>The problem is caused by section 30 being an unusual provision.  </p></speech>

Am I correct that Professor Mee's position is that there is a need for legislation but only to clarify a jurisprudence rule?  Ms Justice Laffoy made the point that the precedent is that there is a constructive trust and that property is managed in that way but that this needs to be clarified through statute.  Leaving the land and conveyancing issues aside, are there additional points that need to be addressed?  </p> <p>  Professor Mee seemed to speak favourably about the legislation in New Zealand, but perhaps I misunderstood him.  If not, are there elements of that legislation that we need to take into account?</p></speech>

I believe legislation is necessary to clarify the matter and, unfortunately, because of the section 30 complexity.  It also needs to provide for the discretion referred to by Deputy Clare Daly for the person who commits manslaughter and is not that blameworthy.  They would be benefits to the legislation, but life would be a lot easier for all of us if section 30 did not exist.  I could make a simple argument, that the split has to be 50:50 but we would need an amendment to deal with section 30.  The Bill is useful because it would reduce the uncertainty for families, reduces legal costs and it provide discretion in regard to manslaughter wherein somebody is not very blameworthy.  It would also allow for the taking of a decision on the three-party joint tenancy cases, such as picking one such that there would never have to be litigation.  It would achieve something, but it will not be easy to draft.  It needs work.</p></speech>

The current draft provides that a person cannot benefit from any property that the victim had an interest in but a life insurance policy does not operate in that way.  I could take out a life insurance policy on a person and I could then murder that person.  The victim does not have any interest in the policy so the wording would have to be different to cover that.  When there is no law, there is flexibility in the sense that the judge can take the view that he or she has a general principle in mind which he or she had not thought of before but the situation before him or her falls into it.  The New Zealand legislation includes the provision that in any other instance where a person is profiting from his or her homicide, the court shall make the appropriate order.  This provision could be included in this Bill to sweep up anything that is missed but that could be dangerous because a judge might do something that was unwarranted and then there would be a lot of litigation to get it reversed.  The Bill, if properly drafted, could work but my concern is that it would be rushed through without being properly drafted.  We do not want to end up thinking that we have solved the problem only to find that once implemented, misery was caused.</p></speech>

In respect of all other properties it is difficult to establish how they might be split or what claim the estate of the deceased or the murderer might have on them?  In the case of the main property held in joint tenancy, potentially the deceased would have come to benefit from the entirety of the property, which is relatively clear.  Is it in any sense arguable that it is not arbitrary because we have an understanding of what might otherwise have happened with that property?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.1058" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John Mee" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019032700002#R00100"><p>Part of the reason I think it is arbitrary is that the list of factors to govern the discretion are wide ranging and not relevant to the question of benefit.  I mentioned earlier that, if I was a member of Advocates for Victims of Homicide, AdVIC, I would ask whether a killer is benefitting from the crime.  Consider a situation whereby a killer kills somebody from whom they were liable to become divorced and thereby stood to lose many of their assets.  When they murder the person, that divorce does not happen.  Those aspects of the Bill which say the amount that each contributed to the acquisition of the property and what they contributed to their family intend to address such a situation.  It seems to be a gesture towards an idea.</p> <p>  There was a perception in the Cawley case that all this money had been brought into the family and given to Eamon Lillis and now he is getting away with it.  In the normal situation, that is just part of the history of the matter.  He inherited ownership and those things cannot be taken from him but he is also escaping getting divorced.  This will take a lot of thought and cannot just be written into this Bill.  </p> <p>  In the case of a murder victim, or other unusual cases where it might help the children, would it be appropriate for the estate to be able to make a claim under divorce, civil partnership or cohabitation legislation?  I do not see anything in this Bill that would help the situation in which the Hawe family find themselves.  It is a different situation to one in which a person empties another's bank account and, after a divorce, that money is returned.</p> <p>  This is specifically in the New Zealand legislation.  The situation is fixed in New Zealand so that each partner more or less gets half the joint assets of the couple.  In Ireland, the money that one gets depends on how much one needs to live - though that does not apply where one is dead and does not need money to live.  It is not easy to do but would be possible if it was thought about carefully.  </p> <p>  To get the Bill through, it would be possible to get rid of the discretion and make half the standard settlement.  Something would have to be inserted to deal with section 30, which would be complicated.  If I was the Minister, I would tell the Hawe family that we have to look into it and see what we can do to help.  </p> <p>  One should not legislate for whatever was the latest terrible thing that happened, as Deputy Clare Daly said.  Such legislation might address the concerns of one set of victims but the next set will have a different set of concerns and these Bills do not get amended.  I am not sure that is a good idea because I do not know how it would be controlled but it should be looked into and thought about.  It certainly would be something that other countries have not done and, as to whether it would work, I do not know.  It is an area of inquiry the Legislature could go down.</p> <p>  I suggest this Bill should be like the one in New Zealand.  It should be a stand-alone Bill that is quite detailed, deals with these issues and says that one cannot benefit from pensions in these cases.  It provides for 50:50 on the distribution of assets and includes discretion in cases of manslaughter.  There is a shape that a Bill should take which this does not have yet.  That is what I would do.</p></speech>

They were discussing the fact that aiding and abetting is not included.  The LRC and Deputy O'Callaghan seemed to understand that somebody taking part in a conspiracy to murder could be charged with murder but Professor Mee seemed to have a contrary view.  What is the distinction between aiding and abetting and conspiracy?  Are they one and the same?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.1060" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John Mee" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019032700002#R00300"><p>In some ways, Deputy O'Callaghan is assuming that someone accused of aiding and abetting a murder did not make as bad a mistake as they did.  I find what the LRC said very hard to justify.  It was looking at the definition of an "accomplice", which the 1997 legislation says is a principal offender, meaning that an accomplice is as bad as a principal offender.  The commission is saying that it is now dealing with civil law which does not have to agree with the criminal law.  It is second guessing the criminal law saying that an accomplice might not be a very bad person and there might be a range of culpability.  The LRC seems to be saying that someone might have hired a hitman, which is bad, but the person themselves only drove the car and were young so it is not as bad and, in such a situation, the inheritance is not going to taken from that person.  The proper response is to say that it is murder if the criminal law says it is murder.  It is the worst crime on our Statute Book.  One is guilty of murder and that is it.  The civil law cannot second guess it and say that it thinks that someone who is a murderer in the eyes of the criminal law is not too bad.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan was saying that accomplices are tried as principal offenders, which they are, and the LRC is saying such cases will be separated.  These people who are found guilty as principal offenders because they aided and abetted will be totally excluded from the legislation unlike those who carried out the crime themselves.  A gangland leader who hired others to kill someone could inherit, or in cases where someone hired a hitman, like the Nevin case, that person could inherit.  It is a surprising aspect of the Bill but it is easily dealt with because it can just be deleted.  </p> <p>  It was suggested, in the debates, that maybe there could be a discretion but the discretion should only apply if it is being applied to all people who are guilty of murder.  There is no particular reason to single out some murderers for special treatment.  Discretion should apply to everybody convicted or murder or only to people convicted of manslaughter.  Does that answer the question?</p></speech>

This is a complex matter.  As legislators, we have to be careful because, while it is our duty to legislate, it is also our duty to do less harm than good.

This Bill is unusual because the LRC does not usually draft a Bill in final form.  My experience is that Bills often change quite a bit from the time they are drafted to the time they go through the parliamentary office and so on.  That is part of the development process and this Bill needs quite a bit of development.  The Legislature has to get the Bill right because one slip can have significant consequences, like section 120(1) of the 1965 Succession Act, which had the Nevins in court for 23 years after the event.  One has to get it right or it is painful.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.1070" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1427" speakername="Marie Louise O'Donnell" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019032700002#R01300"><p>I want to make some general comments.  I have a lack of knowledge of the law until it applies at my front door.  I know Mr. Byrne possibly had a lack of knowledge of the law until it came to his front door, as was the case with Ms Deane.  I am a patron of AdVIC which is one of the correct things I have done since I came to the Seanad because I have learned what happens to people, from parole to minimal custodial sentencing, and these are things that Deputy O'Callaghan is also trying to rectify.</p> <p>  It is difficult to speak about first degree convicted murderers having the same rights as people they have murdered.  I find that difficult to understand from an emotional point of view but I bow to the law.  I am hearing that property rights take precedence over social justice and that is the bottom line here.  Are we saying that property rights take precedence over wilful, first degree murder?  That is what we are arguing here, on a pin.  As Mr. Byrne mentioned, we have kept arguing the point since 2009, waiting and delaying on decisions so I congratulate Deputy O'Callaghan for bringing this forward.  I agree totally with Professor Mee that there should be a stand-alone Bill because it will be cleaner and clearer.  The Legislature will be able to do exactly what it says, as opposed to having it in a civil liability amendment.  Deputy O'Callaghan might like to talk about that.</p> <p>  What happens insurance policies, investments and other bank accounts?  Are they covered in the Bill?  Does it just apply to property?  The arguments about who would have a lifeline first and who would have died first pale into insignificance when somebody purposely shortens the life of somebody else.  It becomes a different argument.</p><p>However, either way I would like to see this legislation being progressed.  I would like the parole element to be progressed as well.  It is very important and we have delayed and lingered on this long enough.  Those are general points about the Bill, the stand-alone nature of it and other aspects, including investments.</p></speech>

Before I call the Deputy, would Professor Mee, Mr. Byrne or Ms Doyle like to respond to Senator O'Donnell's points?</p></speech>

Victims are very fragile sometimes and killers have great energy, chaos has great energy, and the victims get silenced all the time.  The energy, the push, the language and the law sometimes seem to be behind the perpetrators.  I am talking about convicted first degree murderers.  I am not talking about fatal assault or even manslaughter.  Those are different areas.  There seems to be an energy behind this, even with the coming back to court on the head of a pin of the law, and the victims are being delayed and have to wait.  We argue the clippings of tin around the victims.  The power and the energy seems to be in the chaos and not around the victim, but the victim and everything surrounding them should come first.  Our inference is in the wrong place.</p></speech>

That is why it is good to have legislation but also it must be right.  While we have waited so long for it, if we get something that is not right, that is a perfect weapon for the person with the energy.</p> <p>  One point that has not come up that is worth airing is the issue of other offences such as assisted suicide or, less importantly, infanticide.  On the matter of assisted suicide, in the Law Reform Commission's report it was said that most people thought it should be included and then it never mentioned it again and it was not included.  An individual could mess with a person's head and get them to commit suicide and then that individual could inherit.  That would be very bad.  On the other hand, one could be assisting suicide in a much less blameworthy way if someone was at the end of their life and was in great pain.  Possibly that issue should be in the Bill and covered by discretion so that there could be discretion to relieve against that in a less meritorious case.  A person could profit if they manipulated somebody and got them to commit suicide.  Certainly it is an issue that should be discussed.  The Law Reform Commission seemed to say that most people were in favour of including that, and then it never talked about it again.</p></speech>

I am not in any way proprietorial or sensitive about it.  The most important thing is that if we are introducing legislation, we get it right.  We will take on board everything that has been said here this morning.  Certainly neither I nor any other member of the committee nor anybody else wants to introduce legislation that could have unintended consequences.</p> <p>  However, the principle behind the legislation stands.  I am pleased to hear that Professor Mee thinks it is appropriate that we introduce the legislation.  The benefit of legislation is that it prevents people from having to go to courts in the uncertainty about trying to establish trusts before courts of equity.  The benefit of having statutes in place is that people can identity their rights and the processes and applications they have to bring forward.  I am conscious of what Professor Mee said, however, that legislation can tie us up sometimes because something can be put into legislation that may have unintended consequences.</p> <p>  We will consider all the submissions, as we always do.  I will not plough ahead with the legislation without hearing the views of the committee.  We will produce a report.  If we think it is more appropriate to amend it in significant ways, I have no difficulty in doing that.  Alternatively, we can take on board many of the recommendations that have been made for  the purpose of amending it.  There is a need for legislation.  We can have an interesting discussion about property rights, constructive trusts, joint tenancies and tenancies in common, but it is not unfair and not wrong for families to believe in circumstances such as the case of Noel's brother, the Cawley case or the Hawe case that persons have benefited as a result of wrongful acts.  We need to introduce legislation to give effect to that.  I thank everyone and the Chairman.</p></speech>

He has summed it up very well.  We are all agreed that legislation is required.  The question mark is regarding whether the Bill before us for consideration can or will fulfil all its promise.  There are questions there that need careful address over the time ahead.  I thank Professor Mee, Mr. Byrne and Ms Doyle for being witnesses here this morning and for their contributions.  I will not single anyone out.  I thank them very much.  I take this opportunity as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and on behalf of the members to extend our sympathy and solidarity to Noel and his family.  The loss of his brother is something he will be conscious of throughout all of his life and we are very aware of that.  I also thank Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell.

Our officials have provided committee members with detailed briefing material for use at the meeting, which includes comprehensive financial and recipient data.  This briefing also provides updates on the Department's performance on its output targets for 2018.</p> <p>  On foot of the observations made by the Chairman at last year's meeting, the briefing this year provides for a clearer comparison with last year's expenditure and the Estimates for 2019.  Tables have been provided which show last year's outturn excluding the payment of the Christmas bonus allowing for a like-for-like comparison.  Additional columns have also been included which explain the variance between actual expenditure for 2018 and the Estimate for 2019.  I hope this provides more clarity to the committee.</p> <p>  As members know, the work of the Department is broad in scope and has widened over the last number of years.  Throughout the life cycle, the Department offers services and income support to people from the payment of child benefit to supporting people through income support until they reach pension age.  The Department's expenditure, at &euro;20.5 billion for 2019, is the largest of any Department and accounts for 35% of gross current Government expenditure.  To put this in perspective, each week, over 1.3 million people - pensioners, people with disabilities, people on maternity or sick leave, carers, and jobseekers - receive a payment from my Department.  In addition, over 628,000 families receive child benefit each month in respect of 1.2 million children.  With this level of expenditure, we must ensure that our social protection system is properly structured and that it provides support when people need it most.  We also aim to ensure that the system is flexible enough to deal with changes in the economy and society in order that we are ready to deal with changes and challenges if they emerge.  </p> <p>  Without the social transfers we provide, we would see a society in which poverty and social exclusion were much more extreme and acute.  We are grateful to be able to do that.  As I mentioned, the &euro;20.5 billion departmental budget represents 35% of gross current Government expenditure and it useful for a moment to consider the areas in which this money is to be spent.  The biggest single block of expenditure in 2019 will be on pensions, which will amount to more than &euro;8 billion, or 39% of overall expenditure.  As our population ages as, thankfully, people are living longer and healthier lives, an increasing proportion of departmental expenditure will go to pension provision and providing income support for people in their older years.  </p> <p>  Expenditure on illness, disability and carers' payments amount to &euro;4.4 billion in 2019, representing 22% of expenditure.  We will see a further reduction in expenditure on working age income support schemes in 2019, largely driven by the ongoing downward trend in the number of jobseeker payments.  Working age income supports will account for 16% of our output, or &euro;3.2 billion this year.  That also includes one-parent families, maternity and paternity payments and supplementary welfare allowances, as well as jobseeker payments.  In parallel, expenditure on employment supports, including community employment, back-to-education allowances, T&uacute;s, the rural social scheme and various employment and activation programmes, amounts to &euro;724 million this year or 3.5% of expenditure.  Expenditure on working age employment supports is decreasing, reflecting reduced demand in the context of rising employment and reductions in unemployment, which we all think is a great thing.  </p> <p>  Expenditure on children and families will account for over 13%, or &euro;2.7 billion, of which &euro;2.1 billion is spent on child benefit and &euro;416 million is spent on working family payment supports.  Expenditure on supplementary payments like rent supplement and on agencies like the Citizens Information Board and miscellaneous services accounts for &euro;806 million or just over 4% of expenditure.    </p> <p>  As I mentioned, 2018 saw a continuing fall in the live register and improvements in the labour market.  Last week, the live register was at 193,300 people, more than 37,000 fewer people than was the case at the same time last year and over 75,000 fewer people than two years ago.  This is great and welcome but we must not forget those people who are still unemployed.  The Department's schemes and services are continuously adapting to ensure that they encourage movement from unemployment to employment or training and that we support people through activation services and employment opportunities and programmes where they need additional help to find a job.  </p> <p>  In budget 2019, my second budget as Minister, I sought to focus on encouraging employment and supporting families with children.  Building on the increases made in 2017 and 2018, people receiving weekly social welfare payments saw another increase in their rates, with &euro;5 being added to the maximum weekly rates of payment, which is happening this week.  Proportionate increases are also provided to qualified adults.  Again, these increases will benefit our pensioners, people with disabilities, carers and jobseekers and will take effect from this week.  Over the last four budgets, the Government has tried to increase the main weekly rates of payment by &euro;15 per week and the main rates of State pension by &euro;18 per week.  This year, we are again increasing the rate for qualified children.  Last year was the first time it was done and the rate is being increased this week by &euro;2.20 for children up to the age of 12 and &euro;5.20 for children aged 12 years and over.  The rates are now &euro;34 and &euro;37 per week respectively.  This represents increases for children in households dependent upon social welfare and is a direct response to evidence presented by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice and Barnardos that the cost of raising and caring for children increases once that child reaches his or her secondary school years. </p> <p>  The rate of daily expenses allowance, formerly known as direct provision allowance, is being increased to the levels recommended in the McMahon report.  The rate for an adult will rise by &euro;17.80 to &euro;38.80 and, for children, it will rise by &euro;8.20 to &euro;29.80.  The income disregard for lone parents is again being increased by &euro;20 to bring it to &euro;150 per week and a new disregard for maintenance payments, which are used towards housing costs, will be introduced to the working family payment. </p> <p>  This year will see the introduction of a new jobseeker's benefit payment for the self-employed.  My Department and I are currently working through the finer details of the scheme, which will provide a safety net not currently available to people setting up, running their own businesses and providing tens if not hundreds of thousands of jobs for others.  In addition, a new parental benefit scheme will be introduced later this year which will allow both parents to access paid parental leave within the first year of their child's life.  Other measures include the fuel allowance season being extended by one week, which will be paid in April, and a new hot school meals pilot programme, which is almost ready to be rolled out.  The proof of concept for that started in January of this year and has gone incredibly well.  It will be provided in up to 36 schools this year and, if successful, which I have no doubt it will be, my aim is to extend the scheme to a much wider audience.  We are also commissioning research into the cost of disability which I hope will provide this committee and my Department with evidence to inform future policy direction, services and payments in this area.   </p> <p>  The Department has also provided briefing in relation to progress against claims processing targets which I know is important to this committee.  For many of the Department's schemes, claims are processed within or close to the Department's processing time standards.  There were significant improvement in processing times for domiciliary care allowance in 2018.</p><p>However, for some schemes, the processing time standards were not achieved in 2018, particularly for illness related schemes.  In mid-October additional staff were assigned to the carer&rsquo;s allowance area and it resulted in a 35% reduction in the number of claims awaiting decision at the end of February 2019, as compared to the number at the end of September 2018.  Given this reduction in the number of claims pending, it is expected that claim processing times will improve in the coming weeks.  We will watch this carefully and reallocate staff if they do not.  As I have said before, my Department is committed to ensuring claims are processed as quickly as possible and that delays are kept to a minimum.  It is also worth mentioning again that anyone who is awaiting a decision on a social welfare payment can apply for a means-tested supplementary welfare allowance payment, pending the outcome of their social welfare application. </p><p> In comparing the Department&rsquo;s expenditure in 2018 with the allocation for 2019 it is important to note that variances in expenditure under most social welfare schemes are typically explained by a combination of factors, including trends, including downward trends, in recipient numbers; changes in average weekly payment values; and differences in the number of pay days in any given year.  In addition, comparisons in expenditure between 2018 and 2019 are impacted on by the measures introduced in budget 2019, including the increases in the weekly rates of payment, the carryover costs of budget 2018 measures and the payment of a 100% Christmas bonus in 2018, at a cost of &euro;265 million.  Provision for the bonus is made, subject to the financial position of the State, in October each year as part of the budgetary process and is not included in the Revised Estimates.</p><p> As I mentioned, I hope the revised presentation in the committee&rsquo;s brief for this year provides greater clarity on the ability to compare 2018 expenditure and the 2019 Estimate.  We live in uncertain times.  What my Department and I intend to do is deliver some certainty to people when they meet challenges in their lives.  The Department supports people during these life events when they cannot support themselves.  Fortunately, as the economy has improved, we have been in a position to provide greater resources for improvements in the social protection system.  In my statement I have sought to provide the committee with an overview of the scale and scope of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure and how many people it reaches and illustrate how we could not manage without it.</p></speech>

They are now comparing like with like which gives a truer reflection of the position.  The Minister has said the Christmas bonus was not included in the Revised Estimates but that a decision is made, depending on the financial position of the State, in October.  We need to move away from that situation because recipients of the bonus have built it into their annual expectations.  It is an expensive time of year and most people do not have the capacity to get through the Christmas period without this payment.  It is not a luxury, rather it has become a necessity.  Therefore, we need to build it into the annual Estimates, rather than allowing it to be an optional payment that comes about by chance or good fortune.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned pensions.  A year ago we spoke about the anomaly for persons in receipt of a pension since 2012.  That issue has not been addressed in full and there are still many people affected.  Perhaps the Minister might bring us up to date on the matter.  We thought it would have been completed by now.  A significant number of people do not know where they stand.  More importantly, we do not know when the entire process will be completed.</p></speech>

I have said on a number of occasions that once the legislation is passed and the regulations are signed, we will start the review process for the 80,000 or so people involved, each of whom has received a letter.  They have all been invited to come forward.  Where there are gaps in their payments or contribution history, they have been invited to fill them in.  The Chairman seems to be making an assumption that the onus to provide the information is on the Department, but we can only move so fast with the information given to us.  As it has been provided, reviews have taken place.  Some 8,500 people have received a completed review and been given a payment.  There is no delay on the part of the Department.  We took on 120 staff specifically to do this job.  They are reviewing on a daily basis the cases of people who were adversely affected by the changes made in 2012.  In some cases, there has been no change following the review, but for 80% there is an uplift, backdated to March 2018, while the others carry on as before.  As long as there are people affected, they will continue to receive a service from us.  We will not stop until the review for everybody review has been completed.</p></speech>

I was under the impression that if the information on any gap resided in the Department such as in the case of child benefit, those cases would be completed first and that claimants would have to deal with other gaps themselves.  If somebody was out of work for a ten-year period and had children, the Department would have the dates for when children benefit applied.  Does the claimant have to supply this information or does the Department deal with it automatically?</p></speech>

Whether it is conducted with information held within the Department, it still has to take place.  For example, an operative in Sligo has to check the record and if he or she can find all of the gaps, he or she can conduct the review without the intervention of the claimant and it will be completed more quickly than if he or she has to invite the claimant to come forward to fill in the gaps.  There are 87,000 records that need to be gone through.  Everyone has to go through a review by one of the 120 members of staff to whom I referred.  We did not pick the cases without gaps first, as that would not have been fair.  Instead, it has been done chronologically.  Everybody's case will be reached and all those with information to give us are encouraged to share it with us as quickly as possible.  I am told that almost 24,000 requests for information have been issued to date but fewer than half have responded.</p></speech>

However, I only received the supplementary information yesterday afternoon.  I do not know if others received it sooner.</p> <p>  There has been a substantial saving in jobseeker's allowance payments arising from the drop in unemployment and it feeds through to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  I notice that there has been a very sharp drop in the budget for exceptional needs payment, from &euro;43.8 million to &euro;38.5 million.  Is the scheme demand-led?  Is any specific provision made for it?  Staff in local offices have told me that they were out of money in the exceptional needs fund, but I take it that is not correct.</p> <p>  A small sum of &euro;2 million has been provided in 2019 to extend jobseeker's benefit to the self-employed.</p><p>When is that scheme due to commence?  In regard to the working age employment supports, there has been a shocking decrease in the take-up of that support and, therefore, payment of the back-to-work enterprise allowance scheme and the back-to-education allowance scheme.  If the Minister cannot point me to where in the information before us the number of people on each of those schemes is set out, she might have her officials forward them to me.</p></speech>

Approximately 80% of carers in this country do not get any payment.  In other words, they do not qualify for carer's allowance for one reason or another.  Representations have been made by the association representing carers and others seeking flexibility in the rules governing carer's allowance.  For example, there is a specific proposal from Family Carers Ireland that the amount of time a person is allowed to spend working outside of the home be increased from 15 hours to, say, 18.5 hours.  What would be the likely cost of that proposal and how many people are in receipt of the carer's support grant who are not in receipt of the carer's allowance?  </p> <p>  I note a slight decrease in uptake of the disability activation supports.  A problem we hear about on a regular basis is access to the workforce for people with disabilities.  As the Minister will be aware, unemployment is very high among people with disabilities.  It is generally accepted that not only must these people be helped and supported into the workforce but they must be supported to adjust to the workforce.  The existing provision in this regard appears to be grossly inadequate.  In the figures before us today there is a decrease in provision rather than an increase.  </p> <p>  Rent supplement is down from &euro;176 million to &euro;132 million, which is related to the transfer to the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Can the Minister indicate the overall amount for HAP and rent supplement?</p></speech>

We have already received the report from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in respect of the 2017 figures for lone parents, which have increased significantly on what they were in 2017.  The income disregard for lone parents is welcome but according to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul report, we have an awful long way to go.</p> <p>  The youth employment rate for 2017 was 16.8%.  This year, it is expected to be 14.3%.  In 2016, the rate of long-term unemployment was 4.3%.  It is currently 2.1%.  There has been no real progress in this area.  </p> <p>  Page 176 refers to the number of Magdalen commission customers in payment.  The Department needs to be a little more sensitive in regard to Magdalen survivors.  They should perhaps be recorded as Magdalen survivors rather than Magdalen customers, which sounds very clinical.</p></speech>

We do not have customers but we also do not only serve citizens because there are many people who are not Irish citizens that we do not serve.  Perhaps we can collectively come up with an appropriate term.  I desperately try to call people recipients but in doing so I often feel as if I am speaking about robots.  For what it is worth, I agree with Deputy Collins.</p></speech>

I cannot understand why the data is two years behind.  I do not have any idea why that is the case.  The next time I expect to receive data is in December 2019.  Taking into account the report we received a couple of months ago that showed a devastating picture of the impact of policy changes and cuts on, in particular, lone parents, I am very hopeful that the initiatives taken last year and the year before will have had a positive impact.  I know that many of our lone parents are now working in much better jobs than would have been the case a number of years ago.  What I really want to see is data which identify where problems continue to exist so that we can home in and see exactly who has not benefitted from the changes we have made.  We can then collectively decided what next needs to be done.  It is not the case that we can just keep increasing a disregard if the disregard is not hitting certain women because they are not working.  While the increase in the qualified child increase, QCI, is welcome, we are not going to get increases of QCI by 20% every year.  We need to target increases at the people who are not benefitting from the changes we have made but I will not have that data until later this year.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that youth unemployment is not decreasing as quickly as the long-term unemployment and general unemployment rates are.  I am hopeful that the pilot programme that we launched a couple of months ago, the youth employment support scheme, YESS, will have an impact.  I originally asked for a particular amount of funding.  We have to go through the pilot project for six months before I can get increased funding.  We are approximately four months into the six months and so I would expect to have a good preliminary report on the success of YESS in the next couple of months.  I might then be here seeking agreement for more money.  We have to address this area.  The initiatives will have to be employer-led.  It is not a case of simply sending some of our young people to college or to an employment scheme.  The initiatives must be more tailored and in the employment environment.  I am hopeful the YESS project will work.  I will come back to the Deputy with an update.</p></speech>

The vast majority of our schemes are demand-led.  I do not know who would have said to the Deputy anecdotally that we have run out of money.  Funds for emergency needs payments and exceptional needs payments never run out.  It is easy for me to say that because it is not my money that we are spending.  These payments exist to help people at times when they cannot help themselves and have nobody else to go to.  We never say "No".  The policy is what it is.  It has changed slightly in recent years arising from conversations that we would have had in this committee but, we never run out of money and we do not refuse.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked why only &euro;2 million is provided for the self-employed.  It looks like a miserly amount of money but the legislation will not go to Cabinet until next week or the week after.  It will then have to be processed through the Houses.  All of that can take time.  Notwithstanding any difficulties, I expect that the legislation will be passed by the autumn and that we can go live in October or November.  When the amount provided is grossed up it amounts to &euro;35 million for next year.  I hope it does not look like that because we are not expecting people to be out of work.  It is only a support payment.</p> <p>  I will come back to the Deputy with the activation schemes data.  There is a long list of schemes, which we have here and the Deputy can have a look it following the meeting, if he wishes.  I can also have a hard copy of it sent to him.</p> <p>  On the carer's support grant, 116,860 people are in receipt of the grant.  There are 80,989 in receipt of carer's allowance and 2,740 people in receipt of carer's benefit.  A number of those in receipt of an incapacitated tax credit would not qualify for either carer's allowance or carer's benefit but are in receipt of the carer's support grant.  The incapacitated tax credits relate to children and older members of the family and the grant makes up the difference.</p><p>In terms of the supports that we provide for people with disabilities, members may be aware that the Department launched an ability programme last year.  We got money from the European Union which we then matched.  The aim of the programme is to tailor employment opportunities and in-employment supports for young adults with disabilities.  The scheme was over-subscribed threefold in terms of the number of organisations that wanted to run programmes.  Some of them started last year and I do not need to tell members that these are absolutely wonderful organisations, which are providing very valuable supports to people.  I was out in Airfield a couple of months ago with the WALK organisation.  There were some fabulous young people there who are ten foot tall with their jobs, support mechanisms and their mentors.  Members may be aware that all Departments and Government agencies are obliged to increase the percentage of people with disabilities in their employ from 3% to 4%.  When I visited Airfield I spoke to a man who has a son in his 20s.  He is far more intelligent than I would ever aspire to be but his father told me that he finds the application process for public jobs exceptionally difficult.  I discovered that the application process for all public jobs is exactly the same for people with disabilities, intellectual or physical, as for people with no disability.  That does not sit well with me.  He joked with me that day and said that he felt that some of the questions were trick questions so that he would answer the same question differently twice and we would be able to catch him out and then not give him the job.  Apparently, we do such profile testing but it is very disconcerting for people who might read into things more.  That is an issue that should be addressed by the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  We expect more people to join the ability programme.  It is a three-year programme and I would like to see it continue and expand.  </p><p> We also have the employability programme that works with people who may not have a disability but who have mental health issues.  We are talking about all ends of the scale, from those with mild mental health issues to those with very severe problems.  That programme operates in every single HSE centre in the country and is very successful.  We can never be exhaustive in terms of what we are doing in this area but we have introduced a couple of new interventions in recent years, particularly for people with extra challenges in their lives.</p><p> I do not have the figure to hand on HAP.  Sorry, I am wrong - I do have the figures.  There are three schemes, namely, RAS, HAP and rent supplement.  There are 18,900 people on RAS, 22,600 on rent supplement and 45,700 people on HAP, giving a total of 87,200 private rental tenancy supports.  This represents 26% of the private rental market.</p></speech>

It makes this process an awful lot clearer and easier to follow.  A lot of the questions I had intended to ask have been covered by my colleagues but I would like some additional information on a number of issues already raised.</p> <p>  On the 2012 changes to the pension and the recalculation process, the Minister said that 8,500 people have received payment.  She said that a further 24,000 have been contacted, leaving approximately 50,000 people still to be contacted.  It is also my understanding that 11,000 have yet to receive the initial correspondence from the Department.  This means that approximately 61,000 people have yet to be dealt with.</p></speech>

How long is that process expected to take, in terms of finalising the 24,000 and dealing with the others?  Is there a timeframe for dealing with all of that?  I ask the Minister to indicate the size of the average payment.  She said that 80% of the 8,500 have seen their payment increase.  What is the average uplift?</p> <p>  I agree with the comments of the Chairman with regard to the Christmas bonus including the fact that it is called a bonus.  There has been talk of changing the name because it is not an actual bonus.  People see it as a payment and perhaps it should be called the Christmas payment.  There should not be a question hanging over it every year in terms of whether it will be paid.  People need certainty.  I urge the Minister to consider that matter.</p> <p>  The Minister provided an update on the hot school meal pilot scheme, which is ongoing and said that she wants to expand it to include 36 schools.  She also said that she would like to see it rolled out to a much wider audience.  What does she mean by that?  The scheme is brilliant and I would love to see it extended to every school in the State.  Is that the type of audience to which the Minister refers or is she talking about DEIS schools only at this stage?  I ask her to elaborate a little more on that.  </p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea made reference to exceptional and urgent needs payments.  The figures show that in 2018, the Department spent more on such payments than was provided for in the Estimates.  However, the Estimate for this year is significantly lower than the 2018 provision.  I ask for an explanation for that.  We are constantly raising the fact that the discretion applied by community welfare officers varies widely from office to office.  There does not seem to be any oversight there.  Last year there were considerable difficulties with illness benefit payments and people were advised to go to their local community welfare office.  Some were given money while others were not.  The Department had sent a memorandum to all community welfare offices telling them that payments should be made but there were considerable discrepancies between offices, which is a matter of serious concern.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to the fact that level of unemployment among young jobseekers is not falling as fast as she would like.  The rate of unemployment among this cohort is currently 14.3%, which is absolutely scandalous.  The discriminatory policy of the Department, under which young jobseekers are given considerably less financial support than those aged 26 and over, has not worked.  This policy must be looked at again because it has a very negative impact on young jobseekers, including leading to homelessness.  When can we expect to see the report on young jobseekers?  I expect that report will back up what I am saying.  It was supposed to be published in 2017 but has not yet materialised.  The rate of unemployment among young jobseekers is 14.3% and that report is critical.  We need to know when it is going to be published and when we will be able to scrutinise it carefully and go through it in fine detail.</p><p>Can we get clarity on that?</p><p> I referred to illness benefit a moment ago.  This area was plagued by huge issues last year.  The Minister said that many things have been changed since and procedures put in place.  Hopefully the matter has been resolved.  I do not know if further issues have arisen.  Some issues came across my desk, and just after Christmas I had sent them to the Department and to the Minister and they have been dealt with quite speedily, to be fair.  The big issue was where some GPs used the new system while others did not.  The Minister said that she hoped that all GPs would be signed up to and using the new system by now.  What stage has this reached?</p></speech>

I do not want to tell the Deputy that the reviews will be completed by the summer because if we do not get the information from people we will have to keep asking until they provide us with it.  I do not want to say that the reviews will close on 1 July.  People get envelopes and they put them in drawers and sometimes they forget.  They may have good intentions to respond but it does not happen.  I would like to say that it will be openended until everyone has their review and they are satisfied with it.  I do not want to close it off.  I think what the Deputy is asking is how quickly the ones in question should be getting their payment.</p></speech>

It is a question of going through the remaining 50,000 to weed out the ones that might need a little more work and the ones that should be straightforward.</p></speech>

Everybody must have a review.  It must go through a human's hands.  Even if I know that someone had a baby in 1972 and another in 1989 and I can see that information, I must still physically go through that person's review and sign off on it to say, for instance, "Johnny, you are going from an 80% pension to a 100% pension" and give the backdated payments along with the relevant correspondence.  None of this is automated which is why we took on 120 staff.  On some of it we would have hoped that we could do most of the interaction between people and the Department online.  That would have reduced the time it took because information could have been submitted much more quickly than through the post.  That does not suit some people of pensionable age.  On that basis we have had forms which have been dispatched and it takes a few weeks for them to be returned.  There are 120 people working in the office in Sligo.  They work all day, every day.  They are doing the reviews as efficiently as they can.  Some 24,000 requests for information were dispatched in recent weeks and over half of these await a response.  I assume they will come in but if they do not we will have to send the individuals more requests for information.  The only people who will be automated are the ones that we know will not be liable to a change.  Unfortunately there are some gentlemen who we know did not look after their babies because we can see they were out of the country, for instance.  Again, that review must take place and we must say to the individuals that we can see gaps in their history.  These individuals can be invited to fill in those gaps but the likelihood is that we already know what the gaps are.</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;55 million is allocated to the budget this year.  I cannot give exact details of that.  Some ten people went from 85% to 95%.  </p></speech>

Say we reviewed Deputy O'Dea last week and he was moved from an 85% pension to 100%.  The following week's payment will not only reflect the uplift but will also include the backdated payment to 30 March last year.</p> <p>  I hope it will put a smile on the Deputy's face to say that it is a rare occasion when we are both on the same page when I say to a much larger audience - and I am sure that if the Minister for Finance was listening to me, he would have a heart attack - I do not treat children differently.  I do not think that we should segregate children because they go to a DEIS school or a different school.  We do not do that under our current provisions, for instance the cold school meals programme, the breakfast clubs or after-school clubs.  There are many schools which do not have DEIS status which are involved in our programmes which is why the pilot scheme - which is only small, with 36 schools and some 7,200 kids - will not be confined to DEIS schools.  My aim, which may be unusual coming from our Department, is to get a better educational outturn.  Children who eat good nutritional food get better advantages from the educational offering they receive from the State.  We should sample it in small schools, in rural schools, in huge urban schools and in Gaelscoileanna and hopefully that is what the pilot will do, so that a wide variety of schools by type and size are examined to reflect whether it works much better in a school which, for example, has a catering company up the road, or in a small school on the Aran Islands.  That pilot will go live in a couple of months and we will get those figures relatively quickly.  I do not intend to wait for years to ensure that the pilot is working, we will know relatively quickly what our aim and ambition will bear out.  </p> <p>  The exceptional needs payments were reduced in the budget this year insofar as all the types of payments that would normally be associated with an exceptional needs claim are also reducing.  I know I will be here later on in the year looking for a supplementary budget to give me more money, although I hope that we do not have to do that, but if that is the case, then that is the case.  It is all demand led.  </p> <p>  On youth unemployment, this is not an excuse but we need to do something specific over and above training and education for our young people.  Some of the young people who are long-term unemployed have other challenges over and above not having the correct skillset.  The Youth Employment Support Scheme, YESS, programme is something that will be genuinely beneficial.  We only have a small number of people on it at the moment, but I hope to increase that number significantly at the end of the pilot project, which is six months.  I say that because when I look at the norms across Europe, our unemployment and long-term unemployment figures are coming down at a much faster rate than the same figures in other countries, but youth unemployment across Europe is stubbornly static.  Other European countries do not have the same economic difficulties which we experienced in recent years, yet they still have the same stubbornly high youth unemployment figures.  To me, it does not correlate.  Younger people today have different challenges in life than we might have had growing up and we need to genuinely address these to put in support mechanisms around them which I hope YESS programme will do, however I cannot say until the pilot is complete.  However, the Deputy and I will differ that bringing the payment back to the same figure as for those aged of 25 years will not fix the problem.  The problem will be fixed by finding sustainable jobs for these young people.</p></speech>

The same circular on training, policies and management protocols exists in every single office that we have around the country.  I was in the Clondalkin office some weeks ago.  A young woman works there who has been in my Department for some time but originally came from the old HSE community welfare system.  She was telling me how much more flexibility she had in the old days.  As she put it, there is a policy framework now that officers must stick within, which is actually music to my ears, but what the Deputy is telling me is that some people have more discretion than others, and they should not have.  There is a policy and a specific set of guidelines.  The money is there if it is needed.  Somebody in Clondalkin should not have a different view from somebody in Ratoath or Finglas.  There should be a similarity of operation.  All I can do is to keep doing the continuous training programmes that we do and remind people of what the policy is through circulars.</p><p>Again, if the Deputy knows of an example of somebody he thinks should be getting something but is not, he can let me know and I can snoop behind the scenes to check.</p><p> Regarding the jobs report, we have been waiting an awfully long time for it.  We committed to doing the review of the report on the impact of the reduced rates but we can only do that when we get the report from Maynooth, and we have not received it yet.</p></speech>

It is not the completed report but the interim report finds that it incentivised people to educate and train themselves further, although the Deputy does not subscribe to that.  However, I will send a note to see if we can get the final report because we all want the same thing, which is fewer young people unemployed and more people working and training.</p> <p>  Regarding illness benefits, I will probably goose this as soon as I say it but thankfully everything has settled down, notwithstanding that there are people every week who do not get a payment.  That is no different today from what would have occurred under the old system.  There are reasons for people not getting the payments, such as a box is ticked incorrectly, a general practitioner filled in a wrong box or somebody in the Department might tick the wrong box on a screen, but they are few and far between.  We still get in excess of 50,000 applications every week and there are 50,000 payments every week.  There is no problem with our call waiting numbers.  Thankfully, calm and peace have been restored to the office.  Our staff went through a very stressful time through no fault of their own, and I am grateful for their forbearance.  Things are back to normal and we are going into a period when fewer people tend to be ill than would be the case in the period from which we have just emerged, so peace reigns at present.</p></speech>

It gave them a significant increase on the old illness certificate payments.  It was probably long overdue insofar as they had not received a different payment for many years.  Everybody is using the new forms and we are all happy.  In fact, we are in negotiations to move to a newer type of certification system in the future.  Good, peaceful and harmonious relations are ongoing.</p></speech>

Much of it is legitimate concern.  The Minister has the opportunity now to allay some of the concern.  I will not delve into the Indecon report because that is a separate piece of work the committee intends to undertake.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could allay the concern and say that the LES, as is, will remain.</p></speech>

I met the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, just before Christmas.  I attended its annual conference and spoke to the members.  When anybody issues a report on a person's work and it is not exactly to his or her liking, he or she will be afraid.  However, I assured the network then, and I did so previously in this committee, that the people in our partnership organisations, the ILDN, and the people who run our jobs clubs, the local employment services and the CV clubs all provide valuable services to unemployed people in this country.  That might change in the new iteration of activation and supports we need, which we are examining and assessing.  Challenges today are different from what they were.  The ILDN and its staff are placed to address those challenges because they have access to other funds that do not come from our Department, such as social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, funding, which allows them to provide extended services for people who might have anxiety or social discourse issues.  There are a new range of issues, challenges and barriers facing people today in terms of having and not having a job.  The services the State provides must reflect and support those challenges.  The organisations in the report by Indecon are one leg of a three-legged stool, and we would not be able to provide the services, and this was the case historically and will be in the future, without their help, support, guidance, intelligence and empathy.  They are a vital part of our service and they are not going anywhere.</p></speech>

I have come across a number of emergency cases where an elderly person ends up in hospital, often as a result of a fall or a stroke, and the person will not be able to go home without a carer.  When somebody who is working applies for carer's benefit, it takes an age to have it processed.  The person applies to take time off work but is afraid to take that time off because he or she does not know if he or she will get a payment.  It seems to take forever.  As it is not means tested but is contribution-based, I do not understand why this cannot be done in a week or two in a case where there is a medical report and somebody is in a hospital.</p></speech>

There is no difference.  The Department does not have to figure our income, rent and so forth which is part of the carer's allowance payment, but a great chunk of the delay is the interaction between our medical assessors and the documentation provided by applicants and their doctors with regard to whether the person fulfils the medical assessment part of the application.  Carer's benefit is no different from carer's allowance in that regard.</p></speech>

It is mainly cases of elderly people having falls or strokes who cannot subsequently be discharged from a hospital or discharged to a nursing home.  I have come across a number of such cases in the past year and I was surprised.</p></speech>

In my experience it is taking the same length of time to process a carer's benefit application as to process a carer's allowance application.  That makes no sense because there is a means test for the carer's allowance, which is a time-consuming process.</p></speech>

Our improved figure for carer's allowance has reduced from 19 weeks to 17 weeks.  I hope that with the additional staff we have deployed in the last couple of weeks we will continue to see that number fall.  It takes 12 weeks for carer's benefit.</p></speech>

It is not easier for somebody to get carer's benefit from a medical assessment perspective than it is to get carer's allowance.  I would be loath to have a situation where people with contributions get dealt with more quickly than others.  It is not something we should ever have.  We should improve both waiting times.</p></speech>

The 2018 estimate for JobPath was &euro;48 million and the outturn was &euro;71 million.  In her opening statement, the Minister indicated a significant drop in the live register yet the Estimate for 2019 is &euro;57 million.  While it is less than the outturn, it is still significantly more than the Estimate this time last year.  Does the Minister want to explain why?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.1191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2019032700002#H00700"><p>I can only explain to the Chairman that we probably did not anticipate that JobPath would be as accessible as it was.</p></speech>

The live register, as the Minister stated, is down 75,000 over two years.  My question was in that context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.1193" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2019032700002#H00900"><p>First of all, the purpose of JobPath is not only to get somebody a job.  It is to make sure that he or she keeps it and that we support him or her.  It is a holistic service.  It is not only about getting somebody his or her CV, sitting the person in front of an employer and making sure he or she gets the job.  It is making sure the person maintains sustainability within employment.  That will last much longer than the day after the person gets the job.  There are the payments thereafter to hopefully keep participants in their jobs so that they can then go off and not need our support afterwards.  We never anticipated JobPath to be as successful as it was.  It exceeded our expectations last year.</p> <p>  We still have 198,000 people on the unemployment register.  It is my job, and our collective job, to make sure that those people find jobs in an environment where there are more jobs than there are people at present, and every support that people need to be able to get the jobs that are readily available today.  We have a jobs fair in Dublin Castle tomorrow that I will go to where there will be far more employers with work than there will be people to fill that work.  We need to continue to make sure, with whatever support is available to people who cannot currently get work, that we help them to get work.</p></speech>

We are at a stage where the Minister rightly states there are jobs out there and it is more than merely equipping individuals.  I accept that Deputy Regina Doherty is only the Minister for one Department and many of our solutions must be cross-departmental to be effective.  There have been intergenerational unemployment and geographic unemployment black spots.  More than merely supporting the individuals, a range of programmes across Government needs to be devised to lift those communities where there is long-term and intergenerational unemployment.  What the Government is doing with the school meals is only one element.  Recent reports show the outcomes of children attending a DEIS school still are some way behind those in non-DEIS schools.  We have quite a considerable way to go to positively discriminate for those communities that are experiencing long-term intergenerational unemployment.  While Deputy Regina Doherty has a role to play in it - I am not having a go at the Minister - it requires other Departments to work with her.  Maybe we missed it previously.  As an economy where there is almost at full employment, there is an opportunity to drive that and, for once and for all, as the opportunity is there, make the opportunity a reality for people to work and they break that cycle.</p></speech>

I accept that was only about policing, but some of it is connected with the issues that we all experience and see in our towns and villages.  Ms O'Toole cited examples of what she did in Seattle, Boston and New York that worked.  They put together interdepartmental task forces.  Instead of going into an area where there was deprivation, a drugs issue or lack of educational opportunities, they went into an area and took 1,000 people.  There were five or six different departments sitting around the table and they specifically looked at those 1,000 people and asked what could they do for the mothers and what could they do for the husbands.  They asked if they needed work and training.  For example, they saw that there were two young fellows in a family who had problems with alcohol.  They looked holistically at a community, decided what needed to be done to help that community, and all got together and collectively did their little bit, specifically, targeted for one set of people.  Ms O'Toole cited the example of a particular area in New York where there was particularly high crime.  The angle that they were coming from was crime.  When they looked after this group of people for six months, the crime rates reduced by over 1,000% because all of the people were getting the supports and the service that they required to have a better quality of life.  Ms O'Toole's other recommendation was that it should not be led by the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  When we launch the new national action plan for social inclusion in May to which all committee members will be invited, I would like for us - mine is only one Department, it depends on co-operation and I would be grateful for anything the Chairman can do to help - to get a number of Departments to pick a number of areas and use task forces so that we can see if the approach works here.  If it does, I would like us to have a national programme of holistically looking at issues that range from something as small as our younger people maybe growing up not knowing how to cook for themselves and teaching people skills, to providing education, helping people with addictions, talking to people with social anxiety, helping mothers who have not worked for years to have the confidence to do it, and all the factors that might be affecting particular issues, specifically, as the Chairman stated, the intergenerational issues.  Last year we started the programme to look at jobless households.  We are only doing it on a voluntary basis because we cannot do it in any other way but, because people do not know any different, they are not volunteering to come in and work with us.  We need to look at it in a different way.</p></speech>

Before we begin, I remind all members to turn off their mobile phones completely, please, as they may interfere with the recording equipment.  The minutes of the meeting of 27 February 2019 have been circulated.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I now turn to correspondence.  The first item of correspondence is a letter which we issued as a committee through our clerk to Rea Walsh, corporate affairs and licensing director of the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, concerning the scheduled meeting with the joint committee on Wednesday, 10 April 2019.  We were seeking clarification on certain matters and further information on other matters.  The response which we got back was to have the meeting brought forward to 3 April.  The committee has agreed to schedule a meeting on that date with Sport Ireland because Sport Ireland is the body responsible for governance, oversight and scrutiny of sporting bodies.  The committee has agreed that our scheduled meeting with the FAI will proceed on 10 April, as planned.  The committee, through our clerk, on 22 March requested three issues from the FAI.  We sought confirmation as a matter of urgency on the date in early April when they FAI governance review would be completed and confirmation that the outcomes of that review would be brought to the attention of this joint committee well in advance of our meeting scheduled for 10 April.</p> <p>  It was also noted from public statements that the FAI is willing to meet the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and Sport Ireland to give more detail on a bridging loan from the chief executive to the association in 2017.  We requested that full and comprehensive detail of this matter would be forwarded to the joint committee well in advance of the meeting which is scheduled for 10 April.  We have not received any reply to that correspondence.  We will now ask that the FAI would supply the information urgently and at the earliest possible opportunity to the committee, and well in advance of our proposed meeting on 10 April.  That is the decision of the committee.</p> <p>  I will now turn to other correspondence.  The next is No. 2019/419.  It is noted in this correspondence that Mr. Ford said CI&Eacute; is not covered by freedom of information, FOI.  This is a letter from a member of the public.  It is proposed that he would contact the Information Commissioner as regards the body in question.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

We should do that anyway, regardless of the FOI issue.  Correspondence No. 2019/420 is an e-mail from the Minister, Deputy Ross, in reply to an e-mail from the clerk.  It is proposed to note this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  It is proposed to note correspondence No. 2019/421?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Correspondence No. 2019/422 is an email from Councillor Michael O&rsquo;Brien who states that without prior consultation or notification to local commuters, Irish Rail decide to withdraw all staff from Clongriffin station on 16 February.  We will forward that to Irish Rail for its comments on it.</p></speech>

I understand that the committee wishes to focus on the current situation pertaining to BusConnects and MetroLink.  To assist me in dealing with members&rsquo; subsequent questions, I am joined by Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO of the authority.</p><p>MetroLink, BusConnects and DART expansion are three major transport infrastructure projects included in Project Ireland 2040.  Together, they will enable the development of reliable, sustainable, affordable and integrated public transport that will support the economy, help Ireland to meet its climate change targets and make Dublin a better place in which to live, work and shop and to visit.</p><p> The public consultation process on the emerging preferred route was held between March and May in 2018.  Both TII and the NTA have reflected on the views expressed and responded in the design of the preferred route which was published yesterday.  We believe the preferred route proposed addresses many of the concerns expressed and will deliver a better project.  Among the most significant changes is the proposal that the construction of MetroLink in the St. Mobhi Road area will no longer require the acquisition of the playing fields of the Na Fianna GAA Club.  In consultation with Home Farm Football Club, we now propose to construct a more compact station under its pitch.  The pitch will be unavailable during the estimated three-year construction process but will be fully restored afterwards.</p><p>There will be an improvement for domestic and international travel connections provided by access to and from Dublin Airport and through the national rail and road network.  There will be decreased road traffic congestion on journeys to and from the airport and crossing the city from north to south.  MetroLink will include a park and ride for more than 3,000 vehicles at Estuary Swords.  There will be faster journey times with high frequency and high reliability by MetroLink between Swords, the airport and the city centre.  There will be more integrated and improved quality of interchanges with Luas, DART, rail and bus transport hubs across the city, with more direct journey opportunities.</p><p> MetroLink can enhance social inclusion by providing new links from urban areas of Dublin to jobs and services in the city and across the suburbs.  The project will support both the regeneration of existing areas and the development of new areas.  It will generate employment during construction and operation and will support economic growth once operational.  The metro system will support the environment by promoting a modal shift from car to public transport.  That will help reduce emissions and energy consumption in addition to improving air quality and reducing road congestion.</p></speech>

I was pleased to be at the launch of the revised MetroLink proposals yesterday.  Speaking on my behalf and of the other Deputies in my constituency, we all share a sense of satisfaction with the revision of the plans.  I view it as public consultation at its best.  The NTA took the views of the community on board, listened to those views, considered them and provided a revised document.  From my perspective, that revised document is very welcome.  I thank the witnesses from the NTA very much for their work on it to date.</p> <p>  There is reference in the publication in terms of site No. 31 to the fact that the Northwood station will share with residential and business facilities.  I understand that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the NTA and Dublin City Council are in discussion with the local club, Ballymun Kickhams, with regard to this site.  Will the witnesses elaborate a little more about those deliberations?</p> <p>  In terms of the ventilation shaft in Albert College Park, what sort of disruption is envisaged there?  The documentation is not entirely clear about the timescale and scope.  I assume it is slightly less disruptive than the construction of a station.  I would like a bit more detail on that, in particular whether any clubs or playing facilities will be affected.</p> <p>  The biggest change in the revised proposal is that the southside element of it has been dropped.  Would both witnesses say they are disappointed to lose that aspect of it?  Do they agree that, unfortunately, it was a necessity given the lack of viable alternatives on the table?</p> <p>  The previous position was set out by Mr. Creegan to the committee, which is that when design works conclude on the MetroLink project, the design team would be assigned to the Finglas Luas project.  Is that still the case?</p> <p>  Is it strictly necessary to have a bus corridor on St. Mobhi Road given the revised MetroLink plans announced yesterday?  Quite a lot of change and disruption will take place along that stretch of road.  Is it strictly necessary to restrict vehicular traffic in one direction to facilitate a bus corridor, given that it will have, in effect, the best transport link in the country running underneath the road?</p> <p>  Corridors 1, 4 and 6 appear to have a lower impact, given that there is no one way required or relatively little by way of garden acquisition.  Is there a case for proceeding with those first or does the NTA have a sequential order in mind with regard to rolling out the corridors?</p> <p>  How is the redesign going with regard to the routes?  When will the NTA reveal the second iteration of the draft with regard to the routes?  Do the witnesses agree that it was unhelpful to assert that changing 10% of the routes would undo the project?  Do they agree that branding both the core bus corridor aspect of BusConnects and the route redesign aspect of BusConnects proved to be somewhat confusing given they are both under the brand umbrella of BusConnects?  For regular members of the public the constant sequential cascade of consultations, dates and deadlines is proving confusing.</p><p>That is the case for some elected representatives, let alone members of the public.</p></speech>

I will follow the same sequence as Deputy Rock and start with MetroLink, another version of which was announced yesterday.  We have seen many versions of it.  If one adds the timelines set out in the opening statement, it would take in or around ten years to deliver the project.  It is a long way down the road before it becomes operational and that has an impact on the questions I will pose in relation to BusConnects.  The MetroLink proposal, as published yesterday, has shrunk by about 7 km, so instead of the original 26 km, it is 19 km.  Previously, the indicative cost of the longer MetroLink was &euro;3 billion.  What are the costings for the revised plan the NTA presented yesterday?  What is the basis on which passenger traffic was calculated?  What number of passengers was the original 26 km version of the MetroLink expected to carry and what number is expected to be carried on the shorter one?  I am not opposed to MetroLink but it is a substantial change.  The overall metro has been reduced by approximately 30%.  The project that is currently proposed is now different.  Was that accompanied by a cost-benefit analysis?</p> <p>  To be parochial, Ms Graham referred to discussion of metro north and metro south more than two decades ago.  There was also a metro west.</p></speech>

Metro west was also part of the jigsaw because it was to link to metro north.  The western part of Dublin is where the population growth is.  We have two strategic development zones, SDZs, under physical construction as we speak, brand new towns with approximately 10,000 new housing units.  The witnesses are sick and tired of hearing me say that the section of the M50 between the N4 and N7 is probably the busiest section of road anywhere in the country.  Metro west was to have been an orbital route.  At the time, local authorities were making reserves of some lands.  While it is not included in the 2016 to 2035 plan, that does not mean that the original concept is not as valid today.  In light of the fact that the MetroLink is being shortened by 7 km, should the NTA not consider an extension to the western part of the city, especially linking the orbital route connecting Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown?  The area accommodates two hospitals, two third level colleges and two major shopping centres.  There is major activity on that orbital route.  I would welcome a comment in that regard.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that the next stage of the public consultation on the BusConnects network will not take place until after the summer.  Thanks be to God for that, because people do want to engage with it and the summer time is not appropriate.  It might delay it a month or two but it is better that we have full and meaningful engagement.  The whole idea of the network change was to shorten journey time and to provide more efficiencies.  As I stated to the NTA witnesses previously, the problem I have is that the network changes are going to happen before the corridor changes are put in place.  I am concerned that the journey times and efficiencies the NTA hopes to achieve will not be achieved.</p> <p>  I have looked at the corridors and one of them stands out as not having very many houses affected, possibly no more than 15 houses, which is the Lucan corridor, mainly along an existing motorway.  Should consideration be given to trying to fast-track that to demonstrate that the corridor and network solutions being proposed are effective and that they would be additionally accommodated with park-and-ride facilities?  I have real concerns that the NTA will change the network in advance of the corridors and that it will not achieve the travel time.  As Ms Graham correctly pointed out in her opening statement, the increased population and traffic in and out of the city continues to grow but the proposed solutions are significantly down the road.  Until corridors and efficiencies are put in place, is there a programme to increase substantially the fleet of buses operating in the Dublin area in parallel with the BusConnects project?</p></speech>

From the initial publication of the plan, there have been 30,000 submissions.  The public engagement and the opportunity for people to raise their concerns in such volumes are very welcome.  However, sometimes would it not be better to engage with the public and the communities first on what they feel they need regarding work, travel and everything involved in their community, including hospitals and so on, before putting forward any plan to them?  Given the volume of submissions that were made, engaging with the public on their needs before drawing up a plan might be something to look at in the future.  If one listens to people living in Dublin and its outskirts, the frequency of services and the need for increased bus numbers are the daily priorities.  Route changes appear to be way down their list.  One hears people say they stand at the bus stop every morning and three buses pass them before they can actually get onto a bus.  How will BusConnects solve this issue?</p> <p>  People have also been wondering why the NTA wrote to property owners whose properties or gardens will be directly affected while there appears to have been no contact with other property owners living in areas where, say, trees are to be completely cut down, alterations to footpaths made and so on.  Has the NTA any plans in this regard?</p> <p>  Regarding MetroLink, another Deputy raised the issue of the metro west.  The NTA&rsquo;s report here talks about assisting people who face losing their homes.  Could Ms Graham provide more details on the plans the NTA has to assist these people?  The authority says owner-occupiers and tenants are to be given a year&rsquo;s compensation.  In Ms Graham&rsquo;s statement she said "up to one year".  Is it a year or not?  Given the spiralling costs of rents, how will the rate and the compensation for property owners be calculated?  Does Ms Graham have an idea of the overall cost of this part of the project?</p></speech>

Some of the changes to MetroLink have shown that the organisation has listened to some of the concerns, and it is very welcome that there has been a response to those concerns.  I refer in particular to the solutions for the north side of the city.  However, in looking at what the transport needs are, the census of population for the past three or four censuses, perhaps, would be a pretty useful way of predicting what will happen into the future.  The city centre and D&uacute;n Laoghaire, for example, both grew by 13% over those 20 years, South Dublin by 22%, Fingal by well over 40%, Meath and Kildare by over 40% each and Wicklow by just under 30%.  We can therefore see where the population shifts are happening.  One would only have to take a flight over Dublin to see where the space is and where it will continue to grow, irrespective of the amount of land zoned.  As well as looking at what is in a plan, what is not in it is a key component.   In the west side of the city, we must look at where the traffic is generated, which is not just in the neighbouring counties, but also in counties adjacent to them in turn.  That is really where the commutes are happening and where this needs to impact.</p><p>Ms Graham might address how this will be dealt with from the point of view of rail.  At the moment there are capacity constraints in respect of heavy rail.  Ms Graham will be well aware of those constraints and the length of time it takes to get new rolling stock, so she might address that issue.  I will not even go into the issue of DART underground.  I will give this meeting a skip on that because it is totally the missing piece in all this.<br/><br/>Ms Graham said in her opening statement:</p><blockquote>The plan we published yesterday is to develop the section from Swords to Charlemont with an interchange from Metro to Luas at Charlemont.  The required tunnel boring works to allow the future connection to the existing Luas line will be completed as part of this current phase.</blockquote><p>This means that it is a predetermined route once the bore is completed.  Is there the prospect of any flexibility on this route if this plan is to be proceeded with?<br/><br/>What kind of timeline would be involved with the people in College Gate and the Markievicz sports centre who have to move?  I refer to being able to put alternatives in place.  How does the NTA go about that?<br/><br/>Predicting where lines will go is one thing.  What kind of advance purchase is required for the trams?  Regarding the capacity constraints that exist at the moment, is there any issue as to which comes first?  I assume the plan is not likely to push out the purchase of much-needed heavy rail, for example, to make sure that the orders go in for the new metro trains.<br/><br/>There is public consultation on this phase of BusConnects.  When will the next phases be?  I refer to the outer BusConnects routes that were parked.  When are we likely to see that coming back and to see consultation on it?</p></speech>

It is a bit mystifying that when transport is planned, the areas that have grown in population, as has been outlined, are left completely bereft.  I am delighted, by the way, about the MetroLink to Swords because Swords is a hugely growing area as well.  I feel, however, that this is being done more to make it easier for people to get to and from the airport rather than for the people who live in Fingal.  That is fine and that is important, but if we want to take cars off the road daily, we have to plan transport for the suburbs.</p> <p>  The southside element has been dropped, but perhaps the NTA will consider thinking of west Dublin.  There was a plan for metro west when I was on Fingal County Council.  I will mention this briefly.  The councillors agreed to rezone Kellystown, Barnhill and huge tracts of land for development on the basis of metro west.  Hansfield strategic development zone, SDZ, has been mentioned.  It has been thrown up apace.  We absolutely want housing, but there is no point in planning to build in the outer parts of Dublin - we are talking about areas that are basically on the border with Meath - without providing transport.  I was talking to Mr. Creegan at the BusConnects meeting in Blanchardstown and I made this point, that we need a Luas to Blanchardstown.  This is not rocket science.  If one lives more than eight miles out from the city, one cannot be purely reliant on buses.  Light rail is needed to get people to and from places very quickly.</p><p>Mr. Creegan has argued that we have a rail line, but it does not go to where the population has increased.  People living in Mulhuddart, Tyrellstown and parts of Ongar cannot gain access to the rail line.  In any case, the rail service is not frequent enough.  I accept that the rail line will be electrified at some point, which I welcome, but the service will still not cater for the existing need.  We designed a proposal to extend the Luas to Dublin 15 from Broombridge.  It is a low-density route and would be relatively cheap to do.  One would travel from Broombridge to Connolly Hospital, IT Blanchardstown and the Blanchardstown Centre.  Based on other light rail designs, the cost of such a phase 1 development would be approximately &euro;45 million a kilometre or &euro;315 million.</p><p> An additional factor in increasing traffic levels in Blanchardstown which is a problem if one lives there is the fact that there are large industrial parks.  We all welcome the fact that there are more jobs and multinational companies setting up, but the 20,000 to 30,000 people working in Ballycoolin and other industrial parks have no other way to get there other than by driving.  There is complete gridlock following the recovery in the economy.  It does not seem that there is any onus on the companies setting up to make an additional contribution.  For example, could there be a rates increase for the major companies based there to pay for a light rail system?  If a rail system was extended from the shopping centre to Ballycoolin, for example, it would provide significant relief for thousands of people.  One could then look at a third phase to Littlepace and Ongar.  It might sound like a lot of money, but a significant amount is paid in rates and taxes in the area.  That is what we need if we want to get people out of their cars to mitigate the effects of climate change.  Reference is made in the submission to the fact that 67% of public transport journeys are made by bus.  We need more light rail services to increase capacity.</p><p> We have spoken a lot about BusConnects.  One of the major problems with it is that it is cutting some local bus services and making some people make two journeys rather than one.  I do not have a problem with the town centre being turned into a hub for a rail link because a lot of people would get off a little bus onto a light rail service to travel directly into town, but the problem with BusConnects is that people would get off one bus and then fight to get on another one because it is not clear whether there would be sufficient capacity to take up the slack.</p><p> I urge the NTA to strongly consider this serious proposal.  We need a Luas system for the 110,000 people who live in the greater Blanchardstown area.  The same applies to other areas in west Dublin that were developed in the past 20 years.  It is very sad for people to see what is proposed for Ranelagh just outside the city centre.  Why would one need a metro to Ranelagh?  There is no urgent need for it in the way there is for people who are living eight or ten miles out of the city where tens of thousands of people live.  This is necessary and we must campaign for it and make it a big issue.</p></speech>

I commend the delegates on their professionalism, dedication, commitment to meeting the big challenge we all face as a society.  The interaction with the public is impressive.  The NTA is always listening and ready to engage.  Significant changes have been made and resulted from a consultation process.  Democracy is well served by interaction between communities and State bodies.  The NTA conducts its business in a very professional manner.</p> <p>  I live in Drogheda.  A park and ride facility has been proposed on the Malahide Estuary and is ultimately intended to cater for 2,000 vehicles a day.  That would take a significant number of vehicles off the streets of Dublin.  What is the status of the plan?</p> <p>  Yesterday I spoke to Deputy Farrell who hopes to make it to the meeting.  We discussed connectivity between the metro and the Northern rail line links.  As I understand it, one has to travel to Tara Street before one can reconnect to the rail network.  Deputy Farrell thought there might be an opportunity to have another connection point on the Northern line.  Has the NTA considered that possibility?  Millions of people come through Dublin Airport every year and many of them could continue their journey on the DART or the rail line to Belfast.  I would welcome a response from the delegates, as best they can, but they should make sure they respond to everybody.</p></speech>

I might then pick up on some of the other issues raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-27a.1240" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Creegan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019032700002#L00400"><p>I will start with Deputy Rock who raised a number of queries.  TII has had a number of discussions with Dublin City Council about Northwood Station and Ballymun Kickhams.  We are pretty certain we have a solution that will prove satisfactory to Ballymun Kickhams.  I do not know how directly it has been involved in the discussions, but we are pretty confident its concerns will be adequately addressed and do not envisage a problem in that regard.</p> <p>  The intervention shaft in Albert College Park is a considerable construction but much smaller than a station.  I cannot say whether we will interfere with any pitch on a temporary basis.  If we do, I am pretty confident we can sort the matter out with Dublin City Council to find a temporary replacement for a short period.  It is much smaller than a full station.</p> <p>  On whether we are disappointed to lose the southern section of the green line, we have taken the right approach.  The green line will need to be upgraded in the future.  That matter came up in a later question from another member.  We are not upgrading the green line just to Ranelagh.  It is to extemd to places south of Ranelagh.  Cherrywood is a town.  Sandyford is growing and there is an extension to Bray.  The line will have to be upgraded to metro standard to cater for future transport demand, but it does not need to be done now and we can definitely eke more out of the green line in the meantime.  We think it is the appropriate solution at this stage as it will allow us to proceed with the project.</p> <p>  Between the NTA and TII, we have limited resources.  Therefore, as soon as we are able to free some of the resources in working on the other projects to which we have committed, we will assign the design team to the Finglas Luas project and start the design work.  That is part of the strategy.  It will take some time to do it, but work will start later this year.</p> <p>  On whether it is necessary for St. Mobhi Road to be used as a bus corridor, given MetroLink, it is still a busy bus corridor.  MetroLink serves a lot of key destinations, but as members know from looking at the maps, there is a quite a distance between stations and there are many side roads and other locations that need to be served.  The bus system will still be really important in the area.  For that reason, we believe we need to proceed with the BusConnects project.</p></speech>

I am not saying there should not be a bus service along the road, but given the resource that will run beneath it, does Mr. Creegan still believe it is necessary?  I presume his answer is yes.</p></speech>

We could do a longer one, but the short answer is yes.</p> <p>  We genuinely have not worked out a sequence to construct the various bus corridors.  I accept Deputy Curran's point that the Lucan bus corridor has a lower number of properties and would be much simpler in many respects.  When we come to work through a sequence, that will be a significant consideration.  What we do know, as we have said here before, is that we cannot do all of the bus corridors at the one time.  They do have to be sequenced and we need to get a little further on in the design process before working out the sequence.</p> <p>  On how the network redesign is progressing, we are still going through the 30,000 submissions received.  In parallel, we are working to pick up on the issues from the submissions and looking at what the intervention might be.  We will have it done in a number of months.</p><p>As we stated earlier, we will kick off a second round of consultation at the start of September.</p><p> While we understand that it causes confusion when we speak about BusConnects and when we speak about bus lanes one day and bus services the other day, it will be confusing no matter what we call it.  If we call it something completely different, there will still be a level of confusion.  We have tried to simplify our language by referring to bus services and bus lanes when we speak to people, but we accept that there is so much going on that it will inevitably cause confusion.</p><p> MetroLink is the scheme that will extend from Swords to south of Charlemont, although the overall metro scheme will eventually reach Sandyford, as per the original intention.  On the costing of the plan, as we stated yesterday at the launch and in our brochure, to obtain an accurate and fully developed cost estimate one needs to have settled on the design and have the design further developed.  We are still in the process of consultation and the level of change can be seen from the first phase to now.  It is our intention that when the design is moved on further, we will start preparing a business case, and later this year we will develop a robust cost estimate.  We have brought on board an international person, Professor Bent Flyvbjerg, who is involved in mega-projects around the world and deals with cost and estimation issues.  He was brought in six months ago to provide assistance and advice on how to put the project together.  Later this year, we will have developed our position much further and will prepare a full business case, which will be made publicly available.</p></speech>

Will there be value for money versus the full scheme?  It has cut 7 km but what is the cost benefit, how many potential passengers have been affected and so forth?  It is not transparent or obvious.</p></speech>

We have done enough work to be satisfied that there will be a high level of passenger flow, with people interchanging at Charlemont.  The same journey will be possible but people will just have to make a change at Charlemont station where they will alight from the Luas and board the metro.  When we move on with the design work, we will finish the analysis but we are fully confident it will provide value for money.  The metro is being sized for the same size and, therefore, it will handle up to 20,000 passengers per hour in one direction and we remain confident about all the work we have done.  The project will provide value for money but we are conscious we will need to provide a robust cost estimate in the future.</p> <p>  On metro west, the question of how we are serving the west of the city has been raised several times.  We have a transport strategy in place which sets the framework for the overall development of transport throughout Dublin.  Much work went into preparing that, there is ministerial approval behind it, and it is a statutory plan.  Within that plan, the west of the city has not been ignored and two important lines are proposed to be built in the first ten years, with a third to follow.  The first is the DART to Maynooth, as the national development plan, NDP, provides for DART services as far as Maynooth on the Maynooth train line, while the second is the DART on the Kildare train line as far as Celbridge at least.  We are proceeding to progress that project, and in the next month, we hope to kick off a tender process to acquire a fleet to put in place those DART services in the coming years.  The NDP provides for those two DART lines to be developed before 2027.</p> <p>  The NDP and our transport strategy also provide for a Luas line to Lucan in the future.  While it is not included within the first ten years of the NDP, it is included in our transport strategy.  As well as the existing red line, there will be DART services on the Maynooth line and the Kildare line and there will be a Luas to Lucan.  It is important to remember there is also a bus system, which we sometimes overlook, and there is much being invested to provide an improved bus system for the west of the city, through the Greenhills corridor to Tallaght, the Clondalkin to Drimnagh corridor, the Liffey Valley corridor and the Lucan corridor.  Much is being invested, therefore, in the west of Dublin to put in place good transport links in the future.</p></speech>

There are strong orbital movements throughout the ,city but when we considered it in respect of strategy, we believed that in 20 years those orbital travel demands could be met by the bus system rather than a light rail system.  We will improve the level of service and the connections among the towns and urban villages on the west side of the city.  We introduced the 175 service last year, which has been successful in connecting Citywest to University College Dublin and beyond, and we will see those services increase over the next few years.</p></speech>

It is not acceptable for people to be shoved out to areas and told there is a bus service.  Anywhere beyond a certain mileage, the NTA should consider light rail.  The industrial parks do not have proper bus services, people are driving in from all over and the roads are clogged up.  Will the NTA remain open to the idea of a light rail system for Blanchardstown rather than citing the rail line to Maynooth?  People cannot get to it.</p></speech>

It is about improving the bus corridors in order that we can reduce the journey times.

A town is already in place in Blanchardstown, however, and I do not see how the argument can be made for one if the argument is not made similarly for the other.  Does the NTA have the figures for the scenario testing that was carried out?  It would be useful for the committee to examine.</p></speech>

We fully agree that the journey time from Blanchardstown to the city centre is too long and needs to be a whole lot shorter.</p><p>The core of the bus corridor project from Blanchardstown to the city centre is to do exactly that; therefore, we do not disagree with the Deputy.</p></speech>

It would not be the quickest route.  Through the Phoenix Park would be the best route if the NTA wanted to plonk a Luas line through it.  We would then be in and out of town quickly.  Private transport uses it constantly, but there is no public transport.  People cannot actually get to it without driving, but if the NTA wanted to extend the Luas line from Broombridge, it would be another option.  It is very disheartening for people to be told that there is a bus service when it takes an hour and 20 minutes to travel from parts of Ongar, etc.</p></speech>

I refer to Deputy Curran's questions about the next stage and concerns about changes to the network in advance of the bus corridors being put in place.  There is still a benefit to be gained in making changes to services because they would still make for better connections across the city.  We do not yet know what the connections will be and will be bringing them to the committee's attention in September when we have revised the network on the basis of the submissions received.  We still think there is a benefit to be gained in providing an improved service, even in advance of the bus corridors being improved.  There will then be an additional benefit in improved journey times when we have improved the bus corridors, but the benefits of having better connections and a much more integrated bus system should not be held back until the bus corridor improvements have been made.</p></speech>

The additional benefis on the main core bus corridors will also help to radically reduce journey times.  There will be a combination of benefits.</p></speech>

The fear is that in advance of having the bus corridors, the NTA will make all of these changes and people will not see the benefits.  They buy them in the case of the bus corridors, but it should not be suggested to them that they go halfway into town, get off and get on the bus that coming from the other direction when they have probably already queued for half an hour to get on the first bus and seen several go by.  They are terrified because at rush hour in the suburbs heading into town it is difficult to get on a bus and when they are on it, they want to keep that seat.</p></speech>

That is a considerable increase within that period and we know that more buses are needed.  </p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Munster's queries, the key question she asked at the beginning was whether we should have consulted communities before we ever drew up any plan.  We found from myriad consultations that the best way to start was with something which had been developed and to have something which people could review, comment on and give feedback on.  Going out with just a blank sheet of paper often does not help as it usually ends up causing far more annoyance than going out with an unfinished draft proposal to look for people's views.  That is where we are.  We went out with a proposal with which there were still issues that had to be sorted out to look for feedback.  I hope that when we revise it later this summer, we will have addressed a lot of the concerns raised.</p></speech>

From this the NTA could develop an idea of what their needs were before formulating a plan.</p></speech>

For instance, the census provides information on where people live, to where they are travelling, the times at which they leave and the mode of transport used.  We have that information and numerous other sources.  Therefore, we have an enormous database which that type of information, although I am not saying we have everything complete in terms of the knowledge we need.  We did not, but we certainly had enough to prepare a draft plan, which is what we did.</p> <p>  On BusConnects and writing to property owners but not to others, we are very conscious that property owners are the people who will be affected most because we will be interfering with their property.  They are the ones on whom we focused in writing individually.  We went as far as offering all of them a one to one meeting to discuss the project as it would affect them, the issues that were particular to them and other matters that needed to be taken into account.  That was the reason we focused on them, as opposed to writing to every single person across the city.</p> <p>  On how we will deal with affected residential tenants and property owners, in the document that was published yesterday we have put forward that, if we take College Gate apartments as an example, we will assist the tenants who will receive plenty of advance notice when the building is to be acquired because we will have to go through a process with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the scheme will have to be approved or otherwise.  If it is, they will be given plenty of advance notice.  We will work with them to find alternative accommodation.  We have committed to paying a year's rent for those tenants who will have to relocate.  We have also committed to providing assistance for property owners and owner-occupiers to assist them in finding alternative property.  The compensation system of the State will kick in to compensate them appropriately for the property that will be acquired.  We have the right approach in place and hope to continue with it.</p></speech>

As I said, three buses pass by at rush hour before people can get onto a bus.  The delegates have said they have already increased the number, but I am not comfortable with it.  If BusConnects is to work along orbital routes and more people are to come onto these routes, what concrete plans does the NTA have to increase the number of buses and the frequency of services in order that will not become an even bigger issue?</p></speech>

Obviously, there is always an issue at peak times, which is we try to have as much capacity at those times as possible, but there will be occasions on which demand will exceeds capacity, particularly at peak times.  There has been a considerable increase in the frequency of services in the Dublin region.  This also applies to Bus &Eacute;ireann in the services it operates from the regions around Dublin and in the regional cities.  In the case of Dublin Bus, we have just introduced a new route - 155 - which runs from Bray across the city to IKEA.  It has added significant capacity to the system.  Over one to two years we are adding approximately 10% to the capacity of the fleet and the network in Dublin.  A similar quantity of buses will be added to the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet to meet demand.  We will continue to review the position where demand is being exceeded on a constant basis to see whether we can provide additional services, subject to the funding we have available.</p></speech>

I have to repeat what I said earlier.</p><p>We are putting a DART service on the Kildare line, which will be a phenomenal addition to all locations along that line, and I mentioned the Maynooth line, which is further north.  Beyond that, we want to make improvements to the bus system and add capacity to it.</p><p> To move on to the green line connection, because we have recognised that the green line will need to be upgraded to metro in the future, the tunnel boring works we are doing now are being brought as far as is needed to make that connection at a point in the future without having to do more tunnel boring, and the connection in the future will be from the surface downwards.  That is what the MetroLink scheme is lined up to achieve.  Consideration of the flexibility to divert it to another location was the essence of the Deputy's question but the issue is what then happens to the green line.  The green line will be over capacity at a point in the future so we need to upgrade it.  The issue is what we would do if we were not going elsewhere.  I will leave aside the fact that this is our transport strategy and we would be undermining it to point it in a different direction.</p><p> The timeline for residents moving out of College Gate will have to wait until An Bord Plean&aacute;la approves the scheme, if it approves it.  There will certainly be a period of time after that, so I would guess we are talking of a period over three years and it could be five years, so the timeline is somewhere in that range.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the timeline for purchasing trams for the metro system.  The orders will probably be placed about halfway through the construction period.  They will need about four years advance ordering at least, so I imagine it will be 2022 or 2023 when the orders are placed for that.  It would not affect the placement of orders for the heavy rail fleet.  As I said, the tender process to procure DART fleet that will go onto the northern line, the Kildare line and the Maynooth line will kick off next month, so the metro trams will not interfere with that process.</p></speech>

There is a real issue in that once the train gets to Leixlip Confey, it is standing room only at all stations at peak time all the way to the city centre.  Therefore, the lead-in time is very important because there is already an issue.  Will the existing trains or the trains that are to be purchased be compatible with the electrified service?</p></speech>

To repeat, at the moment there is no spare rail fleet to put into service during peak hours as all available fleet is in service.  Unfortunately, there is no quick answer.   It will be 2023 before the new DART fleet starts to arrive.  There are two other options that are still being worked through.  One is whether we could acquire second-hand fleet, although there are questions as to where it would come from and how much modification would be needed.  The Irish gauge - the distance between the two tracks - is different from virtually every other European country and any fleet that comes in would have to be modified.  We are still working through what that would mean and whether it is worth doing it or not.  The second option is to acquire some more of the non-DART-type fleet that were purchased a number of years ago, which are known as intercity rail cars.  A large number were purchased six or seven years ago and there could be an option to purchase more of those carriages to extend existing train sets.  We will be making decisions on one or other, or both, of those solutions in the next couple of months.</p></speech>

I want to focus on the southside, as a southside Deputy.</p> <p>  I am aware that the preferred alignment from the NTA in regard to bringing the metro onto the green line goes back quite some time - 20 years - to the original decision to build the bigger bridge to cater for it and to widen the tracks.  The difficulty we ran into on the section from Dundrum to Ranelagh - it is not just a Ranelagh issue - is that I understand the NTA wants to use a driverless segregated system which would affect the accessibility of the line.  This is a real issue.  Some people depict people in certain areas as being just NIMBYs but there is a fundamental transport principle around trying to promote pedestrian and cycling accessibility as best we can, as I am sure the NTA would agree.  This presented real difficulties.  From the NTA's own research, it is clear there is a difficulty in that the potential closure of the line for two years would have huge knock-on consequences for the rest of the network.</p> <p>  I was very glad the Taoiseach, in response to D&aacute;il questions yesterday, indicated the Government's position that, given that circumstances, rather than just delaying 20 years before we carry out the possible works to connect the metro to the green line, we should and could consider alternative route alignments.</p><p>I have advocated from the outset that we look to the south west, while other Deputies have acknowledged that areas such as Blanchardstown are a nightmare.  The south-west quadrant is a nightmare too, in transport terms, and there is potential for keeping the tunnelling machine going to the south west to serve it.<br/><br/>The Taoiseach favoured running to the south east instead, to UCD, and I hope we will come back with some ideas on this during the consultation period.  It has the advantage that UCD and other areas such as Stillorgan, where a big development is planned, could connect to Sandyford.  This would solve the long-term capacity concerns on the green line because we would be able to divert traffic coming from Cherrywood on to the direct metro route.  It would be a good engineering solution because the entire line would be designed with a driverless segregated system in mind.  It would pick up on very busy transport destination points where significant growth is projected.<br/><br/>I have seen the plans for UCD and they include massive development with an increase in student population.  The president of UCD was quoted in newspapers this morning as stating that it also brings the prize of connecting the north side and south side and connecting three of our universities, namely, DCU, Trinity College and UCD, with an immense strategic benefit to the city.  The president was right to refer to the precedent of Boston where they connected Harvard, MIT and the city centre and it took off as an innovation hub as a result.  We should think of creating an enterprising, connected city and this would do that.<br/><br/>I wish to encourage the NTA in this regard.  We are in a consultation phase and it is fully appropriate in such a consultation to consider alternatives.  We cannot hold a public consultation on a <i>fait accompli</i>or to consider small technical changes.  We should be able to look at a realignment, which is a significant change but would deal with the technical problems we have run up against and would bring huge benefits for connectivity within the city.  We will have a tunnelling machine coming south of the Liffey in six, seven or eight years' time and we have to work out what we are going to do with it.  Alternative alignments make sense in this context.  I would like to get the witnesses' response.  I acknowledge there will be all sorts of legal and planning difficulties.  The transport plan is to upgrade the green line but we can change plans and our system has to be flexible enough to adapt, rather than waiting five years for another plan and starting again.  We cannot stop and wait 20 years either, because there would still be difficult engineering problems that would require us to restrict pedestrian access in a way we do not want or close a line for a period.<br/><br/>I support the approach which has been referred to, which might be difficult because it comes from a political system, while the witnesses have to adhere to legislation etc. and ensure the authority is not caught up in the courts over planning challenges.  I want to flag the point that the political system may have to give very clear direction in the coming year or six months.  That was a lengthy cry for consideration of that alternative.<br/><br/>As for BusConnects, I have been to many public consultation events and have seen Mr. Creegan at a large number of them.  I appreciate the calm, reasoned and open approach which I have seen from the NTA.  The consultation process has been a good exercise and it has not been not easy as there is a lot of anger and concern out there, which is valid.  I am very supportive of the BusConnects project as we have a critical transport crisis in our city, which is not being helped by widening every approach road to Dublin.  That does not make any sense to me.  Every motorway is being widened and to exaggerate a little, thought was given to chopping down every tree and cutting down all front gardens.  We must stop widening the approach roads to Dublin and stop the traffic coming in.  What are we doing?<br/><br/>In respect of the bus network, the public consultation meetings have been very detailed and useful in terms of a couple of corridors in my constituency, namely, those in Rathfarnham and Kimmage.  We have a problem with the continuation of the four-carriageway design, which is a six-carriageway design if one includes cycle lanes.  Real difficulties are being presented on the Kimmage Road Lower, from Sundrive Road to the KCR, and on Terenure Road East, Rathgar Road and Rathfarnham Road.  A very extensive removal of front gardens and trees is proposed, as is the creation of a streetscape that I fear means it will not remain a street at all, but become a major distributor road.  Living on a distributor road in urban villages and residential communities is a totally different experience from living on a street.<br/><br/>At the same time, we need to protect the bus fleets and improve bus times and services and I am 100% committed to that.  There may be a technical solution.  I welcome the plans to reduce the amount of through traffic on the two corridors to which I referred, without blocking access.  We need to take an approach along the lines of the proposal for the main street in Rathmines, which will be a one-way system for cars, the plan to restrict traffic from Bride Street onto Heytesbury Street and the plans for a bus gate in Harold's Cross, though there are local difficulties around this last plan.  These proposals recognise that we are at peak car and cannot cope.  We have to restrict traffic while trying to maintain access.  Instead of a four-lane approach on the roads I mentioned, we could look at a staggered three-lane approach.  We could make sure a bus gets through the light every time and make other reductions in traffic.  It should be possible to run the bus at the correct speed and to the correct timetable without having to provide a bus lane for the first 500 m of the road.  The buses would always be ahead of the traffic and it would be a general shared lane.  With a staggered approach, we may be able to reduce the amount of curtilage that must be taken, as well as diminishing the road's character as a major distributor route, thereby retaining some of the urban and residential character of the areas in question.  Do the witnesses see this as an option?  It would also have an effect on Nutley Lane and loads of other areas where there are similar difficulties but the effects would be particularly significant in the corridors to which I refer.</p></speech>

I still hope College Gate is under consideration for a slight realignment relating to property around there.  I know one of the sites creates a difficulty with the main sewer line but if that can be resolved, can the station be moved while maintaining integrated transport?  I suggest that a proper costing be carried out on the sewer line during the further public consultation, with a view to opening up alternative options.  The normal compulsory purchase order, CPO, mechanism will not work for College Gate.  It is a community that has been in the city for several years and there is a mixture of tenants and owner occupiers.  In the case of the latter, the current CPO system will not allow them to stay within their own community if it is carried out.  I ask for that to be examined.</p><p>College Gate is very different from anywhere else because of its location.  People who purchased their two-bedroom home in College Gate during the recession got it at a what people would call a good price nice now.  If they want to stay within their community, there will be a huge gap between what is a compulsory purchase price and a compensation price than what they can purchase in the immediate area.  That reality must be taken into consideration.  These people cannot be banished from their communities in which they have lived for decades.  Similarly for tenants, I do not believe the proposed one-year system will work.  </p><p> In terms of bus corridors, Deputy Eamon Ryan has outlined that we do not want the streetscape change.  To be fair, Mr. Creegan has worked with me when I made proposals and suggestions in an effort to resolve some of these issues, and I accept that not all of the issues can be resolved.  Let me outline one of my concerns.  In an effort to make constructive suggestions about how this matter can be resolved, as the witnesses are probably aware, the real-time data for buses are open data, so they are freely and easily accessible.  There seems to be a difference of up to 40% between the times stated in the consultation documents and the open real-time data sources that we have accessed.  I ask the witnesses to check their data sources.  We have 28 or 29 days of data.  There are large differences in the times that have been put forward and what is actually shown in the real-time data.  We now need local consultation, thus allowing people to bring forward constructive solutions and I am a big supporter of public transport.</p><p> As far back as when the metro system was proposed, I always said that no decision would be a worse decision for local communities.  We have hit a worse solution for the Charlemont Street line.  By building a bus park under Ranelagh, the NTA has sent a clear indication that it will extend the Luas green line.  I would like a better technical term than "perhaps" 20 years.  I am sure we have real modelling that will tell us within what timeframe it is proposed to extend.  I have not encountered the technical terms of "perhaps" before.  Anybody living along the line now who wishes to rightsize or downsize will experience a financial depreciation on their properties and probably will not be able to move to suitable accommodation because it will be an automatic discount.  This scenario has happened numerous times in terms of plans and certainly within Dublin city.   I refer, for example, to the Merrion Gates flyover that was proposed by the NTA.  One will see from a property search in the area that it is next to impossible to sell a property there if one wants to move one because potential buyers will see that there is a road reservation in the front garden yet there is no negotiation on a future compulsory purchase.  Similar things have happened in other locations, such as the sterilisation of a tract of land in terms of the eastern bypass.  Therefore, the NTA must give a little bit more certainty rather than the word "perhaps" so people can understand the future plans and proper timescales.  I certainly believe that there are two options, which have been clearly outlined by Deputy Eamon Ryan.  One option is to connect UCD or take the line further westward and connect Harold's Cross, Kimmage and up as far as the Rathfarnham bus corridor, which takes over 70,000 passengers and shows there is a demand.  I also believe that we should start to plan public transport for this city on a 100-year basis and not on a very short-term basis.</p><p> I respect what has happened in Swords.  I mean a decision has already been taken about height and density on the expectation that the metro system will go to Swords.  As for furnishing data on the viability of taking the MetroLink westward, one could consider, while working with local authorities, that changing the density and height at the locations along the metro line could make the line much more financially sustainable.  I believe public transport must be subsidised because cities and communities make other positive gains.</p><p> Lastly, the NTA must take on board the fact that this city is made up of villages and, therefore, we must ensure they are not destroyed by the proposals.  I urge the NTA that the streetscape is not changed so much that the villages are no longer viable.  I lived through the development of the Luas line on Harcourt Street so I know that many of the businesses on Harcourt Street never re-opened after they closed during the construction period.  Therefore, the construction proposals must be accompanied by supports for small businesses to ensure that they can exist during construction.  We must work imaginatively with the local authorities and take into consideration the loss of business during the construction of BusConnects.  At present small businesses and small shops are only hanging in there so one cannot say this project is going to be great, more people will go to the village thus generating more business if one cannot stay open during the construction period.  If a small business or shop closes then, more than likely, it will never re-open. </p></speech>

As the Deputy will know, we do need to provide the infrastructure and do it on the basis of our existing transport strategy, which is a statutory plan.  Any changes to any alignment would require a change to our statutory document plus there is a time period involved in delivering a change to the transport strategy.  We do and we are required, and of course our strategy has to be adaptable to changing circumstances, but there is an allowance in our legislation to review our transport strategy every six years.  We will be proposing to do that and to start that work towards the end of next year.  We believe it is at that time that any changes or potential changes to alignment would be considered.  It is then that one would consider the proposal to go to UCD instead of upgrading the green line to metro level service.  If we make changes to our plans now, it means that our transport strategy would have to change.  There is a two to three-year period involved in developing a transport strategy, getting it statutorily approved and then delaying the process for the whole MetroLink.  We do not think that is something we should bring forward at this stage.</p></speech>

Clearly, we must do things within legislative and other mechanisms but we have a real transport crisis in our city.  We face a congestion charge of &euro;2 billion a year because Dublin is such a car dominated city.  I recall from our separate work at the Joint Committee on Climate Action that Ms Graham replied to a question that I asked about the estimate.  Even with the metro and BusConnects, we are looking at a 30% increase in transport emissions in Dublin by 2030 when we need a 30% reduction at least.  So, we have an absolute crisis.  I know from the work done by the Joint Committee on Climate Action and other committees that a whole range of measures will have to be taken in other sectors of society, and that we will have to be quick and resolute in our approach.  We will not resolve the matter here today, and I hear what the witnesses have said on that aspect.  I think the political system is going to come back to the NTA to ask it to come up with ways to speed up the process.</p><p>Even if, for some reason, it is ruled out or not agreed, a general approach of delaying transport infrastructure is the last one that we should be adopting.  As we have that tunnelling machine coming south of the Liffey, it would be a tragedy to fail to use it in a productive way.  Other parts of the city are going to have a similar dramatic increase in the scale of public transport investment we are going to make.  That strategy will probably be challenged and changed in other ways.  For example, we will have to ramp things up because the climate agreement we will have to conclude with the European Union will say our plans are not sufficient.  The national development plan included no climate assessment and there is a legal challenge against that, rightly.  We are facing the European Union which is not going to give us an out on our climate emissions targets.  We will have to so much more on transport that any plan cannot be regarded as fixed.  In particular, where we have a project where this is a variation, any court or planning system will see that, during the consultation process, people came forward with alternative suggestions.  If we do not have a public consultation that allows for such variation, that process would say it was not a proper public consultation.  While I think it is a proper public consultation, we should not get caught in the weeds of timelines for statutory plans that see us missing an opportunity.  That is the one point I would make.  If that requires political action by way of legislative or other measures, it will be possible for us to do it.  However, we must work fast now to do the modelling quickly and to assess as best we can the alternatives.  The political system will be coming looking for that because we have this challenge.</p></speech>

The danger is that it would have an impact on delivery of MetroLink as proposed with regard to the preferred route.  There is a risk associated with that and we will be pointing out what it is.  Certainly, the political system can come to us and request us to do that work.  While we will carry out the work as requested, there is a danger to the delivery of the MetroLink project as it is set out with regard to the preferred route.</p></speech>

The short answer is that while that may be possible in places, we have to be conscious that we are building this for the future.  If the queuing extends back beyond the bus lane area into the combined lane, which the Deputy proposes we avoid, we will end up with problems.  There may be places where it is the appropriate solution so we will look at it.  There is also another way to get to a three-lane arrangement and reduce the land take in one or two places.  A one-way piece of street may be appropriate there.  We have already had discussions with one or two groups about whether that is appropriate in their particular localities.  Both options are available and we will explore them.</p></speech>

Senator Humphreys is right that we have to think long-term.  In the long term, the city will not be dominated by cars.  It will be dominated by bikes, buses and a rail system.  The bike capacity will reduce the number of cars on the road.  We must think long-term.  It is not that we will continue to provide the existing car system.  It will be a completely different city and one that is much better.  That is where we are going.  In that context, we can start to think not about always providing for the car but providing for those alternatives.</p></speech>

We did a great deal of work on College Gate to see if we could avoid having to proceed with the proposal with which we went forward.  The honest position is that the proposal with which we went forward previously is still the right one.  None of the alternatives is satisfactory.  They all have issues.  We will put on the MetroLink website within a number of days a comprehensive report setting out all the options that were looked at and the issues with each.  People will have the opportunity to review that.  They will see that a lot of effort was made to determine how to avoid having to remove those apartments.  Unfortunately, we have not been able to do that in this case.  On the compulsory purchase order, CPO, system, it was stated that the normal process will not work correctly.  We are sort of acknowledging that in what we have put forward.  The idea of compensating tenants with up to one year's rent in another location is outside the CPO process and beyond what it normally requires.  Rental tenants by their nature only have a fixed tenancy usually.  We are going to go above and beyond that.  For owner-occupiers, we will try to help them find alternative accommodation in a suitable location.  As the Senator said, they are part of a community at this stage and, it is presumed, will be looking to be accommodated somewhere else in that community.  We will do all we can to assist them.  I agree completely that the normal compensation rules are not enough and we are going above and beyond that.</p> <p>  I will pick up some of the other things, including the streetscape issues.  We are very conscious of that and have consulted people.  Taking gardens is a significant issue which encompasses what a road will look like afterwards.  We are appointing design teams for the project over the next month or so and all of them will include urban realm architects.  We will make it a key focus of the project that we end up not only with the transport but a project that respects the character of the areas through which it runs.</p> <p>  I was asked about bus data and open source access.  That is understood.  When one looks at the open source data, the issue is the variability in the buses.  We have not put out a single number and said that every bus journey takes a certain number of minutes.  We have had to put out a notice to say journeys take up to a certain amount of time and we have not even gone to the extremes in that regard.  The data we have used in our documentation come from the automatic vehicle location data from the buses themselves and we have access to all of that.  The calculations that were done came from that system.  It demonstrates, if nothing else, the vast variability in bus times.  One day a journey takes a certain amount of time and the next day it takes a different amount of time.  People find it hard to plan their journeys with confidence on that basis.</p> <p>  I was asked about the sterilisation of properties along the green line and the timescale for its upgrade.  The proposals to upgrade the green line to metro will largely mirror the proposals we published last year.  People will have seen what the impacts and changes will be.  It might vary slightly, but that is the broad outline.  As to timescale, we said in our documentation yesterday that we believe we can get the green line to function for up to 20 years, approximately.  Close to that time period it will have to change, but we do not have any more detailed information on that yet.  I was asked about the metro deviating in another direction towards the Rathfarnham area.  Ms Graham has covered the impact on the strategy of making changes at this stage.  As the Senator acknowledged, it would require significant development changes to make it slightly higher density.</p></speech>

In answer to Deputy Ryan, the NTA gave a timeline for the review.  We are looking at a review at the end of 2020 which will then take two or three years.  In fact, there would be no change if we were to stick to that timeline because it will be four years along and contracts will have been entered into.  If it is to go further to the west or down to UCD, we have to take action now.</p><p>I am open to this.  I would like to see the modelling to see whether it would be best to go west or out to UCD.

It was designed and considered on the basis that the green Luas line would be upgraded to metro and that there would be an expanded and improved DART service on the DART corridor as well.  The Stillorgan corridor, which serves UCD at the moment, is in the middle of that.  The development of the strategy showed that if both were put in place, the bus system would be able to cater for the demand along the Stillorgan corridor.  We can certainly go back and look at the modelling that was done in the lead-up to the strategy and the optioneering that would be done.  If we were now to do some modelling on a different proposal, that would involve a significant amount of work.</p></speech>

According to the NTA's figures - they are not mine - there has been a 17% increase in bus journeys along that corridor.  As a result of higher than expected movements of public transportation and buses, the level of passenger movement on the Rathfarnham corridor is now coming very close to what the Luas is serving on the green and red lines.</p></speech>

Our estimate, which is based on modelling that was done previously, is that travel demand along the Rathfarnham corridor would not support a Luas or metro service.  We can certainly share that information with the committee as well.</p></speech>
