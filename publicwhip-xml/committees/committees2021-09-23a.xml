Deputy Marc MacSharry has stood down from the committee and is being replaced by Deputy James O'Connor, who may join us later.  I propose that the committee ask the clerk to send a letter to Deputy MacSharry to thank him for his work as a member of the committee over many years.  He took a great interest in that work and I express the committee's thanks for his efforts.</p>  <p>  As we return to participating at committee meetings in person, I ask members and all in attendance to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending, practise good personal hygiene and always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after meetings.  Masks should be worn at all times during meetings except when speaking.  I ask for the full co-operation of members on this.</p></speech>

The HSE has been advised that the areas of interest to the committee include oversight and governance arrangements concerning grants to section 38 and section 39 organisations and the service arrangement between the HSE and SouthDoc.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the HSE: Mr. Paul Reid, CEO; Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer; Mr. Joe Ryan, national director of operational performance and Integration; and Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan, assistant chief financial officer.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Kevin Colman, principal officer at the Department of Health.  They are all very welcome.</p>  <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute their microphones while not contributing so that they do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent.  We have a hybrid meeting this morning, with some members in the room and others joining remotely.  I ask for everyone's co-operation with these arrangements.  </p>  <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House, as regards references that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and by statute, by absolute privilege.  However, one of today's witnesses, a Department official, is giving evidence remotely from a place outside parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  The witness has already been advised of this and may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218, which states that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of Government, or Minister of the Government, or the merits or objectives of such policies.</p>  <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  To assist our broadcast services and the staff of the Debates Office, I ask members to direct their questions to specific witnesses.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time that he or she contributes.</p>  <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, delivered his opening statement on the board's financial statements at our meeting of 16 September and it was recirculated to the committee before this meeting.  Unless the Comptroller and Auditor General wishes to address this matter again, we will move straight to Mr. Reid for his opening statement.  Is Mr. McCarthy happy for us to proceed?</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleagues, Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer; Mr. Joe Ryan, national director of operational performance and integration; and Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan, assistant chief financial officer.</p>  <p>  We submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting on the topics for examination, so I will confine my opening remarks to the following concerning section 38 and section 39 services providers.  The HSE must use the resources provided to it each year by the Government in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and well-being of the public.  The HSE is mandated in law to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.  These services are, by their nature, varied and complex.  In the main, the HSE delivers services directly but it also relies on voluntary providers to deliver services on its behalf.  It also funds providers to deliver similar or ancillary services.</p>  <p>   Section 38 and section 39 service providers comprise more than 2,100 funded and grant-aided organisations nationwide, including some of the large academic teaching hospitals, disability service providers and a diverse range of other health and social care providers.  These organisations play a central role in the provision of acute, community and home-based services to the public and many have a long history of caring for patients and service users within their communities.  They have been vital and trusted partners of the HSE during the Covid-19 pandemic in protecting, treating and caring for our most vulnerable.  I acknowledge and appreciate their enormous contribution to the success of the national health response.</p>  <p>  Annual funding released by the HSE to these providers is approximately &euro;5.4 billion.  Given this spending, the HSE has a formal governance framework in place with each organisation, incorporating standardised contractual documentation and guidance coupled with direct engagement processes.  The governance framework underpins the allocation and oversight of the funding granted and the services provided in return.  The requirements of the governance frameworks are onerous on providers, and we know that, and they are also onerous on the HSE.  However, such a governance framework is necessary to ensure the HSE and the providers meet their obligations to one another.  The terms of a governance framework are informed by the public spending policy and the framework is reviewed and updated in accordance with those principles.  The manner in which funding is overseen by the HSE is also informed by the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In this regard, I highlight two developments in particular. </p>  <p>  First, the large number of service providers, approximately 2,100, funded primarily by the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, led to a decision being taken to establish contract management support units, CMSUs, in each of the nine CHOs.  Several of these teams are in place and it is expected that the remaining staff for these units will be in place and the units fully operational by the end of the year.  These CMSUs are a dedicated permanent resource and their primary purpose will be to assist service managers at operational level in managing the contractual relationship with the service providers.  </p>  <p>  Second, as we advised the committee previously, external reviews of the governance of 30 organisations have taken place as part of phase 1 of this process.  Phase 2 will commence later this month and it will involve the review of the section 38 service providers not previously reviewed and some of the higher funded section 39 service providers.  The purpose of these reviews is to gain external assurance regarding the standards of governance and to ensure that enhancements are put in place where required.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that our section 38 and section 39 providers are separate legal entities, with their own boards that are directly responsible, in the first instance, for the standards of good governance within their organisations.  Most of these providers are registered charities and their boards are subject to oversight by the Charities Regulator, quite apart from any additional governance assurances the HSE may seek.</p> <p>We continue to work closely with our section 38 and section 39 providers to ensure the services we provide together meet the needs of our communities, are complementary to each other and are of high quality.  To this end, we will continue to examine and keep under constant review the governance framework in relation to section 38 and section 39 providers.  Some of these organisations are facing funding challenges, and committee members will be aware of this.</p> <p> The HSE is also participating, with representatives in the voluntary sector, in a dialogue forum set up following the report of the independent review group.  The aim of the forum is to build a stronger relationship between the State and voluntary providers for the benefit of patients and service users.  It is my view that we need to consider a revised governance framework which better supports accountable autonomy within the sector, while at the same time meeting the important and necessary governance and accountability obligations to which the HSE is itself subject.</p> <p> SouthDoc provides an out-of-hours GP service to a population of 694,000 in counties Cork and Kerry, in addition to the 3 million visitors to the region each year.  There are 502 GP members and the services provided by SouthDoc are governed by a service level agreement which is agreed and signed annually and reviewed quarterly.  The agreed level of expenditure for the full year of 2021 is &euro;7.5 million.  All calls to the service are processed through a central call centre hub in Killarney in the SouthDoc headquarters.  A triage nurse, in consultation with the patient, decides on the most appropriate course of clinical care for the clinical condition.  There are 12 walk-in treatment centres as well as seven treatment centres which are attended by appointment only in the SouthDoc catchment area.  While some treatment centres were temporarily closed due to safety concerns associated with Covid-19, all patients were still in receipt of a full out-of-hours service, which may have been provided in a different location or via telehealth.</p> <p> The SouthDoc service continued to operate throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, with necessary precautions applied during the different phases of the public health emergency.  SouthDoc introduced medical triage to support normal triage.  This allowed for certain issues to be dealt with via telecommunication, where appropriate.  There were two specific sites which were later to open, at Listowel in County Kerry and the Blackpool centre in Cork city.  Both services were the subject of discussion between SouthDoc and the HSE regarding their restoration, with both centres now open subject to public health measures.  The Listowel service recommenced in July and Blackpool recommenced in early September.</p></speech>

The first committee speaker, Deputy Colm Burke, has 15 minutes.  He was to be followed by Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill.  As I noted earlier, Deputy Carroll MacNeill is as l&aacute;thair today, so after Deputy Burke there will be six minutes for each speaker.  I will give Deputy Burke a reminder after 12 minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092300003#B00300"><p>I thank Mr. Reid and all the people in the HSE for their work over the last 18 months.  It has been a very difficult time for everyone.</p>  <p>  I want to touch on the last issue Mr. Reid dealt with.  With regard to the funding for SouthDoc, I note from my notes that in 2019 the funding for SouthDoc was &euro;8.3 million, my figure for 2020 was &euro;12.3 million and for 2021 it is &euro;7.5 million.  I wonder why there was a 50% increase between 2019 and 2020, in particular when some of the centres were closed.  Could I have an explanation for that variation in the funding to SouthDoc over that three-year time period?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092300003#B00400"><p>I will make a brief comment on 2019 and 2020.  I can get the full figures but, certainly, any extra funding which would have been assigned would have related to Covid and the extra supports we would have had to put in due to Covid, with the various agreements.  I will see if I can confirm the other increases but, certainly for 2020, extra expenditure was funded to GPs for out-of-hours services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092300003#B00500"><p>It sounds like a huge increase, in particular when facilities were closed.  Another issue is in regard to facilities that closed.  For instance, Blackpool, which is on the north side of Cork city, was closed down.  With regard to access to the facilities on the south side, there is no public transport, so a facility was closed down that people on the north side of the city and the rural area on the north side previously had access to, whereas the south side was far more difficult for people to get access to.  Where are we going in regard to the development of facilities in Cork, in particular when we are spending that kind of money?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092300003#B00600"><p>I might come in on that.  In terms of how out-of-hours services work and their funding, it is not just for face-to-face consultation.  A lot of the work that an out-of-hours service does is over the phone.  They have nurses who triage people, so if people phone an out-of-hours service, they will be triaged by a nurse in the first instance, they may then be triaged by a doctor, all over the phone, and it is only if they need to present in person-----</p></speech>

Those are the figures I have.  I know the witnesses may not be able to give that to me now but they might give it to me subsequently in writing.</p>  <p>  I want to move on to deal with the issue in regard to the value for money report in regard to nursing homes.  We have been waiting nearly three years for this report.  Why can this report not be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Where are we with it now?  In regard to the whole nursing homes issue, additional funding was provided under TAPS, the temporary assistance payment scheme.  What allocation went to the public nursing homes as opposed to the private nursing homes?  For example, under the fair deal scheme, &euro;768 million is going to the private nursing homes and &euro;356 million to the public nursing homes.  Additional moneys were provided during Covid.  What element of that went to the public nursing homes and what element went to the private nursing homes?  Could we have a breakdown of those figures?</p></speech>

It is roughly &euro;6 million a month so, in 2020, it was about &euro;70 million-odd.  From it started until about the middle of this year, about &euro;120 million of support has gone to the private nursing homes.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092300003#B01300"><p>The reality is that the public nursing homes incurred additional costs, which are also set out in the annual financial statements.  Their other fixed costs were of the order of &euro;55 million to &euro;57 million, up from about &euro;22 million or &euro;23 million the previous year.  They incurred additional costs because their occupancy levels would have fallen.  I do not have information on the value for money report.</p></speech>

This has been going on for over three years and costs have increased in the meantime.  There are complaints from the private nursing homes about having difficulty retaining staff, but part of the problem is funding.  The other issue with funding is this.  When people go into a private nursing home, they are assessed as regards the level of care they require when they are admitted.  As I understand it, if their health disimproves and they need additional care, there is no provision for the cost of their care to be increased or for additional funding to be provided by the HSE under the fair deal scheme.

The InterRAI assessment, which is a common assessment, is being rolled out and we are recruiting a lot of new assessors, so in terms of assessing the changing care needs of individuals we are moving towards that.  That does not mean that the cost of care in an individual nursing home will flex up and down.  We are working towards having a more up-to-date assessment.  It also allows us to support people.  Another criticism is about the lack of support for assessment, for example, for equipment, aids and appliances.  It helps with all of that and assessing what an individual's need is and ensuring that we provide the right supports.</p></speech>

The nature of that fraud was surfaced and identified by us as part of the financial returns requested.  It occurred over a number of years.  That is our understanding of it.  I will not go into the details of the scale of the fraud.  Suffice to say, it is significant that criminal charges - prosecutions - are being brought.  Many issues arise from that case that we have taken on board in internal audits of other organisations and for controls that need to be put in place.  A few general issues have come through but, as the Deputy said, it will be part of a criminal case shortly, so I will not go into the full details of it.

That local hospital has made significant changes since this was discovered by its teams.  The hospital group in which it sits has also gone out to other hospitals to check whether this is a possible issue in other hospitals.  On a national level, our executive management team has discussed this and I have written on behalf of the HSE to all our services with a detailed checklist asking them to carry out a self-assessment on the range of controls relevant for payroll.  We have asked them to come back to us by the end of September setting out what their position is with that.  At a board level, our audit committee has oversight of this on behalf of the board and has brought in the relevant hospital and hospital group to discuss progress on implementing changes.  As the CEO said, the matter will be before the courts shortly and has been with the Garda for some time.</p></speech>

There are 2,100 organisations, with a &euro;5.4 billion overall spend.  We put in place a range of controls.  We have completed about 158 internal audits on section 38 and 39 organisations over the past few years.  There would be a range of consistent issues coming through that we would put particular focus on relating to governance, delegations, income controls, travel and subsistence.</p>  <p>  The controls that we put in place are largely set out in the section 38 and 39 agreements.  They range from service agreements with those organisations which spend above &euro;250,000 to grant-aid agreements for those which spend less than &euro;250,000.  Those organisations which receive grants of over &euro;3 million have an annual compliance statement.  There is a range of controls relating to reviews.  As I mentioned in our opening statement, we have our compliance unit and we resource compliance support teams in our CHOs all across the country.  We have a range of governance and oversight devices to protect the funding of the State but, inevitably, issues have arisen and some consistent issues have arisen as part of some audits.  That is our overall oversight.</p></speech>

When people are aware that a centre is closed, they will feel there is no point in ringing SouthDoc and will decide to go to the hospital, such as the emergency department in Mercy University Hospital or Cork University Hospital, rather than going all the way out to the Kinsale Road.

What actions has the HSE taken?  I am having difficulty with the HSE in CHO 5 which is telling me that the private providers cannot provide carers either.

I have only recently raised this matter in the D&aacute;il.  It is is absolutely unacceptable that we have people in beds in hospital whose families want to take them home but, due to the lack of three hours of care a day in some instances, we cannot get those people home.

The notion of having people in hospital who could or should be at home is not one that any of us want to live with.  There has been a lot of work done in relation to home support workers.  If we go back a few years, our challenge was one of funding.  We have two different groups awaiting home support.  We have people who have a package and maybe their care needs to be increased and they need more hours and then we have those who are on a waiting list to receive home support.</p>  <p>  In the last 18 months or so, we have found a reduction in the number of workers available.  This relates, in the main, to two things.  The first is that people are not applying for these jobs both in the public and private sector.  It used to be that this was a problem in certain parts of the country.  For instance, in parts of the south east, unfortunately, there have always been some issues with recruiting these workers into some of the private agencies.  However, it is now a national problem.  Some of our CHOs are only able to deliver up to 60% of their funded allocation of home support.  That is impacting hugely on people such as those the Deputy mentioned - people in hospital who are trying to go home - as well as the disability sector where people are not getting the right in-home supports.</p>  <p>  We are working on a number of fronts on this.  One challenge is around people not applying for these jobs.  They have other income at the moment and are not putting their hands up.  Equally, we have identified a problem with training.  We are working on a new model to bring people in and providing an internship-type training to try to encourage them.  We have found that many of the people who apply do not have the necessary qualifications.  They are very well meaning and want to do this work but the reality is that home support work is very rewarding but also very challenging.  It is not an easy job.</p></speech>

I discovered we are not covering for maternity leave across most of our services.  Will the witnesses explain that to me?  This is critical from an early intervention perspective, particularly with children.  Why, in God's name, would maternity leave not be covered for speech and language therapists?</p></speech>

I raise the funding scheme for section 39 providers.  One provider that I have supported locally is Western Care, which does a fantastic job.  It is experiencing serious issues providing the quantum of service it is contractually agreed to provide with the funding provided by the HSE.  It is not authorised by the HSE or its board to exceed the level of service provision in the absence of adequate funding.  However, demand for services is increasing and applications for funding are not being addressed.</p>  <p>  Western Care has experienced serious financial difficulties in recent years.  The cost of service provision exceeds the funding received by the HSE, which is leaving it in a position where it has no option but to implement cost containment measures.  That is having a huge negative impact on those most in need of the services and their families.  Demand for services is increasing and applications for funding are not being addressed.  Western Care has told me it has submitted over 135 business cases to the HSE, with a value of &euro;11 million, over the past three years and the HSE has responded to very few of them.  How is the HSE dealing with specific requests for additional funding from service providers such as Western Care?</p></speech>

There is signficant demand for services, not just from section 39 providers.  Section 39 providers account for about 28% of the total &euro;5.4 billion grants to section 38 and 39 organisations.  Many section 39 organisations have deficits and are having issues with demands for services exceeding funding.  It is a big challenge across the health service.  We engage with the organisations.  Comparing 2020 with 2019, significant extra funding was provided to recognise the Covid demands on all section 38 and 39 organisations.</p>  <p>  I fully understand the issue the Deputy is raising.  We receive those requests on a regular basis.  We allocate funding based on Government funding in the Estimates and the budget, based on the national service plan.  Those demands are increasing, particularly for section 39 providers, but we can only allocate the funding to the extent that we have it.  The demands on all of our services are a big challenge.  We receive them, review them and allocate to the best extent we can.</p></speech>

Nationally, the disability organisations in particular are very challenged with their funding.  The demand is going up, as the Deputy said.  We are looking at the funding of the organisations in our engagements, as Mr. Reid said.  Equally, we are looking at the whole model of delivery of disability services to ensure we are making the best use of the funding available for all organisations, including Western Care.  I would say the disability sector is the most challenged.  There are many organisations in the same space as the one the Deputy set out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.83" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="09:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092300005#D02100"><p>I hear what Ms O'Connor is saying but the reality on the ground is that the HSE managers have very limited access to funds to support the business cases.  Western Care was informed by the HSE that funding would be only allocated for 44 emergency places for the whole country in 2021.  If that is the case, the business cases that Western Care is submitting are falling on deaf ears.  That does not reflect what people in the west - in counties Mayo, Galway and Roscommon - need.  Covid has shone a spotlight on this.</p> <p> There is pent-up demand and the lack of adequate funding to support families in the short, medium and long term is causing real suffering.  That must be addressed.  What I hear today does not give me or the people I represent confidence.  There is a huge issue around section 39 organisations.  There is no capital funding available for Western Care to properly renovate its existing stock.  There is no plan to support the development of new facilities for both day and residential services, apart from what was available under the Covid-related minor works scheme.  Significant issues arise, even in rural constituencies.  There is no funding for transport provision, which is fundamentally important for both day and residential services, especially given the geographical spread in Mayo.  These are the issues that are coming up day in, day out from this type of provider and we must address them.</p> <p> Regarding the increased number of referrals of children for autism supports, Western Care has had no increase in funding for autism support workers in recent years and that must also be addressed.  We are spending large amounts of money.  Western Care has more than 940 staff supporting a massive county like Mayo.</p></speech>

It has been funded last year and this year and we are pursuing funding for it for next year.  As far as we are concerned, as Mr. Reid said, individual section 39 organisations will be proceeding with that, but there can be ongoing difficulties with organisations and their staff representatives around the pace of that.</p></speech>

From the range of oversights I touched on with the previous Deputy, in particular in some of the internal audits completed by the HSE on some section 38 and 39 organisations, a range of issues come up, no more than for ourselves, as the Deputy has just outlined.  Issues arise relating to board governance, travel and subsistence, income controls, procurement, purchasing, segregation of duties, human resources, HR, and petty cash.  I am not saying they all default and they all have those issues, but they would be some of the consistent issues that arise.  A lot of these organisations are registered as charities and have their own boards.  They are accountable and the board members are accountable.  We provide an oversight in some cases for a portion of their total income streams, but they are the consistent issues that come up as part of audits.</p></speech>

We do not have a sufficient level of oversight and governance of some of these organisations.  During Covid, we saw that we did not have a sufficient level of control, in particular over service delivery.  Have we analysed whether the section 39 model is the way to proceed?</p></speech>

They are a part of the health system and the delivery of services and they provide a very valuable service.  While I have highlighted some of the governance issues that arise, overall, as Deputy McAuliffe is aware, they provide a very valuable service for service users and in particular for the health service.  We see them as a valued part of the service providers going forward.</p></speech>

With Covid and other challenges over the past year, the provision of service has been challenged due to the unavailability of staff who are close contacts and the various issues that have arisen.</p>  <p>  In terms of the monitoring of compliance, we have a number of measures which have been outlined to the Deputy such as our annual compliance statements.  They are detailed in terms of compliance with procurement and other procedures the organisations have to comply with, such as public standards.  Any organisation with funding of over &euro;150,000 has to provide annual financial statements and any organisation with funding of over &euro;250,000 has to provide a more detailed statement on compliance with corporate governance, procurement and other control measures.  The statements that are submitted to us are all reviewed by our teams in the CHOs.

One of the benefits of the section 39 organisations in particular is that they are local, have buy-in and have other funding sources which they can secure above and beyond State funding.

I apologise as I was not here at the time, but I have read his statement since.</p>  <p>  I will start with the grant-aid agreements, which have been a welcome addition to the entire process for section 38 and 39 organisations.  There is a little bit more certainty and there is good engagement between the relevant CHO and the organisations.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the fact that contract management support units are being established across the nine CHOs.  I have a quick question on the grant agreements.  Where an organisation exists, but spans several CHOs, surely it would make more sense to have a single service level agreement or grant agreement with one particular body of the HSE rather than multiple grant-aid agreements?</p> <p>Is there a process in place for such a thing?

That makes sense.  I thank Mr. Ryan for that clarification.  In terms of the capital programme, to which Deputy Dillon referred, there is a real need for many of these section 38 and section 39 organisations, which either lease or maybe own their own building, to access capital funding.  Is there any plan coming forward for that?</p></speech>

It is a tight pot of availability.  It is reviewed based on all health needs, not just the HSE's, but those of section 38 and section 39 organisations, but it is limited funding.  We certainly feel that capital as a proportion of our total expenditure on health is tight, although it has been increased in the last few years.  However, it is an available window that we have.  Our capital review teams review all submissions they get and try to fund over a period of years and build them into a three-year programme.  Mr. Mulvany might comment.</p></speech>

While the overall capital is limited, as the CEO said, it is finding its way to section 38 organisations and some section 39 organisations proportionately more than on the revenue side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092300007#F00600"><p>It is very hard for those organisations to try to access capital funding.  While I appreciate it is limited, particularly in urban areas such as Dublin, where we need extra capacity for some of these organisations, the benefit of unlocking capital funding is that it could expand those much-needed services.</p>  <p>  To stay with the section 38 and 39 organisations, I want to ask a few questions on the internal audit.  There are anomalies with the Charities Regulator as well, and I would ask the HSE to examine that aspect.  The Charities Regulator is asking some of those independent boards to do one thing and the HSE audit is saying it is frowned upon, so there are some anomalies there.  How many audits have taken place since the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2016 report and what is the breakdown between random and targeted audits?</p></speech>

Under section 38, 158 audits were completed by internal HSE audit in the period 2014 to 2021, although I will have to clarify if that is the correct period.  Certainly, in 2020, there were a limited number, due to Covid and redeployment of most of our internal audit teams.</p></speech>

In terms of the integrated financial management and procurement system, which is known as IFMS, I know that over the last couple of weeks, and even for the last number of years, the IT systems across the HSE have been questioned.  What impact have the cyberattack and the pandemic had on the original budget for the financial management and procurement system within the HSE?</p></speech>

The impact in terms of both Covid and the cyberattack is that it has cost us approximately 12 months in time, as per the briefing we sent to members.  The cost impact of Covid and the cyberattack on the programme is of the order of about &euro;1 million or thereabouts, so it is not substantial in the overall context, albeit it was significant.  It is the time delay of the year overall, which we can break down if needed, which obviously is more worrying.</p></speech>

Because of the first and third waves of Covid, the cyberattack and planning difficulties, that has been pushed out to quarter 1 of 2025.</p>  <p>  I need to mention to members that, in recent weeks, we have been engaging with our external third party, what is called a systems integrator, that is, an expert professional firm which is assisting us with this programme.  They have indicated to us that they have difficulties in commercial terms in meeting the contract because it is a fixed price contract.  We are exploring with them all the options around how to deal with that.  As the Deputy can imagine, it is fairly commercially sensitive.  The project continues and is simply suspended in order to stop accruing costs.  We have suspended an element of the billed work which they are completing but we are proceeding with the rest of the project, and we are working with them on the various options.  Those options may include securing a different systems integrator through a procurement process.  Again, we are very mindful that any procurement process will take more time, so we have tasked the team to look at all the options to mitigate any further delay to that quarter 1 of 2025 target of having 80% of the health system, including the voluntary organisations, on a single finance and procurement system.  Those negotiations are under way at the moment and, as I said, we are exploring the various options to deal with the issues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092300007#F01700"><p>Yes, I am well aware of that.  I know there was a presentation yesterday by some of the HSE team to the Joint Committee on Health to set out the issues in regard to Owenacurra, which, on inspection and review, was found to be beyond refurbishment in terms of the costs allocated to it.  I know a very strong commitment was given by the HSE teams at a national and local level for the service users of that site to be managed in a very sensitive way over a period of time.  The original dates were October of this year but that has been pushed out to manage each case on a case-by-case basis.  Certainly, the costs associated with any refurbishment were well beyond any benefit that could accrue over the long term.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.123" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092300007#F01800"><p>I have two points.  First, we still do not have sight of what the costs of refurbishment would be.  Second, it is our understanding that it is proposed to rehouse or rehome some people in institutional settings like St. Stephen's Hospital in Glanmire and also in St. Catherine's, and possibly on the site of St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork.  If it is the case that the HSE is proposing to re-institutionalise people at a time when the HSE policy and Government policy is to decongregate, I think that would be taken very seriously.  I ask that the HSE take another look at this decision on the basis that people are very concerned, given where it is proposed that people will be sent to, in that this further institutionalises them.  All I am asking at this stage is that Mr. Reid take another look at this and run the rule over it, as chief executive officer.  I will leave it there.</p>  <p>  SouthDoc is very important.  During the pandemic, a number of cells were taken out of action, and that is the fact of the matter.  Mitchelstown and Fermoy, as well as the Cork centres, were taken out.  This meant that cars were going much further afield to cover off services on an out-of-hours basis.  It meant that doctors were much more stretched, if they were doing home visits.  Please do not tell us how the service works.  We know how the service works.  There is a fear that the &euro;7.5 million of taxpayers&rsquo; investment in this service is not buying enough scrutiny of the service that is being provided, notwithstanding the fact it is a separate entity.  There is a presence by the HSE on the board of SouthDoc.  To my mind, that buys the taxpayer and the HSE greater scrutiny of how SouthDoc operates.</p> <p> On Deputy Colm Burke's point, which he ran out of time on, I share his view.  More and more people are now going to Cork University Hospital, CUH, on an accident-and-emergency basis and bypassing SouthDoc because they do not feel confident that they will be seen at times by SouthDoc.  We need to deal with perceptions in the public mind as to how SouthDoc operates.  I am very familiar with the Mallow service and the Mitchelstown-Fermoy service.  They are excellent services staffed by brilliant people.  I could not say enough good things about them.  However, we do not have a service in Youghal out of hours.  Someone who phones from Youghal is expected to go to Midleton.  That is a journey of about half an hour.  The services at times are stretched between the Waterford border and the Kerry border.</p> <p> There needs to be a review of how SouthDoc operates.  It is our view that the &euro;7.5 million investment of taxpayers' money buys the HSE greater scrutiny to ensure that it is triaging and building out a public message in a way that ensures that if people can avoid the accident and emergency department in CUH and go through their local services, while those services are very good, there might need to be a greater degree of scrutiny or some sort of review as to how the services operate, particularly within the city.  There needs to be a look back on why the Blackpool and Fermoy-Mitchelstown services were closed because the HSE took out a massive geographical area there.  They were taken out during the pandemic.  I ask - this is my only ask - that the HSE look back on how SouthDoc operated during the pandemic.  A little report could be furnished to Members of the Oireachtas or there could be just a look back on the basis of what lessons can be learned, how the service, which is by and large an excellent service, can operate more efficiently and whether it can cover more sufficiently east Cork.  I am convinced that it is not covering the Youghal area.  It does not have sufficient resources to cover the Youghal area and ensure that people in Youghal or further afield are not forced to go to Midleton or onward to Cork, directly to an accident and emergency department.</p></speech>

The out-of-hours services provide a valuable service.  I do not disagree with the Deputy.  Another Deputy mentioned the issue of people going to emergency departments, EDs, as opposed to using their out-of-hours service.  That is a confidence issue and we want to build up confidence across the board, not just in SouthDoc, for people to value their services and use them.  We know that the impact on our EDs can be significant if people do not value those services.  That will be part of our constant review with them.  I assure the Deputy of that.</p></speech>

What is the status of the Department of Health's value for money review of the nursing homes support scheme?  That report has not been published yet.  When is it likely to be published and will it be out of date when it is published?  Covid certainly shone a light on deficiencies.  It is one thing paying for a service; it is another thing for that service to be adequate.  The lack of staff ratios is a case in point.  Do the witnesses have any update on when that review will be published or if it is being looked at again in advance of its publication because of Covid?</p></speech>

It started in 2018.  We know there has been a pandemic, but it is probably all the more important now than in 2018 not only that it is a value-for-money audit but also that it compares quality of service and value for money.</p>  <p>  Reference has been made to the 2016 audit, which showed significant weaknesses, and that has been stated each year.  What are the sanctions for non-compliance?  Has the HSE applied sanctions for entities that have been consistently non-compliant or are not addressing the issues?</p></speech>

I have a very short time.  I know sanctions would not be the first thing the HSE  would start out to do but they have to be available if there is non-compliance.

In the main, we have had a couple of organisations, one quite publicly of late, with which we have had significant difficulties.  We have issued notices but we have worked with them and their boards in general to turn that around because, clearly, a lot of these organisations provide very valuable services that we want to sustain.  However, we do issue notices under the service arrangement.</p></speech>

Kildare and west Wicklow, which would have a population of approximately 250,000 and a disproportionately young population with new needs, does not have a history of having organisations already in place because it is a growing area.  I note, however, that it got one of the lowest amounts of money in that distribution model.  Mayo, for example, got &euro;888,000, with Kildare and west Wicklow getting &euro;83,000.  There may well be a good reason for that.  I do not think there is any part of the country that could boast that it has an exceptional service because they will always be stretched.  However, is there an objective resource allocation model for the delivery of services?  When it came to, for example, the distribution of new staff around the time of the crash, where there was a relaxation of the embargo on recruitment of staff - for example, speech and language therapists and other therapists - Kildare in fact got a disproportionate number relative to the rest of the country because it was so deficient and the staff were distributed on an objective resource allocation model.  Is that the model or is it just that there is an offering coming from services?</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned Enable Ireland.  It would get a budget or money from us and would determine how it needs to use that in line with us.  However, if the Deputy is talking about a resource allocation model, we have looked at that in certain instances - for example, in some of our disability services and in our primary care services, looking at the population-specific needs.</p>  <p>  As for the realities she mentions, Kildare has come from a very low base in terms of disability funding and primary care funding.  We have been working with it, so it was one of the first pilot areas in terms of the in-school supports, etc.  We are working with it.</p>  <p>  As for disabilities, I emphasise that the funding of disability services is a huge challenge for us.  The demand far exceeds the available resource, in terms of both early intervention but, equally, the emergency supports we talked about and emergency placements.  To answer the Deputy's question briefly, we are looking at more population-specific resource allocation.  It is a model we are growing, although it is not there everywhere, and we are seeking to do more and more of that in line with Sl&aacute;intecare, particularly as we roll out our enhanced community care and health networks.</p></speech>

The document I am holding up, received under a freedom of information, FOI, request, indicates that the hand sanitiser referenced last week was only one of 30 in respect of which the HSE was engaging with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure compliance.  As members can see, almost all of the information is redacted.  I accept that some of the products listed may well have been donations and that some may have been cleared.  How many of the products purchased by the HSE have, to date, not been cleared for use and what is the total value in that regard?</p></speech>

Last week, we summarised on the issue around PPE.  There was a significant write-down, which is an accounting issue in terms of the realisable value at the year end, of the stock in total.  As part of that, there was an approximately &euro;64 million cost in regard to PPE suits.  The preference is always to have gowns applied in terms of PPE for clinical front-line staff.  When gowns became available at a later stage in the pandemic, we moved to the use of gowns.  That was part of the issue.  There were other issues, as just mentioned by the Deputy, in terms of the hand sanitisers based on a specification by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, which were recovered from the system and placed in quarantine.  There was a value associated with those as well.  As far as I understand it, there were issues with FFP2 masks as well.  They are the issues to which I can point straight away.  The write-down value in total, as stated last week, included the &euro;64 million in terms of suits.</p>  <p>  Mr. Mulvany might want to add to my response.</p></speech>

That covers all of the relevant hand sanitisers.  We also said that we were not aware of any other stocks.  Since then, we have become aware, as referenced by Mr. Reid, of 1 million FFP2 masks which an assessment indicates are not fit for purpose.  As I understand it, it has been agreed with the supplier that it will replace those 1 million masks.  We were not aware of that at the previous meeting, but I am happy to clarify that now.</p></speech>

We will revert with a summary table of PPE in stock that cannot be used.  Nobody should ever lose sight of the challenges to which our teams were working across the board and how this health system punched well above its weight, with the support of our international ambassadors, IDA Ireland and many agencies of the State.</p></speech>

Can Mr. Reid outline how many of those 151, assuming that is the correct figure, will be addressed by the end of this year and what proposals are in place to eliminate that list?</p></speech>

On the general question in terms of the impact of Covid, there is no doubt, particularly in terms of BreastCheck, that infection prevention control measures throughout Covid had significant impacts on our services across the board and still have to be done in a very different way.  Our teams in all of the cancer programmes are very focused on that as a priority but the Deputy is correct that cancer services, in particular BreastCheck, were impacted throughout Covid.</p></speech>

Why is it that in regard to orthopaedics we are in a position to manage numbers whereas in almost every other area the numbers increased exponentially?</p></speech>

We have, however, seen big impacts across the board.  I will ask my colleague to comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.169" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne O'Connor" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092300010#J00200"><p>The Deputy will recall that at the beginning of the pandemic, we stopped all scheduled activity other than time-dependent critical surgeries.  People were assessed on the basis of their clinical need.  We worked with the private hospitals in terms of referring the most urgent cases.  Our waiting lists did grow.  We saw a reduction in them last summer.  We managed to stabilise and start reducing those numbers.  The surge in infection at the beginning of this year saw us stop all of that activity again, so it is fair to say that all scheduled work has been hammered.  Many services have now re-initiated a lot of their activity.  We have seen considerable progress in some sites.  The national figures give an overall number.  When we look at the figures site by site, however, we can see that some sites are doing a considerable amount of scheduled activity.</p>  <p>  On cancer care, we have sought to prioritise.  Within those numbers, as with any waiting list, people are triaged and the most urgent will be seen first.  That is what we did during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  There are different responses in orthopaedics and other specialties.  The numbers are huge when one looks at the overall waiting list but the inpatient and day-case lists have been dealt with and in terms of stabilising, they have come back more quickly.  Our longest lists relate to outpatient activity.  We are coming up with different ways of working to address those lists.  We are currently in the process of agreeing some immediate actions around reducing some of those lists.  </p>  <p>  There has been a significant increase in our unscheduled care activity.  The committee will know that the emergency departments in many of our big hospitals are extremely busy.  That drives a lot of the activity in hospitals and means that we continually have to scale back scheduled care.  We are constantly trying to manage the balance between unscheduled care and the activity the Deputy is talking about.  We are seeking to do a lot of activity before the end of the year to make an impact.  Critically, we intend to do that before the serious winter flu season kicks in.</p></speech>

The waiting list for an oncology appointment has increased from 32,000 to 94,000 since 2019.  The waiting list for an audiology appointment has increased from 16,000 to over 19,000, with 7,000 people waiting more than a year.  Are we in a worse position than we may have been due to the historical deficiencies in all of these services?</p>  <p>  I will follow on from a response I received to an earlier question.  Does Mr. Reid accept that difficulties in terms of presentations to accident and emergency departments are accentuated by the fact that there are delays in all these other treatments?  People who should have been scheduled for other appointments are presenting to accident and emergency departments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021092300010#J00400"><p>I will take the three parts of the Deputy's question in the round.  Covid has had a severe impact on our health services overall in terms of waiting lists and delayed care.  We can see in our emergency departments that many people have delayed their care during Covid.  We can see that because of the volume of patients, the frailty of some of them and the severity of their illnesses.  As my colleague outlined, delaying non-urgent care was a part of our response to the pandemic.  Health services have certainly been hugely impacted over the past 18 months.</p>  <p>  We in the HSE and the Department are anxious to put together a kind of restoration approach, not only to deal with non-Covid illnesses but also to address the size of waiting lists.  We want to do that from a few perspectives.  We will, first of all, look at how we can increase capacity in the public system.  That will mean significant extra recruitment and resourcing, for which we have funding.  We have approximately 10,500 extra resources compared with January 2020.  We have approximately 4,500 extra resources for 2021.  We will probably add another 3,000 before the end of this year.  On top of that, we have approximately 3,200 people working on our testing and tracing and vaccination programmes as agency staff who we want to convert to full-time employment.  We have funding for resourcing.</p>  <p>  This will be a significant challenge for the health service as we move to an approach that looks at increased public capacity.  Increased utilisation of private capacity is also part of our plan.  We are also examining a completely new way of delivering many of our services, using many new technologies and medical supports.  We are going to take a comprehensive approach but it will be a massive challenge.</p></speech>

In 2014, as I understand it, there was recognition that such a system was needed.  A decision was made to go ahead with it.  In 2017, as I understand it, SAP was appointed.  I noted Mr. Reid's earlier response on the matter.  My understanding is that it has now entered design stage, or that was the stage it was at a week or two ago.  Phase 1 of the project was to be completed by May 2024.  There has been a delay of 12 months, obviously, and the Department and the HSE have said that is due to Covid-19.  Phase 2 of the new system is to be completed in March 2025.  I wish to ask a couple of questions in that regard.  Assuming those targets are met, that is a full nine years after the recognition of the need for such a system and the decision to go ahead with it.  Will the whole system be out of date?  Mr. Reid, in reply to an earlier question, mentioned that the company concerned now appears to be out of the frame and a new company is being brought in.  Does that mean we will go back at the starting blocks?  If the first company has dropped out, is there a liability in terms of payment?  How much in payments has that company already received?</p></speech>

The SAP S/4HANA platform was procured in the middle of 2017.  It will definitely not be out of date because part of the overall process is ongoing upgrades of the system.  That is one of the reasons we would go with a first-tier company such as SAP.</p>  <p>  As we said in the briefing, the timeline for getting to 80% of the publicly-funded healthcare system, including voluntary organisations, by quarter 1 2024 has been pushed back by Covid and the cyberattack to quarter 1 2025.  The current systems integrator, as I have said, has indicated commercial issues about living within the fixed price contract.  One of the options may be, as the Chairman indicated, that we will have to secure a different company.  I will have to come back to the Chairman with the exact figure for the payments that have been paid to date.  The contract is fixed price, as I said, but it is also staged and the company is only paid for deliverables on specific milestones.</p></speech>

We are obviously exploring options and this is a commercially sensitive matter.  In the event that we need to get a new company, we will have that design and will not be restarting the design process.  That is partly why we suspended the technical part of the build, albeit the overall project completes, because we are seeking to ensure we are not accruing costs when there is a potential that we will have to get a different external systems integrator.  We will take the design we have already and we will ask an alternative company to build it for us.</p></speech>

When will we see the report regarding progress and final costs for the children's hospital?  We have been pursuing this matter for a considerable period.  The hospital board told us a long time ago that the report had gone to the Department.  The Department has had a considerable period to look at it.  We are anxious to know about the progress.  This is the biggest capital project undertaken by the State and the taxpayer is digging deep for it.  We all want to see the children's hospital in place.  The committee has been following this closely.  Members did a site visit before the summer recess and followed it during the recess.  When will the report be available to the committee?  We are answerable to the public, as is Mr. Colman.  When will we see it?</p></speech>

I have spoken to people at different levels of the ambulance services.  The headline in my local newspaper two weeks ago said "No Ambulance Help 'A Disgrace'".  Sometimes headlines are not accurate, but on this occasion, it is.  I could rattle off cases where ambulances have been deployed and diverted but time does not allow it.</p>  <p>  One case involved a person in part of north Kildare about 50 km or 55 km from Portlaoise hospital.  A horse fell on top of this person and he was seriously injured with internal bleeding and all of that.  The ambulance came to within 2 km of him but was then stood down and turned back.  It was sent over to Athy to deal with a what they were told was an emergency.  The crew diverted but it was not an emergency.  Whoever made the call in used words that gave the impression to the person dispatching in the control centre that it was.  Meanwhile, another ambulance chased the original call for the emergency and took longer. </p>  <p>  There was also an example of an elderly person who waited more than two hours for an ambulance in Clonaslee.  There are other examples of people waiting for ambulances that did not show up.  The newspaper headline referred to a case where an ambulance did not show up and the people on-site were told not to move the patient.  It was a no-show.  There are no-shows and late shows.</p>  <p>  Insofar as I can ascertain, dynamic deployment can only work if there are huge resources and increased numbers of ambulances and staff.  I understand the problem at the moment is the service has between 20% and 25% fewer resources in terms of personnel and ambulances than it needs.  In Mr. Reid's estimation, is the capacity of the service 20% to 25% below what is required?</p></speech>

They have been stretched through their involvement in resourcing and setting up testing and tracing programmes.  They have been involved in vaccination programmes.  Their responsiveness in terms of nursing homes throughout Covid has drawn hugely from their resources and their responsiveness in keeping people at home and out of hospitals to keep them protected has severely stressed the service in the past year.</p>  <p>  Specifically on resourcing, we have a recruitment resourcing budget for this year.  A number of graduates will be emerging later this year and will be deployed.  The service has a continued recruitment budget and allocation.  I accept it has been particularly stretched throughout Covid and more resourcing is required for it.</p></speech>

I am aware there are many graduates coming on and I welcome that.  Does Mr. Reid accept the service is 20% to 25% below capacity in terms of personnel and vehicles?  Could I have a "Yes" or "No", please?</p></speech>

At any one time, we have between 160 and 180 ambulances on the road.  We estimate we need about 250 ambulances.  Every ambulance takes 12 staff.  From 2015, we have grown from 1,500 to 2,000 staff.  We intend to grow that figure.  It is a multi-year plan.  We agree that the service is significantly under-resourced.  To compare it with Scotland, for example, the latter has approximately 5,000 staff for a similar population and geography.  We are working on a multi-year plan to increase capacity and what the Deputy described is a symptom of demand outstripping available capacity, not dissimilar to what we see in emergency departments, etc.  The ambulance is part of our unscheduled care pathway and is experiencing the same pressures.  The Chairman is right.  We need to grow the resource and we are planning to do so.</p></speech>

On page 146, according to note 6, there has been an increase in agency staff.  Is that more staff or higher salaries with the same staff?</p></speech>

It is a combination of increased costs and, no doubt, staff.  We have had significantly increased agency staff as part of the testing and tracing programme and the vaccination programme.  Ultimately, it is a combination.  It has not risen hugely as a total percentage of our pay bill.  Mr. Mulvany may wish to add to that.</p></speech>

The positive news is that the overall percentage is relatively stable.  In particular with medical, where the figure was nearly 9% in 2019, which is worryingly high, that has fallen back to 8.3% of our overall medical pay bill.  That is a positive move but there is still a concern that medical is so high.</p></speech>

We have a significant budget this year, as I mentioned.  We have about 4,400 staff already recruited.  There are likely to be another 3,000 staff recruited before the end of the year.  We are making submissions to continue that funding into next year as well.  It is the first time in many years.  Last year was the biggest year for our recruitment in many years and this year will be the same.  A significant proportion of those have, quite rightly, come from nursing on the front line and consultants.  These are net increases.  On top of those recruitment numbers, we recruit about 8,000 staff every year just to stand still.  The number I have given of 7,000 before year end is on top of recruitment we must do just to stand still in terms of churn.</p></speech>

I understand there were pressures but what I am hearing from Mr. Reid is it seems that despite the money provided, which itself seems to have been well in excess of that in other countries <i>per capita</i>, there were no control measures in place.  All caution was thrown to the wind.  I would have thought the object was to ensure we have systems in place for when a crisis hits us.  I thought the objective was to ensure we have institutional capacity, particularly in relation to procurement, to be able to deal with substantial shocks such as Covid.  As I said, spending &euro;81 million on 2,200 ventilators that were of no use whatever is an extraordinary and abject failure on the part of the HSE and its procurement department.  I cannot see how Mr. Reid can defend it in any way.  I fully understand that people will get into dire straits but not when their day-to-day job is procurement.</p></speech>

We fully respect that role.  However, I will make a few comments.  First of all, no, we do not throw caution to the wind and, no, we did not blow any funds.  What we did do is operate in an environment that certainly was more high-risk.  This is not just for Ireland.  EU-approved procurement rules were relaxed on the basis of the pandemic.  There was a world demand in excess of supply.  If members look beyond our country, they will see export bans were implemented by many providers of PPE and ventilators across the world.

There was also worldwide reporting of fraud in this area, with PPE being paid for but not being provided, substandard PPE and PPE that was not PPE.  That was reported worldwide.  I am very concerned that at no point is Mr. Reid taking on board what we could have learned, should have learned and did not learn.  I appreciate he has said he understands my position as a member of this committee.  I understand his position as the head of the HSE.  What the public want is accountability.

Microsoft has a special security arrangement for Windows 7 and there is a replacement programme for computers.  I would have thought the cyberattack was in the emergency or urgent category, given what it has caused in disruption of services and the potential cost in lives.  Where are we with that replacement programme to ensure we no longer rely on any device running Windows 7?  What is the timeline on that?  Are we paying Microsoft as well for that special arrangement?</p></speech>

She is right that Windows 7 is a real cause of concern for us in terms of its deployment.  There are about 30,000 units across the HSE running Windows 7.  I will break them into a few categories.  About 12,000 of those are related to our national integrated medical imaging system, NIMIS.  Unfortunately, we need to replace NIMIS and, certainly, significantly upgrade before we can take those out of it.  There are another 11,500 units which will be taken out by the end of this year as part of the replacement.  There are about another 6,400 units which are currently being deployed at the minute and people are migrating some of their own software from the Windows 7 version across to laptops.</p> <p>In 2019, there were 46,000 units on Windows 7 and 12,000 on Windows 10.  In 2021, it is now 30,000 on Windows 7, a reduction of 16,000, and 30,000 on Windows 10.  That replacement can be-----</p></speech>

How much is being paid for this special arrangement?  I ask Mr. Reid to provide a timeline for every member of staff being moved onto a system that is properly secure, such as Windows 10 or another system that is more modern than Windows 7.  He accepted it is a risk.  Was it not on a risk register?  It is not like it was not known that these licences were not going to provide the protection that is required.  Was that on a risk register in advance of the cyberattack?  Was there a programme to phase them out in advance of the attack?  I know that has probably been accelerated but why did the HSE get itself into this position?</p></speech>

It was completely separate from Windows 7.  However, I fully accept that Windows 7 is an exposure for us.  The ultimate target date, as I mentioned, is for the replacement of the approximately 12,000 national incident management system, NIMS, units and that will be in 2022.  We expect to have the rest of them out in a much shorter period.  We can provide the committee an update note on that and on the support arrangement with Microsoft.</p></speech>

Mr. Reid said he had erred on the side of protecting the public and that is fine; we accept that.  However, in the context of purchasing products not cleared for use by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, was he not doing the opposite with substandard ventilators, masks and sanitisers and all of that?</p>  <p>  The data to which I referred came from a pivot table outlining details of supplies and suppliers, etc.  Is Mr. Reid seriously claiming there was not a column providing the value of those products?</p>  <p>  There are currently more than 900,000 people on waiting lists.  Back in January 2020, there were 870,000 people on them.  Covid did not cause the waiting lists; they were there long before it came along.  Does Mr. Reid expect that at this rate, given that referrals were not happening during the pandemic and that we are now coming out of it and everything is opening up again, the total number on waiting lists will exceed 1 million people by December or shortly thereafter?</p></speech>

We are finalising a suite of initiatives between the Department, the Minister and the board of the HSE that will target an approach in the very difficult period through winter to ensure that is not what happens.  As Ms O'Connor stated, we are addressing some of the inpatient, outpatient and day-case waiting lists and, indeed, scopes that need to be addressed between now and year end.</p></speech>

Can Mr. Reid accept, in all fairness, that people are asking where the heck the money is going?  These waiting lists show that it is certainly not going directly to the patients.

We hope that the total will not rise to 1 million but the reality is that we are actually dealing with cases and most sites are now managing what is coming at them.  They are not yet able to make a dent in the backlog but some sites are starting to get there.  As I stated, we are seeing an improvement on some sites now but clearly it is a big mountain to climb.  The waiting lists only tell one part of the story.  The reality is that we do a huge amount of scheduled care work every day on all of our hospital sites and some of our hospitals only do that.  There is very significant investment going into scheduled care.  When one looks at the level of activity that goes on, that is where the money is going, and it is significant.  The waiting list does not tell the story about the activity that is happening.  Our performance reports tell that story in terms of the number of people who are being seen every day around the country.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Cullinane, who is the Sinn F&eacute;in health spokesperson, has indicated that there are 652,244 people waiting to see a consultant, of whom 183,491 have been waiting more than 18 months and 85,950 are children, with 29,271 of those children waiting more than 18 months.

They come from the service plan that was agreed before this year.  We then had the surge from January to March of this year and its impact.  We then moved straight into the cyberattack and we are still recovering from that.  As regards confidence, the reality is that many things have happened.  Some of those initiatives have been deferred.  However, when one looks at what has been delivered, in line with the funding that has been made available, we made very considerable inroads on several initiatives, particularly in the context of what has already been described several times this morning.</p></speech>

As Ms O'Connor stated, I think everybody would acknowledge that the impacts on the health system in the past 18 months have been severe.  However, those problems were legacy issues that we are going to approach.</p>  <p>  As regards confidence in the health service, during Covid we have tracked some of this in terms of the health service response to Covid overall.  That showed that public trust and confidence in the health service strengthened.  I fully accept the challenges we face are momentous but the commitment from the HSE and from the funding we have received this year is setting out to address those challenges.</p></speech>

I refer to the speed and execution of capital projects.  I welcome that funding of &euro;18.4 million was approved for an extension to the emergency department of Mayo University Hospital.</p> <p>I ask that HSE estates is adequately resourced to deliver on this project with speed.  The hospital is crying out for this extension.  It was built to cater for over 20,000 patients and that figure now exceeds 40,000 annually.  I would really appreciate if Mr. Reid could work with his team to see how, after funding has been allocated, we can work through the process of procurement, tender and construction.  I look forward to his engagement on this.  If he could send me a note, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

I appreciate there are many frustrations from everybody's perspective with capital projects, but in fairness to our HSE estates team it has a strong track record of delivering big strategic projects in-house, particularly this year with the national forensic mental hospital and the national rehabilitation hospital.  I appreciate the frustrations around the procurement and planning issues that emerge.  We can give a summary note on the status.</p></speech>

Replies to parliamentary questions show that agency staff cost about &euro;60 more per shift.  I accept there are always recruitment problems and difficulties.  Is the HSE making a conscious effort to move away from the dependency on agency staff?  Every day, the HSE spends &euro;1 million on agency staff internally.  That is not counting the section 38 organisations and all the other bodies that are also contracted.</p></speech>

It went from 5.8% to 6.1%.  Our intention is to build a sustainable workforce and we have funding from the Government to do that and to continue it into next year.  Our primary focus is a sustainable in-house workforce.  However, there are requirements and needs for agency staff to supplement our requirements, particularly, looking at this year, in parts of the testing and tracing programme, which we know will last for a period of time, and the vaccination programme in some cases too.  Agency staff will be a feature but our primary focus is to recruit in-house.</p></speech>

Advanced paramedics and other highly trained staff were transferred to work in swabbing and test and trace during the pandemic.  That was understandable in the early days.  We have a capacity issue in the ambulance service, as Mr. Reid and his operations managers agree.  It is a fact of life and there are moves afoot to change that.  However, there are still highly trained ambulance personnel who have been deployed on test and trace and swabbing.  How many are doing this?  When will they move back?  I stress the importance of moving these people back into the ambulance service.  I am sure Mr. Reid knows this.  It is really important that we get all hands to the wheel to improve capacity in the ambulance services.  How many are there?  When will we see them all back?  That needs to happen soon.</p></speech>

Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and other attendees.  They should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for members' full co-operation in this.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist and assistant secretary.</p> <p>  I know everybody has heard the notice on privilege for witnesses a million times but I must go through it again.  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  The Minister is in the precincts of Leinster House so he is covered by privilege, but he is reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that he should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if his statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, he will be directed to discontinue his remarks.</p> <p>  Members of the committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister and invite him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I will make a short opening statement and I look forward to the questions from members of the committee.</p> <p>  Looking at where we are now, this week marked a critical moment in our public and economic health, with many people returning to their workplaces for the first time in a year and a half.  In about a month from now, if everything goes according to plan, almost all of the remaining public health restrictions will be lifted.  We can, therefore, be increasingly confident that, absent a vaccine-resistant variant emerging, the worst of the pandemic may well be behind us.  This is very important.  The past 18 months have been unbelievably difficult for all.  The disruption to family life, the pain of losing loved ones and health issues and the impact of successive, but necessary, public health restrictions hindered our normal economic and social life in an unprecedented and highly intrusive way.  Throughout the pandemic it has been clear to me that the Irish people have responded with resilience.  Ordinary people, business owners and especially our front-line workers have risen to the challenge in an extraordinary way.  In particular, I acknowledge all those who were part of the vaccination programme.  Let us be clear &ndash; the programme has been one of the most successful in the world.  We owe them a huge debt of gratitude.</p> <p>  For the Government, it has been our job to match the success of the vaccination programme with an economic approach that has protected incomes, supported business and invested in the health service.  I will make the case to the committee this afternoon that we have succeeded in doing that.  To date, the Government has made a total of &euro;48 billion available to mitigate the worst impacts of the pandemic.  All of our budgetary tools have been utilised, including direct public expenditure, tax policy and below the line supports such as credit guarantees.  For example, more than &euro;17 billion has been spent on the three main income and business support schemes, the pandemic unemployment payment, the employment wage subsidy scheme and the Covid restrictions support scheme.  These schemes worked.  The success of these and other schemes is clear from official data.  Most economic indicators are now moving in the right direction and, most important, people are returning to their jobs.  For example, there were more than 480,000 of our fellow citizens on the pandemic unemployment payment in February, while today that figure is closer to 110,000.</p> <p>  As we enter the next stage of the pandemic, and I hope the next phase is the final one, we must move on to the next stage of our policy response.  The counter-cyclical budgetary stance has served us well over the past 18 months.  Such an approach should continue to serve us well in the recovery.</p><p>With all economic indicators suggesting a strong recovery is in prospect, we need to be careful we do not add fuel to the fire by maintaining current expenditure, which would be at an unprecedented and unsustainably high level.  This is particularly important given potential trends in inflation.  Accordingly, temporary supports such as the pandemic unemployment payment are being phased out in a careful way.  Similarly, employer supports such as the Covid restrictions support scheme will also come to a natural end.</p><p> While the pace of the recovery has been quicker than many expected, I fully recognise that some businesses and employees will continue to need support.  This is why the Government has committed to maintaining the employment wage subsidy scheme until at least the end of the year, but this has not come cheaply.</p><p> Over the summer, we estimated a budget deficit of around &euro;20 billion for the year.  During the pandemic, borrowing costs were kept to a minimum as central banks in all major economies purchased government bonds.  This looks set to continue for the next few months but, thereafter, we can expect a change to how central banks engage in financial markets.  We can expect, over time, a gradual change in borrowing costs and gradual renormalisation.  Only time will tell how different the new norm will be from the old, but it will be very different from where we are today.  This highlights the importance of policy supporting a credible path towards fiscal sustainability, as reflected in the target of borrowing only for capital investment from 2023.</p><p> Having said that, I believe there are genuine challenges that need to be addressed.  Additional public expenditure will be required to meet them.  This is particularly true in respect of capital infrastructure.  The forthcoming national development plan will lay out a multi-year plan for a decade, outlining expenditure of over &euro;136 billion.</p><p> Borrowing to fund investment that raises long-term productivity which changes our future is the right thing to do, but borrowing for day-to-day expenditure is not.  The latter runs the risk of changing the living standards of future generations, who have to pay for it.  We are determined to minimise the debt-service burden on our children.  However, the next generation will and must benefit from an improved stock of infrastructure.  This is why the Government will continue to borrow for capital investment from 2023 onwards.</p><p> Let me elaborate on public debt.  It is approaching a quarter of a trillion euro.  To express it more meaningfully, this is the equivalent of around &euro;50,000 per person, a figure among the highest in the developed world.  At some point, the debt will either have to be paid back or, more likely, rolled over.  What is likely is that it will be rolled over to a higher interest rate because we cannot expect the exceptionally low interest rates of today to last forever, nor can we base a strategy on such an expectation.  We need to be aware of our obligation towards future generations.  This is particularly true given our ageing population and the impending transformation of the economy away from fossil fuels.</p><p> The budgetary strategy outlined in the summer economic statement tries to get the balance right, with a total budget package of &euro;4.7 billion.  On the expenditure side, core expenditure will increase by &euro;4.2 billion, including &euro;1 billion for entirely new measures.  The remaining &euro;3.2 billion will allow for demographic pressures and deal with any changes to public pay.  There will be a significant increase in capital expenditure of some &euro;1.1 billion.</p><p> A further &euro;500 million will be focused on some tax measures, and these will be outlined on budget day.  The summer economic statement outlines how, over the next two budgets, temporary Covid-related spending measures will be phased out.  A pathway will be provided to meet core objectives set out in the programme for Government.</p><p> In practical terms, this means the implementation of an expenditure rule whereby total expenditure is fixed at just over 5% growth per year.  This is in line with the trend growth rate of the economy.  The rationale for this approach is to ensure that temporary or windfall revenues are not used to finance permanent changes.</p><p> For next year, an expenditure ceiling of &euro;88.2 billion has been fixed.  A key point to note here is that the summer economic statement committed to decoupling expenditure from tax revenues that could be temporary, such as lower than assumed or higher than assumed tax revenues.</p><p> Let me be clear that managing the public finances involves trade-offs.  When we consider the challenges and the options for new expenditure, we see there are only three options: raising taxes, increasing borrowing and reducing expenditure in other areas.  Budget 2022 will aim to strike the right balance between these choices.</p><p> In conclusion, as is always the case in the run-up to any budget day, there will be decisions, including difficult ones, that need to be taken, but that is the role of the Government.  We will take decisions against the background of improving economic health.  I look forward to being able to discuss some of these issues with the committee this afternoon.</p></speech>

I compliment the Government on its handling of the Covid era.  It is not all over yet but it was very competently handled by the Government.  We have to be grateful for the fact that good management made it possible to be able to assist or borrow to the extent that we did over the period in question.  We must recognise that not all economies supported their citizens to the same extent as ours.  For example, some countries had no emergency payments at all, with no payments for the private sector, which was disadvantaged.</p> <p>  While we provided supports, the challenges have not gone away.  I agree entirely that it is necessary to improve public infrastructure to provide the services required for future generations.  We must realise our population has increased fairly dramatically since the 1950s and it is now incumbent on everybody to provide services for the much larger population, which is to increase in the future.  Housing, health, education and, more lately, climate are the challenges that have to be addressed.  I strongly support work in this regard.  It will be a difficult time because there are competing demands in the sense of keeping the economy on the straight and narrow path while addressing the challenges and ensuring our borrowing to make economic progress is manageable.  The Minister said the borrowing to date is still within manageable proportions and that we do have an economy that is sufficiently capable and robust to come through at the end of the day.</p> <p>  The other point that is worth mentioning is that Covid did not come alone; it came in the immediate aftermath of the financial crash.  Many people and businesses affected negatively by the financial crash still have not recovered.  On top of this, we had Covid.  It is worth commenting on the fact that we had the two challenges one after the other in rapid succession.  Due to careful management, it has been possible to come through the storm to date relative easily.</p> <p>  I have two or three questions.</p><p>On private savings, which is a considerable amount, how does the Minister see that affecting our economic performance into the future?  It could well contribute to further inflation if not handled properly or it could be of benefit in various ways.  How does the Minister see that unfolding and will be capitalised on to the benefit of the country at large?  On the 12.5% corporation tax, some commentators have already pencilled the possibility of a &euro;3.5 billion negative impact.  I am not too sure about that.  I think there is scope there.  We had discussions on this in the past few days with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  The resilience of Irish business and the corporate sector in this country is still fairly solid and it may well be possible, in my humble opinion, to manage around it rather than be overwhelmed by it.  </p></speech>

I will deal with each of them in turn.  On the role of private savings within our economy, it is the case that those private savings are playing a role in the purchase of homes and decisions around the purchase of large items.  We may well see that come through in, for example, the VAT returns and the figures we have in regard to the purchase of vehicles.  Overall, private savings are playing a big role in the successful reopening of our domestic economy.  One of the reasons we are seeing a rapid fall in the pandemic unemployment payment is the reopening more quickly of domestic enterprises, with a higher level of demand than they may have anticipated.  Private savings are clearly playing a role in driving that consumption.  There is benefit in the ability of those savings to play a role in the growth of domestic economy, which would not be as touched by the very large multinational presence we have here, but we need to be alert to what this could mean for inflationary trends in the future and to monitor that carefully.</p> <p>  On corporate tax receipts, the monitoring and modelling that we have done of corporate tax receipts points to, over time, a loss of up to &euro;2 billion in annual corporate tax revenue.  It is worth saying that for some years that might not result in a direct fall, but in the rate of growth being less than that which has happened in our recent history.  This is the reason it is so important we reduce our reliance on borrowing to fund day-to-day spending and get to a point where the taxes we are collecting are paying for the public services we have at the moment.  It is also the reason changes in carbon tax, which are difficult and I know can be a cause of challenge for many, are still so important in broadening our tax base.  I believe that even with the change that may happen with our corporate tax revenue, we have the ability to get the health of our public finances to a safer place, particularly over the next two years.  I remain confident that the Irish economy will be competitive, resilient and able to retain and grow jobs into the future.  </p></speech>

Our ability to do that is reflected in the plan we have published for our public finances.  We are not looking to eliminate all of our borrowing in a single year.  Where we do reduce borrowing, particularly from 2023 onwards, the aim is to get to a point where at least some of our capital expenditure can be funded by tax revenue that we are collecting.  We have the ability to continue to make progress on the challenges and difficulties.  The publication of the national development plan in the next number of weeks will outline how we will invest in the future.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#C00800"><p>I welcome the Minister to the committee.  I want to pick up on the points he made in regard to next year's budget.  In his opening statement, the Minister said that the expenditure ceiling would be fixed at &euro;88.2 billion.  This is consistent with what was spelled out in the summer economic statement such that regardless of how well the economy does, or tax fluctuation, the expenditure ceiling is confirmed and will not be changed.  I want to tease that out with the Minister.</p> <p>  As we know, the budgetary package outlined in the economic statement allowed for &euro;4.7 billion overall, &euro;3.2 billion of which is already allocated or earmarked, with &euro;1.5 billion being discretionary.  Can the Minister confirm that that is the package regardless of what happens in terms of tax buoyancy in the next period unless it is funded by tax increases?  Revenue is outperforming by about 5.4%.  When you strip out corporation tax, it is still outperforming by 3.7%.  Am I correct that the point the Minister is making is that regardless of that the expenditure limit is the expenditure limit, the package is the package and he will not be deviating from that?  The recovery scenario outlined by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council also suggested revenue for next year would be about &euro;4.2 billion higher than was outlined in the summer economic statement.  Is it the case that regardless of that materialising the plan is to stick with the figures outlined?  I would appreciate it if the Minister could come back to me on that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#C00900"><p>I will be sticking to the figures outlined in the summer economic statement.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's commentary of the budget package and the parameters that we outlined can be described as cautious.  As we move into, and conclude, the Estimates process, it is my absolute aim that we would stay in line with the parameters we outlined before the summer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#C01000"><p>Okay.  Given there have been changes in tax revenue and that the economic growth we are seeing is above what was projected in the summer economic statement, can the Minister outline the revised projections for the deficit in tax revenue this year and next year as a result of the tax buoyancy and higher than expected economic growth such that the committee is fully apprised of the detail?  The Minister outlined the budgetary package of &euro;1.5 billion discretionary, &euro;500 million of which is for tax cuts.  He also mentioned the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  It has criticised these commitments and the fact that core expenditure rules permit these tax promises despite that they are permanent measures in nature.  I am not sure if the Minister is aware of this but earlier today, in the D&aacute;il, the T&aacute;naiste made a clear commitment in terms of indexation on taxation.  He went as far as explaining how it works and said that it was not tax cuts.  I will not go into that debate, but there is a commitment to make sure that there will be no additional burden from tax as a result of wage increases.</p><p>We see from the Central Bank's quarterly bulletin that it estimates compensation per employee will rise by 4.9%.  If the Minister is to index bands and credits at that rate, it will cost &euro;681 million.  How is the Minister going to pay for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.316" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  We have not revised the economic forecasts we have as of today.  In the run-up to the budget, we will make a final run-through of our economic and tax revenue forecasts for this year and next year.  On other occasions, particularly when our September tax receipts and fiscal monitor are complete, I have done a press conference to indicate where I believe our tax revenue is likely to come in for the year and address whether it will have any impact for the following year.  I will probably do that again but I am not going to do it until the September tax figures come in and we are still a few days away from that.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a point about the tax package and the difference between indexation and a tax cut.  I would make the point, as the T&aacute;naiste did, that we are trying to keep as much of the wage growth that workers may gain by being able to go back to work or stay in a job.  We are trying to protect as much of that as we can from the increased level of taxation that would be caused by their movement going through the personal tax brackets.  The total size of the package will be consistent with the parameters we outlined in the summer economic statement.  They are the contours within which the budget will be put together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#D00300"><p>The T&aacute;naiste was clear and at pains to point out the intention to protect people's wage growth from additional tax.  The Minister has said the Government wants to do that as much as possible, which is different to what the T&aacute;naiste said.  It is also completely different from the commitment in the programme for Government which promised an index link to earnings growth.  Given the fact that would cost &euro;681 million, which is close to half of all the allocation that is available, and given the fact we have crises in health, housing, the cost of living and the cost of energy, is the Minister seriously still talking about that type of package for wage growth?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.318" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#D00400"><p>We will lay it out on budget day.  We will lay out both the scale of it and how it will be funded.  The Deputy is making the point that there are great challenges at the moment and challenges relating to the cost of living are building.  I would, therefore, have thought he would welcome a package that tries to protect the take-home pay of workers, particularly low income workers, who might be experiencing increased levels of taxation at a point when they are going back to work.  If we are acknowledging that pressures on the cost of living are building, surely measures that try to preserve the take-home pay of workers could contribute to dealing with those challenges that are building in the cost of living.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#D00500"><p>We will not go into that debate.  The Minister and others like him, people who are earning salaries of &euro;180,000, will also benefit from this tax cut.  It is not directed only at people who are going back to work.  It is all about priorities.  The Minister has his priorities.  My priorities are to make the investment in capital infrastructure in terms of housing, to make sure we recruit enough nurses and doctors to deal with the hospital crisis and to make sure we reduce the cost of living through reducing rents and the cost of childcare.  The Minister has a different suite of policies and that is fine.  We will go to the electorate and ask them to decide.</p> <p>  I will turn to the budget contingency fund.  We know the figures that have been outlined.  We must consider where we are at in terms of the recovery and the opening up of the economy.  There is &euro;2.8 billion in an unidentified reserve fund for Covid-19 measures, possibly including the extension of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which should be extended at least into the first quarter of next year.  Does the Minister believe that number is on the high side, given the new information we have?  Is he aware that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, is hinting that some of that money will not be drawn down in 2022?</p></speech>

The Deputy is making the point, and I accept it, that rising costs with regard to energy are making things even more difficult, after we have already experienced a period of great difficulty.  With that in mind, I would have thought the Deputy could see the value in measures that try to preserve the take-home pay of our workers.  We will have that debate at another point.</p> <p>  I have heard some commentary that not all of the contingency fund may be drawn down next year.  I have heard some of the views of IFAC on that point.  One of the experiences I have had from using these contingency funds and putting them together is that draw down can at times come from unexpected sources.  I have the experience of where we were with the contingency fund last year.  We announced two different funds last October.  I never thought I would be in a situation where both of them would be used.  If they were used, I never thought that either of them would be fully drawn down.  However, I found myself in a position whereby the funds were nearly entirely used by the summer.  If there is an opportunity that we do not have to allocate so much funding into these contingency funds, we will certainly look at that but it is something about which I am going to be cautious.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#D00900"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for coming in to speak with us.  I raise the issue of VRT on new and imported fossil fuel vehicles, including so-called hybrid vehicles.  I raise the matter because, as the Minister knows, we have very ambitious climate action targets.  Transport represents 20% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions and private cars represent the majority of emissions from that sector.  We need to follow the example of Norway and significantly increase taxation on the purchase and importation of fossil fuel vehicles.  The reason to do that is to prevent a lock-in of transport emissions over the next 15 years.  We have to do that quickly, as soon as possible.  It is better to do it sooner rather than later.  There are clear and serious climate reasons to do so.</p> <p>  We have had a significant build-up of household savings during the pandemic, as the Minister knows and as others have mentioned.  From a balance of payments perspective, the purchase of new vehicles involves a lot of money leaving the State, compared to other, more labour-intensive household spending items such as home renovation.  Our taxation system should reflect that.  The average lifetime of a vehicle is approximately 15 years so new fossil fuel cars will be part of the national fleet for a long time.  It is appropriate to give an increased price signal to reflect our climate commitments.  </p> <p>  While electric vehicles are getting cheaper, there is not yet cost parity between fossil fuel vehicles and fully electric vehicles.  We can use VRT increases on fossil fuel vehicles to achieve cost parity in the next year, as has been done in Norway.  As most people know, Norway has one of the best take-ups of electric vehicles in the world.  Significantly raising VRT on fossil fuel vehicles would be a progressive taxation.  It would target taxation at those who are wealthy enough to purchase a new vehicle.  The Minister said to me in a meeting a few months ago that the taxation system changed in January, when we brought in the new worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure, WLTP, emissions rating for VRT.  The information I have is that the top selling new car in Ireland is a fossil fuel sports utility vehicle.  It is clear to me that further market signals are needed.</p> <p>  Raising VRT for fossil fuel vehicles is also necessary to balance out the loss to the Exchequer from the increased take-up of zero-emission vehicles which attract a lower tax.  While stability in taxation policy is desirable, our significant climate action agenda means it is inevitable that we will need to frequently change VRT and, indeed, motor tax to ensure the State's income stream is protected.  I ask the Minister to consider a significant increase in the VRT charged on fossil fuel vehicles.</p><p>He should do so as a prudent move to ensure the sustainability of the Exchequer as well as of future greenhouse gas emissions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#E00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for the points he has made.  He acknowledged, but I wish to develop a little more, the really big changes we made in respect of motor taxation last year, that is, the change in motor tax and the very significant decision we made with the introduction of the worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure, WLTP, using which we correlated the tax paid on a car with the impact it has on the environment.  The Deputy may be aware that we are already seeing clear signals that the changes we made last year are having a contributory effect in the change in purchasing patterns for new vehicles.  What we have seen up to this point in the year is already a clear shift in purchase trends toward lower emissions vehicles.  To give an example, in 2020 the average WLTP figure was 135.6 g of CO2 per kilometre.  It now stands at 122.6 g.  That is a real sign of change.  I will not say for a moment that the changes we made in the Finance Act last year are the sole reason for that, but they are part of the reason.  So far this year, we have seen up to the end of July a 33% increase in the purchase of electric vehicles and hybrids.  To put that in context, the figure for 2020 was 20%, while in 2019 it was 13%.  The rate of increase is accelerating before we make any change at all.</p> <p>  In the budget last year we changed the taxation of hybrids, recognising that due to the fossil fuel component of some engines the environmental or climate impact of some hybrids is not as positive as may have previously been understood.  We changed some of our tax policy to capture and reflect that.</p> <p>  As regards further changes, as the Deputy stated, having already brought in a sweeping set of changes, I would normally be careful not to follow that with another set of changes only a year later, but I am aware of the importance of the points the Deputy is making.  I am aware of the existential nature of the climate crisis that we are, for now, trying to mitigate and I will certainly consider the points the Deputy is making.  I ask him to be aware that this is in the aftermath of big changes already made that appear to be having a role in changing purchase patterns.  Further changes have to be considered in light of what we have just done and in the context of a car market and car purchases that have had an incredibly volatile 18 months.  We will certainly consider the point the Deputy has made but I ask him to be aware of those matters.</p></speech>

I really appreciate his answer.  He is correct that we are seeing an effect from the changes brought in last year.  My fear is that we are not bringing about change quickly enough.  The cars sold in 2021 or 2022 will still be around in 2030, by which stage, obviously, the challenge is to reduce emissions across all sectors by approximately 51%.  Transport will probably have to do more than other sectors, so taxation policy should join with that target.  I know that every effort is being made to ensure it does, but we have to be absolutely confident that we are not creating a problem for ourselves in eight or nine years' time.</p> <p>  The second point I mentioned, of which I know the Minister is abundantly aware, is the wall of cash that is there.  We do not want the personal savings that have built up in the past 18 months during the pandemic to leave the country.  There are much better uses for that money, particularly in the area of retrofit and so on.  I will leave it at that.  I would appreciate hearing the response of the Minister.</p></speech>

I ask him again to be aware, as I know he will, of the need to consider all these matters in the round.  Any further decision we make relating to the taxation of the purchase or use of cars will be made in the context of the commitment we have to increasing carbon taxation.  We are one of the very few Governments of which I am aware that have made the commitment to change the price of carbon.  It is a really significant commitment to make and it is one in which I strongly believe.  I know it is difficult but we have to change the use of carbon. Maintaining support for that and being able to deliver it year by year is a vital way in which we respond to the challenge the Deputy and I are both doing our best to try to mitigate for now and, perhaps, get to a better place in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#E00500"><p>I am slightly amused by the fact that there are two versions of the Minister's speech and that the difference between them is that in one there is a reference to the famous statement by Charlie McCreevy that, "When I have it, I spend it", and the extreme damage that policy pursued by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government did in creating the conditions for the economic collapse in 2008.  I am curious why the Minister included that in the first version of his speech but then removed it.</p> <p>  I wonder whether his Government is not guilty of making the same mistake, particularly in the area of the significant expenditures that are going out on housing assistance payment, the rental accommodation scheme and leasing arrangements to private property interests because of the failure of the State to directly invest in and construct its own social housing stock.  As a result, we are currently in a situation, and will be for the foreseeable future as I read the plans of the Government, of approximately &euro;1 billion, a figure that will probably rise every year, going out in those sorts of payments to private property developers.  Is that not a very significant and poor example of spending money in a profligate way that we should avoid?  We need to replace that expenditure with direct investment in our own social housing stock, where the rental revenue will come back to the State and it would be able to reinvest those funds in more social housing.  </p> <p>  A figure being bandied around for Housing for All is that it will cost &euro;4 billion a year.  I ask the Minister to confirm whether that is accurate.  In our discussions with the Parliamentary Budget Office, it pointed out that the direct Exchequer funding is significantly less than that and that the Government is essentially hoping that more than 50% of the spending that would be required to deliver the 330,000 houses by the end of the period covered by Housing for All will come from the private sector.  I ask the Minister to clarify that point.  I will put all my questions now because I do not want the Minister to talk down the clock.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#E00700"><p>Just in case.  I refer to the distinction between current and capital expenditure.  It often seems like a sensible distinction to make but, when examined closely, is often a false distinction.</p><p>For example, we have significant skills and qualified professional shortages in a whole range of areas - the health service, construction and engineering and many other areas.  It seems to me that the way to address that would be to create additional places in colleges and universities, which would be current expenditure, by creating additional places and removing things like fees and other obstacles to people accessing higher and postgraduate education.  That would be current expenditure, but it would be an investment in the future which would save us money down the line.  I would make a similar point about our proposal that we should have things like free public transport.  It would be additional current expenditure, but in the future it would save us on things like fines for carbon emissions and so on.  Therefore, I question the merits of that distinction in many areas.  I could quote others but I do not have time.</p><p> Lastly, I pushed at this committee, as did other members, for the examination of tax expenditures, which the committee has agreed to examine.  There is a huge shadow budget that we have every year that is not scrutinised in the same way as the direct expenditure budget.  We are proposing that those tax expenditures should be examined in the same sort of way during the budget as direct expenditures.  I would like the Minister to comment on that, because in my opinion many of those tax expenditures are essentially tax loopholes which allow big corporations to evade tax.  To give the Minister one example, and perhaps he might comment on it, in the latest available figures for revenue, the cost of intra-group transactions, a tax relief, in 2019 was to the tune of &euro;16 billion in lost revenue.  I presume that is accruing to some of the big multinational corporations that use transfer pricing to avoid their tax obligations.  That is &euro;16 billion in just one category of tax relief.  Should these things frankly not be closed down, or at the very least examined in a detailed way as part of the budgetary process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#F00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Given the warning that he has issued to me about not speaking for too long, I will try to be quick.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's first question, I just made the same point in different words.  I apologise for two speeches being issued to the committee.  I will ensure the same does not happen on budget day.  On the Deputy's second point about the use of HAP and housing-related payments, I would love to be in a position in the future where we do not have to make as much use of those payments as we are currently.  However, while we are in a situation where we are building more public and social housing and rebuilding our social housing stock, I believe those payments play a role in supporting those who need long-term secure rental accommodation while more permanent plans and homes are being made available to them.  </p> <p>  Third, on the Deputy's point about capital expenditure, sometimes the line is more blurred than economic textbooks might indicate but, from a policy point of view, there still has to be a segmentation.  There is a world of difference between making a decision, for example, to hire 1,000 more teachers in any given year and committing to building a new public capital project that has a finite end point, at the end of which you can make the decision as to whether you want to maintain the spending or not with few of the difficulties that are sometimes associated with the management of current spending.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's final point on the review of tax expenditures, as a matter of policy we review all tax expenditures every three years.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#F00300"><p>First, I would like the Minister to comment on the intra-group transactions and the capital allowances, which are the two biggest categories of tax reliefs.  To my mind, they are examples of aggressive tax avoidance by major multinationals.  Tax relief in this category amounted to &euro;16 billion in 2019, around &euro;6 billion in capital allowances and, of course, there is the research and development tax relief.</p> <p>  I should also mention in respect of climate that the Minister is going to increase the carbon tax once again.  The ESRI has stated that that is regressive for people on lower incomes when they have little control over their ability to reduce their energy use because of, for example, the quality of their housing.  Is that not the case? Is the ESRI not correct?  Is it not the case that it is going to increase fuel poverty, particularly given that, for example, in most local authorities next year the retrofit plans for social housing are for only 1% of the housing stock, so many people will have no control over the heating they need to keep their houses warm, and the Minister is going to punish them with further increases in the carbon tax?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#F00400"><p>The ESRI report also acknowledges that there needs to be plans in place that mitigate the effect of an increase in carbon pricing for those particularly who are on fixed income, which is why, budget by budget, we have made changes in the fuel allowance.  My recollection is that the changes that we have made have been successful in protecting lower income citizens within our society from the more difficult consequences of an increase in carbon pricing.  Data and evidence are also available to show that has happened.</p> <p> On the Deputy's point about the use of capital allowances and intragroup transfers, I disagree fundamentally with the Deputy in describing them as tax loopholes in any way.  That is just a consequence of the fact that we have so many companies located here in Ireland but are managing large businesses that take place in other parts of the world from Ireland.  That inevitably means that changes take place to deal with transfer pricing, the transfer of funds from companies within a broader organisation that are part of how larger corporations run their businesses.  I accept that the figures are high, but I do not accept the characterisation of them as being in any way tax loopholes.  To re-emphasise, all tax expenditures are reviewed every three years.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#F00500"><p>The Minister is most welcome to the committee's proceedings today.  I can assure the Minister that I will give him as much time as he needs within the parameters the Chair will allow to answer the questions I have for him and the observations that I will make.  I will try to be relatively brief.  I wish to focus on the issue of corporation tax and the impacts that proposed reforms will inevitably have on the Exchequer over the coming period.  I note with interest the remarks made by the Minister to Deputy Durkan earlier on regarding the &euro;2 billion figure, which has been the received wisdom in terms of the extrapolated potential loss to the Exchequer essentially around pillar 1, to which we have fully signed up.</p> <p>  I think it would be useful, based on the remarks in response to questions to me from the International Federation of Accountants, IFAC, yesterday, if we might reassess the figures in terms of what potentially could be lost to the Exchequer and what the position might be over the next period, if we do in fact sign up both to pillars 1 and 2 of the OECD process.  I draw the Minister's attention to remarks made by Feargal O'Rourke of PwC on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 on Tuesday.  He seemed to suggest that the figures the Minister has cited and we have all cited repeatedly in respect of the potential &euro;2 billion loss were in fact developed before there was any real OECD articulation of any new global minimum effective rate of "at least 15%".</p> <p>  First, does the Minister believe that we are at a point where we need to reassess those figures?  Related to that, if indeed we do sign up to to pillar 2 of the process in time, does he think we may end up losing something on the swings and gaining from the roundabouts, to borrow a phrase?  My final question in respect of the corporation tax process is whether the Minister sees a landing zone on the horizon for Ireland that would allow him and give him the confidence to sign Ireland up fully to pillar 2 of the process, given what he knows at this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#G00100"><p>I thank Deputy Nash for his questions.  I might try to dispose of his earlier questions quickly and maybe spend more time dealing with his final question.  His first group of questions was about where we are with estimated revenue loss.  We had to form those judgments regarding revenue loss early in the OECD process.  At that point, I believe that it was vital that we plug into our figures and the public debate an expectation that revenues will begin to change.  We will only be able to revise those figures when the full detail of how an OECD agreement would work is fully agreed and communicated.  We are still some way off that.  As further detail comes in, if that detail merits a revision of the figure that I have shared with the Oireachtas, of course I will update those figures and communicate it in the right way to the Government and the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's final point about a landing zone, before I answer the question, it is important that the committee continues to be aware that any decision that we make is a decision that will carry significant consequences.  I will outline two of those consequences for either of the choices that could become available to us.  The first is to acknowledge that if we were to go into an agreement and it has a higher rate in it than our current 12.5%, then entering that agreement means a change in the rate.  I note that in the current agreement as it is laid down, there simply is not clarity regarding what a future rate could be, since "at least 15%" can clearly mean any figure higher than 15%.  I know that the OECD process, as critical as it is, is merely part of the process in which overall change will take place in corporate tax policy in Europe.  It is also worth noting that at least being in an agreement carries with it our continued ability to influence corporate tax policy inside the forum within which global decisions are made and has benefits regarding engagement and the influence that we can have in the OECD on issues that are important to us.  If and when we get to the right point to make this decision, those are issues that I will want to elaborate on.</p> <p>  If we are not in the agreement, of course it is the case that it gives us the ability and capacity to continue to preserve the figure that is there at the moment.  Our rate of 12.5% has, as I have argued in many cases, been a deeply important element in our economic success and development to this point.  Alongside preserving our ability to do that, there are three other factors that will require consideration.  The first is the most understandable one, which has been the subject of public debate.  It is the reputational consequence of being outside an agreement.  As Deputy Nash knows, I believe that it is justified to be outside the agreement at the moment.  The second is the real possibility, which is different from where we have been before, of the ability of other jurisdictions to form a view that certain revenue streams and levels of profitability are being undertaxed and, in the context of a global accord being in place on these matters, the ability developing in the future to tax that revenue in different ways.  Were that to happen, that would also have a potential effect on the stability and revenue that we gain from corporate tax policy.</p> <p>  The final issue relates to the medium-term consequences of being outside an agreement and what that means with regard to our ability to influence the future development of corporate tax policy, especially and vitally within the OECD.</p> <p>  I have shown my willingness to stand by our corporate tax policy and rate at many different points over the past four years and now, with the decision that I have made to be outside the consensus.  It is useful to indicate to the committee that in any decision that lies ahead, there are consequences that will be meaningful and potentially very real for our economy, which the Government and I will have to consider if we get to a point in the coming weeks or maybe later in the year of deciding to enter not just the process but the agreement.</p></speech>

I have been listening intently to what he has said and to the questions.  He mentioned crises or challenges for the economy that may be coming.  We have housing, health and climate action, including carbon tax and public transport issues.  We are fighting many things on many fronts.  The Minister talked about the national development plan and the spending that will happen.  That all relates to the infrastructure that we need for the country to sustain itself over the next 15, 20 or 30 years.</p><p>I offer as an example the media reports about Intel having shortlisted a site in Oranmore in Galway for development and creating up to 10,000 jobs.  A project of that size in the west of Ireland would mean that we would need to have at least 12 counties supporting that with resources, supplies and all that goes with that.  It would be transformative for the region.  If this project were to be successful, we would need to make sure that we are building the required infrastructure, including the outer bypass of Galway city, upgrading our roads to Sligo, creating rail lines and improving the rail networks that exist, because we are talking about up to 10,000 people.  There is a challenge but also an opportunity.  How will the Government deal with this?  I asked the T&aacute;naiste about it yesterday and he talked about additional supports for people in the region.</p><p>The eight counties in the Northern and Western Regional Assembly have been re-graded to being a region in transition, a lagging industrial region and a moderate innovator.  The European Union has done a score sheet.  It states that the re-grading is due to a lack of expenditure <i>per capita</i>to create the basis to keep balanced development in the country.  With all the crises that we have, how will we balance that?  How will we positively discriminate for such a region to make sure that it raises the bar further?  How will we access the potential of Structural Funds from the European Union to do that?</p><p>That is my first question for the Minister.  How does he see those challenges?  If something is to lose out, what will lose out?  It is a significant challenge and I wanted the Minister's thoughts on it.</p></speech>

He refers to all the crises.</p><p>I am aware of the many challenges we face with regard to the supply of homes and the transition to a lower carbon future.  In acknowledging the crises we have, we should acknowledge and make the case for the things that are going well in our country and society.  I refer to where we are in the reopening of our domestic economy, the level of entrepreneurship, the excellence of our schools and the work they have done in reopening and getting children back safely.  There is much in our society and country that we want to do better, but I also make the case for many things that are going well and of much of which we should be proud. </p><p> The Deputy made a point on our ability to meet the needs he described, particularly those of the communities and counties he referred to.  That is why the national broadband plan is so important.  It was not an easy or simple decision to make, but the Deputy and I made the decision to go ahead with the national broadband plan.  Whatever criticism I got for making that decision would easily be outweighed by the criticism we would all receive if we did not have a national broadband plan being rolled out in the context of the massive change that could take place in many communities the Deputy represents outside of our larger cities.  This is why the national development plan will be important.  It looks to respond to many of the infrastructural and funding needs the Deputy referred to and to lay out how the funding will be made available to deal with these issues over a ten-year period.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, is doing considerable work on this and I hope it will be published imminently.</p><p> I am not in a position to comment on the speculation over the investment the Deputy referred to but I make the broad point that the fact Ireland is still perceived to be competitive and attractive for investment decisions recognises, notwithstanding all we need to improve on, that our economy, society, entrepreneurs, public services and Government are coming together to try to do well on. </p></speech>

When I mention the crises, it is not that they are negatives.  There are always challenges.  I see every day the number of young people biting at the bit to get involved in or set up businesses and to create industry and employment.  One of the issues with that relates to the incentives to make work pay.  One of the biggest challenges small and medium-sized companies and all businesses face is trying to get people back to work.  How can we make work pay?  It is marginal at times between working and not working.  We need to make it worthwhile for people to be working.</p> <p>  On social welfare, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  We have gone through a huge amount of living experiences with people over the last year and a half.  Some 13.5% of our population are disabled people.  We need to make sure they are not below the poverty line.  They have needs beyond others.  They have many challenges which they have spelled out to us.  There needs to be a special budget for people with disabilities to make sure they can live independently and in a way equal to everybody else, as their right.  I ask that people with disabilities be taken on board in the overall formation of the budget on the basis that something special needs to be done for them.</p></speech>

As he said, I acknowledge our young people going back to work, some starting work for the first time and going to college and the enormously positive future we are trying to create for them and that they are trying to build.</p> <p>  On making work pay, that is why it is important that, after two budgets in which we had no change in personal tax policies, rates, credits and bands, we work hard within the resources available to us to try to preserve and support as much of the income workers earn as possible, and to try to prevent that going into higher levels of taxation just by their wages going up.  It is important in the upcoming budget that we recognise this in certain tax changes that the Government has yet to agree but which will be the subject of budget day communications.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about those citizens who deal with the consequences of disabilities, for whom daily life and going to work, school or college are more difficult.  The Ministers for Health, Social Protection and Business, Enterprise and Employment, have worked on this to try to create pathways to work for those citizens the Deputy is making the case for.  We have targets within Departments and public service providers for trying to recruit and retain citizens with disabilities to give them the options to create and develop careers in our public services.  I will take the Deputy's point on board.  When the Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath and Stephen Donnelly, are working on the health budget for 2022,  I am sure this will be given the consideration it needs.   </p></speech>

We are in a crisis in terms of gas and energy costs.  With regard to policy tools that can be used to respond to that crisis, in response to a parliamentary question my colleague, Deputy Doherty, submitted in January 2019, the Minister said VAT rates for household utility bills such as gas and electricity could not be reduced below 12%.

Anything we can do would be essential for those people, who are struggling.</p> <p>  I want to talk about the corporation tax issue.  I do not want to talk about the specifics of the two-pillar system or the negotiations under way.  My questions are more hypothetical because I am aware the negotiations are under way.  If the OECD agrees to a global minimum effective corporation tax rate above 12.5%, has the Minister received a signal from the Commission that it will allow the State to operate two different corporation tax rates simultaneously for those who fall outside the OECD process?  I do not ask the Minister to say what he will do, but just if he has had any signal on that.</p></speech>

We are engaged in a really sensitive and important negotiation and process on behalf of our country, and that is not a hypothetical situation in the sense that my answering that is, of course, relevant to the discussions and negotiations that we are having.  Our ability to do that will be dependent on the final decision that we make in regard to the OECD process and, as we are working way through the OECD process, we will need to engage with the Commission in terms of its views on the tax changes and directives it is likely to bring in in the future.</p></speech>

I was not asking for the Minister's opinion on that; I was just hoping he could give an indication.</p> <p>  Second, the Commission has said it will legislate through a directive for Pillar 2 of the OECD inclusive framework proposals.  Regardless of whether this State signs up or does not sign up to the final agreement, would the Minister agree it does set a significant precedent for the Commission to legislate on the tax policy of member states?</p></speech>

Any decision it makes on the implementation of the OECD agreement has to be consistent with the Single Market and has to be in line with the powers it has under the law of the European Union.  It is the way OECD agreements have been implemented in the past and when the BEPS process was implemented, it was implemented via Commission directives.</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister is aware that, by the end of the decade, data centres are set to consume around 30%, and from figures that have been talked about, it will be 29% by 2028, in seven years.  We know that as a result of increased energy usage from those already in operation, as well as issues in terms of imports of fossil fuels, there have been concerns about the possibility of blackouts.  Companies constructing these data centres can qualify for capital allowances &ndash; basically, tax concessions - and the Taoiseach has also called for the fast-tracking of the construction of these data centres, which could mean even more tax concessions.  However, the information on those capital allowances is not compiled separately by Revenue, so that information is not publicly available.  Is it possible that this information would be made available?  Is that something the Minister could look into because, realistically, it would be very important in terms of fiscal and environmental perspectives.</p></speech>

We do not normally break down the drawdown of capital allowances into what those capital allowances are used for and, therefore, it may not be possible on taxpayer confidentiality grounds to provide the information the Deputy is looking for, but I will certainly ask.</p> <p>  The point I would make around data centres is that the reason the Government has been supportive of their development is that they are part of the broader reason international investment is resident within our country.  Of course, we are well aware of the impact it has on energy supply.  We know we will have to invest in that energy supply and ensure we get the balance right between being able to support data centres and, of course, meeting the energy needs of our country.  We are well aware of the balance that needs to be achieved but the reason we have been supportive of these data centres up to this point is that they provide part of the proposition for jobs and investment in our country.</p></speech>

I want to double check something.  In regard to Pillar 2 and corporation tax, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, said that any potential higher tax rate would only apply to companies with a turnover of &euro;750 million or higher in Ireland.  Is the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, saying the Commission has not approved this?</p></speech>

What the T&aacute;naiste was doing was just making reference to the OECD statement that already refers to companies that have a level of turnover that is greater than &euro;750 million.  That is the current draft text of the OECD agreement.</p></speech>

Hypothetically, this could be 13%, so what did the T&aacute;naiste mean in that regard?  I am slightly confused.</p></speech>

If and when we make a decision that we are either going to enter into the OECD agreement or we are not, at that point, I will be able to give full clarity on the question the Deputy is asking me.</p></speech>

At this moment in time, whether we enter or not, according to that text, as the T&aacute;naiste understood it and portrayed it, that would mean it would be separate and it would only be for those who are in the process.</p></speech>

However, the point is that, as it stands, that is what it would mean.  It would mean that those that are below that &euro;750 million could have the 12.5% and the others would not.  I am not suggesting the Minister is entering or not entering, but as the text stands now, that is where it is at.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the Minister had a chance to view our committee footage from yesterday, but Sebastian Barnes of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council expressed his concern about the lack of an economic assessment of Housing for All, the Government solution to our housing crisis.  If he has not already, will the Minister commit to such an assessment and also to publishing it?</p></speech>

It was the subject of extensive engagement within government.  As each constituent element of Housing for all is implemented, it is at that point that an evaluation will take place of the impact it will have.  It is difficult to evaluate the plan or do an economic appraisal of the plan in its entirety but, as we take each individual step in Housing for All, that will be subject to the normal means of Government scrutiny.</p></speech>

I have two questions.  I am sorry if I start with something that is relatively obscure.  I want to ask the Minister about the Evergrande debt crisis.  For those unaware of it, Evergrande is the second largest real estate company in China and it now has a debt of approximately $305 billion.  Both Fitch and Moody's ratings firms have signalled that a default is likely, if not inevitable, and may lead to some global instability.  Are the Department and Minister monitoring that situation?  Are they aware of any specific exposures that Ireland faces?  Are they concerned about a situation where we do not face specific exposure but since we live in a global environment, we might be exposed to a global domino effect in the banking community?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#K00400"><p>We are monitoring it.  We believe that our capital markets and banking systems are resilient and able to deal with any contagious effect from the issue that the Chair refers to.  It is the case, as can be seen in changes in the pricing of certain commodities and the performance of particular equities, that we live in a deeply interconnected world and changes that take place in the Chinese banking sector definitely have the ability to influence the performance of the global economy and national economies which are intertwined with China.  We are monitoring it.  We do not have a specific exceptional link to what could be happening with the development of that enterprise but it is far from obscure.</p></speech>

I want to follow up on another item.  The Minister signalled in the past year that he might introduce a gaming credit, fund or tax-favourable situation for the gaming industry in Ireland.  That would be a commendable thing to do.  It is exactly the type of industry that we should support in Ireland.  It is highly skilled.  However, I am aware that employment conditions in the gaming industry can be less than ideal and there is often a gender disparity in the sector.  As we look at that issue in budget 2022, are there any considerations by the Department to link State funding, support or favourable conditions from the State to better employment conditions, gender parity, disparity, or requirements for a living wage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#K00600"><p>I should emphasise that this is the digital gaming sector that the Chair and I are referring to.  I have signalled that I am interested in seeing how we can develop it further.  I am working on it at present.  Looking at the strengths that we have in filmmaking, animation and IT already in Ireland, the digital gaming sector is a part of our creative economy that I believe that we can do even better in.  Regarding the issues that the Chair referred to, we have developed some tests through the administration of the section 481 film tax credit, which Deputy Boyd Barrett is well aware of, that can deal with some of the issues but probably not all.  Certain criteria would need to be met before any digital game firm would be able to access such a credit were it to be brought in.</p></speech>

There is a lack of clarity, given the conversation that went on.  Will the Minister clear this up?  Two days ago, on Tuesday, the T&aacute;naiste stated, "any agreement we may or may not sign up to won&rsquo;t impact the average Irish business, won&rsquo;t impact even any large Irish business, or mid-caps. The 12.5 per cent rate will stay in place for them".  Can Deputy Donohoe, as Minister for Finance, say that that is an accurate statement?</p></speech>

I am familiar with the current draft that has been agreed.  The question is about its implementation.  Deputy Farrell has put that question to the Minister.  For us to implement that, mindful that many countries across the globe have an effective rate of above 15%, from what the T&aacute;naiste has said, we would need approval from the Commission to operate two different rates simultaneously, both the 12.5% rate and whatever other rate may be agreed by the OECD.  The question originally asked of the Minister was whether he has had a signal or clarification from the Commission that that would be allowed after the base erosion and profiting shifting, BEPS, process had concluded.</p></speech>

Does the Minister have any confirmation that we could potentially run two simultaneous corporation tax rates, with one at 12.5% for those outside the OECD BEPS process with turnover of less than &euro;750 million, and then whatever higher rate we could potentially have if we opted into the OECD BEPS process?</p></speech>

Maybe the Minister does not have the answer, because it appears that it has not yet been approved by the Commission.  I put it to the Minister that the T&aacute;naiste went to the media and gave certainty to businesses that regardless of the outcome of OECD BEPS and regardless of whether we opt into that process, businesses without a turnover of &euro;750 million will be secure, and the 12.5% tax rate will remain.  Can the Minister give that same certainty at this committee?  Uncertainty in this situation is not good and the Minister needs to clarify the comments by the T&aacute;naiste.  Companies are operating across the State and paying corporation tax at 12.5%.  Will that remain unchanged regardless of anything that comes out of OECD BEPS unless a company has turnover of &euro;750 million?</p></speech>

For instance, the Irish Cancer Society indicated how much it had fallen behind in dealing with urgent care issues in the past 18 months - and understandably, because the services were obviously highly strapped in dealing with the immediacy of another issue.  Similarly, other issues were raised in relation to CervicalCheck etc.  The issues raised are ongoing and have a serious impact on health.  Will it be possible to sympathetically consider all those issues, including housing, special needs and early years education, as well as climate, notwithstanding the exigencies within which the Minister has to operate for obvious purposes?  Will there be a role in managing the national debt for the NTMA, as there was in the past?  It is a reverse situation to that which prevailed previously when borrowing was at high interest rates and it was obviously easier to offload and roll over into lower interest rates.  It will not be that easy to do the next time, but there may still be a role for the NTMA.  What could that role be in those circumstances?  To what extent could it be utilised?</p> <p>  My two questions relate to the seriously pressing issues in terms of health and other services, and the potential role for the NTMA.</p></speech>

Second, within the scale of the health budget there will absolutely be the ability to give good consideration to the issues raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-23a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021092300002#L00500"><p>In the event of there being any difficulty in raising funds in the international market, could the private or personal savings in the banks in this country be utilised by way of incentive in order to supplement the budgetary issue in way that might be positive and in a way that would not impact on foreign debt?  Would that be possible?  Obviously, there would have to be some incentives, but I presume it could be possible.  Again, could that be done through the aegis of the NTMA?</p></speech>

That is why the NTMA has a national savings bond and many existing ways in which the savings of those resident in our country can be used in a productive way and can be invested in activities that the NTMA runs.  Those facilities are there at the moment.  I know that for many, they are not attractive, given the interest rates that are available on them currently, but they are available.</p></speech>

Within that plan there will be the ability to make progress on many of the capital needs that are required to make progress, particularly in housing.  It is a really big plan.  Housing for All already shows the many ways in which we can make progress.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the Minister has responded to issues that I have raised in respect of the film sector, but I want to inform him that the major recipients of section 481 film tax relief continue to essentially deny their responsibility to employees from one production to another, and indeed, continue practices of blacklisting employees who raise those issues.  Despite the efforts of the Minister in that regard,  they are signing declarations about compliance but then continuing as they have acted in the past.  Further measures need to be taken there.</p> <p>  I wish to raise the issue of revenue raising.  We are alone in the D&aacute;il in asserting that we should increase the corporation tax rate and that it is immoral, essentially, that corporations in this country pay a lower proportion of their, in many cases, staggering profits in tax than the average worker does.  How does the Minister sustain, on moral grounds, defending the very low levels of tax against attempts at an international level to bring in some reform?  There is no excuse now that there is a big international move to increase the tax contribution of these multinationals.</p> <p> On that general theme, given that we face huge challenges and crises in climate, housing and the health service that will require additional expenditure, should the Minister be looking at additional sources of revenue in the coming budget, particularly from sectors that have made big profits, or employers' PRSI, which is some of the lowest levels anywhere in Europe in this country, or financial transaction taxes or wealth taxes?  These are things that would not punish ordinary workers who sustained us through the pandemic, but would begin to redistribute the vast accumulations of profits and wealth that continue to accumulate at the top of our society.  </p></speech>

I believe the corporate tax structure that we have at the moment is effective in meeting the needs to which the Deputy has referred.  Some of the broader matters to which he has referred can only be addressed on a global level.  That is why the work of the OECD is important.  We have yet to make a decision as to whether Ireland can be part of the final agreement.  Currently, we are not, but we remain committed to the process and we are working on these matters as we speak.</p></speech>
