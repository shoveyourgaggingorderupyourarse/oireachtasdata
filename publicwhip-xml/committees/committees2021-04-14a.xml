    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#A00200"><p>I welcome everyone.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Kehoe.  Before we begin, I remind members that in the context of the current Covid-19 restrictions, only the Chairman and staff are present in the committee room and all members must join remotely from elsewhere in the parliamentary precincts.  The secretariat can issue invitations to join the meeting on Microsoft Teams.  Members may not participate in the meeting from outside the parliamentary precincts.  I ask members to mute their microphones when they are not making a contribution and to use the "raise hand" function to indicate.  Please note that messages sent to the meeting chat are visible to all participants.  Speaking slots will be prioritised for members of the committee.  The topic of today's meeting is the Common Agricultural Policy negotiations, specifically the proposed amendments to the good agricultural and environmental conditions 2, GAEC 2.</p> <p>  The meeting comprises two parts.  In the first part, from 10.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m., the committee will engage with representatives of the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, and the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association, ICSA.  The second hour is engagement with officials from the Department of Agriculture and the Marine.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Tim Cullinan, president of the IFA, and Mr. Tadhg Buckley, IFA director of policy and its chief economist.  From the ICMSA, I welcome Mr. Pat McCormack, president, and Mr. John Enright, general secretary.  From the ICSA, I welcome Mr. Dermot Kelleher, president, Mr. Eddie Punch, general secretary and Mr. Tim Farrell, rural development chair.  From the INHFA, I welcome Mr. Colm O'Donnell, national president, and Mr. Henry O'Donnell, Donegal national council representative.  They are all appearing remotely.  I welcome the witnesses.  We have received their opening statements, which have already been circulated to members.  We are limited in time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions, so the committee has agreed that the opening statements will be taken as read so that we can use the full session for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I have an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which their participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I invite questions from members to the farming organisations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#A00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses from the farmer representative bodies.  As the Chairman rightly says, we have many witnesses and members in attendance, so time is of the essence.  I will not take much time.  While I have no specific question, I would like to hear from the different organisations, in advance of our meeting with the Department later, if there is one thing that we could leave this meeting with that witnesses want us to get across to the Department in our deliberations with it later.  Reading the submissions, there is a common denominator in all three, which, as a farmer myself, I and members of the committee were probably well aware of before we read the submissions.</p><p>Regarding the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the genuine farmer, the issue of capping and convergence seems to be coming to the fore in all the submissions.  I reiterate the organisations should give a brief couple of lines on each of those issues that they would like us to bring forward in our deliberations when it gets closer to D-Day.</p><p> From reading the submissions, there is a slight difference of opinion between the different organisations on the good agricultural environment conditions.  That may possibly emanate from the different sectors that are their core membership or the different geographical areas they represent.  I would like to get a little more depth as to their stance on the good agricultural environment conditions with regard to high carbon soils and where they would like to see this evolving. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak.  Senator Paul Daly has mentioned a number of issues, including the genuine farmer, capping and convergence.  Regarding the genuine farmer, it is very clear and absolutely essential that this CAP reform ensures money goes to the people doing the work and who are out ploughing the fields.  That is paramount.  We are strongly of that view in the association.</p> <p>  On capping, what obviously has to be included is farmers' income.  If farmers are leasing in entitlements, that has to be included as well.  On convergence, we are clear.  We strongly believe that we cannot take money from one farmer and give it to another.  As we all know, the main problem is the entire budget.  The overall budget has not been increasing with inflation.  We have to deal with the budgets as they are but we have to lean on the Pillar 2 schemes, which are the schemes the Government can deal with.  The budget of &euro;2.4 billion agreed in Pillar 2 can be co-funded, by up to 57%, by national governments.  That is critically important.  It is more important that the &euro;1.5 billion coming from the carbon tax, agreed in the programme for Government, and agreed by all governments currently in power, is ring-fenced for a proper environmental scheme.  That is absolutely critical and essential and needs to happen going forward.  </p> <p>  On the soils high or rich in carbon, it is very important to state that those lands have been farmed for generations.  We want to ensure that continues going forward as well.  We cannot have restrictions put on farmers for what they have been doing for generations and that needs to continue long into the future.  Somewhere in the region of 300,000 ha. are in the high carbon soil category.  I want to make it clear to the committee that we do not want restrictions on farmers on those soils in the future. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McCormack" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#B00300"><p>In response to the Senator, it is very hard to define just one thing coming from today because it is a combination of things as we move forward.  Mr. Cullinan alluded to the genuine farmer who is the person working the land.  We certainly feel that the person who is working the land, and is doing so in a meaningful fashion, needs to be defined as the genuine farmer.  When I started out in farming, twenty-something years ago, there was the armchair farmer who was effectively a milk quota holder.  We now see entitlement holders becoming armchair farmers.  That is not sustainable for the commercial or active farmer, or the genuine farmer as it is now, who is out there.</p><p>We see convergence as being a very harsh method.  While it flattens the payment per hectare it by no means levels the playing field.  There should be no further convergence without taking into account the overall envelope an individual farmer receives.</p><p> On good agriculture culture and environment, on carbon unfortunately we have seen the case of Bord na M&oacute;na which is so hesitant to give a written agreement.  It is not that long ago since we asked for that in this forum.  We would not like to see that burden on farmers who are farming in a commercial and effective manner.  We need to be very prudent about how we navigate that.  The critical matter is the genuine farmer and the convergence.  We need to get those right.  The farmers who are trying to make a living and make a meaningful economic return from farming cannot afford to carry the armchair farmers into the future. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#C00200"><p>I thank all the farm organisations for their attendance at this meeting which was called because of the very serious concerns among committee members on the position as articulated by the INHFA on the GAEC 2 proposals.</p> <p>  Will the INHFA representatives outline what exactly they see as being the potential concerns from these proposals as outlined?  I hope they have had an opportunity to see the Department's response to the effect that there is nothing to worry about here, that the Council is moving to protect farmers on peat land.  What do the representatives see as being the significance of a piece of land being designated or considered an eligible hectare, permanent agriculture or not being considered?  Do they believe the proposed changes by the Council at European level have the potential to impact on payments received by farmers in Pillar 1, Pillar 2 or both?  What might this mean for farmers who are operating under commonage agreements?</p> <p>  The IFA has raised concerns around GAEC 9 which relates to the minimum share of agricultural land devoted to non-productive features or areas.  Its opening statement indicated that the Department seems to be pushing for this to be applied across all agricultural land rather than simply arable.  Will the IFA outline its view of the effect that extending this condition would have on all agricultural land?</p> <p>  On convergence, all of us will have sympathy for any farmer who is likely to lose out on Pillar 1 payments, particularly those who would be on smaller holdings but might have larger eligibility.  I understand the point made on the European budget and the share of that going to CAP, and I agree.  Ireland should not have agreed to the European budget on the basis of what was being provided, but in the parameters that exist, will the different farm organisations outline what they propose with regard to Pillar 1 payments for the farmers who are currently receiving below the EU average?  We can say that we do not want to take funding away from any farmer, but there are farmers who are being penalised because of a historic eligibility criteria that is archaic.  How do we address that?</p><p> What are the views of the witnesses on capping?  This would appear to be the first thing we could try to put a redistributive mechanism in place.  The ICMSA has proposed a cap of &euro;60,000, which would be eminently fair.  Would the other organisations support such an upper limit payment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#D00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to participate in this meeting.  Regarding the Deputy's question on the GAEC 2 proposals, there are ten GAECs, which are cross-compliance tools to ensure that payments are delivered and farmers comply with the conditions.  However, the new GAEC 2, which is proposed to protect wetlands and peatlands, will have the opposite effect.  It will remove land from being an agricultural area due to not having agricultural activity happening on it.  Under the Commission's drafting, an eligible hectare must consist of an agricultural area exercising an agricultural activity.  Clearly, this amendment will knock land out of being eligible on grounds of compliance with the GAEC standards.  This is unprecedented in any CAP reform.  Lands will be now be differentiated.  It is why we have relished the opportunity to inform the members of this committee that this will be the case.  It is teeing up to be part of the European Commission's bigger picture under the biodiversity strategy to protect carbon-rich soils.  It is being offered on a plate under the amendment to the Commission's position on Article 4.  That is our fundamental problem with the proposal.</p> <p>  I might ask Mr. Henry O'Donnell to continue this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Henry O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#D00300"><p>As Mr. Colm O'Donnell outlined, the current amendment, as produced by the Commission, is detrimental to our members on carbon-rich soils.  While it is mentioned that a derogation may be provided at national level and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has told us that this amendment is being made to protect our farmers, the reality is that agricultural activity on the land in question will potentially have to stop.  That introduces much bigger questions, which our Department has not been able to answer, relating to whether the land will still be available for an eco scheme payment and whether farmers will be able to avail of a Pillar 2 payment in respect of that land.  Far from protecting the land and the people who farm it, this amendment has the potential to stop all agricultural activity in those areas.  As Mr. Colm O'Donnell stated, when we consider the bigger picture in terms of the biodiversity strategy and carbon sequestration and storage, we can see that the objective is to sterilise this land and use it for carbon sequestration to offset unsustainable activity everywhere else.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the Department's submission to the committee.  Page 4 of its document where it relates to Article 4 is inaccurate.  GAEC 2 is mentioned along with eco schemes, landscape features and non-productive features under GAEC 9.</p><p>The reality is, looking at the EU regulation and the amendment proposed by the Commission, GAEC 2 lands and carbon-rich soils are separated out in Article 4, under which they are not classed as agricultural areas.  While this is quite technical, the reality is that the legislation has the potential to be extremely damaging for our type of farmers.  That is why we are acting so strongly on this issue because it potentially negates any gains that our farmers may get from increased convergence and a flat-rate eco scheme.  If our lands are not eligible for all these things, it will take away from that.  </p><p> That is a summary of the issues we have with GAEC 2.  They are very real and we believe the Department has not addressed our concerns properly.  We are extremely familiar with the regulations and can see the potential for huge issues for our members farming on carbon-rich soils going forward.  There are also many unintended consequences that have not been properly thought out.  We are asking that this be looked at in detail before it is passed into law in Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot Kelleher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#E00200"><p>Our outlook on the whole thing is that in respect of the GAEC, for many years they have all been worried about the "A" part of it but no one was worried about the environmental part of it until now.  They are now all jumping up and down about biodiversity and habitats but there is no point in talking about biodiversity when another Minister on the other side of the room is drawing red circles around habitats and areas of high biodiversity, stating that they no longer constitute land.  Suckler cows and sheep in disadvantaged areas are actually doing a good job for the environment.  They should make up their minds as to what they really need.</p> <p>  On the issue of productive farmers, we believe that an active farmer is one who is producing and working.  Some may argue that some farmers work part-time.  The former Minister, Joe Walsh, sang that song for years.  The argument was that those who cannot make money from suckling cows should get an off-farm income as well.  Many farmers were forced to do so.  The elephant in the room is that the CAP money came out of the beef and suckler cow schemes and EU premiums.  All of the CAP money came out of all of those schemes originally.  Since the MacSharry and Fischler reforms, the whole thing has changed.  When I was a young fellow I was taught that Robin Hood took from the rich and gave to the poor.  Since these reforms came in, we have been taking from the poor and giving to the rich.  </p> <p>  It was noted in the Teagasc report of 2019 that dairy farming is four times more profitable than suckler farming and sheep farming is three and half times more profitable than beef or tillage.  Still, these farmers are probably drawing the same amount of CAP or more.  If we want to rebalance it, we must look after those suckler farmer, the sheep farmer and small tillage farmers in disadvantaged areas who have no other option but to pursue such farming.  Looking forward, what is being proposed will mean that farmers will have to move into dairy farming.  It is not necessary to build a milking parlour to move into dairy farming.  The farmer can lease his or her land, opt for contract rearing or do something else.  The smaller farmers are suffering big time.  While the money was provided for those people at first, it has since been taken off them constantly.</p> <p>  In respect of convergence, we believe that &euro;60,000 would be a very fair cap.  However, one needs to look around it at the minimum, because when an approximation was made a few years ago, those who were due to receive a six-figure sum had it reduced by around &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000.  I know of farmers with smaller hectare farms in disadvantaged areas who were working hard who were brought from &euro;11,000 down to &euro;9,000.  It is a much bigger hit for a farmer to take when his or her income is reduced from &euro;11,000 to &euro;9,000 than from &euro;80,000 to &euro;75,000.</p> <p>  We have submitted our proposal.</p><p>We believe that farmers with values of between 130 kg and 150 kg per hectare should<b></b>be entitled to the full payment under the eco scheme.  Farmers with values of between 131 kg and 170 kg per hectare should probably be paid at a lower rate.  People seeking a derogation should be excluded from the scheme, as should farmers with values below 50 kg per hectare, especially those on low land, as they are not doing anything.  Those who can sit at home and do not need to put on their wellies and go out to do work should not be getting money.  There are fellows out there - this is coming down the track - who can lease their land and entitlements and sit back.  They should not be getting a lot of CAP money.  That is all I can say.  Mr. Punch is more technical than I am if members have questions.  I thank them for listening to us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#F00200"><p>Deputy Carthy raised a very important point about smallholdings with high payments per hectare.  This is critical.  Those smallholders are getting caught up in this, as they were in the past.  We have a very clear view.  We need targeted schemes.  As I stated, we must ensure there are more targeted schemes in Pillar 2 co-funded by the Government.  For example, we must ensure we get the payment under the suckler cow scheme up to &euro;300 per cow and get a proper payment of up to &euro;30 per ewe as well.  It is important to note the structure of farms here compared with many of the larger countries in the European Union.  We have hedgerows and smaller fields.  We have an excellent farm structure for sequestering carbon.  Outside of the CAP, we are the only group in society that can help in the whole climate change debate.  For generations, farmers have been sequestering carbon in hedgerows and grassland.  A new payment must be developed around that as well to help farmers in smaller farms to continue farming.</p> <p>  Deputy Carthy asked a question about capping.  We are in favour of capping but there must be an allowance for all farm labour, including that provided by family members.  If a farmer leases entitlements, that is a cost as well and it must be included.  I will ask Mr. Buckley to give a view on GAEC 9.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tadhg Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#F00300"><p>GAEC 9 specifically relates to the percentage of land that is dedicated to non-productive features.  Originally, it was proposed that it would just be for arable land but there is now potential for it to be extended to all land.  The key message on GAEC 9 and the other conditions as well is that there must be flexibility at member state level to ensure that when we apply GAECs at a member state level, it is done in an appropriate fashion that minimises the impact on farmers.  For instance, in the context of GAEC 9, more than 6% of all the land in Ireland is under hedgerows or individual trees.  As Mr. Cullinan mentioned, hedgerows sequester significant amounts of carbon.  That should be taken into account when we are looking at non-productive areas.  GAECs must be applied in an appropriate manner at member state level.  We cannot take a GAEC and make it even more-----</p></speech>

Such are the joys of rural broadband.</p><p> To refer to Senator Paul Daly's question, the 2019 national farm survey showed that only 34% of farmers were viable and a future CAP cannot increase the number of unviable farmers.  That is the key message I would take from that.  The 34% figure is shockingly low but it cannot be allowed go any lower.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McCormack" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#G00200"><p>I thank Deputy Carthy for the question.  It is a long time since I first met the Deputy.  He was a Member of the European Parliament at the time and the topic of significance on the agenda to me on the day was the fact that the small family farm structure was losing out under convergence.  I dealt with that matter in answer to Senator Daly's question.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy Carthy for his acknowledgement that we had courage to put a figure on a cap.  In that context, we felt, after a great deal of discussion, that &euro;60,000 would be a reasonable.  That would afford some level of distribution but we have to examine the envelope available to the people earning below the national average.  In the last round of CAP reform, negotiations we saw people with single farm payments of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;12,000 having their payments cut while those on &euro;40,000, &euro;50,000 and &euro;60,000 got increases.  We need to keep that in mind also.</p> <p>  Another contributor mentioned that dairy farmers are more profitable.  The facts are - and this was alluded to by the same speaker - that other sectors are in a position to get income from off-farm employment.  In the vast majority of cases, dairy farming is very much a full-time job.  Direct payments in challenging years - and we are in a time of volatility - have contributed up to 37% of overall income on dairy farms.  By no means should members be of the view that dairy farmers can survive without the single farm payment or any cut to the payment.  That cannot happen, irrespective of whether it hovers between 20% and 37%.</p> <p>  There is a lot of discussion about non-productive land but the reality is that for the past five to seven years, come the middle of October, the one issue that keeps the ICMSA office extremely busy is people being penalised for having rushes, dock leaves or habitats.  The committee's next forum in an hour's time is with officials from the Department.  We need to have them on board to ensure that farmers are not penalised if they have those habitats.</p> <p>  Equally, we need to see environmental schemes under Pillar 2 that are available and attractive to the family dairy farm units.  As we move forward, the more farmers we get into environmental schemes under Pillar 2, the better.  There was a great gr&aacute;, and I know it was the initial scheme, for the old style rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  When this Government was formed, there was a good deal of hope that we would see a scheme similar to that.  Unfortunately, we have not seen that in the pilot scheme that has been launched, which is going to be very targeted.  We need to see environmental schemes that attract all farmers, including commercial and dairy farmers.</p></speech>

A number of Deputies and Senators wish to contribute.  Unfortunately, Covid-19 has imposed restrictions on us timewise.  Many issues have been raised and I believe we will end up adjourning this discussion to a date in the near future.  I will take questions from a number of Senators and Deputies and then revert to the organisations for their responses.  I call Senator Lombard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#G00400"><p>I welcome all the farming organisations to this important meeting to discuss setting out the parameters with regard to CAP and where we will be in the next few years.  How we define the active farmer will probably be the decisive statement in this proposal and ensuring that the active farmer on the ground is sustainable into the future.  That will be a major issue for the farming organisations and for farming communities.</p><p>All of us involved in the farming industry know there is a cohort of farmers who are in many ways armchair farmers living off CAP payments continuously.  Some of us have been renting entitlements from such individuals for many years.</p><p> The big issue for the farming community is how we can take everyone along this road because there will be a significant backlash if there is a proposal to move away from the definition of "active farmer".  It is a matter of how we can take all the farming organisations along with us on this road.  Addressing the issue of retired farmers in their 70s, 80s and 90s claiming single farm payments back through land leasing is going to be one of the key factors in determining how we can make progress and manage the whole system.  There will be significant pain for everyone.  That is probably the thorniest issue we will deal with.</p><p> Convergence is probably another issue.  In my part of the world in Cork, people say convergence means taking the money from the south and east and moving it to the north and west.  That is effectively what is proposed as part of convergence.  It would have a huge knock-on effect for economic farming and farming that involves supplying to co-operatives and other societies that keep our food industry going.  It is a sustainability issue for farming.  That main issue will be that of how we can have a sustainable farming sector.  The payments received from Europe ensure that it is sustainable.  Unfortunately, we can all see the demographic trends.  Young people are going out of farming for quality of life and financial reasons.  Therefore, how can we make sure that, if there is convergence, there will be sustainable farming in the areas in question and that young people will get involved in the farming community?  I am 44 now and I would say I am the fourth youngest farmer in my parish.  That is a poor reflection on what would be a really good farming part of the world.  It is because of what is happening in society itself.  If we were to move large numbers of entitlements, what would be the knock-on effect for the relevant areas?  What would be the major knock-on effect for the agriculture industry and the island's food dynamic?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#H00200"><p>I will be brief because I really want to hear the witnesses.</p> <p>  It is important that we get a message out from this meeting today that the new CAP is focusing on delivering better environmental outcomes.  No one is in doubt about that and no one is disputing it.  It is not that farmers or the agricultural community are against that.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on the alignment of the new CAP with what is the European Green Deal.  That is the political reality we are in.  While we are talking here as politicians and while the witnesses are representatives of the agriculture community, the Government and our representatives at the table in Brussels ultimately need to be aware that there is a commitment cost to the green deal.  It has to be compatible and aligned with any reform of the CAP.  That is important and nobody is doubting it.  The written submission of the president of the IFA states farmers who do not participate in the ecosystems could lose 30% of their single farm payment and that this is completely unacceptable and ignores the huge efforts of these farmers.  I agree with the IFA on that.  The witnesses might tease it out.  I am interested in hearing how we can align the commitment to the EU green deal with a reformed CAP.  That is the concise question to which I would like to hear responses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#H00300"><p>I have been involved with farming organisations down through the years.  Coming up to CAP negotiations, I have always considered the smaller farmer, the farmer who is finding it hard to survive.  Quite a lot of farmers will say they are finding it hard to survive but the smaller ones certainly are.</p><p>I listened to Mr. Kelleher speaking along the lines of what I have been saying for years.  Many farmers get less than &euro;10,000 in farm payments and are barely able to survive.  There are CAP negotiations, with much promise, but farmers will gain about &euro;200 or &euro;300 in payments.  We have to work towards a system whereby any farmer earning less than &euro;10,000 will have their payments brought up to &euro;10,000, while anyone earning more than that should be fully protected.  The sum of &euro;10,000 is small money for survival on a family farm and to try to rear a family on a farm.  There was much discussion prior to the election that the new rates should be nothing less than &euro;10,000, but now it looks as if it will be &euro;4,700 in new rates.  It will be an appalling position for farmers to find themselves in if they have to pay for a farm planner and whatever other payments from that sum.  It will be hardly worth applying for.  There is talk of &euro;11 million being moved from the east to the west, which will affect parts of my home county of Cork.</p><p> I would like to hear much more from farming organisations this year about the survival of the small family farm and about where the payments should be focused going forward.  Those who are receiving massive payments need to come down to some kind of a fair level.  I understand they have significant costs too and I respect that, but the survival of the small man and woman on the farm certainly needs to be a greater focus for us going forward in the context of the new CAP.  I am interested in hearing from the organisations and I thank their representatives for attending but we need to put a greater focus on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cullinan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#J00200"><p>Senator Lombard made some excellent points.  I am clear on the definition of an "active farmer".  It is anybody who works on a farm.  That is very important.  The Senator referred to "armchair farmers", a term I do not like.  We have to look at this and be serious about it.  We have one budget now.  If a farmer is at the point in his or her life where he or she decides not to farm any longer and to lease out his or her entitlements, and if that continues on an ongoing basis, we have to look at that.  People have worked hard to earn those entitlements but there needs to be a trading system whereby the farmer could sell those entitlements.  The Government has to step up as well from a capital allowance point of view.  The money received for the sale of those entitlements would have to be tax free.  It is very important that we examine the issue.</p> <p>  As for how we take people down the road in the context of convergence and sustainability, there are three pillars, the first of which relates to economics.  For a farm to be viable, it has to be economical and there has to be a return for what the farmer is doing.  The second pillar is societal, which is very important.  In this review, we want to be very careful in regard to that issue in order that we will be able to sustain and maintain farmers in rural Ireland.  If we have learned any lesson from what has happened in our society in the past year, that is critical.  Third, on the environmental pillar, we are up to doing what we have to do as farmers to deal with the environmental measures coming down the tracks.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan also made some excellent points.  The new CAP is being aligned to the green new deal, the farm to fork strategy and the biodiversity plan.  It is worth remembering that those measures are aspirational and there is no legislation on them as yet, but I could not agree more that the pressure coming onto us for more green farming will cost a great deal.  The Senator mentioned eco-schemes, an issue on which I am very clear.  This is another cut.  We are speaking about convergence but the European Commission and the Government are talking about anything from 20% to 30% of the Pillar 1 payment.</p><p> The history of the payments is that they were introduced in Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome of 1957.  The money was put in place to protect farm incomes and provide food security.  That is important.  We have been producing cheap food for the consumers of Europe since then and the money has been used for that.  There is now a huge shift and the money is being moved away from protecting farmers who are producing food to protecting the environment.  We will deal with that matter but we have been telling the Government consistently that we need an economic impact assessment on the cost this change will have for farming.  That message needs to go out from here today.  Before we sign up to any agreement at the end of the year, I want to see such an assessment.  I have asked the Minister on several occasions to do that.  It needs to happen immediately.  The only assessment that we have sight of at the moment is from the United States Department of Agriculture, which has shown it will have a serious impact on farmer's incomes, anything up to 15% or 20%.</p><p> Deputy Michael Collins said that a farmer needs to be getting a minimum of &euro;10,000.  If we look at the situation at the moment and bring this back to reality, the average payment is less than &euro;9,500.  That is where we are at.  Some livestock farmers are depending on payments because those payments are 160% of their income.  That is the reality of where we are at.  All of those things must be taken into account by the Government when it is signing up to this new CAP reform.</p></speech>

We have farm-to-fork and biodiversity strategies.  At the same time, we have an EU Commission that is proposing the Mercosur deal.  On the one hand, the Commission wants to impose new restrictions on family farms in Ireland, France, etc., while, at the same time, it wants to import 100,000 tonnes of extra beef from Mercosur countries.  It is important for us to call out these contradictions because we cannot have it both ways.  The Commission is, to an extent, trying to have it both ways.</p> <p>  Mr. Cullinan mentioned sustainability, which has economic, social and environmental components.  The complete focus of the Commission and our Government is on the environment.  We understand the environmental challenges but there seems to be a complete absence of examining what is going on economically on farms and what is going on socially in rural areas.  We must have an economic assessment of what these strategies are going to do to countries such as Ireland, France, etc.  Those topics are conveniently ignored by the people who bring forward these strategies.  The green deal is suggesting that we are going to put 25% of land into organic production.  The reality is that if we do that, it will destroy the organic market for the people who are in it at the moment.  It will turn it into a commodity.  Many of these sorts of ideas seem great on paper but they will be a disaster from a farming perspective.</p> <p>  The Commission publishes all these strategies while, at the same time, cutting the CAP budget.  To listen to some of these conversations, one would think that farmers are doing nothing for the environment at the moment.  People tend to forget that we have had agri-environment schemes in this country since 1994.   We have had cross-compliance since 1994.  A considerable amount is being done on Irish farms regarding the environment and we are not getting the acknowledgement for it.  We recognise the need for increased environmental ambition but we cannot expect farmers to pay for it all.  If we, as a society, want increased environmental ambition, it comes at a cost.  Sustainable food comes at a cost.  One cannot expect farmers to bear that cost while they are getting the same prices they got 30 years ago.  There are decisions to be made by politicians at both European and national level.  If we want all this sustainability, the system is going to have to pay for it because we cannot expect farmers to pay for it.</p></speech>

I agree that the first &euro;10,000 of one's envelope should be exempt from convergence.  That would take a lot of the pain out for the smaller family farm structure.  The Deputy and Senator Lombard were right in their comments that convergence is moving money west but I would say it is moving money from the more productive areas.</p><p>Obviously, food production and farming activity brought these payments to the country.  As I mentioned earlier, we are in a time of volatility and this has helped underpin all sectors of agriculture in difficult times in the past.  We will not have that support into the future, which makes the rural economies very vulnerable.  </p></speech>

In fairness, they are talking about money travelling from the east to the west of Cork.  It probably happens a bit but ten years ago, it would have been the other way.  Let us remember that going back to the Treaty of Rome, this money was to help family farms in rural Ireland.  A lot of this money came into disadvantaged areas in respect of suckling beef cow headage payments and all that.  Over the years, it has moved away.  Many smaller farmers in the beef and sheep sectors and small tillage farmers are suffering and their payments are very low.  When we look at big dairy farmers and big enterprises that are profitable - four times more profitable according to the Teagasc figures - we can see that they are getting the same single farm payment or in many cases, way more.  That cannot be fair or logical.  We make no apology in calling for the larger share of eco schemes and other money to be given to the smaller farmers who find it hard to make a living, such as sheep and beef farmers and suckler cow farmers.  We propose that in Pillar 2, the agri scheme should deliver real benefits to participating farmers.  If they carry out the full range of measures, they should get something up to &euro;15,000.  In respect of the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, between farmers' trouble, time and planning, they are only making Mickey Mouse money.  It is a waste of time.  If farmers do not get some reasonable payment for doing all this work such as planning and paying planners, they will not participate any more because the day when farmers cannot stay working for nothing has come.  They must get a reasonable income from participating in schemes.  This idea of income foregone, costs incurred is a load of rubbish.  No farmer will work for nothing.  If he or she cannot get it at home, he or she will have go away and get it somewhere else.  I will refer back to Mr. Punch if he is there.</p></speech>

It was stated that only 34% of farms are viable.  For the record, viable farms are defined by Teagasc as farms that can support a labour unit.  The vast majority of farms are in the sustainable and vulnerable sector.  For those farmers, convergence would be make a difference when it comes to making them more sustainable - and not before time.</p><p>We are back where payments are linked to historic references dating back to 2001 and 2002.  I suppose it is getting the mix right.</p><p> Senator Boyhan was wondering about the alignment of the CAP and the European Green Deal.  Designations on land as a way of ensuring environmental dividends does not work.  It has not worked in the past.  The Natura 2000 designations have been a failure for both the farmer and the environment.  Reports back to the Commission from the National Parks and Wildlife Service shows a deterioration in all the habitats that were supposed to be pristine and in good condition and to keep them as such.  Therefore, that has not worked for Ireland.  I am afraid where we are going down here again under the biodiversity strategy will not work for farmers.  It has proven not to work in the past.  The previous document, the prioritised action framework document that was signed off by Government as an assessment tool for funding for areas under designation, has no mention of the biodiversity strategy or the impact of it.</p><p> Mr. Cullinan spoke about an assessment of the impact of the farm to fork and, indeed, the biodiversity strategy and this needs to be done.  Now is the time to ensure that we do not have a situation where as a result of a proposal in the Council's position under GAEC 2, it slides off the land and leaves it that it has to come back in under a derogation to be paid on.  In the Department's presentation, it is assuring the Houses that these areas will be eligible for CAP payments.  To receive those CAP payments, they have to be deemed not to be an agricultural area.  This is unprecedented.  This is the first time this has happened in the history of the State.  The committee has been informed of the potential here.  Derogations do not work.  They come and they go.  Such fundamental change here will have adverse effects.  I cannot overstress that.</p></speech>

I have a few questions for them.  Are they united that it is a worrying development that for the first time in 20 or 25 years there is a different meaning for both mineral soils and peaty soils when farmers seek single farm payment eligibility?  Are they concerned about that?  I want to hear clearly whether they are all opposed to this and at one in making it clear to the Minister that they will not accept this on behalf of farmers.  Are they agreed, as one, about derogations?  No more than what we have seen, we saw it with turf years ago in one that never existed and we saw it with water when there was a debacle about water.  We have seen approximately ten different derogations to a member state.  Bear in mind, this is not to a farmer.  This is to the member state.  As things go down the road, the witnesses should bear one issue in mind.  I have a Commission document in my possession. I had a meeting with the INHFA last week and I gave Mr. O'Donnell a copy of it.  There is a document that states - Pillar 2 is where I can see many farmers getting sucked in - one will have to do X, Y and Z, be it under an environmental scheme, under eco-schemes or whatever, and one will go do that road but there will be no going back to having that land as eligible for single farm payment.  Then this so-called other system, called a derogation, will kick in.</p><p> The Department will argue that it is not a derogation but I have a document in my possession proving that it is a derogation.  Are the witnesses concerned that, as a result of this new system, huge areas of the country will be under pressure, from Donegal right down to Kerry and places such as Cavan, Monaghan, Westmeath, areas of Wicklow, parts of where Michael Collins is from in Cork and Tipperary?  Senator Lombard made reference to the payment system but the first thing we need to do is get this sorted.  This is the part of CAP that must be sorted.  If farmers go outside the system in the context of the derogation, assuming the derogation is renewed, they will end up in trouble in ten or 15 year's time, when the guys in the farming organisations and we politicians have moved on.  We saw what happened with the animal medicines issue.  We know what Ireland had and what we had to do but now we are caught in a snare.</p><p> Are the witnesses at one in saying that they are not accepting this?  Do they agree that farmers in Donegal, in the Golden Vale or in County Meath must be treated as one when they apply for their single farm payment and that this new system of derogation under GAEC is not acceptable?  We can debate this at length and I would argue with Senator Lombard that for the last 25 years, there was an economic effect on farmers in the west and north west because of a lack of money received from Europe.  That could be said about farmers right around the country but they were definitely down the ladder a bit.  This is a bigger picture and I would worry about it.  Do any of the witnesses think that if this land is taken out of the main single farm payment criteria, down the road it will be moved under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in terms of biodiversity?  We must look at all of this together.  Ireland has signed up to the 2030 biodiversity strategy which will see 30% of the country designated.  That is what we have committed to through the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  Approximately 10% of that will be an area that we will not even put our foot on.  With the best will in the world, we can look for as much State land as possible but that will be gone by the wayside.  In terms of the bigger picture, if we take this land out and declare that it is not eligible under the normal CAP but that there is a derogation, down the road it will come under the biodiversity strategy.</p><p> I have a question for the witnesses and the Department.  I saw a reference in the document from Europe to the effect that farmers will not be allowed to open drains or do certain works on their land.  Where are we going in the context of marginal land if we cannot clean a drain or do things like that?  Are the farming organisations at one in terms of rejecting this?  The Minister can make the decision to try to have this removed.</p></speech>

I have a question for each of the farming organisations, the first of which is for the INHFA.  There are farmers in my constituency in Tipperary with a stake in this problem and it is sad to see that, judging by the approach being taken here, all of the work they and their forefathers have put into their businesses could potentially be wiped out at the stroke of a pen.  We need to be certain that any measures taken in the context of the environment do not deliberately or inadvertently lead to irreversible and negative consequences for farmers and their livelihoods.</p><p>Is this uncertainty having an impact on these farms in making plans for the future?  If it is, the damage is already done and that message needs to be passed on to everybody involved in the negotiations.  We continually hear about the move away from supporting farm incomes and production towards environmental demands, and this was mentioned again in the IFA's opening statement.  I am sure we all agree that the best way forward to advance good land management is to bring the farmers along with us.  We are talking today about certain types of lands potentially losing agricultural status.  The IFA noted that if these matters result in negative consequences for our farmers, they will also have a social impact on rural Ireland.  I would like the association to highlight the seriousness of this issue.  Will Mr. Cullinan comment on the implications of this kind of an approach for rural Ireland in general?  Is it properly thought out?</p><p>The ICMSA representatives spoke about the EU food supply chain not functioning properly.  Will they comment on how planning issues within our country are having an impact on dairy production?  We have seen this in Belview.  Is the association concerned that this could set a precedent in the years to come as we face into the new CAP and the post-Brexit environment?  Does it have any suggestions with regard to the areas that need to be cleared up here so that these issues will not arise again?</p></speech>

The issue on which I will focus is that of good agricultural and environmental conditions with specific regard to the high-carbon soils that make up a large part of my part of the country: peatland soils.  In its submission to the committee, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine tells us that there is absolutely nothing to worry about here and that an effective derogation is available at the national level.  In the past, we have seen what happened with derogations in respect of veterinary medicines.  We also see it with regard to the nitrates directive at the moment.  The derogation from this directive is vital to the operation of agricultural practice across the country.  It is important to remind members that our part of the country was designated as a nitrate vulnerable zone to facilitate agricultural production in the southern half of the country, where we did not have issues with regard to nitrates.  We now have to farm by calendar to facilitate agricultural production in other parts of the country.  That must be remembered as we discuss all of this.  The levels of intensity in some parts of the country are a direct result of farmers facilitating the designation of the whole country as a nitrate vulnerable zone, which I believe was wrong.  However, because of this, we now have to farm by calendar.</p> <p>  The key issue in respect of all of these derogations is that the derogation has to be invoked by the Minister of the day.  That Minister decides whether he or she wants to utilise that derogation.  Depending on the political make-up of a particular Government, the Minister may decide not to invoke that derogation.  I have had personal experience in the past of the Commission putting pressure on me, as a Minister, not to invoke particular provisions to facilitate another agenda.  We cannot allow peatland soils to be singled out, whether today or in the future.  There needs to be a commitment from all farm organisations that they will not allow peatland soils to be singled out either through the facilitation of a derogation, through a new Irish land use policy being developed down the road or through future interpretations of good agricultural and environmental conditions that would result in these peatland soils being restricted in agricultural practice.</p><p>We need to address this issue now because, as was stated, it may not happen in the current round of CAP, but we will be impacted by this in the future.  It will have a significant impact across large swathes of the country if this principle is broken in differentiating between peatland and non-peatland soil.</p></speech>

I ask the representatives to be as brief as possible because we are eating into the time allocated for discussion with representatives of the Department of Agriculture and the Marine.  I will go to Mr. Cullinan first.</p></speech>

I could not agree more with the point made by Deputy Fitzmaurice.  If one goes down the road of derogation, it is a slippery slope.  Deputy Naughten referred the nitrates derogation, where one must go back year after year to reapply for derogation.  I am clear that, in the context of these carbon-rich soils, we cannot have a system for one type of farming and another system for the other type of farming.  In fairness to the Deputy, I recall working with him in 2004 and 2005 on the issue of nitrates.  We did not go for zones but, rather, for the country as a whole.  Our position is clear that that is where we are staying and we will fight that to the bitter end.  A clear message for the Minister is that he cannot divide the country.  The same agricultural practice has to follow through.</p> <p>  Deputy Browne raised the issue of divergence in the context of taking farmers' income to support environmental measures.  As was stated earlier, in the dry stock sector, anything from 130% to 160% of farmers' income comes from direct payments.  We are now being asked to do an eco-scheme.  It will impact on anything from 20% to 30% of the direct Pillar 1 payment that was put in place to compensate farmers for producing cheap food.  We are nine months out from signing off on this but the Department and the Minister have given us no clues as to what we have to do.  We have no problem working with the environment.  We have been doing so for many years, playing our part.  We are the actors in the chain who will play our part in the future on climate change, but we need fair play on this.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

A derogation of any form, whether it is nitrates or in any other way, creates uncertainty and bureaucracy.  Over time, we have seen with the nitrates derogation that the bar rises.  That may also answer the question asked by Deputy Naughten.</p> <p>  As regards the point raised by Deputy Browne on the EU supply chain malfunctioning, we represent primary producers who are receiving a price that they received 30 or 35 years ago.  All other sectors along the food supply chain increase or maintain their margin while the margin of the primary producer is eroded.</p> <p>  The Deputy alluded to the Belview plant.  We met the Taoiseach last week on that particular issue, as well as the Minister for Agriculture and the Marine.  It has put the industry and, in particular, that process and entity, at a crossroads.  It is a juncture at which it had not expected to find itself.  The consequences could be widespread in the country and, equally, could be drastic across rural Ireland.  Since the abolition of quotas, we have seen a vibrancy, which was not present in rural Ireland for a significant period, with young people and those from other sectors transferring to dairy farming.  That could all be brought to an end very easily.  It needs to be watched very closely in the coming period.</p></speech>

Whether it is crag, mountain, good land, bad land, limestone, upland or low land, that is where he has been born and reared, and that is all he would have.  This was my argument about this.  The Deputy went on with this ineligibility and marginal land.  Marginal land is grand if one has 50 or 60 acres of good land with just a corner of marginal land.  If one has been born in a place in west Cork, south Kerry, Ballymakeery or somewhere and one is born in a place that has 60 of 70 acres of marginal land then that is all one has.  So, one cannot call it marginal land because it is all one has.  I have spent my life fighting for that principle.  Especially the more biodiverse land is now, then the more eligible it should be.  The Government wants biodiversity and habitats but then there is a lad drawing red circles around these places trying to make them ineligible.  One hand must know what the other hand is doing.  I totally agree with what was said by Deputy Fitzmaurice, in that no farmer should be discriminated against based on where he came from or what land he was born into.</p> <p>  As for different farming practices and having the same farming practices all over the country, that is not correct either because a farmer with 200 or 300 acres in County Meath or in the Golden Vale will have very different farming practices from somebody with a 100 acres on top of a mountain out west around Dingle, back around west Cork or somewhere who is trying to scrape a living from between rocks and bushes.  Yet the Department is trying to tell him that his land is not eligible any more.  I know young fellows who had the same amount of stock as their father and grandfather yet they were told that their lands were ineligible, which is totally wrong.  The more biodiverse land is then the more eligible it should be.</p></speech>

I was surprised when I got a communication from him that the Commission has proposed to count this proposed GAEC 2 derogation to ineligible hectare standard rules.  Consequently, the Commission is referring to it as a derogation at this stage.  The Minister's position will be that minimum protection is better than the Parliament's effective protection and appropriate protection by the Commission.  Anywhere, where the word "protection" is mentioned in terms of a GAEC smells like a designation to me.  Farmers will have to comply with standards of GAECs in order to get a basic income support for sustainability, to get their first year of a payment.  If this is onerous then this will leave farmers in a difficult position to build a payment in environmental measures or, indeed, in the eco scheme.  My colleague, Mr. O'Donnell, wants to make a quick point and I will leave it at that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.67" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Henry O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#Q00900"><p>It is quite heartening to hear widespread support for not having more derogations, and they are ineffective, as has been evidenced in many areas.</p> <p>  On the whole area of GAEC 2, the question must be asked what do we want.  The opening statement submitted by representatives of the Department to the Oireachtas today states "While we must await the final text before we can finalise any management requirements under GAEC 2".  To be honest, my interpretation of this is it would look as though the Minister and his Department were actually outside of this process and were awaiting a resolution.  The reality is that we are very much part of the negotiations and discussion here, and we need to step up and get this flawed wording removed.</p><p>It is not right that the Department is saying it is awaiting the final text.  It can have an input into the final text, and that is what we are seeking.  This flawed amendment, which leads to a derogation and the end of agricultural activity on peat soils, must be removed.  That is what INHFA is seeking here.  Referring to the Department's statement again, GAEC 2 standard is lumped in with eco schemes, landscape features and issues under GAEC 9.  That is not what is in this Council amendment.  GAEC 2 is separated as an area of the holding.  It is not an agricultural area of the holding.  This must be acted on and the House must convey that message.</p></speech>

This is a very important issue for the organisations and their representatives made many strong points to the committee.  That is the reason for the delay.</p> <p>  We have received your opening statement and it has been circulated to the members.

They are directed that only evidence connected to the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.

The CAP was brought in to subsidise the price of food.  Why are all these different parts being put onto it which put more onerous conditions on farmers?  I am asking questions one by one.  My second question is on a document from the European Commission.  It is clearly stated in five parts of the document that under the GAEC 2 this is a derogation for member states to apply.  That is stated by the Commission.  Why then is the Department calling it an amendment?  It was highlighted earlier but at the end, under a derogation, is it not very clear that a minister applies for that?  If there is a minister who is opposed to letting farmers work in those areas where they had been farming it is entirely up to that minister.</p> <p>  After 25 years of CAP, why are we now going down a road whereby some farmers in this country are being differentiated based on whether they have mineral soils or peat soils?  Can the officials answer that?  On top of that, in the document, it states that where a farmer would not be able to clean drains or carry out works, this sort of backdoor job would be operating.  Do the officials envisage that farmers with peaty soils will be stopped from doing certain works?  What vision does the Department have for what we will call the boggy or peaty soils, especially in the mountains?</p> <p>  Over the coming years, if we go into Pillar 2, is the Department signing up along with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to the 2030 target whereby 30% of our country will be designated and some of it will be strictly protected?  One will not get that on State land.  Are the officials working with that Department to pencil in areas which may be suitable for this?  When farmers go into Pillar 2, be it an environmental scheme or other eco schemes or another type of scheme which is brought out, if they put land into a habitat or biodiversity, will the officials guarantee that that farmer will be able to go in with a digger and pull it apart again to make it eligible for what we might call tier 1 now, of being able to apply for a single farm payment?  I ask because obviously under this proposed new system there is going to be a two-tier system.  I ask that the officials answer those questions one by one.</p></speech>

In this particular case farmers who are struggling to make a living are actually trying to ensure their land is not being stripped of agricultural status.  That is effectively going to lock them out of farming and the supports they need to survive.  The offer of a possible derogation is misleading and could actually draw them into a situation of carrying out these actions, which make farming impossible and which they fear may not be reversible in future.  They need to see measures being taken by the Minister to assure them that what is being done is not deliberate.</p> <p>  In County Tipperary our farmers are responsible for some of the most picturesque and environmentally rich lands which fall under the GAEC conditions.  However, there is an issue of trust there.  I have three or four questions.</p><p>As the witnesses will be aware, farmers in Tipperary with lands in the Galtee and Knockmealdown mountains are concerned that the technicalities of what we are talking about today are going to trip them and the Department up and that will have huge consequences.  In addition, farmers on commonages are concerned that if the technical details under GAEC 2 are not properly thought out that could result in a decision by one farmer to meet the GAEC 2 conditions, meaning that it will also be imposed upon others nearby without them having a say.  Can the representatives from the Department confirm that this issue has been addressed?  Will the officials confirm if they have relayed the concerns of our farmers to their counterparts elsewhere in the EU?  Will they also negotiate a way to give long-term assurances to those farmers not signing away their land concerning their ability to actively farm forever?  Is it possible to give those assurances to farmers?</p></speech>

I begin with some overall comments from my perspective regarding the overall direction in which we are travelling in this regard.  I will ask for further input from colleagues, including Ms Murphy and Mr. Keating, on some of the more technical elements as we go through the process of answering the questions.</p> <p>  I start with some of the points made initially by Deputy Fitzmaurice.  Concerning the CAP originally subsidising the price of food and why these additional conditions or further requirements are now being imposed on farmers, the only way I can answer that query is by looking at the evolution of the CAP itself over the past 20 to 30 years.  It would certainly have been introduced essentially as a means to provide support for the sector in the form of market supports or subsidies to support the price of different food products.  However, that of course led to problems over the early part of the CAP.  We have since seen changes in what the CAP does in recent years and a move to much more of a market orientation for the CAP and away from direct price support, if we want to call it that.  The CAP has now moved more towards market orientation and supporting farmers through a type of income support structure, as it is now essentially, which provides a foundation then for farmers to respond to the demands of the market and the requirements of the wider development of the industry, and for them to feed into that wider development.  </p> <p>  That market orientation has characterised the CAP over the past 15 to 20 years, and I suppose gradually over the latest period.  We have also seen an increasing environmental dimension to the CAP in recent years.  That environmental dimension and focus is, if anything, intensifying.  It has been doing so in recent years and it is going to intensify more in the future because there are major pressures from consumers globally concerning expectations of environmental standards associated with food production.  In addition, there has been an impact from the targets we have set for ourselves domestically in the climate action plan, as well as in respect of the targets set at European concerning the green deal and the farm-to-fork and biodiversity strategies now in place.  There must also be consideration of the expectations of stakeholders and of people generally who have an interest in ensuring that farming and food production takes place in an environmentally sustainable way.  I think that aspect will continue to characterise the CAP in future and there is an increasing focus in that area.  </p> <p>  These extra conditions or requirements to which Deputy Fitzmaurice referred are, therefore, a reflection of the way the CAP is evolving.  It is a reflection of the hugely increased environmental pressure regarding the standards we must meet and the level of ambition we must try to achieve.  We are, however, trying to do that, and member states and the parliament have been trying to do this on the basis of continuing to support farm incomes while also endeavouring to redirect the CAP to support these market-oriented and environmental objectives.  Income support obviously remains a key objective of the CAP and that will continue to inform the reform process in future.</p> <p>  Another point touched on regarding expenditure and farm incomes concerns the budgetary negotiations and where we stand regarding the budget we have for the next CAP.  We have seen, for example, a slight increase overall in Ireland's budget for the CAP and a slight decrease on-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Savage" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#U00200"><p>Of course.  With the Chairman's permission, I am happy to move to the other questions that were raised.  With regard to GAEC 2 and differentiating between peat soils or providing a derogation for member states, for example, I can make some general comments before leaving it open for colleagues to provide some detail.  There are a number of different provisions within the regulations that provide for the management of soils and the maintenance of what we call eligible hectare.  There are a couple of different elements.  The GAEC 2 is a new requirement that is coming in as part of conditionality and the protection of wetlands and peatlands.  It is clear that this new requirement is coming in as part of CAP reform.  It is linked to provisions in the regulations, specifically Article 12 and Article 4 in particular.</p> <p>  Article 12 makes it clear that member states must define the GAEC standards in accordance with their own local farming conditions.  Member states set the standard that must be achieved under each of the GAECs.  It is up to member states themselves, subject to compliance with the overall regulatory framework, to decide the level at which the bar should be set in terms of management to fulfil GAEC requirements.  In the case of GAEC 2, for example, there are different approaches in the wording from the Commission, the Parliament and the European Council.  The Council's wording speaks about minimum protection of wetlands and peatlands by 2025 at the latest.  It is up to the member states to decide the minimum level of protection they want to set as part of the implementation of that GAEC.  Therefore, we have freedom at member state level to set the requirement in accordance with our local conditions.  This is under the article and it is clear it is the member states' responsibility and there is flexibility in doing this.</p> <p>  Article 4, meanwhile, goes into some detail on the definition of eligible land.  There are a number of different elements to that.  One of the elements referred to is the possibility of land that would continue to be considered eligible despite the fact that something may be done on that land in the context of implementing a GAEC 2 requirement.  If the land were to become ineligible as a result of that practice, member states could nevertheless continue to make payments on that land as if it were eligible land, essentially.</p> <p>  The key point is that this is not a derogation as such.  There is provision in the legislation.  We speak about an amendment but it is an amendment to the text that was submitted by the Commission in the first place, which speaks to the areas that would continue to be considered eligible for payments.  Under that there is specific reference made to any lands subject to a management practice under GAEC 2.  It essentially means that if anything is done in the context of GAEC 2 that might otherwise lead to land being made ineligible, it is up to member states to decide whether that is the case and they could continue to consider that land as eligible.</p> <p>  This is not a derogation.  It has been said before that we must still agree the detail of the regulations between three institutions.  Even in the context of the wording as it currently stands, there is no intention for a member state to apply for a derogation on this.  This is around member states exercising the flexibility they have been given in the regulations to define what is required under the standard.  In the context of doing that or implementing GAEC 2, for example, if a member state made a requirement under GAEC 2 that would otherwise render lands ineligible, the member state could still treat those lands as eligible and pay on them as eligible lands.  It is at member states' discretion.</p> <p>  Ultimately, this is about providing the framework within which member states can make a decision.  In our case we will look at local conditions, as other member states would do, in order to set a standard under GAEC 2.  We want to be able to do that in a way that is manageable and which upholds our obligations to comply with GAEC 2 while giving the scope to build on that with potential ecological schemes.</p></speech>

I do not have sight directly of the document he is talking about.  People can use easy phrases such as "derogation" to describe what is quite a complex matter.  Looking purely at the text of the regulation as it stands, with both the Council amendments and the European Parliament's amendments, it can be quite complex to navigate through it and to follow through the different sub-components of those articles, particularly Article 4, which is quite dense in its definition or setting out of the requirements surrounding an eligible hectare.  It is easy to refer to that as a derogation.</p> <p>  Again, not having sight of the document the Deputy is talking about directly, I am saying, looking at the layout of the text in the regulation as it stands, including the changes the Council had proposed, that what is being set out is that member states have the flexibility to define and set the standard in GAEC 2.  If, as part of the process of setting that standard, land were to be made ineligible, in accordance with the normal consideration of land being eligible for payment, then member states would have the ability to continue to consider those lands eligible for payment.  I think that is where the derogation piece comes in.  That is where people refer to it as derogation, but it is up to member states themselves to continue to treat those lands as eligible for payment.  That will very much depend on what member states decide to do as part of the requirement for GAEC 2.  As I said, we will look at that in the context of complying with the requirement but also leaving scope for further development and further actions on those lands under eco schemes and under Pillar 2.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#V00600"><p>I thank the Department officials for being present.  I want to go back to the issue of GAEC 2.  If we look at the different negotiating positions, small word changes can make a big impact.  I know this from my time in Europe.  When one moves from &quot;eligible area&quot; to &quot;agricultural land&quot; or <i>vice versa</i>, or when one uses the word &quot;minimum&quot; or &quot;appropriate&quot;, the words can have very different impacts.  As it stands, in the context of the Council position, what will that mean from the Department's perspective in respect of farmers' Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 entitlements?  Can an absolute guarantee be provided that those payments will be secure beyond the timeframe of the next CAP and into the future?  The Department will understand, I am sure, the concerns many farmers will have because, whether or not we call it a derogation, we will all have heard the stories of farmers with Natura 2000 lands, with a derogation in place that allows for land to be deemed ineligible, and the very negative experience many have had.  In 2007, of 927 farmers assessed, only 13 were deemed eligible.  The Department can therefore see why there will be a lot of concern about this.  We want to know for sure from the Department's perspective what this will actually mean and the change it will make for farmers.</p><p>I was interested in listening to the Department and talking about the additionality in terms of the requirements of what CAP is expected to deliver.  Obviously, it has moved beyond just market supports and income supports to environmental protection.  The question I get asked probably the most, particularly in counties where there are high levels of designation, is why the farmlands that do the most in terms of carbon sequestration, biodiversity and environmental protection receive the lowest amount per hectare in payments?  As far as the Department is concerned, how does that add up in the context of the definitions that have been outlined?</p><p>We had a discussion, which I hope the witnesses heard, in the previous hour about the issues of convergence and capping.</p><p>It would be useful if the committee could get a sense from the Department today as to where it stands and where it believes the next CAP will allow for flexibility.  For example, if we are moving towards convergence will it allow a front-loaded payment to be made to address some of the concerns raised about smaller landholders who traditionally might have higher eligibility?  Could we move towards a flat-rate payment that is front-loaded on the first 30 ha?  Could we get a sense from the Department as to where it stands on the negotiations on an upper limit on payment that would allow for redistribution back to some of those lower-paid farmers?  At what level would the Department like to see that cap set?  What, if any, flexibility would it allow?  We know some of the flexibility mentioned would dismiss and disregard capping because it is so broad that farm enterprises would continue to be able to receive six-figure sums.</p><p> I have several more short questions and if there is not enough time to answer them I would appreciate a written response later.  With regard to the organic farming scheme, in response to a parliamentary question I submitted I saw that the Department has set itself a target of having 7.5% of land in the organic farming scheme within the term of this CAP, which is far below the EU average.  Is this to suggest that between 2025 and 2030, the Department expects the percentage to move from 7.5% to the EU target of 25%?  Do the witnesses believe this is attainable?  With regard to the new agri-environmental scheme, we are told approximately &euro;200 million a year has been paid in recent years.  We have been told a carbon tax fund of &euro;1.5 billion has been promised to add to the scheme.  Will the officials confirm the number of places intended to be delivered per year, considering that the Minister told us recently the average payment will be &euro;4,700?  If we know the average payment, surely we have a sense of the number of places that will be provided.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.87" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#W00200"><p>I thank the departmental officials.  I will be very brief.  Most of what was raised in our first session that needed to be brought to this session has been raised by Deputies Fitzmaurice and Carthy.  I would like to gain a little bit of an insight as to how the Department is approaching the negotiations.  Based on what we have been told by the INHFA in particular, what is the viewpoint of the Department when it comes to good agricultural environmental conditions, in particular high carbon soils?</p> <p>  To be devil's advocate, and I do not want it to go out that I am condoning this or that I am in favour of it, if we have to go down this road somewhat, what preparation has the Department done?  How will it differentiate between soils?  In my area there is a lot of land with two extreme soils in the one field.  The best of land backs down to a bog.  In a 10-acre field there could be 8 acres of the finest agricultural soil with 2 acres down at the bottom that are well drained and getting farmed in the same way as the higher ground.  How will the Department differentiate in this case?  To reiterate, I am being devil's advocate.  In the worst-case scenario, if farmers are not allowed claim a single payment on this type of soil what other compensation will they get?  How will carbon credits, sequestration and carbon storage envisaged for the land be offset in the agriculture sector?  How will Irish agriculture as a whole gain from this sacrifice, for want of a better word?  How is the Department approaching this?</p><p>Another issue that came up was with regard to the discussion about convergence and the genuine farmer.  Robin Hood was mentioned in the previous session.  Rob the rich to pay the poor was the Robin Hood outlook.  In this case, it seems we are robbing the poor to pay the rich.  We also robbing the poor to pay the poor.  If we go back to the reference years, where a farmer had above average payments, in particular a small farmer, that is a sign that he was an active farmer at the time.  He was claiming the subsidies and schemes and he was working hard.  Now he is being punished to pay his neighbour who may not have been nearly as active as a farmer.  There is a major contradiction there when we talk about active farmers and convergence in the current conversation.  I would like a comment on that.</p></speech>

On every farm, there are what one would consider a few wet acres, to say the least.  Will we work on electoral districts?  Will we work on townlands?  Every townland has a different soil type.  It will be interesting to see if we can put in place a system for the different soil types that will work on the ground.  Will a survey of every field in the country be proposed?  How will the work be done on the ground?  I know from my part of the world that Senator Daly is right and one has different soil types in different fields, or even in the same field, depending on where it leads.  That is a major issue.</p> <p>  The definition of "active farmer" and how that plays into this debate will be a defining moment for the CAP.  Does "active farmer" mean somebody who is actively farming the land or someone who owns the land?  What level of activity is required to be an active farmer?  Will we see holdings purchase a few store cattle to be cleared as active farmers, while renting out the rest of the holding?  Will that scenario arise in the new CAP?  It has been an issue since 2002.  I was criticised for using the terminology "armchair farmer" but we have a major issue with a cohort of landowners who lease land with entitlements on a continuous basis.  The farmer who is working and farming the land is doing so to pay back the entitlements.  That is the way farming in Ireland has worked since the early 2000s and it has had a negative impact, particularly on efforts to get young people into the industry.  It has been a barrier to the younger generation building up a holding.</p></speech>

I come back first to Deputy Carthy's question on GAEC 2 and knowing for sure what that means.  The text differs at the moment depending on the point of view taken by each of the three institutions but if we work on the basis of the Council approach, which refers to a minimum protection of wetland and peatland by 2025, at the latest, the issue is where we set our minimum level of protection.  That is what it is about in terms of what this means in practice.  Member states have the flexibility to do that in accordance with local conditions.  It is not our intention to do anything as part of the imposition of that GAEC 2 requirement that would result in any lands being made ineligible.</p> <p>  In terms of setting the standard for GAEC 2, we will look at that in the context of considering practices that provide an environmental benefit but are not so onerous that they do not provide scope for further building on those measures when we come to potentially look at eco-schemes or pillar 2 measures.  It is not the intention at this point to do anything in setting the GAEC 2 standards that would render lands ineligible.</p><p>It is in our interests, and certainly from our point of view, that we want to have what is known as green architecture, which would allow us to build on the things that we do under conditionality, whether that is GAEC 2 or GAEC 9 of any of the other GAECs, and that we can build on those elements through what we do on eco schemes and under Pillar 2.  It must be remembered that Pillar 1 conditionality is mandatory for farmers.  It is compulsory.  In the context of building on those things the eco scheme and the Pillar 2 measures would be voluntary for farmers to participate in.</p><p> Again, we are not looking at doing something that in a broad-brush way would simply make lands ineligible.  I can give that assurance.  Maybe my colleague, Mr. Tom Keating, might come in on our thinking on what might be feasible, even for individual practices we might consider.  I wanted to provide that assurance, however, in an overall sense.</p><p> On where the convergence in capping is going, which was mentioned, it is difficult at the moment because there are different positions from the three EU institutions.  In an overall sense, we had discussions with the farming organisations and stakeholders only recently.  We have done a survey of them on what their views are on issues such as convergence and capping, farm organisations and environmental organisations.  We met bilaterally, just before Easter, with a range of stakeholders, around these issues.  We are taking their views on board, which are very different views about what should be done under convergence and capping.  We are taking that on board and will include it in the discussion with the Minister first of all, and then, as Deputy Carthy said, as input to the negotiations.</p><p> As part of this, we must bear in mind that the Council has already agreed its general approach as of the end of last October.  It has agreed what its approach is to the Commission's proposals.  We have moved on to the stage where those elements are now being discussed among the three institutions, led by the Portuguese Presidency.  The text that was agreed last October, as the Council's position, provides the basis for the Council's contribution to those trialogue negotiations.  Yes, it is still open but scope is minimal for individual member states to come back and somehow unravel what was agreed as a general approach last October.  The negotiation process could not withstand the possibility that every member state would simply go back and potentially reopen Council's general approach.  If we get to that point there is a possibility that all member states will want to open up all aspects of the negotiations and we would be right back to square one.  A very difficult compromise had to be struck and we now have to go along and try to protect the Council position in the negotiations with the Parliament, especially where the Parliament view is very different from the Council's approach and where it would, in our view, undermine some elements of how the CAP has evolved over the last number of years.  We must bear this in mind when considering where that is going.</p><p> From Ireland's perspective, and with regard to the Council's position on convergence and capping, we can see there are different approaches to whether they should be voluntary or mandatory.  We discussed this with stakeholders and those issues are still very much at play in the trialogue negotiations and it is not possible to say where they will go.</p><p> The Minister has, in the past, supported capping.  The capping provisions are there around the voluntary approach by member states and the &euro;100,000 cap.  That came out of the EU budget negotiations last year that were agreed by Heads of State and then subsequently agreed with the Parliament.  There is a voluntary cap of &euro;100,000 established for member states, but we have degressivity proposals, or reduction proposals, within the CAP strategic plan regulation that give members states, potentially, some flexibility to play around with the bands to which the reductions are applied.  There is scope there for member states to exercise a bit of flexibility around how they apply the capping arrangements.  Again, we do not know if they will actually survive the negotiation process over the coming months.</p><p> We are inputting actively to the process.  We will input through the Council as issues are taken back to the Council by the Presidency on foot of the trialogue negotiations.  We will be able to input our views on that but it is going to be very difficult to essentially change internally what has already been agreed as a Council general approach.  It will be more in the context reacting and negotiating with the Parliament on its approaches to these issues around convergence and capping.</p><p> Deputy Carthy referred to some issues in regard to the organic farming scheme and new agri-environment scheme.  I will take up his offer to come back to him separately on those issues because they are slightly outside the remit of today's discussion.</p></speech>

On the overall point on the approach to the negotiations, I mentioned earlier on that the GAEC 2 text that has been agreed by the Council is the one the Council will be defending in the negotiations.  We have not yet got back to that point.  The Portuguese Presidency has moved away from all of these environmental matters.  Once Portugal took over the Presidency in January it went to other aspects of the regulations.  Under the German Presidency we had some initial contacts on some of these issues but the Portuguese have not taken that forward yet and they do not intend to do so until the next stage of the negotiation from their perspective over the coming weeks.  We have not yet seen any detailed engagement between Parliament and Council on some of these issues.  In that respect, it will be a case of waiting to see what happens with the text but from our perspective we will still be reflecting on how we set the standard for GAEC 2 in a way that provides the flexibility to build on that through eco schemes and Pillar 2 measures that I mentioned earlier.</p> <p>  Senator Lombard was talking about soil types and he picked up on Senator Paul Daly's comments on different soil types on pieces of land that are close to each other.  I take the point about needing a system that will work on the ground.  We have to do our best to try to acknowledge the different types of systems that are in place.  We try to make sure that the schemes we put in place are tailored to deal with the challenges that are presented by different soil types in different parts of the country and our schemes are designed in a way that we can respond as best we can.  That has to be dictated by the CAP framework that we agree.  That is more of a technical detail that we need to work through in some of the measures that we will eventually end up putting in place as part of the CAP strategic plan.</p> <p>  Senators Lombard and Paul Daly mentioned the genuine or active farmer and we are looking at this issue.  It formed part of that recent consultation with stakeholders around some of these direct payment issues and we got feedback from all of the stakeholders.  There was unanimity that we need a definition of a genuine or active farmer.  The challenge is to try to set that in a way that is meaningful and that allows us to make payments in an accurate and proper way.  We will be giving some thought to some of the options that stakeholders have put to us, including some of the options that were mentioned here in terms of activity on the ground.  We would have to look at those options and then decide what is the most appropriate measure we can put in place in defining a genuine farmer.  That is part of the evolution of the process over the coming weeks and months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#Z00300"><p>A lot of the questions I wanted to raise have already been raised, which is fine.  The definition of an active farmer has been raised with me quite often.  As others have said, there are farmers out there who are growing corn, fodder beet, grass, maize or silage for sale.  They deem themselves to be hugely important to the agriculture sector and there are concerns that they will deemed as armchair farmers, which would probably be unfair to a lot of them.  The witnesses might be able to give us more clarity on that.</p> <p>  On the negotiations on farm payments, disadvantaged or single farm payments will be up for review.  I have always fought for the small farmer, whether male or female, and those involved in family farms.  Many times I have lost the fight on small farmers, some of whom only get payments of &euro;2,000, &euro;3,000, &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000, which is an outrageous sum.  It is disastrous and wipes out small farms.  In some situations there are massive payments of well in excess of &euro;100,000 made to some.  How do the witnesses see that faring out?</p> <p>  There is another hammer blow coming with this new REP scheme with figures of &euro;4,700 being talked about.  Imagine all the payments that have to come out of that before the farmer even gets his or her hands on the few cent to put food on his or her table.  Where are we going with those negotiations?

We will get Mr. Savage to reply in writing to them.  This is obviously a hugely important issue.  A framework is being set for the next seven years.  It is hugely important to the whole agricultural sector and the economy in general, so we will return to this again.  The Covid restriction of two hours per committee session makes it extremely difficult to have the full debate we would want.  I ask Mr. Savage to address Deputy Michael Collins's remarks and we will send Mr. Savage questions from Deputies Naughten and Pringle to which he might reply in writing to the committee if he would not mind.

We would be very happy to respond in writing to any questions submitted after the meeting concludes.</p> <p>  On the general point about payments, the disparity or divergence in the level of payments being received by different farmers and how we might address that, in terms of low payments or redistributive options available to us, we have seen an evolution on this over recent years in terms of convergence, for instance, and moving payments from some farmers to others.  The motivation of the previous CAP reform was to try to achieve a greater level of fairness in the distribution of payments and to provide more consistency to the level of payments.  Obviously, this resulted in a large shift of payments over the period from 2014 to 2019 from some farmers to others.  There are issues around that and around those who have high-value entitlements perhaps suffering more than those with lower-value entitlements in terms of convergence.  There are other anomalies within that system, which are very difficult to address.  Obviously, within a large and almost one-size-fits-all convergence system, there will always be anomalies.  From our perspective, however, we have to look at these things as an overall package.  Direct payments are comprised of a number of different elements.  There is capping, convergence and payments to young farmers.  There will be the new eco scheme payments, for instance.  They will come from Pillar 1.  There will also be the redistributive option that is currently being discussed as part of the negotiations.  All these things will have to be looked at in the round in the context of the scope we have at the end of the day to redistribute payments.  We have said some of these options should be voluntary for member states in terms of a voluntary redistributive payment, for instance.  However, we have to consider what the combined effects of all these things will be on payments.  How do we ensure that their impact is as fair as possible, while also keeping in line with the ethos or the thrust of the regulations, which is to get a greater degree of fairness?  All I will say on that is that we are doing a lot of modelling at the moment on where the current system and where convergence, capping and other elements have left us over the past five years in terms of payment distributions around the country.  We are looking at the potential options or the potential impacts of things such as 75% convergence, as currently proposed in the regulations, and the impacts across different farm types and sectors.  We have to do a lot more modelling in looking at the impact of that convergence but also building in some of these other elements such as redistributive payments, the initial cut from the direct payments for eco schemes etc.  We are working through those elements.</p> <p>  Again, all that modelling cannot be finalised until we have a full picture of what the regulations and that package of direct payment measures will look like.  To reassure Deputy Michael Collins, I think the overall approach here will be to try to strike the right balance in combining all those measures in order that we get a degree of fairness in the system.  However, as we said the last time, when we were doing the reform for the current period, we want to try to make sure not only that there is fairness there but also that we are not causing any undue or untoward impact on those who have, for instance, invested in their farms and undertaken expansion programmes or other programmes on the ground.  We want to try to strike that balance.  I think we will just have to wait and see what measures are available to us on foot of the end of the negotiations and on foot of the modelling we complete.  Then we will decide what the best combination is.</p></speech>

The secretariat can also issue invitations to join the meeting on MS Teams.  Members may not participate in the meeting from outside the parliamentary precincts.  I ask them please to mute their microphones when they are not making a contribution and to use the raised hand function to indicate.  They should note that messages sent in the meeting chat are visible to all participants.  Speaking slots will be prioritised for members of the committee.</p> <p>  The topic of this meeting is the impact of the climate action plan 2021 on the agricultural sector.  The joint committee intends to draft a submission to the public consultation on the plan, so this meeting is vital to tease out the issues.  I welcome to the meeting the following representatives of Teagasc, Professor Gerry Boyle, director, and Dr. Frank O'Mara, director of research, both of whom are joining us remotely.  We have received their opening statement, which has been circulated to members.  We are limited in our time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions, so the committee has agreed the opening statement will be taken as read in order that we can use the full session for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I draw witnesses' attention to an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Witnesses participating in the committee meeting from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, their participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I invite questions from members for the Teagasc representatives.</p></speech>

He has been with Teagasc for some time but I read the other day on Agriland that he will depart in September.  I take this opportunity, in case I do not see him again, to wish him well and thank him for all his work at Teagasc.  I also welcome Dr. O'Mara.</p><p>I want to stick to one issue because I know there will be a multitude of questions.  I thank our guests for the paper they have submitted.  I am particularly interested in carbon sequestration in woody biomass and our guests have dealt with that matter in their submission, to some extent.  One of the recurring themes is the potential in terms of calibration and the significance of hedgerows.  In their submission, our guests referred to increasing perennial biomass via increased adoption of forestry, agroforestry, the use of hedgerows as shelter belts and what they offer in terms of verifiable options.  Our guests tell us in their report that Teagasc is doing a lot of research in this area.  It is a particularly interesting area.  We, in Ireland, are familiar with hedgerows.  It is a significant area and the more research we have, the better.  The issue was raised this morning when we were talking about CAP and environmental initiatives.  We sometimes underestimate the significance of our Irish hedgerows as they relate to that area.  Perhaps our guests could touch on the significance of that issue and the extent of Teagasc's work to date on it.  I know work is ongoing and Teagasc has not concluded all of its research.  This is an area on which I would be interested having feedback.  Where are we with it now?  What are our guests' plans to produce some substantial information and analysis that we can use?  This is a significant area and we should not underestimate it.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the kind remarks of the Senator and I will certainly miss meeting him at our annual Oireachtas briefings.  He has attended several of those briefings and we very much appreciate his contributions.</p> <p>  I know the issue of hedgerows is of interest to many members of the committee because I have engaged in discussions with many of them previously.  We are, obviously, very much in favour of planting new hedgerows but it is perhaps even more important to manage existing hedgerows to maximise their potential for carbon sequestration.  I will ask Dr. O'Mara, who is director of research, to outline the various research and extension programmes in which Teagasc is engaged.</p></speech>

We have quantified the length of hedgerows in the country and the total is somewhere of the order of 650,000 km.  They are a huge part of our landscape when one considers that the average field size is somewhere around 2.5 ha and most field boundaries, as committee members know, are hedgerows.  They have a role in carbon sequestration and storage.  There is a difference between storage and sequestration.  Our hedges store a lot of carbon in the woody biomass, the material above ground, and there is also quite a bit of carbon in the rooting system and so on underground.  From the point of view of sequestration, the additional carbon that is added is of real interest.  That can be in the form of planting additional hedgerows or managing our existing hedgerows to allow them to accumulate some more material or biomass.  In other words, that would involve making them a little bushier than they currently are while still maintaining their shape and making sure they are effective as stock barriers and shelter belts.</p> <p>  As I said, we have quantified the length of hedgerows and we are now involved in research to look at the amount of carbon that is stored both above and below the ground.  While we know that additional hedgerows or allowing the existing ones to get bulkier will add extra carbon, we are also trying to quantify more exactly how much extra carbon might be stored from the way we manage our hedges.</p><p>This is a very active area of work and we hope to have the results of it very soon.</p></speech>

I do not have an exact timeframe but it will probably be the best part of a year before we have significant information on the carbon stocks in those hedgerows.  There are estimates around but we need more accurate estimates of the amount of carbon in the hedges but, more importantly, how much additional carbon we can put into them because that is the really important point.  It is great to have a store of carbon but unless we are adding to it, it is not really taking any extra carbon out of the atmosphere.</p></speech>

I wish to be associated with Senator Boyhan's remarks and wish Professor Boyle the best in the future.  I have no doubt our paths will cross before his imminent departure but in case they do not, it has always been a pleasure working with him on occasions like this.</p><p>I have a couple of questions and top of the list is one about hedgerows.  Senator Boyhan got in there before me.  Following on from that, as somebody from Westmeath, which is not a Golden Vale-type area, I can confirm the figures given relating to field sizes and the amount of hedgerow.  While I welcome the science and research on this area and all other areas, I would put some pressure on for timelines on when we might be in a position to say how much sequestration and storage there is per metre or kilometre of hedgerow.  When do the witnesses envisage that we will be able to get down to individual farm audits and identify the actual carbon footprint of an individual farm, for example, an 80-acre suckler farm in Westmeath with ten fields of 2.5 or 3 ha each and hedgerows everywhere?  When will we be able to identify an exact figure of what storage and sequestration is in the soil if it is a grassland grazing suckler farm?  What storage and sequestration value do the hedgerows have?  Will we be able to identify that this farmer is carbon-positive, neutral or even negative?  How far away are we from that?  </p><p>I would like to hear Teagasc's views on carbon leakage.  While the witnesses have their job to do and are doing a fine job and we will collectively tick the boxes we have set for ourselves, are we creating an opening for carbon leakage?  If we rewet all our bogs, reduce our herd, do whatever is asked of us and become carbon-neutral by 2050 but the beef requirements of the world are being met by Brazil, which has knocked down a hundred times more rainforest than we have wet bogs in the same length of time, that would not make sense in the overall global picture.  While the science is the witnesses' end of things, I would like to hear comments on that.  </p><p>I would also like to hear their comments on the fact that every document and proposal I have seen in the past six months has contained the statement &quot;stable national bovine herd&quot;.  Can the witnesses explain what they mean when they use that term?</p><p>I would also like to hear their opinion on an article I read in last week's <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>by Colm McCarthy regarding where carbon emissions are allocated.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy's argument was that we are production as opposed to consumption and we are allocating the carbon footprint to production whereas with a lot of product that is exported, its carbon footprint is credited to the consumer.  I would like the Department's opinion on that.  If the people who are consuming our beef were responsible ultimately for its carbon footprint, it would take much of the pressure off the agricultural sector.</p></speech>

He asked a number of substantive questions.  I will deal with some and hand over to Dr. O'Mara.<br/><br/>Starting with my good friend, Colm McCarthy's comment in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, he has been saying this for a long time, and, as a fellow economist, I absolutely agree with him.  The theoretical position in respect of consumers paying carbon taxes is well established.  Unfortunately, we have to deal with the practical policies that are in front of us.  I guess as the years go by we will probably see more of that perspective coming onto the agenda but at present we are very much aware that the imposition in terms of restrictions is on production, in particular, on the products and associated carbon outputs.<br/><br/>The Senator asked an important question regarding timelines in respect of when we will have solid, robust information on an individual farm basis.  I assume what he is referring to there is on a basis that we would be able to present data for the majority of farms in the country.  At least that would cover the majority of production because, as the Senator will be aware, at present we have good information from the national farm survey, which is a sample of farms that are representative of the national farms in the country.  We are able to extract from that survey robust carbon footprint information and also information on the basis of the volume of carbon that is produced on a per-farm basis, and that is statistically representative.  We were doing this for a number of years.  We publish this every year.  In fact, we were particularly pleased to see that the European Commission took the decision some time ago to have a similar focus right across Europe in respect of the Farm Accountancy Data Network to which we supply the information.  That is one source.<br/><br/>Most importantly, and Dr. O'Mara might elaborate on that, part of our strategy is to implement the measures that we have produced from the research contained in the so-called marginal abatement cost curve, MACC.  We will implement those on farms through a programme we are calling the Signpost farm programme, which will commence in the middle of next month.  That will see us being able to measure carbon on a detailed basis across the country, admittedly, on a small number of farmers, but in a way that will provide additional information in respect of what is happening at farm level.  That database will also be used to measure carbon sequestration using the most up-to-date equipment available to us.<br/><br/>In terms of scaling that up, part of the Signpost programme is to involve ourselves directly, not only with the farming organisations and the food and meat companies but also with State agencies that have a similar interest, such as Bord Bia.  Of course, we will work closely with Bord Bia to make sure that we are harvesting the information from its quality assurance programme that feeds directly in to providing the kind of information that the Senator recognises as being needed.  Clearly we would then be in agreement.<br/><br/>As far as the Signpost farm programme is concerned, I hope we would kick it off in the middle of next month.  I would certainly hope that within a year we would have more of the kind of information that the Senator is looking for.  Of course, we will put every effort then into making sure that is scalable and representative of the total farming situation.</p><p>I will hand over the questions on carbon leakage and what is meant by a stable, national bovine herd to Dr. O'Mara.</p></speech>

As Professor Boyle said, we have been doing this in the national farm survey but because those farms are all anonymised, we cannot discuss any individual farmer's results.  However, we will be using the exact same methodology on these 100 farms and it will be great to be able to talk about real-life farms, to have demonstration events on those farms and discuss the actual figures.</p> <p>  To give the committee some sense of it, we have modelled the typical or average suckler farm in the country in the national farm survey and the amount of emissions that are offset by sequestration, according to our estimates, is approximately 50%.  Around 50% of emissions of methane and nitrous oxide are offset by carbon sequestration in soils, based on our current estimates of sequestration.  We are undertaking a major programme on carbon sequestration in soils.  We are setting up the national agricultural soil carbon observatory, a network of very sophisticated measurement towers for measuring carbon changes in soil across the country.  We will have about 16 such towers in the network which, for the size of the country, will give us one of the densest measurement networks in Europe, if not the world.  As part of the research that will be conducted using that network, we will be looking at whether we can use remote sensing, such as satellite or drone data, to measure or estimate carbon sequestration so that we do not have to do the kinds of detailed measurements that we will be doing on the 100 farms in the signpost programme.  Hopefully, we will not have to do that on every farm in order to get estimates of carbon sequestration.  </p> <p>  Committee members are probably well aware of the carbon leakage issue and what it means but briefly the idea is that if we cut back on our production of food, particularly milk or meat, and the shortfall is filled by some other country which has higher emissions, there is no gain.  Indeed, there is actually a loss to the overall system.  This is a very real issue because Irish milk and meat has a very low carbon footprint.  Ireland has one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world for milk and the footprint for our meat is also very low.  Therefore, if our production is replaced by countries that have a higher carbon footprint per kilo of milk or meat, then the world loses out in terms of the level of emissions entering the atmosphere.  That is the carbon leakage argument but at the same time, the agreements we have signed up to contain individual country targets.  We must live within those individual country targets and that is the conundrum we face.  In our approach to this issue, we are always trying to find ways to reach our environmental targets without negatively impacting on food production from Ireland.  </p> <p>  The question was asked as to what a stable national bovine herd means, which is often spoken about in the context of methane emissions.  It means that we have stable emissions of methane or that we have stable numbers of animals.  Obviously, different animals produce different amounts of greenhouse gases so the logical conclusion is to talk about stable methane emissions.  The marginal abatement cost, MAC, curve that we produced in 2018 around greenhouse gas emissions set out scenarios for how the national herd might develop over the next decade.  Broadly, there would be a stable overall number of animals in the country.  We envisaged some increases in dairy cows and some reductions in suckler cows over that period, with one more or less counteracting the other.</p><p>That is the stable bovine herd.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions that relate, in the first instance, to the opening statement, which alluded to major reductions equivalent to 51% by 2030 that would require a substantial reduction in the amount of agricultural activity in Ireland.  Does this convey that Teagasc is not confident that the assurances the committee has received regarding the separate targets for biogenic methane will offer the leeway for the agricultural sector that has been suggested?</p> <p>  I heard what was said in response to Senator Paul Daly's questions on carbon leakage and what appears to be the crazy suggestion that we would reduce the amount of production that might be in a country such as Ireland in order to import less sustainable product from places such as South America.  To return to the Senator's point on consumption and production, we know why we encourage people in Ireland to move to electric vehicles - it is so that we contribute as consumers.  If we were to take into account production and consumption at a global level, would this not lead to consumers and governments encouraging consumption of the most sustainable products?  This would have a beneficial impact for countries that produce more sustainably and would encourage more sustainable practice.  What is Teagasc's position on this?</p> <p>  It was mentioned that greenhouse gas emissions have risen over the past decade as emissions associated with the dairy herd have increased.  This was followed by the statement that this has not been fully matched by a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from other cattle.  It would be useful if Teagasc could clarify this.  Do the witnesses suggest that it is the responsibility of the beef sector to reduce emissions to offset increases in other sectors?  Many beef farmers are of the view this is where the strategy has been leading and the pressure on them is, perhaps, as a result of greater profitability in other areas.</p> <p>  The witnesses also mentioned the carbon footprint of Irish beef being low by international standards due to the close interaction between livestock and their feed.  In the case of beef, this has a lot to do with the fact it is primarily grassland beef.  Biodiversity and landscapes have also been mentioned.  With this in mind, would it not be fair to say there should be an onus on promoting the most sustainable types of beef production, which is clearly our suckler herd, for example.  When it comes to reducing cattle numbers, or when this suggestion is made, when we compile this with all other beef production, including factory feed lot, which is clearly much less sustainably produced, the easy target is a reduction in the suckler herd even though it is the most sustainable beef product we produce.  Would we not be better to target increasing the profitability of our sustainable product as opposed to trying to use reductions in this regard to offset other sectors?</p> <p>  There was quite a bit of focus on the Ag Climatise strategy.  Action No. 9 of the latter seeks an increase in the area of land under organic farm production to 350,000 ha by 2030.</p><p>From previous ministerial responses, we know that the Government strategy is to aim for the 2019 EU average of 7.5% by the end of the term.  As such, it appears that 350,000 ha will account for approximately 10% of land.  Is it not a wholly underambitious target that, by 2030, only 10% of land will be participating in organic farming schemes?</p><p> The Ag Climatise document states that research will be required into peat alternatives for the horticultural sector, but policy is moving beyond that.  We are essentially facing the possibility of an outright ban on the harvesting of peat moss for horticultural product.  The importation of horticultural peat is already happening in order to sustain the requirements of the horticultural sector.  As such, I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' views on where we are in terms of providing peat alternatives to the sector or, in the absence of such alternatives, whether it makes sense to import that product, given my earlier points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry Boyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#GGG00200"><p>The Deputy raised many important questions.  He will understand that some stray into the policy domain, which is not part of our brief, but I will nonetheless try to deal with the issues he raised.  Dr. O'Mara will speak on the matters that I neglect to mention.</p> <p>  In our statement, we considered what the implications of the targets set in the programme for Government, in particular the 51% target, would be if they were extended to the agricultural sector in a simplistic way.  Our assessment, as we state in the document, is that it would have a significantly negative impact on activity levels in the sector.  We have conveyed that view to the Department and the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, and we would be happy to brief any other body that is interested in this issue.</p> <p>  Regarding the implications, it is important that there be recognition of some of the biological features of agriculture, not least that there must be animals to produce animal products.  In other sectors, technology can change and decarbonise and the sector can still engage in productive activity.  That makes the sector unique relative to other sectors.</p> <p>  Of more importance is an issue that has been in the scientific literature for some time.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, Teagasc and the CCAC have remarked on the important scientific information that is becoming available in respect of biogenic methane produced by animals, which is the substantial part of the methane produced in Ireland, being quite a different greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.  It has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere and, therefore, has a potentially lower impact on the greenhouse gas issue or the potential for global warming.  For that reason, we have been advocates for some time for a separate target for biogenic methane within the national targets, which will be determined over the coming months.  That would give recognition to the uniqueness of this gas.  Obviously, the level of the target is a matter for the Government.</p><p> The document before the committee and the work that we have done point to the need for the unique requirements of the sector to be taken into account in setting the national budgets.  That is no different from what other countries are doing.  The obvious example, of course, is New Zealand, which has a target for biogenic methane that is significantly lower than that for other greenhouse gases.</p><p> We are in complete agreement with the Deputy on carbon leakage.  It makes neither economic nor environmental sense that a policy could lead to carbon leakage.  All of us would be better off in a global sense if countries can produce goods in the most efficient way.  It benefits consumers at the same time if those countries that are engaged in an efficient way in the export market also produce lower emissions.  There is a win-win there all around.  However, as we are aware, that is not the policy, at least at the moment.</p><p> I wish to amplify on the consumer approach.  This can cut a number of ways.  Clearly, if this is reflected in the prices consumers pay for their products, including in taxes and so forth, it could lead to consumers consuming more products that are produced in a sustainable way.  Of course, it could also lead to a defensive action on the part of some countries which might want to defend their own producers against exports.  That is also a possibility.  Again, I agree with the broad sentiment of the desirability of having a consumption-based tax, but as I pointed out, that is not where we are at the moment.</p><p> The Deputy raised a number of other important issues.  The approach depends on one's perspective.  I have argued that we should start from a position where the Irish dairy and beef herds are not in opposition to each other but are interdependent.  I am a little bit older than the Deputy and I can remember the situation in Ireland prior to the imposition of the dairy quota when we had far fewer suckler beef animals in the country.  Subsequent to the introduction of the quota, farmers naturally looked to the alternatives and that led to an increase in sucklers from approximately 400,000 to, I believe, in excess of 1 million head by the early 1990s.  The suckler herd has been declining gradually since.  We all knew it would accelerate its decline post the abolition of the dairy quota in 2015.  To some extent, we are experiencing a recycling of history.</p><p> As I am sure the Deputy will agree, the fundamental issue on which we are focused is to maximise the livelihoods farmers can generate, irrespective of the enterprise.  That is the most important issue.  There is no point in having a herd of suckler cows if farmers are not making a decent income for themselves and their families.  Unfortunately, the data from the national farm survey show that only a tiny percentage of suckler farmers are making a sufficient livelihood.  In most situations, were it not for the basic farm payments and other direct payments, those farmers would be making a net loss per hectare.  Our job, along with the farming organisations and farmers themselves, is to try to enhance the opportunities for the creation of livelihoods.</p><p> I see nothing wrong with advocating an alternative - not to the exclusion of sucklers - of dairy-beef for example.  I see nothing wrong with advocating that farmers consider contract rearing of heifers or indeed male calves as long as there is profit in it, in other words as long as those enterprises offer an alternative livelihood.</p><p>The Deputy is right, in that the carbon footprint of beef is low.  That is primarily because it is an extensive system.  The other side of the coin is that this also means that livelihoods are predominantly low on those farms.  There is no doubt that this type of farming activity is sustainable in an environmental sense.  When we discuss sustainability, though, we are careful to emphasise three critical dimensions in our annual sustainability reports, the first of which is economic.  The farmer has to be able to make a living.  That is at the core of sustainability.  The second and third dimensions are environmental and social issues.  Wrapping all of those up together and getting them to work requires a farmer to be able to change, make investments and have the education to enable him or her to identify and exploit opportunities.  From a sustainability point of view, the core issue is the need to identify where farmers can generate a better living.  A certain amount can be done inside the farm, and our job is to support farmers in being more efficient technically.  We see a positive future for many suckler farmers, albeit not with the same level of suckler cows that are in the country currently.  There will be a strong core of suckler farmers who, through their excellence in managing their herds, will be profitable.  There will be other opportunities as well.</p><p> Dr. O'Mara will expand on my next point, as there are several important issues on which to focus.  Regarding organic farm production, the targets in the Farm to Fork strategy would be very ambitious were they to be applied to Ireland.  We must be sensible, in that we are starting from a low base of 5%.  Teagasc has been involved in supporting this sector for a number of years and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been centrally involved in the provision of grant aid and so forth.  That percentage was hard won.  To be realistic, it would be a considerable achievement were we to double that target over this Government's period.  The Deputy may consider it to be underambitious, but ambition must also be realistic.  We are prepared to state that Teagasc has a responsibility to up its game when it comes to organic farming.  That will involve us recruiting more specialised research staff and developing demonstration farms in collaboration with the sector.  We will do our bit to promote organic farming, even more so than we have been doing for a number of years.</p><p> The issue of peat alternatives is significant for the protected crop sector, including mushrooms.  Given what has happened with the production of peat by Bord na M&oacute;na, which was a major player not only in Ireland but in the export market as well, the only feasible alternative is to consider importation.  That will be the immediate challenge in the next few years.  I will not make any comment on it, as that is the policy implication, but I will comment on the need for research into identifying alternatives.  I am glad to see that the Department, in its recent stimulus call, has prioritised this area for future research.  Importantly, Teagasc will be collaborating not just with institutions in Ireland, but with institutions internationally to find alternatives.  It will take a number of years to find those alternatives, but I have no doubt that we will.  I tend to be optimistic when it comes to the potential of research to find solutions.  In the meantime, though, the Deputy is correct that the only alternative is to consider importation.  That is the position as I understand it, but Dr. O'Mara may wish to elaborate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Frank O'Mara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#JJJ00200"><p>There is not much more to say on that.  It is the only option at the moment for most horticultural producers.  The volume of peat that was being used for domestic horticultural production accounted for a small proportion of the overall volume of peat that was being extracted.  To the best of my knowledge, it was in the low single figures as a percentage of the total.</p><p>It had been anticipated that while peat extraction for fuel would cease soon, horticultural peat extraction would continue for up to ten years.  This issue has come very much as a surprise to the industry and an unanticipated issue for it to face in the next year.  There are no good alternatives at the moment.  The best option in respect of replacement would be that perhaps 30% of the peat would be replaced.  That is what we appear to be looking at.  There is currently no alternative to peat for the capping of mushrooms.  Therefore, there is a big challenge for research to find ways around those issues.</p><p> Briefly, to back, Professor Boyle dealt with most of the issues raised by Deputy Carthy.  On the beef issue, he compared our Irish grass-fed beef with feedlot-fed beef. Grass-fed beef is really a sustainable product because of the carbon sequestration associated with the grasslands that the cattle are raised on and the biodiversity in that type of production system.  There is very little "food versus feed" competition.  In other words, the animals are not eating food that could be eaten by humans.  From an animal welfare point of view, the animals are very much in their natural surroundings.  Beef production in Ireland is by and large very sustainable.  That applies to both suckler beef and dairy calf to beef production.  In fact, the carbon footprint of diary calf to beef production is even a bit lower than suckler beef production, because the emissions from the cow are carried or assigned to the milk that is produced.  Both types of beef production are very sustainable systems.  I agree with the Deputy that we should be seeking to improve the profitability of suckler beef production here in Ireland in any way we can.  On the way in which the document portrays the figures, it was not our intention to imply that one needs to compensate for the other; it is just the mathematics of the way the emissions have gone over the last 20 years or so.  There was a gradual decline up to about a decade ago and there has been a gradual increase in emissions over the last decade, which by and large has been associated with the rise in the dairy cow herd.  At the same time, there has been a small drop in the suckler cow herd.  It is not a question of one compensating for the other, but mathematically, that is effectively they way the figures were adding up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#KKK00200"><p>I welcome Professors O'Mara and Boyle.  Indeed, I extend the good wishes that my colleagues have sent to Professor Boyle and I wish him well in the next few months before he finishes up.  I thank him for his work with Teagasc over the years.</p> <p>  Professors O'Mara and Boyle have acknowledged the beef versus dairy situation.  It seems that until the 2010s our emissions were reducing, largely because the suckler herd was reducing and then it turned around.  Now we have a situation wherein any gains that we have made through the reduction in the suckler herd have been unfortunately negatively offset by the increase in the dairy herd.  Had that reduction continued, we would be at something like 15 megatonnes of agricultural emissions per year instead of 21 or so.  The professors have acknowledged that and it is a most is significant point on which we should probably dwell more - perhaps not in this session but in further sessions.</p> <p>  The professors have mentioned an EU study which shows Irish milk to have the joint lowest carbon footprint in the EU.</p><p>Bear in mind 90% of our milk product is exported.  Does the study include the carbon footprint as a result of export? </p><p> The same section in the statement refers to the international context.  The United Nations understands the biggest threat to global food security is climate change.  Many of our development agencies such as Tr&oacute;caire and Concern are working with some of the poorest communities around the world which suffer extreme hardship and famine as a result of climate-related floods, droughts, water scarcity and food insecurity.  </p><p> More than one quarter of the world's population, approximately 2 billion people, do not have regular access to nutritious and sufficient food and the Covid-19 pandemic only makes matters worse.  The painful irony is industrial agricultural systems with high greenhouse gas emissions, such as we have in Ireland, contribute to climate change and biodiversity loss.  We must get our house in order.  The best thing we could do to prevent increases in global hunger and malnutrition and to avoid future breakdowns in food and livelihood systems is to ensure our agrifood policy and processing of food do not contribute further to climate change.</p><p> On the issue of biogenic methane, action 4 states that "Biogenic methane such as methane from ruminant livestock is different from other greenhouse gases because of its biological origin and its relatively short life span in the atmosphere."  That statement is quite misleading.  Biogenic methane and methane are the same molecule, as the witnesses are aware.  They are the same thing and have the same effect in terms of global warming potential, irrespective of their source.  The biogenic refers to the source.  It is misleading because it implies this methane has a different effect on global warming potential when it does not.  It does not have a shorter lifespan than fossil-derived methane in the atmosphere, regardless of whether its source is biogenic.  Methane, whatever its source, needs to be reduced drastically if we are to tackle climate change.</p><p> The point below that on the Teagasc submission refers to the GWP100 and the GWP* systems of accounting but GWP10 and GWP20 were not mentioned.  If GWP10 and GWP20 had been mentioned, one would have stated methane had a global warming potential of 88 times the warming effect with those systems as with GWP100.  It is short-lived compared with carbon dioxide but converts to carbon dioxide after it breaks down.  It is a potent greenhouse gas and is not, by any means, an insignificant one.  No matter what system we use, we cannot get away from that.</p><p> I ask the witnesses to give us more information on the most important line in the statement, that reducing methane "can be associated with a cooling effect".  That is critical.  On the issue of biogenic methane, the statement notes that "the CO2 produced is effectively new carbon released from permanent carbon stores and therefore must be treated differently because it inputs additional CO2 into the atmosphere".</p><p>The reality, however, is that increasing herd numbers inputs additional CO2 into the atmosphere also.  I think there is a sleight of hand here.  This line gives the impression that methane that comes from ruminants is somewhat less harmful than fossil-derived methane, and that, scientifically, is not correct.  Teagasc goes on, on the last page of its submission: "Because of the significant difference between biogenic methane and fossil fuel derived CO2, scientists propose setting a separate target for biogenic methane in climate targets."  That is the subject of debate, but I do not believe - and the witnesses may correct me if they know more about this - that the IPCC or the United Nations have proposed any change in how we account for biogenic methane.</p><p> I will ask the witnesses some questions.  I know we do not have much time, but if they would like to revert in writing, I would appreciate that.  Can they tell me how much the beef and dairy herd have grown in numbers in the past five to ten years and what the increase in nitrogen fertiliser has been over that time?  That, of course, is a very significant greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of, I think, over 200 times that of CO2.  In Teagasc's 2020-27 sectoral roadmap, it shows projected increases in cattle numbers from 1.4 million to 1.65 million and increasing output from the dairy sector.  Could the witnesses give us an indication of the expected overall emissions increase from the beef and dairy sector attributed to 2027, not on an efficiency-per-cow basis but from an absolute emissions point of view?  I do not expect them to have these numbers right now, but if they could revert, I would appreciate that.</p><p> As for the issue of hedgerows, the document Teagasc sent us refers to sequestration from hedgerows, and we know hedgerows are excellent for biodiversity and should be promoted.  I wonder how impactful they are from a carbon sequestration point of view.  Perhaps the witnesses could estimate the numbers quoted in their note to us to give us the national picture.  How much hedgerow coverage have we got in Ireland, and what is the suggested coverage of hedgerows over the next few years?  I think Dr. O'Mara said we have 650,000 km of hedgerow, but how does that translate into an acreage basis?  I think it was Dr. O'Mara who mentioned that 50% of methane emissions can be offset by sequestration on the average suckler farm.  Is that a temporary or a permanent sequestration?  How is it verified, and is there a scientific basis that is aligned with the EPA's methods for compiling its emissions inventory?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry Boyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#MMM00200"><p>I thank Deputy Leddin for a very comprehensive set of questions.  I will hand most of them over to Dr. O'Mara in a moment.</p> <p>  Regarding the comments the Deputy made previously on the trajectory of the dairy herd and the beef herd, the introduction of the quota in the first instance and then its removal are responsible for a lot of those trends, in my opinion - historians will differ, I am sure.  However, when the quota was brought in, dairy farmers expanded their suckling numbers.  At the time there were a lot of coupled subsidies available.  Teagasc's predecessor, An Chomhairle Oili&uacute;na Talmha&iacute;ochta, ACOT, supported these at the time as farmers were scrambling to find viable alternatives.  Then when we came up to the post-quota period there was a lot of pent-up demand for young farmers in particular to get into dairy production.</p><p>This was for the very simple reason that relative to other enterprises, it was quite profitable on reasonably small amounts of land and animal numbers.  That is what is behind the expansion.  We will get to the detailed figures in respect of the trends.  Deputy Leddin referred to our roadmap publication a number of months ago.  It is something we do every few years, and we make an honest attempt and give our best estimate in respect of where the sector is going and what are the critical driving technical factors.  Nonetheless, if we were to combine the dairy and beef herds into the national herd up to 2027, as in the roadmap, and even beyond that to 2030, overall the trends would be consistent with what we call the stable herd.  In other words, there would be rough balancing out between the two herds.</p><p> This underlying assumption was critical to the publication of the set of targets in the previous climate action Bill, introduced two years ago by Deputy Bruton, when he was the Minister.  We presented our marginal abatement cost curves on the assumption that if the technical measures were implemented, and on the assumption of a stable national herd up to 2030, we would be able to sustain a decrease of between 10% and 15% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  It was based from 2005.  This was the calculation, based on the very same figures underlying the estimates that were in the roadmap publication.</p><p> I absolutely agree with Deputy Leddin's comments on food security globally and the threat of climate change.  I do not know whether the Deputy is aware that for a number of years we have been working very closely with Irish Aid, the Department of Foreign Affairs and NGOs on the international agricultural development agenda.  We have been doing a lot of work in Irish Aid countries.  We are very familiar with the challenges because of climate change in respect of agricultural production in many of these countries.  It is a fact that we are an exporting country and where it is more efficient for countries to import food at reasonable prices we certainly can support the alleviation of the worst implications of climate change.  Of course, it is equally desirable that countries themselves are able to produce to their optimum.  This is where our technical support work comes in.</p><p> It has to be borne in mind that there is a vast difference with regard to sustainability between an exporting sector that is dependent on technologies such as grass fed systems to those dependent on feed lots and the feeding of concentrate animal feed.  This harks back to the earlier discussion in respect of the importance of a low carbon footprint and sustainability.</p><p> Before Dr. O'Mara picks up on the biogenic methane issue, I have a comment in respect of the points made on hedgerows.  What we are saying is we have to do the research here in respect of the potential carbon sequestration that hedgerows can provide and their potential in future.  One of the issues we are concerned about, given the length of hedgerows in the country, is their management.</p><p>Our biodiversity specialists are concerned about the typical management practices, which are not as conducive to enhancing biodiversity or dealing with emissions as they could be.  The initial work has to be done in quantifying the biomass involved.  Based on that, we will be in a better position to estimate the level of sequestration.  It will depend on the multiplicity of species and so on.</p><p> The Deputy rightly put his finger on the importance of verification.  This issue does not just extend to hedgerows, but to all other potential sources of sequestration.  That is why we embarked on the signpost farm programme.  Among other considerations, it will examine rigorously quantifying emissions and sequestration.  The regulatory regime needs to be worked out into the future, and I am sure that will happen.  Being optimistic, we hope it will lay the basis for carbon farming, as it is called.  Whatever way the regulatory environment takes shape, there is no doubt in our minds that it will have to be based on rigorous scientific measurement and verification if it is to have value in the marketplace.  We hope that, as time moves on and the regulatory regime sharpens up, the measures we are laying in place now in terms of protocols will be consistent with whatever regime emerges.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.133" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Frank O'Mara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#OOO00200"><p>I will provide some more facts about hedgerows in light of the Deputy's interest in that matter in particular.  Ireland has 690,000 km of hedgerows.  Per hectare, we have approximately 150 m of hedgerows.  The figure is probably a little higher on grassland farms, given that tillage farms tend to have bigger fields and fewer hedges.  The average width of those hedges is approximately 2.7 m.  As the Deputy rightly alluded, just having the hedgerow is acting as a store, but the additional sequestration is what is important.  We get that by either planting additional hedges or allowing the existing hedgerow cohort to add more biomass.  Current research is focused on quantifying the potential for sequestration through hedgerow management or further planting.  That work is in progress, but it is an active area for us.  While hedgerows might not have as much sequestration potential as soils, they are nevertheless an important sequestration route that we want to quantify better.</p> <p>  I will quickly answer another question before addressing biogenic methane.  The Deputy asked about the EU study that we referred to in our opening statement.  It was published by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission in 2010 or 2011.  It only went as far as the farm gate, that is, the emissions inside the farm gate, but that accounts for most of the emissions in a dairy or beef product.  The life cycle analysis of dairy products in particular suggest that approximately 90% of the overall emissions occur inside the farm gate, with processing and transport representing small amounts.  Of course, factoring in the food waste that happens after food leaves the supermarket shelf is a whole other scenario.  As the committee knows, quite a bit of food gets wasted.</p> <p>  We were not trying to give the impression that biogenic methane was irrelevant to global warming.  The reason biogenic methane is being spoken about so much now has to do with the Paris Agreement, where we shifted from talking about controlling greenhouse gas emissions to controlling global warming and we put a target on the amount of warming.</p><p>A molecule of methane is a molecule of methane, wherever it comes from.  The issue with methane that comes from enteric fermentation in animals is that it has come from plants taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere in the process of photosynthesis.  The animal eats the grass or other plant and respires most of it back out as carbon dioxide, which is the carbon cycle.  Carbon moves from the atmosphere into plants, into animals and back out, effectively, but with ruminants some of the carbon dioxide taken from the atmosphere is put back out as methane.  Methane stays in the atmosphere for about 12 years or a half-life and reverts into carbon dioxide.  Again, it is part of the carbon cycle and the carbon that is in methane was originally carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  That is different from fossil-derived methane whereby the carbon dioxide therein was taken out of the atmosphere a million years ago or some such.  That is why biogenic methane is singled out.  We were not trying to say that it does not have an impact while it is there.  In terms of its warming impact, it is part of a fairly short cycle of 12 to 15 years so in theory, if we keep its concentration in the atmosphere stable, there is no additional warming.  On the other hand, if we emit carbon dioxide from burning fuels like diesel or petrol, that will stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years and will contribute to warming over a very long period.  That is why scientists are trying to figure out how we can account for methane and biogenic methane in particular in our climate targets now, when our focus is on warming rather than just on the emission of greenhouse gases.  I hope that answers the question.  It is a complex topic and one on which we could spent a lot of time but in the time available, that is the best answer I can give.</p></speech>

The answer ignores the numbers issue, with respect.  If we are increasing herd numbers globally, whatever about in Ireland, that increases levels of methane and we need to talk about that because that has a global warming potential.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.136" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Frank O'Mara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#PPP00300"><p>That is right, yes.  As I said, if we keep the concentration of methane stable in the atmosphere, there is no additional warming, in theory.  However, if herd numbers are rising and hence, emissions of methane are rising then there will be additional levels of methane in the atmosphere which will contribute to warming.  If one looks at it over a short period of ten or 20 years, there is a lot of additional warming from that methane.  This is where the importance of a stable national herd comes into play, as per earlier questions.  Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas if it is rising.  Obviously, if it is falling, it can make a significant contribution to cooling, which is the point we made in our document.  If it is stable, it is having neither a warming nor a cooling effect.</p></speech>

Ireland should be a country that can produce food efficiently.  Everyone is talking about the climate but the first problem many people may face is food shortages as a result of what governments around the world are doing.  I met Professor Boyle a few years ago in Leinster House and we discussed hedgerows.  Do we have tonnage figures for the sequestration that is possible now?</p><p>Have we done any research on grass?  Grass grows, it is eaten, it grows again and it is eaten again, but it is sequestering.  Have we done anything on that?  Have we done anything on heathers or grain?  I read a report from Norway on grain.  The witnesses spoke about biomass.  Willow and miscanthus have both been disasters.  Where is Teagasc's thinking with regard to anaerobic digesters?  They can create electricity.  They have a double use.</p><p> I would like Teagasc's view on the following.  I got a call this morning from a guy in Louth, where some of Teagasc's guys are going around signing up farmers to basically go chopping straw.  To make matters worse, it is barley straw.  It is my understanding that we are trying to increase our organic herd to 8% or 10% or whatever it is.  This equates to 350,000 ha.  When one looks at the terms and conditions of the organics scheme, one sees that one has to use straw in the 50% of a cattle shed that must make up the lie-back area.  Deputy Carthy touched on the issue of horticulture earlier on.  What is Teagasc's view on this chopping of straw.  I talked to a few people about it this morning and it is my understanding that, while one gets more slugs in the ground, one has to spray away more tannins.  Is that correct?  Are we defeating the purpose altogether?</p><p> In its document, Teagasc talked about peatlands and wetlands.  What is its vision for people in Donegal, Mayo, Sligo, Galway or any other area which has mountains or peaty ground who are trying to farm, do the best they can and rear a family?  Is the vision that such people should flood their ground for the sake of the rest of the country?  What is Teagasc's view for the future?  I will be very straight about my view.  I heard people on about climate, food and the lot.  We see the prices land reaches when there is a shortage.  There are areas in the west, the north west, in Wicklow and in the Chair's own area that are really only suited to sheep or suckler cows.  Dairying will not work in these areas.  What is Teagasc's view on such areas and peaty ground?  I have been watching Teagasc over the last while and it has made a fair bit of reference to the matter.  What is its view?  There is a new system for agitating in slatted tanks which allows the methane coming out of them to be reduced by 40% to 50%.  Are there new technologies that will tick the boxes and get us through this?  </p><p> How much research has been done over recent years?  That is very important.  Off the top of my head, I believe some work on this is done in Athenry.  Everyone talks about what comes out of agriculture.  If we do not know what it sequesters, we are giving the incorrect figure.  Have we given the wrong figure over many years?  When will Teagasc be able to give the right figure that includes the sequestration potential of all the hedgerows about which we have talked, the grass and all the different things that grow, to put it simply?  On top of that, how much research has Teagasc done with regard to forestry?  Am I correct in saying that, when the goods are being divvied out, the carbon credits arising from sequestration from forestry do not go to the agricultural sector but rather are spread between a few sectors?  If these credits come from agriculture, they should come back to that sector.</p></speech>

He raised this issue with me previously.  At the moment, we have an estimation of the level of sequestration in our hedgerows.  It is outlined in our submission, if memory serves me.  There is quite a wide range and, obviously, the purpose of the research is to narrow that range.  If we could have solved all the problems and addressed all the issues, we would be in a very good place, but we have to start somewhere.  The Deputy will be aware that at the moment, in the context of the so-called effort-sharing agreement, there is a limit on the number of removals that can be included.  Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, most of that is taken up by forestry.  Even if, therefore, we could identify in a comprehensive and rigorous way the sequestration potential from hedgerows, we would not be able to get credit for it at the moment.  There is no doubt that the situation is constantly changing, and we hope we will be well ahead of the curve by the time it is needed nationally to include sequestration from hedgerows.</p><p> The same applies to most of the other areas.  Obviously, we have information from research but that is not the same as being able to state categorically that something will apply to every farm in the country.  It gives us a good idea but it is not robust.  It is certainly not sufficiently robust to be included as a credit in the so-called national inventory of greenhouse gases or, longer term, to be included part and parcel in a carbon farming or trading regime.  Nevertheless, the Deputy is absolutely correct.  The way in which the research is heading is to get firmer estimates of the sequestration potential of our farmlands, our mineral and organic soils, our grains and the contribution of different mixes of ryegrass and legumes, including multispecies swards and so on.  We are putting major effort and resources into addressing that issue.  The Deputy may say it is a bit late but we have had a considerable agenda over recent years and our production of marginal abatement cost curves was of tremendous benefit to the agricultural sector.  I would like to think we are ahead of many European countries and, indeed, further afield in that respect, but there are many other areas we have to research, as the Deputy pointed out.</p><p> As always, and I acknowledge the Deputy is very conscious of this, farmers make up their own minds.  They can be presented with technical information on the best outcome in any given number of situations but they will make up their own minds, and encouraging them to do so is often a greater challenge than producing the research results.  For example, we have been carrying out research on clover for several years and some really important results are emerging from that work.  In Clonakilty Agricultural College, for instance, we have demonstrated the significant potential that clover has to replace chemical nitrogen, but the greatest challenge now is persuading farmers that that will work in practice.  The same applies to our research on alternatives for calcium ammonium nitrate.  We have identified protected urea, as it is called, as an alternative that will substantially reduce greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions with the same efficacy in terms of dry matter production.  Farmers have to come to that decision themselves, however, and that takes time and support from throughout the industry.  It is another dimension that is as important as research.</p><p> I am glad the Deputy raised the issue of anaerobic digestion.  It is a hobby horse of mine and I am a great supporter of it.  It is the ultimate example in the agricultural system of the circular economy.  I certainly think there are opportunities, although, like with everything else in this area, subsidisation is necessary in the early stages.</p><p>We do not have a regime that is similar to the one north of the Border.  In any rural community north of the Border, one will notice the prevalence of anaerobic digesters, which is not the case south of the Border.  We are doing a small amount in that respect.  We are about to commission an anaerobic digester demonstration plant in Grange.  It will demonstrate how one can use grass silage and slurry to produce biomethane.  We plan to be able to sell that surplus biomethane into the national gas grid.  In the future, that will be an alternative for farmers.  Grass is a phenomenal source of energy that we convert into human and animal foods via animals.  It has several other potential uses, not least, in terms of energy, in the production of electricity and biogas.  Who knows what future research will show can be produced from this crop which we produce with such efficiency?</p><p> I will leave the question on topping straw to Professor O'Mara because it is not part of my competence.</p><p> On the point raised by Deputy Fitzmaurice about our vision in respect of uplands, wetlands and so forth, I have two perspectives.  First and foremost, I go back to the point that we certainly see the ability of the farmer to generate a livelihood as being the critical element of sustainability.  That extends to, and is a particular challenge in the context of, the areas of special natural beauty that we all value.  We know from research that these areas are maintained in best order when there is agricultural activity.  We have very good examples in that regard, not least through the Burren LIFE project which has demonstrated that time and again, as have many of the other LIFE programmes throughout the country.  We are very supportive of those programmes.</p><p> I have a particular interest in uplands because I live in an upland area.  The Deputy is absolutely right that in many cases there is no alternative to beef production in these areas.  In my area, there is very little sheep production so it comes down to beef.  Dairy tends not to be very suitable.  In some cases, it is not possible to have forestry and so on because of restrictions relating to the hen harrier.  There are very few alternatives for farmers in these areas.  They need to maximise what they can produce off grass, given all the limitations of those areas, and they must have access to direct payments to support the preservation of farming in the areas.  Our vision certainly is to promote those uplands in such a way that a combination of appropriately designed environmental supports maximise the income the farmer can obtain from farming activity and provide a decent standard of living.  That is really the issue.  It is what we try to do through our sheep programme in particular.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned rewetting peatlands and so on.  I am always of the view that if farmers are to be presented with options, it should be for each farmer to make up his or her own mind.  Obviously, farmers will not make decisions until they have done the sums, so to speak, and looked at competition between the alternatives.  That is what everyone else would do and farmers are entitled to do that.  Our view is that it is ultimately a decision for the farmer.  I certainly hope that recognition will be given to the necessity of maintain farming in upland areas.</p><p> I visited Glenwherry farm, a fantastic farm in Northern Ireland which is being managed by the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise our counterpart on the adviser side in the North.</p><p>The college came up with the important insight that we need to farm our sheep and animals but also farm the environment.  In other words, all of us, including Teagasc, must view the environment as another enterprise that farmers have to manage appropriately and they must be compensated appropriately for farming.</p><p> New technology was mentioned.  Teagasc must always be ahead of the curve.  Dr. O'Mara will talk about this issue, which we referred to in our statement.  We are doing work on feed and slurry additives.  We hope that some of those will come on the market and will do what they say they do on the tin.  Sometimes there can be excessive optimism about the potential of these various additives, so one must guard against what I call optimism bias.  We like to think that some of those that we are currently researching will come through in a positive way.</p><p> The issue of whether carbon footprint is measured appropriately was mentioned.  I think what is being referred to is the difference between gross emissions, on the one hand, and the adequate accounting of removals, on the other hand, so that we get at the net figure.  Clearly, that has been to the fore for Teagasc over the years, particularly concerning the national inventory and the target set for agriculture.  Teagasc in its research always tries to identify opportunities that can improve the footprint.  We certainly pursue them to the point that they are included in the national inventory.  One practical example is the replacement of calcium ammonium nitrate by protected urea.  Research was able to demonstrate the lower footprint that arises from using that source of nitrogen and the national inventory was amended.  As we move forward in this area, particularly given that carbon farming may emerge on the agenda, more and more of that precise work will be required to establish a value for carbon at the individual farmer level.  Dr. O'Mara may wish to pick up at this point.</p></speech>

Tillage soils, by their nature, tend to be lower in carbon and organic matter.  When we keep tilling these soils, we run down the organic matter in the soils compared with grassland.  This can be bad for soil health and soil function.  One way to address the issue is to chop the straw and return it to the soil.  In a year where straw is scarce, it is a very valuable and dear commodity.  In a year where it is plentiful, it can be hard to give it away in some parts of the country.  For two of the last three years, straw has been pretty scarce and very expensive.  Obviously, it would not be a good outcome for the country if we ended up not having enough straw to meet our needs.</p> <p>  I will not discuss technologies in any detail but I will refer to pages 3 and 4 of our statement which set out our approach to the issue.  The first part is to implement the measures that we already know will reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  They are the measures that were in our MACC.  That is what the signpost programme is about and we have said that these measures could deliver a 10% to 15% reduction in absolute emissions from the sector.  We need to go further than that so the next big part of our strategy is to research additional technological measures that could further reduce emissions from both methane and nitrous oxide.</p> <p>  The third big part of our strategy is carbon sequestration.</p><p>It is to see how much of the residual emissions that would be left after one does all the mitigation one can, and how much of that can be offset by carbon sequestration.  I am going over that just to illustrate that developing new technologies is a very important part of what we do.  There are some quite promising technologies in the pipeline, including some relating to reducing the emissions from stored slurry.  However, they are still at the research stage.  We will have to take them through to fruition and see how they work in practice when they are deployed.  I am hopeful that there are a number of technologies we will be able to put forward with potential to reduce emissions in the coming years.</p><p> I believe Professor Boyle and I have covered most of the areas the Deputy mentioned.  I will make a final point on the bogs.  Most of the bogs in the country are not drained.  They are hill bogs, mountain bogs and so forth.  Those bogs are not emitting carbon.  If anything, they are probably still sequestering some carbon.  It is just the bogs that have been drained in the past that are emitting carbon and where the focus is on rewetting as one possible option.  As Professor Boyle said, it will be up to every farmer to figure out if the compensation for that is worth it for him or her.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for their attendance today.  One of them said that without the payments for work in the farm schemes at present, farmers would be working at a loss.  I fully agree with that, but I would go a step further.  I know many farmers who are on farm schemes and, unfortunately, they are working at a loss.  Only for the off-farm income of a partner or wife or their own off-farm income, they would be wiped out.</p> <p>  What type of environmental schemes are proposed to come on stream and what type of payments are there for them?  Have the witnesses any indication of what will happen?  We are currently looking at the rural environment protection, REP, scheme that is being proposed.  There was a promise, with carbon tax and so forth, that no farmer will get less than &euro;10,000 in this new REP scheme, but it appears that it will be &euro;4,700.  If that is the case, it is a disaster for farmers.  That is the one they were depending on; it was the great REP scheme that was started previously.  There is talk about the same amount of money now, and perhaps even less than when it was started over 20 years ago.  If that is the compensation for people paying carbon tax and if that is the thanks they are getting, it is turning people very sour.  The farming community is starting to seethe with anger.  The carbon tax has not delivered, and it is rural areas such as the area in which I live that are suffering most.  There was no greenways funding from the carbon tax, although that is outside the farm sector.  However, it is frustrating people more.</p> <p>  My other question relates to dairy farmers and suckler farmers.  There is talk of a reduction in agricultural activity in Ireland and of herd numbers dropping.  Most people in my constituency might not have more than 50 cows, but if we take an average of 50 cows or suckler cows, to what number will they have to reduce to comply with the regulations that are coming on stream?  Would the witnesses be able to give us those answers?</p> <p>  In addition, we discussed peat moss earlier.  This is an absolute disaster.  The new solution for Ireland is that if one cannot, one will not be producing anything, but we will import everything in through the back door.  That is not a solution.  We are getting it hot and heavy from the garden centres and others.  They cannot understand the idea of importing peat moss into the country instead of producing it ourselves, and working towards a solution while producing it ourselves.</p> <p>  I would appreciate it if the witnesses would answer some of those questions.</p></speech>

The first one concerns the nature of the environmental schemes, how much they will be worth and so forth.</p><p>I am afraid we do not have any more insights than members do at this stage.  The only issue that is quite different is the payment by results pilot which is a departure from what was there in the past.  We must wait and see how that works out.</p><p> Similarly, the Deputy asked an impossible question in respect of the potential likelihood, if any, of a reduction in cow numbers to achieve whatever environmental targets or budgets will ultimately be set.  I simply do not have the answer to that.  We have looked at a variety of scenarios, depending on the scale of the potential reduction which might be required, but it is nearly impossible to answer that question in any precise way because we do not yet have the information on the targets.  It brings us back to the point that the key assumption in the old climate Bill was that of the stable herd.  We have talked about that already and its importance for the overall ability of the sector to continue to make an adequate living for the people who work in it and also to achieve an overall reduction in gaseous emissions.</p><p> I agree with the Deputy's comments on the challenge some farmers, particularly livestock farmers, have in making an adequate living and on the importance of farm employment, which is hugely important and has, no doubt, been affected to some extent by Covid.  I would certainly like to think farmers would be very careful that their farming activity does not eat into the household income they generate off-farm but also, and equally important, that it does not eat into the single farm payment.  When that starts happening it can be very corrosive when trying to manage normal household expenses.</p></speech>

In the Ag Climatise report the expansion of forestry by 8,000 ha per year is cited as one of the big ambitions to further the sequestration of carbon.  However, the Minister stated in the past month that that target will not be met this year.  For years, we have had complete mismanagement of the forestry sector and that deters new entrants.  Can the targets set out for sequestration through forestry be met if reform of forestry is so slow in bearing fruit?  Do the witnesses have any idea of what impact delays in the licensing process will have on the sequestration targets?</p> <p>  Has the Minister asked Teagasc to complete a full economic analysis on the likely implications of the European Green Deal for Irish farm profitability?  The IFA indicated it had asked the Minister to do this but we have not heard anything from it since.</p> <p>  I am aware that Teagasc is conducting research on grass management which has made findings about the introduction of clover, which Professor Boyle raised earlier.  Is any evidence available to show whether there is any difference between the CO2 storage capacity of, shall we say, old grass versus new grass?</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Browne for his comments and good wishes, particularly as they are from a fellow Tipperary man.  I must state an interest here, as I always do, that I have a small forest myself.  We have been very fortunate.  I believe it was 2014 when agricultural emissions could be offset against forestry and agricultural land.  I will be positive for a minute.  There is no doubt that the level of plantation farmers undertook 30 years ago and more is benefiting us now, not least in terms of timber production and so on, and especially in commons sequestration.  We are benefitting, and will benefit up to 2030, from the historical level of planting that was put in place.</p> <p>  As Deputy Browne rightly pointed out, the problem is that the current level of plantation is well below the national target and way below the levels that will be needed to replenish the forest stocks for carbon sequestration post-2030.  This is a huge concern, obviously.  Teagasc been involved with the Department and COFORD in the past couple of years in actively promoting an afforestation campaign.  It is a difficult area.  I do not have to go into the views that some non-farming people, and indeed some farming people, have in relation to forests.  That was before there was even an understanding of the carbon sequestration potential of forests.  There are whole other issues.  We can speculate as to the reasons for the very disappointing levels of planting that is going on.  A new group has been set up to look into all of this and I agree with the Deputy that the matter is very urgent.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question on whether Teagasc has been asked to undertake any analysis on the green deal.  The answer is "No."  We have been asked, and we continue to work with the Department, on the whole impact of the climate change scenarios, those in the programme for Government and the international commitments that Ireland has entered into.  There are many ancillary issues, but I see that issue as being the primary driver behind the green deal.  We are certainly working on that.</p> <p>  We are in the difficult situation where we do not yet have a firm indication of what targets will be attached to the sector.  We expect this in a couple of months and we will continue to do the work we are doing.  The Deputy can be assured, however, that the issue of implications for Ireland of the whole green agenda, including climate change, is very much at the top of our agenda.  We are continuing to work on this and look at different scenarios.  That is very much in train.  Perhaps Dr. O'Mara will answer the last question. </p></speech>

The theory, as I understand it, is that the more productive a pasture is at growing grass then the more carbon it will sequester.  That is the theory.  We will do a good bit of research in this area over the coming years and how that might be modulated by deep rooting species, as one might have in a multi-species sward.  That is one of the questions we will have to answer, but in general the new, more productive pasture will sequester more than an older, unimproved pasture.</p></speech>

If that was the basis then Ireland would be 6.4% higher in our emissions if we were to move to a consumption-based emissions.  We must, therefore, be careful what we wish for.</p><p> The speakers referred a great deal to ongoing and long-term research, but what are the short-term reductions envisaged in agricultural emissions in response to the five-year carbon budget programme and sectoral carbon budgets proposed in the new climate Bill?  They will be over five years, so it is a very short timeframe.  Teagasc acknowledges on page 22 of its marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, document that increased efficiencies do not necessarily lead to reduced emissions and can, in fact, lead to an increase in emissions.  What does Teagasc intend to do to address that, which is probably the Jevons paradox?</p><p> In terms of feed additives and their potential to increase efficiency, is it not true that additives are added to feed indoors?  If we are to rely on additives for reducing our emissions, what does that mean for our reputation of having a pasture-fed beef and dairy herd?</p><p> Another topic is not climate-related but relates to ammonia.  I hear that the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has recalculated its figures for ammonia upwards.  I am not sure if those figures have been reported lately, but they are significantly higher than was estimated.  Teagasc has mentioned a move to protected urea from calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN, in a bid to reduce nitrous oxide, which is a greenhouse gas.  What are the implications of moving to protected urea for ammonia emissions?  How does Teagasc foresee us being able to reduce both nitrous oxide and ammonia, given the health implications of ammonia emissions?</p></speech>

I should have added that they are not on the table at present and are unlikely to be for some time, if at all.</p> <p>  She raised an important point about short-term versus medium to longer-term actions.  When we talk about short-term responses we are arguing from a position of existing research and existing knowledge.  That was the basis of our MACC curves.  All those technologies have been tried and tested.  The challenge now is to deploy them onto farms.  They are ready to be rolled out on the farms.  Many farmers have adopted them but, typically, one finds in an adoption process what has been characterised as an S curve turned sideways or a sigmoid curve.  At the very early stages there tends to be very low levels of adoption.  Some farmers at the frontier adopt and then they can influence others around them.  It is the same situation here.  Farmers have to change on a number of fronts and we are not naive enough to think it is going to happen very rapidly in the early stages, but we think it will pick up momentum.</p> <p>  That is why the signpost farm programme has been devised, to focus particularly on demonstrating to farmers how they can benefit in a real way from adopting the known and existing technologies.  As I said earlier, we are not in any way underestimating the challenge of persuading farmers to change.  For example, if one is a farmer who has been buying 18-6-12 fertiliser for years from one's co-operative or merchant, it is very hard to change overnight to a product one does not know anything about or perhaps the merchant might not have the knowledge and information.  It will require what we believe to be an all-industry response to get the adoption of the type of changes that are required and to make the quick impact that the Senator and everybody else is concerned about.</p> <p>  The Senator is absolutely right about feed additives.  Most of the existing technologies we are looking at are designed for indoor systems.  Our challenge is to adapt those to grass-based systems.  We are in complete agreement with the Senator on the desirability of doing that.</p> <p>  I will leave the question about ammonia emissions to Dr. O'Mara because that is his area of expertise.</p></speech>

The main alternative fertiliser type available and which is used in many other countries is urea.  We use some of it in Ireland, but much more of CAN than urea.  Urea is associated with emissions of ammonia.  Protected urea is the one that hits the sweet spot in that it is a urea that does not produce ammonia.</p><p>It is low in both nitrous oxide and ammonia, which is why it is the fertiliser type we would advocate as the main nitrogen source on our grassland farms.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.161" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Frank O'Mara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#YYY00500"><p>That can be the case.  Generally, increasing the efficiency of a system is a good thing to do in that we are getting more for what we put in.  That translates into reductions in an agricultural system and into reductions in carbon footprint, and it can translate into reductions in overall emissions as well.  However, if there is not a reduction in the overall level of activity, there can be a situation where we are reducing the carbon footprint but we are increasing the overall emissions because there is more activity.  That is not to say efficiency is not something we should not seek in any case.  We talk about the sustainable production of food, which means we have to get as much food out for the inputs that we put in.  Therefore, efficiency is a very important part of the repertoire of things we want to bring to bear on agriculture.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.162" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry Boyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#YYY00600"><p>To add a quick point which is brought out in our presentation, there is one very good example where we get both a reduction in carbon footprint per unit of animal or per kilogramme of output, or whatever it might be, and we get a reduction in total emissions.  That is the case of slaughtering animals at an earlier age, which gives that double dividend.  That is one example.</p> <p>  It is relevant also to the earlier discussion on the stable herd.  Obviously, if there is a stable herd and we can reduce the footprint, we reduce overall emissions.  The risk is that there can be a rebound effect, as we call it.  If a farmer generates more profit because of being more efficient, then there is an incentive to increase numbers and activity.  That is the difficulty.  If we can hold activity level constant and push down the footprint, that is where we get the real dividend from efficiency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021041400002#YYY00700"><p>I wish Professor Boyle the very best of luck in the next phase of his career.  I ask him to put on his hat from the Climate Change Advisory Council.  As he knows, a statutory function is to be provided for the Climate Change Advisory Council and the climate action (amendment) Bill will set out a five-year carbon emissions cap for the country.  That has to be rubber-stamped by the D&aacute;il, although, sadly, just rubber-stamped.  Sectoral caps will then be put in place without any consultation with the Oireachtas whatsoever.</p> <p>  My concern in regard to these sectoral caps is that they are five-year caps but agriculture needs a long lead-in time to bring about change.  My concern is that when we hit 2025, and the Department of Transport and the Department responsible for energy have kept their hands in their pockets, so to speak, the statisticians will then turn to agriculture and tell it to reduce stock numbers overnight in order to try to achieve our 2025 or 2030 targets.  Can Professor Boyle comment on the built-in incentive that is now being put in through primary legislation for other Government Departments to do as little as possible and let agriculture carry the can in the fourth or fifth the year of the implementation?</p> <p>  I want to come back to the broader issues and the issue of the structure that is there in terms of climate targets.  As we know, climate targets are designed by industrial countries to deal with the bulk of emissions coming from industry, cities and intensive agriculture.  In Ireland, 37% of our population live on 96% of the land mass in rural areas and we have only two cities with a population over 100,000.</p><p>Our challenges and issues are very different from those of any other EU country.  It is about managing our land use and our dispersed populations.  In that context, an in-built industrialised-country bias is being adopted here and enacted into legislation that could have a detrimental impact on the economy.  Take, for example, beef production.  We all accept that Ireland, as a net exporter of beef, is the most efficient producer within the European Union.  The environmental targets as they are currently structured will see the decimation of the Irish beef industry, which will be replaced with beef coming from South America.  If it comes from the Amazon basin, it is 35 times more carbon intensive than the beef from Ireland and that is before it is exported to Europe.  While that is okay from a climate calculation point of view, it has a detrimental impact in terms of global warming.  Our guests might comment on that.</p><p> The issue of biogenic methane is related to that.  Deputy Leddin highlighted the issue well.  The difficulty is that environmentalists look purely at the figures on this matter rather than at the source of the methane.  The methane coming from agriculture is part of a biological cycle, and as long as numbers are maintained, that biological cycle will remain in equilibrium.  Disappointingly, while the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill pays lip service to biogenic methane, it will not enshrine in law that it should be treated differently.  Professor Boyle mentioned the approach being taken in New Zealand.  Will he elaborate on the fact that in that country, biogenic methane is treated in legislation very differently from other sources of methane that add to global warming?</p><p> Ireland is very involved in the scientific community in terms of agricultural sector.  Based on Professor Boyle's engagement with the IPCC and the community feeding in to that, does he think that the IPCC approach is likely to look differently at the various sources of methane and not treat them all the same, as is done currently, given that each of them has a very different impact on global warming?</p><p> Professor Boyle spoke earlier about the grass-based systems in Ireland in the context of his home place.  Disadvantaged land types cannot be used for tillage or for growing crops to feed the public directly.  The only way food can be produced is by converting stock into animal protein that can then be used to feed our population.  In many parts of Ireland, that is the only way that such land can be actively cultivated to produce protein fit for humans.  Based purely on the mathematical calculations being done at the moment, however, whether we like it or not, what will happen is if an overall cap is put on stock numbers in Ireland, dairy numbers will increase as the beef herd haemorrhages in terms of numbers.  That will take much of the beef production off marginal land and let the land go fallow, which is not good in terms of food production and is definitely not good in terms of low-emissions protein production to feed our global population, particularly when we use grass-based extensive agriculture with its low-emissions profile.</p><p>How do we deal with the contradiction in terms of the environmental zealots and mathematicians on one side who are saying we have comply with these figures rather than looking at what is best for our global environment, which is to maintain and support small indigenous farmers in rural communities across the west and north west of Ireland rather than shutting them down in terms of large beef production in South America or dairy production in other parts of the world?</p></speech>

However, despite what might be the outside perception, and it has been a challenge for me, I have been most impressed by the way the council has addressed agriculture.  In the past two or three years the council was the first body in the country to identify the issue Deputy Naughten has underlined of the uniqueness of biogenic methane and argued for a separate target for biogenic methane.  I have no reason to believe that, notwithstanding the Deputy's comments in respect of the Bill being discussed, that emphasis on the uniqueness of biogenic methane will be maintained.  It is certainly something I will be articulating.<br/><br/>The Deputy and I are in complete agreement in respect of the challenges of disadvantaged land.  I have been saying for some time that there are no alternatives to the production of human protein through livestock and also to the maintenance of those landscapes in such a way that the rest of us can enjoy them for recreation purposes.<br/><br/>I do not necessarily agree with the Deputy but we could argue the point.  He is presenting a very pessimistic and worst case scenario where there was a significant additional reduction in sucklers.  As I said earlier, there is a strong future for suckling.  I believe it will be maintained in the traditional areas.  I accept that a premium price is required for a premium product.  There will be alternatives in dairy beef and so on.  It is not that long ago that the country managed quite well with substantially fewer suckler cows.  If that future were to unfold I do not believe it has to be as pessimistic as the Deputy says but time will tell.</p></speech>

When they are speaking I ask that, where possible, they have their camera switched on and be mindful that we are in public session.  In addition, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin or both, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be refused.</p> <p>  Our agenda item today is the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of a certain institutional burials (authorised interventions) Bill.  I advise members that Ms Mary Lawlor was invited to appear before the committee to represent the Sean Ross Commemorative Committee.  However, unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, Ms Lawlor is unable to attend today and sends her sincere apologies.  I will share Ms Lawlor's speaking time with the other witnesses present.</p> <p>  The witnesses in attendance today in the D&aacute;il Chamber are as follows: Ms Catherine Corless and also Ms Susan Lohan, who is joined by Ms Mary Harney.</p> <p>  The witnesses appearing virtually before the committee from a location outside of the Leinster House precinct are as follows: Professor Phil Scraton, Professor Emeritus, School of Law, Queen's University Belfast and Dr. Maeve O'Rourke, lecturer in human rights, NUI Galway.  </p> <p>  All the witnesses are very welcome to our meeting on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme.  Before we commence the meeting I take this opportunity to thank them for taking the time to prepare their opening statements and to thank those who provided written submissions.  I also take the opportunity to set out the purpose of today's meeting and how proceedings will be conducted to avoid any confusion during the meeting.</p> <p>  While acknowledging the harrowing experiences of survivors during their time in mother and baby homes and county homes, the purpose of our meeting today is to consider the policy provisions of the proposed legislation.  A discussion will take place on the provisions of the general scheme as they relate to the statutory basis and framework under which the Government may decide to authorise interventions at certain sites where manifestly inappropriate burials have taken place associated with institutions operated by or on behalf of the State or in respect of which the State had clear regulatory or supervisory responsibilities.  There are also provisions for the establishment of an agency to carry out such interventions.</p> <p>  I remind members and witnesses that they are expected to strictly adhere to the subject matter scheduled for discussion today.  I also advise witnesses that the opening statements they read into the record here today should be the statement they provided in advance of this meeting.  Any deviation on these matters will be addressed through the Chair.</p> <p>  We are all very much aware of the restrictions Covid-19 has brought to all our lives.  It has also severely impacted the scheduling of public committee meetings.  However, members of the committee felt it important to hear from as many people as possible who may be impacted by or have a professional view on the provisions of the general scheme.  It is the responsibility of parliamentary committees to consider and discuss topics in a balanced and fair manner.  In achieving this goal, it is the committee, and only the committee, which determines the witnesses it engages with and will do so in an unhindered manner.  This level of engagement will greatly assist the members of the committee in finalising its scrutiny report on the general scheme.  For this reason, and while strictly adhering to Covid-19 safety requirements, four public meetings of the committee have been scheduled over the course of today.  It is also expected that further public meetings will be scheduled in the near future to consider this matter further.</p> <p>  The committee wishes to have a productive public engagement.  However, I must remind all present that they should not mention names of individuals or organisations even if that information is already in the public domain, nor should they make charges against anyone by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>These are normal parliamentary procedures that exist to ensure engagements are conducted in a constructive way.</p><p> Before I invite people to make their opening statements, I must read out the standard text regarding the provisions of the Defamation Act to remind witnesses of their rights and obligations.  I want to take a minute to brief the witnesses on the work of the committee since the publication of the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters and the pre-legislative scrutiny by the committee to date of the general scheme of the proposed Bill.  While the committee has been limited in the number of public meetings held due to Covid-19, it afforded priority in its consideration to scrutiny of the proposed Bill, the issues that have arisen following the publication of the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters, and the desire of members of the committee to ensure justice for the survivors of mother and baby homes.  These matters have been discussed at eight of our committee meetings.  Nine joint meetings have been held this year.  The committee has corresponded with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on five occasions on various matters and it has met the Minister and his officials to discuss these issues wherever possible.  The committee has prioritised these issues above other competing demands related to its vast work programme insofar as it reasonably can.  It stands ready to help to facilitate delivery on the recommendations and actions contained in the report into mother and baby homes wherever possible and to undertake robust scrutiny of any and all related legislation referred to it, such as the general scheme under discussion here today.  We made a public call for submissions on the scheme on 22 January, with a deadline of 19 February.  The deadline was later extended until 26 February, and every effort was made to ensure maximum reach and accessibility during this process.  In total, the committee received 426 submissions.  It has received substantial stand-alone correspondence from the public on these issues and appreciates the engagement and effort the public has made to date on what are very difficult issues.</p><p> At this point, I would like to highlight some of the support services.  I am aware that today is going to be a long day dealing with some very difficult issues for people.  Therefore, the dedicated counselling service for former residents of mother and baby homes is available.  Its number is 1800 817 517.</p><p> Without further delay, I will move on to our advice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses present in the D&aacute;il Chamber are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege, and it is my duty as Chair to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if the statements of witnesses are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p> For witnesses appearing virtually, I need to point out that there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege will apply to evidence given from locations outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, it is imperative that they comply with any such direction. </p><p> We will start with Ms Catherine Corless, followed by Ms Susan Lohan and Professor Phil Scraton.  We sincerely appreciate their travelling to be here with us today.  For many of them, this is a long-standing issue.  It was supposed to have been dealt with in early 2020 but that did not happen.  Therefore, we really do appreciate the witnesses taking the time to be here.  They are very welcome.  Without further ado, I ask Ms Catherine Corless to make her presentation.  She has between five and seven minutes.  I thank her very much.</p></speech>

We really appreciate it as part of a final effort to pass this legislation as soon as possible.  I am a researcher into Tuam mother and baby home.  My research revealed the tragic fact that 796 babies and young children died in the Tuam home in the years in which it was run by the Sisters of Bon Secours, from 1925 to 1961.  Worse still, many of those babies were indecently buried in a defunct sewage system at the back of the home, and it was this disclosure, which hit the headlines worldwide, that was instrumental in setting up the commission of inquiry that operated from 2015 to 2020 to inquire into all the mother and baby homes.</p> <p>  The fifth interim report of the commission, published in 2019, gives explicit detail on what the team of archaeologists found, namely, 17 chambers of the sewage tank filled with the remains of infants, older babies and children up to four years old, discarded without coffins, one on top of the other in those chambers.  The chambers are accessible only by a concrete lid at the top, not wide enough to allow an adult through, so we can only assume at this time that the babies must have been lowered down by some method or other, maybe by a sheet or ropes.  We do not know yet.</p><p>These same chambers contain shutters with openings to the main sewage tank, which was originally designed to separate bulk sewage from water while it was in operation during the workhouse period.  Since the babies were interred there, from the late 1930s onwards, heavy rain has flooded the area and the seeping water has caused some mingling of the little remains, which is evident from water marks in the chambers.  In one photograph from the 2019 interim report, a little finger is attached to a chamber wall because of the water lashing against it.  Many of the little remains have evidence of rodent gnawing. </p><p> In March 2017, statements of shock and horror were proclaimed by the Government and the President on all national media after the announcement by the then Minister, Katherine Zappone, regarding the discovery of multiple babies' remains at a sewage facility in Tuam on the grounds of the old home run by the Bon Secours.  I naively thought then that my work was done and that now surely there would be immediate action by the State, the church and Galway County Council to do the right thing and exhume the babies from this sewage site.  Within a month, to my dismay, the Tuam home tragedy fell silent, the site was restored to its original condition, the chambers were closed in, soil was put back and grass seed was sown.  Imagine the pain this caused to the families of those in that sewage tank.  What would committee members' reaction be if they had a baby brother or sister within those infested chambers? </p><p> Outside the walled-off area with the grotto we are all so well accustomed to, there are many more burials, some perhaps in boxes, others perhaps in shrouds.  They are in the grassed area all around the playground, under the pathways and under part of the huge playground.  We know this from local knowledge, from the wording in a Galway County Council memo the commission included in its fifth interim report and, more importantly, from a ground penetrating survey carried out under the instruction of the then Minister, Katherine Zappone, in summer 2017.</p><p> I have forwarded the result of this survey to all committee members.  They will see from the pages I have sent that the radar system picked up 69 anomalous and 23 subtle responses, many of them measuring 3 ft 3 in. by 1 ft 6 in., which strongly suggests little burial plots.  The anomalous responses are marked and numbered on one of the photos in the survey.  It allows easy access to carry out experimental excavation.  It is almost a case of "X marks the spot".  The report suggests that trial excavations be carried out in those areas.  We cannot forget the missing babies of Bessborough Mother and Baby Home, Sean Ross Abbey and all the others; they must be accounted for as well.  Some ground was surveyed in those places but it did not account for possible underground passages and vaults such as that in Tuam.  It is quite possible they used those areas.</p><p> DNA testing of remains is crucial and quite possible.  The archaeologists who worked on the Tuam site stated in the fifth interim report that the babies remains are in excellent condition and, although mingled because of seeping rainfall, have little sign of erosion or fragmentation, including even delicate infant skull bones.  DNA testing should also search for signs of starvation, evidence of which is to be found in the death reports, injury and malpractice.  A DNA database should be set up as soon as possible for families who wish to give their DNA in the hopes of retrieving their babies' remains.</p></speech>

I am the co-founder of Adoption Rights Alliance.  I am joined by my fellow advocate and survivor, Ms Mary Harney.  We are pleased to be here today.  I am an adopted person, separated from my mother immediately after birth.  Ms Harney was born in the Bessborough mother and baby home in County Cork.  She spent two and a half years in that institution and was illegally fostered from there.  At the age of five, due to neglect on the part of the foster people, she was taken to court by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, and was subsequently incarcerated until the age of 16 and a half in the Good Shepherd industrial school, Sunday&rsquo;s Well, Cork.</p> <p>  We are here today in a private capacity but we are also both members of the collaborative forum of mother and baby, county and Bethany institution survivors and have been since 2018.  As survivors, we endeavour to describe the treatment of all victims of Ireland&rsquo;s forced adoption and enforced family separation systems in human rights terms, irrespective of when and where the abuse occurred.  We have embraced the international human rights models of transitional justice in describing the actual abuses and in recommending potential remedies around the four pillars of truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-repetition.  Sadly, we find that the proposed burials Bill is not in keeping with these central tenets of transitional justice and we will address our concerns under a number of headings.  We are not legal experts.  We are volunteer advocates for our fellow survivors and the voiceless 9,000-plus deceased children identified by the commission of investigation.  The committee will undoubtedly hear more professional and more detailed submissions over the course of its pre-legislative scrutiny.  We make our recommendations from the heads and hearts of those so willfully discarded and othered by the State, its agents and various churches.</p> <p>  It is evident from the outset and from reading the purpose of the Bill that there are huge problems.  The Bill allows for the powers of the coroner under the Coroners Act to be disapplied during the existence or establishment of an agency that will be set up to investigate the existence of inappropriate burials.  I have a small table that highlights some of the issues that we would like the committee to highlight.  It seems from the Bill that intervention will be based on the existence of inappropriate burials rather than suspicious or unlawful deaths.  The Government has given itself considerable powers not to proceed with intervention at various sites.  It has a five-criteria test for whether an intervention should proceed.  We are concerned that the Government can unilaterally decide to memorialise a particular site, rather than to intervene and investigate any remains.</p> <p>  We feel that the wishes of family members and survivors for truth and justice should be central in the burials Bill.  An alternative could be to amend the Coroners Act, rather than proceeding with this Bill.  We feel that it is imperative that we get to the absolute truth of all of these deaths and burials.  As we saw from the final report of the commission of investigation, several survivors were disbelieved by the commission.  There were references to contamination of evidence and I think the Irish public needs to realise the extent of the horrors that existed and happened in these various institutions.  The lack of involvement of local coroners and the entire coroner system is a misstep within this Bill.  We propose that either the coroner system is interwoven into this Bill or that the Coroners Acts would be amended to give them the powers which are now being earmarked for this agency.  </p> <p>  The suggested provisions on sealing data that emerges from the investigations into these burials is anathema to us.</p><p>As we saw with the digital archive controversy in late 2020, the Data Protection Commissioner has already ruled that such sealing of records is unlawful so I am somewhat at a loss as to why the same scenario is being suggested for this Bill.  </p><p> We also want relatives to be kept informed at all points during any investigation.  Progress reports should not just be going to the Minister.  Some of the timescales are also deeply disturbing for family members of people with children whose remains are interred in these various sites.  A timescale of five years has been suggested so that the agency would not have to release a body within that timescale.  We very much reject this.  </p><p> I hope the committee will have an opportunity to listen to the various experts who will present today.  From the survivors' perspective, this Bill falls far short of what is not only expected but promised if we look at the Taoiseach's apology.  It falls very far short of what would be expected in international best practice when it comes to the treatment of mass graves.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for inviting me to speak to the Government&rsquo;s general scheme of the Bill.  I will provide a brief introduction to my research and who I am.  My knowledge regarding the investigation of, and inquiry into, deaths that occur in controversial circumstances specifically involving state and non-state institutions spans more than four decades.  I am a founder member of the UK-wide non-governmental organisation, NGO, INQUEST, which was established in 1980 to safeguard and promote the best interests of bereaved families.  Since then, the focus of my research has been on bereaved families and survivors of tragedies.  I headed the research for the independent panel into the Hillsborough disaster, whose extensive report in 2012 led to new inquests that reversed the findings of the initial inquest and brought about a new police investigation and criminal prosecutions.</p></speech>

Professor Scraton is a founder member of the UK-wide non-governmental organisation, INQUEST, established in 1980 to safeguard and promote the best interests of bereaved families.  Since then, the focus of his research has been with bereaved families and survivors of tragedies.</p> <p>  Professor Scraton headed the research for the independent panel into the Hillsborough disaster whose extensive report in 2012 led to new inquests which reversed the findings of the initial inquest and led to a new police investigation and criminal prosecutions.</p> <p>  In 2019, Professor Scraton was appointed to the UK JUSTICE working party into inquest and public inquiry reform which reported the following year.  In 2020, Professor Scraton was invited to give written and oral evidence to the New South Wales select committee on deaths in custody and coronial reform.</p> <p>  Currently, Professor Scraton is principal author of the research report of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Death Investigation, Coroners' Inquests and the Rights of the Bereaved, to be published later this month; he is chair of the Haldane Society's inquiry into the official inquiry process in England; and with me, he is a member of the three-person panel appointed to advise Northern Ireland's Ministers on the most appropriate form of investigation and inquiry into the mother and baby and Magdalen institutions.  Together, we co-authored with nine other academic practitioner and survivor authors our written submission which the committee has.</p> <p>  Turning now to the proposed legislation, clearly its enactment would disapply existing powers of the coroner in whatever locations and in respect of all deaths over which a new agency is given jurisdiction.  The Bill implies that families of infants and mothers who died in institutional custody will be compelled to make a choice between exhumation and identification of their relative's remains followed by reinternment on the one hand and the coroner retaining the power to hold an inquest to confirm the deceased's identity, approximately when he or she died, where he or she died and, most important, how he or she died.  The Bill also implies that no appropriate process already exists to conduct examinations, exhumations and identification, where necessary, of individuals who have died when in State care or when actions or inaction of State employees are involved.</p><p>I am just going to pause now because Professor Scraton is back with us.  Should I continue or hand over to him?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.195" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Maeve O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#G00300"><p>The committee will be aware that the coroner has a statutory obligation to hold an inquest if she or he considers that a death may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner, suddenly and from unknown causes, or in a location or circumstances that require an inquest, for example, in prison.  The Coroners Act 1962 also empowers the Attorney General to direct a coroner to hold an inquest where a person has died "in circumstances which in his opinion make the holding of an inquest advisable".  It is now two decades since the Government-appointed working group published its review of the coroner service in Ireland calling for root and branch reform.  The ICCL report authored by Professor Scraton establishes that existing legislation requires significant overhaul to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights.  Having said that, existing legislation allows the Minister for Justice to arrange exhumation and post-mortem examination which could and should, where possible, include identification.  It also permits inquests to proceed where bodies have not been found.</p> <p>  The crucial questions to be answered are why no inquests into the deaths in mother and baby institutions or county homes have been held and why the general scheme of the Bill proposes to disapply the coroner&rsquo;s existing mandatory jurisdiction.  We are aware that coroners have been notified of the unmarked burials in Tuam and Sean Ross Abbey.  The final report of the mother and baby homes commission of investigation established that 9,000 or 15% of the infants born in the institutions examined died there, in addition to the deaths of 200 mothers.  The commission describes the infant mortality rate as "very high" when compared to the national average.  There are many deaths for which no specific cause is known, where there is no death certificate, or where the resting place of the person is unmarked or unknown. </p> <p>  The mother and baby institutions were the responsibility of the State.  They were either directly State managed or there was extensive State involvement in their operation through funding, regulation and inspection.  Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights applies, requiring an effective investigation wherever a person dies in circumstances engaging State responsibility, not least in the context of inhumane treatment.  Article 8 of the European Convention, that is, the right to respect for private and family life also applies. This is particularly relevant to ensuring the return of remains to relatives. </p> <p>  Our recommendations to the committee are contained in our written submission.  Given that we concur with the commitment to overhauling the coronial system in Ireland, such reform should prioritise deaths in mother and baby institutions and other related settings.  If the Government wishes to maintain its proposal for an agency, that agency must co-operate with the overhauled coronial system as that system carries out inquests into deaths in mother and baby institutions and other related settings.  Our written submission contains details about issues regarding deaths not only in mother and baby homes but also in industrial schools, Magdalen laundries and other institutions.  The appointment of an agency coroner could be considered, with the necessary additional powers and duties to comply with Ireland's European human rights law obligations.  These additional coronial duties include independent investigation, dedicated infrastructure, full disclosure obligations, a mandatory requirement for publication of findings and full involvement of families. </p> <p>  It is a privilege for me and Professor Scraton to be here today alongside those whose lives have been, and continue to be, directly impacted by this institutionalised atrocity.  Today we reflect on the inhumanity within these institutions, meted out by those within and beyond the walls who operated and serviced them.  We are involved in a professional capacity, albeit affected profoundly by the revelations.  For the families, the bereaved and survivors, however, there is not a day that passes on which those deeply impacted by this inhumanity do not mourn their loss.  It has defined their lives and their voices must be heard.</p><p>The State&rsquo;s response must meet their right to truth, justice, acknowledgement and dignity.  We both look forward to being of further assistance.</p></speech>

I cannot but begin by saying how appalled and moved I was reading the submissions and opening statements for today's meeting.  I do not think any of us could but be extremely upset by them.  We are also here in our professional capacity.  I can only imagine the horror families and survivors live every day.  I begin by acknowledging that and, as Dr. O'Rourke said, by being still with the sheer magnitude of that horror.  As we go through the interim report, we see the horrific way in which human remains were dealt with, especially in Tuam.  There is no way to overstate just how horrible and inhumane this was.  I begin by saying that.  That is where I am coming from in anything I have to say here.</p> <p>  I thank all of our witnesses for their extraordinary work and for their contributions here this morning.  I begin by thanking Catherine Corless especially.  Our State owes her a serious debt of gratitude for bringing this horrific history to light.  I agree with her that this has gone on for too long and that now is the time for action.  I note that several of the submissions for today's meeting talk about us acting or moving quickly.  I believe this pre-legislative scrutiny will give the witnesses an opportunity to see just how determined this group of public representatives is to ensure that happens very quickly, that this legislation is acted on and that decency, respect and human rights are accorded to these remains.  That is necessary.</p> <p>  My questions and commentary are open.  I just aim to hear further detail on a number of matters.  The need to keep family members informed is absolutely essential.  Thus far, have we had a means whereby everyone who believes they are a family member has had an opportunity to contribute?  Do we have some sort of list or database apart from the records of the homes?  Are we confident that has captured everything needed to ensure that family members are kept informed?  At some point, this agency will need to compile some sort of index or develop a mechanism whereby people can register their interest, that they need to be kept informed or what they believe.  Perhaps this could be of assistance in developing a DNA database which would extend beyond just the immediate family members, which is what is currently planned.  I am interested in hearing comments on that.</p> <p>  As regards the coroner's jurisdiction and the agency, because this is the first time an agency has been established with this particular, very specific remit, it may be useful to write into the Bill the ability to grant or remove powers or to move them somewhere more appropriate as experience is gained and as we go through the process, with Tuam being the first of many.  In that regard, I note the very helpful appendix A to the submission of Mary Harney, Mary Lawlor and Susan Lohan, which tells us what happened in the investigation-----</p></speech>

Today is a really important day.  It opens the door to try to move on and give these lives the respect they were not given in life.  I commend Ms Corless on her work.  The domino effect of what she has done has been tremendous.  The State owes her significant thanks.  It is really important the victims are at the front of our thoughts here today, as well as the families who are grieving or looking for family members and the little babies who may no longer have family members in existence because this goes back to the origins of the State.  It is incredible to think of the little lives that were lost and not taken care of properly.  Today is a good day because the State can come back and say that all those lives mattered.  This is the start of that process.</p> <p>  I only have one question because, for me, today is a listening and learning process to inform the next steps to be taken by the committee, such as delving further into the human rights issues or the issues to which Senator Seery Kearney referred, such as the coroners and that overlapping of responsibility.  One thing that is not necessarily troubling me but about which I have a question is the threshold of investigation.  I would like to tease that issue out, if possible.  Where is that bar best placed?  There is an emotion and a want for these children to be looked after and then there is the practicality of disturbing the rest of babies who may have been buried appropriately.  It is important to strike a balance and to make sure we reach that threshold.  Tuam is very straightforward in a way because, thanks to the incredible amount of work that has been done, we know babies are buried there.  However, there is less certainty about the extent of burials at certain other sites.  What are the opinions of the witnesses on that threshold?  It is very important in the context of sites other than Tuam.</p></speech>

Our commitments under the European convention really call for an effective investigation, which is one that involves - I know this is being included - family members of the deceased, and fully providing them with all access to all available information and records.  However, I do not see how that can be done when records are already sealed.</p><p> For instance, people cannot get information from the Department about their own children being buried.  I know that is certainly, and I have been allowed to say this, in the case of a Bessborough colleague where her brother died and the mother was not informed in time of the death or where the baby was buried.  For years, she has searched, and during the commission of investigation, the commission found the baby was buried in Carr's Hill.  Meanwhile, the mother had been told years ago that her baby was interred in the angels' plot in Bessborough.  We have not had access to our records before, and this, for me, is crucial to the effective investigation.  We must have access and the investigation must be in public.  It must also ask all the relevant questions, the who, what, where and why.  I believe that by following or incorporating the guidelines from the Minnesota and Bournemouth protocols, we can achieve this.</p><p> I am going to leave the rest of how that is achieved to the humanitarian law professors, who are going to follow, and to the forensic archaeologist.  I believe the coroners must be involved.  Maybe we should scrap this Bill and replace it with a more robust coroners Bill with extra funding.  Bring on the forensic archaeologist and make sure the identities match with the sparse records we have or the unknown records for Bessborough.  We know there are more than 900 children missing there.  Where are they?</p></speech>

I know how difficult it is even for me to speak around this, so I can only imagine how difficult it is for the witnesses.  I thank Ms Catherine Corless, in particular, for starting the ball rolling, for want of a better word, discovering the fact that 796 babies and young children had died in Tuam and, worse still, as she said, identifying that some of these children were discarded into a sewage pit.  Just even the thought of it boils my blood.</p> <p>  I have a generic question for each of the witnesses which I ask because I am looking for advice on this as well.</p><p>What one change would each of the witnesses envisage in the legislation that would make it stronger and fit for purpose and provide a more humane outcome?  I heard what was said about the coroners.  That Bill could be included in this as well.  I am trying to see if there is one change that could be made.  I know it is difficult to answer with one change, but that would give me some guidance as we move forward in this process.</p></speech>

It said the Government would still have the power, even when the agency is set up, either to add to or subtract from what is in the Bill.  What exactly does that mean or does anybody know?  I would be uneasy about changing anything that would lessen the exhumations.  Can the Government just say, "We are not doing this, we will do that"?  Is that the way it is going to be?  I would like to have that clarified.</p></speech>

One is that we have a thorough investigation of the how - how did these children die?  Obviously, the family members are horrified by the conditions in which the children were buried, but they certainly want to know if their children died of natural causes or if they were unlawfully killed or killed in suspicious circumstances.  The second change would be not to allow the Government to decide not to investigate certain sites.  All survivors and family members are equal.  I tried to cobble together a very basic table which showed the number of significant sites where the number of deceased children has not even been established.  That situation cannot be allowed to prevail.  The Government cannot say, "Well, we do not know, so we are not going to bother with that and we will just memorialise, erect a statue or whatever".  That cannot be allowed to prevail.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.214" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Phil Scraton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#L00500"><p>Many apologies for the breakdown in communication.  I do not know why it is occurring today.  I want to try to group the three questions together, if I may.  First, if we take it right back to the beginning, what does my work with bereaved families tell me?  It tells me what people really want, and this is all the families I have ever worked with and it is absolutely clear from all that has been said today.  People want to know the detail of the context in which their loved one died.  They want to understand the specific circumstances in which their loved one died.  They also want to explore the consequences.</p> <p>  Currently, the State's priority is to establish these priorities generically for families.  We are talking about families as if they are one.  In the work I did on Hillsborough, there were 91 families involved, all of whom had their own specific needs and requirements in terms of the inquests even though all died in the same circumstance.  In this situation, where each of those who died did so in very specific circumstances, every family should have the right to access the details of those deaths.  Ms Corless stated that we need to know what happened as regards all deaths - how the burials took place, who was responsible for discarding the babies and so forth.  We need answers to that.  What Ms Corless is undoubtedly saying is that she wants those investigations to be specific to each death.  I will take that into what is so significant in all of this, the inquests.</p><p>As we already stated, the inquest is there to establish who the person was, when he or she died and where he or she died as closely as possible but also how he or she died.  This is the issue central to all inquests in all circumstances, namely, the specific circumstances of how a person died.  We do not really have any choice in this because these, we would argue, are article 2 inquests.  The current proposal disapplies the coroner's jurisdictional powers and blocks the right to inquest.  When I read in the proposed Bill that there would be discretion on this I was really surprised.  There can be no discretion on article 2 inquests.  It is an obligation on the State, a dual obligation, and this answers two of the questions raised previously.  First of all, there is an international human rights obligation that is unquestionable.  However, there is also a domestic obligation under domestic law.  What is so important from my point of view - and this comes out of the most recent work we have been doing on death investigation, coroner's inquests and the rights of the bereaved in Ireland, which will be published in two weeks - is that what we can see in that is there is a process which is inadequate in terms of investigation and we want to see that changed.  In relation to this specific range of cases it is absolutely vital that an agency, if it is established, has agency coroners.  In other words, an agency cannot somehow trump coronial investigation.  Thus, an agency that is established should actually incorporate the coroner's role within it and the agency should be the coronial role going to the who, when, where and how.  That is absolutely central to our argument.  We lay it out in detail in the 61-page submission.  The State cannot duck that responsibility; these are article 2 inquests and must be seen as such.  Even though we might wait for reform of the coronial process in Ireland, this cannot wait.  The relationship between the agency and coroners' investigation is crucial.</p><p> I will conclude with this point.  One of the most impressive issues I have seen in our work since Hillsborough but also going to the 7/7 bombings in London and the inquest into anorexia in Cambridgeshire, is that at the beginning of each of those inquests bereaved families are able to come to the court and state the impact those deaths have had on their lives.  This is crucial.  It must be a forum where families can come, provide the account of their lives and share it with the general public.  One may ask why.  The answer is because it is their inquest, not simply the State's inquest.</p></speech>

In order to be effective, I will go straight to questions but obviously my sentiments are the same as everybody else's.  I will address Ms Lohan and if there is any time left after that I will ask Dr. O'Rourke a question.</p> <p>  If Ms Lohan does not mind, I ask that she give a one or two-word answer to these questions.  I found her table very useful and wish to get clarification on a couple of points within it.  In Ms Lohan's opinion or in that of survivors which she is aware of, will the provisions of the burials Bill allow for any analysis of how the more than 9,000 children died?</p></speech>

We are not legal experts but it is wonderful to hear our concerns being endorsed by the experts who have spoken already and will speak later.  How the children died must be addressed.  There is just no way of getting around that.  It is not a matter of moving children from one burial spot to another, how they died must be investigated as well as who is responsible for that.</p></speech>

It is interesting that the Senator has pointed out that not all the children are necessarily going to have been buried in one spot, as has been suggested regarding Bessborough, for example, or Sean Ross Abbey.  The remains of the children's bodies might be scattered around individual sites.  We need the conditions in which those children were interred to be preserved and protected.</p></speech>

It is not clear whether the agency would be compelled to do that because coronial powers would be suspended while the agency is in existence.  The agency would not be allowed to commence work on a site where the Garda and coroners were already involved.  It is not clear regarding which sites these are, whether the Garda and coroners would be involved from the outset or whether the agency would have <i>carte blanche</i>to start its work.  I am afraid that the proposed Bill raises more questions than it actually answers.  We are certainly not satisfied that the identification of the cause of death and who was responsible will be answered by this Bill and that is deeply worrying.</p></speech>

If I have time left, I would like Dr. O'Rourke to elaborate on that last point and to give us an insight as to why this agency must have coronial powers to get an answer regarding why things happened.

I think this aspect relates to the question raised by Senator McGreehan concerning what the threshold is for investigation as well.  Before I reiterate what that threshold is, and regarding the issue Senator McGreehan has raised, I think there is some confusion among the public over whether a coroner's inquest requires the exhumation of every body.  It does not.  The coroner is about investigating and an investigation can happen in the absence of a body.  It may be that an exhumation is part of an investigation, but the investigation does not require an exhumation.</p> <p>  Returning to Senator Ruane's question about how many of these deaths require a coroner's inquest, we argue that every single one of the deaths in the mother and baby institutions requires an inquest.  The real question then is where that process begins and in respect of a long-term agency coroner.  This aspect also relates to Senator Seery Kearney's question regarding the extent to which families even know yet that they might be affected or be able to make representations in this regard.  Where to begin then is the real question and not saying from the beginning who should or should not have an inquest, because there is not enough information.  What we do know enough about is that these were State-related institutions, either directly run or funded and regulated by the State.  There is ample evidence that generally, human rights violations were widespread.  Therefore, these are places in respect of which all deaths require inquests.  The question is where to begin and how to go about the process.  There must be access to records in order that people will even know to come forward and perhaps to request that they are prioritised.  </p></speech>

Like others, I begin by thanking Catherine Corless.  Without her, we would not be at this point today concerning engagement with victims and survivors.</p><p>We are trying to bring about justice for all those not just associated with Tuam but also the entire mother and baby system that prevailed in Ireland for far too long.  What a horrible system it was.  The work we undertake as a committee on a continuous basis needs to have victims and survivors at the centre of our thoughts.</p><p> I will jump straight into some contributions.  I take my hat off to Ms Corless.  I have dabbled in local history.  Like other Deputies and Senators preparing for today, I read the briefing notes but I have honed in on some matters on which I have worked over the years.  Many Irishmen died on battlefields in the First World War and there is a very extensive Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Britain that has immense powers to exhume and remove bodies from ground that is not under British jurisdiction, bring them to Britain and undertake a full coroner assessment, with DNA to be matched to a family member.  Ultimately, this can put a final chapter in the life story of somebody who died on the battlefield.</p><p> I hope Professor Scraton could consider this because he has looked outside the realm of mother and baby homes at different burial scenarios.  There must be something in international law.  Most recently, I looked at the Hungarian example.  The first step Hungary took as a state was instead of seeing the burial grounds as illegitimate, or inappropriate as we are calling them in Ireland, it gave them legally protected status.  The next part was an 11-stage process from exhumation, including family members and those in a DNA database, ultimately leading to the reburial of the person in question after identifying the relatives.  This brought the matter full circle.</p><p> I am sorry for rambling a bit but this is quite a new phenomenon for us to deal with in Ireland.  Mother and baby homes are not a new phenomenon.  They were around for many decades.  In the tragic aftermath, we must look at what other nations have been doing for the past four or five decades.  I will finish by asking Professor Scraton on his views on the process I have described.  It was a far more complex undertaking and it has been done very successfully over many decades.</p><p> I believe in the coroner process.  This month 98 years ago, an ancestor of mine was murdered in Sixmilebridge.  It was believed that it was suicide and it was not until his body was taken from the grave, laid on white sheets in the burial ground and a coroner's report undertaken that it was established that the man was murdered.  Far too many families will go with stories untold and final chapters not completed unless we have a coroner's input on this.</p><p> Will Professor Scraton speak to the layers of legality that other jurisdictions have put in place to allow for exhumation, protection of burial grounds, DNA tracing and the work of coroners?</p></speech>

They are complex, different but distinct.  Different states operate in different ways in memorialising the dead and also in their record-keeping and the establishment of cause and consequences surrounding death.  When the Deputy spoke, the genocide in Australia sprung to mind and the deaths of Aboriginal families at the hands of the British invaders.  We have seen that very same matter raised again about the relationship between sites of memorial and sites of genocide, on the one hand, and sites of respect.  The Deputy is raising an important question but it is separate and distinct.</p> <p>  It is important for us to consider today how those deaths are investigated, specifically with regard to their individuality and specificity.  It is a question of how they are understood.  The Deputy is absolutely right that we should be thinking of that broader level of memorialisation.  Broad memorialisation does not help individual families come to terms with the circumstances of these deaths.  I am not in any way discounting what the Deputy is saying, I am saying it is a twin track.</p></speech>

We do not know how the children in mother and baby homes died.  What I am saying is that there is long-established legal procedure both in Britain and on the Continent that allows, albeit in a very different context, for everything from exhumation to coroner scrutiny right down to reuniting remains with a family through DNA testing.  I am just saying that as a committee we should not overlook that legality either.</p></speech>

Sorry.  I was having trouble unmuting, which is the challenge of our era.  I thank very much the witnesses for their expert guidance so far.  There is a lot to read in the various submissions.  I am sure we could dedicate two hours to each individual witness instead of unfortunately having to put everyone together.  One of the things I am struck by is that throughout this entire process there has been an erosion of trust.  It is essential we try to rebuild, if we can, some of that trust of survivors and families.  It is really important we listen to what is being said here and what is possible to do and should be done.  I am quite struck by the fact that there is a basic right to have questions as to how family members died answered, and we are all here trying to ensure that the Bill does that.  One of the things I am struck by is the role of the coroner in all this.  I am looking at this in a similar way to Deputy Crowe when he asked how other countries have managed this.  Picking up on Professor Scranton's comments on genocide sites and mass graves in other countries, I would love to hear more about how other countries have managed this and specifically what we are missing in the Bill, not just around DNA identification.  Should we look at including other things in the Bill such as things that would help the identification process, the records, the sociological stuff and the anthropological stuff?  I know we will hear about some of that later, but specifically what are we missing to ensure that these agencies can do the job we need them to do, not the job they want to do, if that makes sense?</p></speech>

Australia is looking to the UK, for example, where I worked on these issues for 25 years before I came to Ireland.  The UK system is an imperfect one.  I do not know how it would even begin to deal with this issue at the moment.</p><p>This is why we propose this has to be a groundbreaking unique first attempt to investigate thoroughly, examine the circumstances and go through all of the issues heard in the submissions today.  I want to make a point on the relationship between agency and coroner.  I was off-line and I am not sure how much of the statement on the coronial position on agency was made clear.  We are speaking about mass deaths and multiple inquests.  The coronial system in Ireland could not do this job.  Agency coroners would have to be appointed specifically to work on these issues.  This would be a major investment for the Irish State and there is no question about it.  I have to say that justice does not come cheap when a State has administered injustice over years.  We understand where the argument about agency comes from but it is not sufficient.  It has to be plumbed into the coronial process.  This means the appointment of not just one agency coroner but as many as it would take to examine and investigate thoroughly all of these cases individually on behalf of each family that comes forward.</p></speech>

I want to use my time to gain from their knowledge and get their guidance.  Our job is to try to frame legislation that will in some way begin to bring about justice for these human rights atrocities.  I listened closely to the witnesses and I have read all of the submissions and I thank them all.  I would appreciate if Professor Scraton could speak to us a little about the coronial process and about investigating each and every one of these deaths.  We are speaking about 9,000 babies and somewhere in the region of 200 women, much of this being historical.  What would be the scale of such investigation?  What would be involved in terms of resources, time and expertise?  I appreciate it is a very broad question but it would be very important if Professor Scraton is able to share this with us.  In doing this we want to try to get it right and we want to try to bring about justice.  I do not know whether I have picked up Professor Scraton correctly but I heard him say the coroner's office does not have the resources.  Does he propose this is something on which we should engage external and international leadership as a State?  I would also like to hear from Ms Corless, Ms Lohan and Ms Harney.  I appreciate the urgency because it has been four years and it has taken us too long to get this far but where does the balance come between trying to progress what we have in front of us and starting again from scratch?</p></speech>

It was mentioned previously by somebody in a quick remark that we could be speaking about up to 25 years if we were to examine every little baby.  I am a bit lost because I do not understand the coroner and the workings of the agency but I can imagine it would be enormous.  It was also mentioned that justice does not come at a cheap price.</p><p>This is all about justice.  We need to do the best we can to ensure that every family member is satisfied with how the remains of their little brother or sister are examined.  </p><p> This may not be appropriate at this stage but may be later on in the meeting.  Who will pay for the cost of the exhumation and DNA testing?  This has not been spelled out in the burial report.  I have been campaigning as best I can for us to deal with what I call the perpetrators, the people who did this, who put the babies there in such circumstances, who discarded the babies.  What about the religious orders?  Are they being called in?  I am anxious to know that.  </p><p> In my opinion the Bon Secours Sisters are no longer a religious congregation as such.  These days, they are first and foremost a business.  They are a multibillion euro corporation.  They have merged with the Mercy Sisters in the United States and the Bon Secours Sisters in the United States.  I would hope that the Government is approaching them regarding Tuam specifically.  We know how many babies have died and are missing.  I would like to know who is funding all this.</p></speech>

However, I agree it is the price of having dispensed with the State's obligations towards all its citizens.  In other jurisdictions, the state has paid that price.<br/><br/>I would argue for speeding up the process for certain families.  There are family members today who want to know where their loved ones are buried and how they died.  Those cases could be prioritised and the children for whom nobody so far has come forward could be, unfortunately, left to the back of the list.  However, we should deal with those families who are suffering today.  <br/><br/>I totally concur with Ms Corless on the need to hold the various religious orders to account.  Ms Corless rightly calls these organisations businesses.  We have the perverse situation in Ireland that we, as taxpayers, are actually helping to fund those organisations because we continue to outsource vital social services to them.  In some of the campuses where these atrocities occurred, the same religious orders are still <i>in situ</i>providing services to, for example, intellectually disabled individuals.  The State needs to get its house in order and decide if we are going to subsidise the organisations that carried out the atrocities or if we are going to absolutely cull them from the list of organisations that we might engage in the provision of social services.  That needs to be dealt with.</p></speech>

I have two questions, the first of which is for Dr. O'Rourke.  We have heard how crucial finding the fate of the disappeared is from a human rights perspective, but disapplying the coroner's jurisdiction seems to fly in the face of those fundamental human rights.  However, the Coroners Act clearly sets out that it is the duty of the coroner to hold an inquest where the body is found in their district and when a person dies in State custody or detention.  Does this law still apply even if the Act disapplies the coroner's jurisdiction in this instance?  Obviously, we know it would require unprecedented resources, but that would not negate the law and the need to find those resources.  That is my first question for Dr. O'Rourke.</p> <p>  If there is time for a brief answer, my second question is for Ms Harney, Ms Lohan and Ms Corless.  In her opening statement, Dr. O'Rourke mentioned that the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice may direct the coroner to act.  Would Ms Harney, Ms Lohan and Ms Corless like to see this happen?</p></speech>

The first question I raised concerned the explanation for the absence of inquests to date.  We need real answers to that so we know what we are dealing with.  What are the civil servants saying as to why the coroner has been disapplied in this law?  Do they not believe there is a legal requirement or do they think it is too expensive?  The coroner is currently obliged and we need to understand why it is not happening.  I believe the legislation will disapply fully the coroner's current jurisdiction.  That is the point of it.  Until it comes into force, the coroner is obliged, but once an agency is established under this law in relation to a particular area, the coroner no longer has that legal obligation or power.  It is a very good question.</p></speech>

This Bill perhaps has not been sponsored by the most appropriate Department.  It might have been better vested in the Department of Justice.  These are the most awful legal matters and why the Minister for Justice or the Department has not already spoken out on the lack of progress and obvious action at Tuam, Sean Ross Abbey and Bessborough is astonishing and inexplicable.  We need clarification from the Minister on that without further delay.</p></speech>

There seems to be an absolute lack of will from the Government to act on this.  It is being dragged out and dragged out.  When I started my efforts first, memorialisation was being heavily decided on for Tuam.  It was mentioned earlier what happens in other countries where there are mass graves after war.  It is almost, I feel at times, as if it is, "They're just illegitimate babies.  Leave them there.  Let them rest."  I had to fight that for many years, that these were individual babies.  They were Irish citizens.  God knows they could have been with us still.  God only knows what could have become of them.  They could be sitting here in the D&aacute;il.  They had every potential if they had got half a chance but the consensus was: "They are only illegitimate babies.  We will put up a statue to them."  Galway County Council really pushed that at the time.  It is time we made up for that and treated them as individuals and Irish citizens.</p></speech>

It is important we listen to what they are telling us and, particularly, to their concerns.  Ms Corless has done great and important work.  My first question is for her.  She was given bits and pieces of information and, thankfully for us, she pieced it together.  Would she say local knowledge needs to be given a priority in this legislation?  In her research, she found herself suspicious but she was determined to do everything she could.  I am interested in seeing how local research can be given a place in this legislation.  I am working with some survivors in Carlow and, for me and for them, it is so important to get the local knowledge.  It is hugely important that this plays a role and Ms Corless might come back to me on that.</p></speech>

Right from the start, when I began my research, I had absolutely nothing to go on.  Even in our local library there was absolutely nothing on the Tuam home.  It was as if it did not exist in paperwork.  I did try for local knowledge at the time and I got very little.  I found that people were very hesitant to speak about the home.  I feel that a lot of people knew what was going on, had put it at the back of their minds, and they just wanted to forget about it.  I know that the then Minister, Katherine Zappone, had requested in the fifth interim report that local people come forward with evidence and knowledge but absolutely nothing happened because it fell on deaf ears.  I found out in the meantime that businesses in Tuam relied heavily on the Tuam home, supplying them with clothes, shoes and so on.  There was a lot of input.  It was even stated in one of the Galway County Council reports that they did not want to close the Tuam home in 1961 because one of the county councillors at the time said that the Tuam home was an economic plus to the town of Tuam.  I think there are probably a lot of people with guilty consciences about what went on at the time.  I found it quite impossible to get any information off the elderly people in Tuam who would have known stuff, especially people associated with the home.  It was just a wall of silence.  With regard to trying to get any information at this stage, I do not think it would work.  That was my experience.</p></speech>

I will ask the two questions next, and I do not know if I will get to Dr. O'Rourke for my last one.</p> <p>  My first question is to Ms Lohan about the lack of provision for the treatment and protection of unclaimed or unidentified remains.  I spoke to a woman this week who had miscarried one of her children.  She sowed a tree in her garden.  To her it was a place to remember, although it was not a burial site.  Have the members of the Adoption Rights Alliance come to Ms Lohan with a suggestion of what would be an appropriate process of treating those unknown babies?</p> <p>  I share Professor Scraton's concerns on the establishment of an agency.  There seems to be an accepted Statute of Limitations, which in Ireland seems to be that no inquest is carried out after 70 years.  Is this standard international practice?  I am concerned that when we consider the Tuam home, for example, the burials were validated in 2017.  The last burial there was in 1960, which is 60 years, but the burials go back to 1925.  We know this from Catherine Corless's great work.  This would exclude many of these babies.  I would like to know if Ireland is very far off the mark in respect of international practice by limiting it at 70 years.  I imagine it would make more sense to give coroners full powers under the Act and resource the offices to do that.  It is so important that coroners get funding.  We spoke of this earlier.  Funding is going to be very important in this and we need to make sure the funding is there. </p></speech>

The fact it does not is news to me as well, and that perhaps an inquest could proceed without a body.  I understand there are circumstances where this can happen, but in this context and to understand how the babies died, I am curious as to how we could proceed investigating in the absence of individual exhumations and identities.  This may be an inhibitor.  In my head I imagine this to be a long process, and that we would have to have an exhumation, an identification and then an inquest of some sort.  Perhaps she will elaborate on that.</p> <p>  On Ms Corless's points regarding local knowledge, and bearing in mind that we have appendix A at the end of the opening statement by Ms Susan Lohan, and that we have other sites, we will need local knowledge.</p><p>Is there a recommendation by which the witnesses could foresee the inclusion of local knowledge in an anonymous capacity, for example, so that in some way we could garner that information?  I have a familiarity with the Gacaca courts in Rwanda following the genocide there and I was out in Rwanda.  I have seen some of that process in a little way but I also know that it was deeply flawed in other ways when there were no parameters around how people contributed.  The usefulness of that information was open to question and it was open to abuse for various agenda reasons.  I am curious to know how we could facilitate that to happen.</p></speech>

The question of an Article 2 European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, inquest goes beyond the immediate cause of death to include contextual causes and circumstances as well.  There is evidence that needs to be gained that does not just come from the body.  It is also worth pointing out that section 22 of the Coroners Act 1962 states:</p> <blockquote> 	Where the body of any person upon which it is necessary to hold an inquest has been buried and it is known to the coroner that no good purpose will be effected by exhuming the body for the purposes of an inquest, he may proceed to hold an inquest without having exhumed the body. </blockquote> <p>Section 23 takes this further, mentioning the scenario where a body may be &quot;irrecoverable&quot;.  That is important because we have hundreds of bodies with no known locations and the answer cannot be to just not investigate.  Section 23 states that where a body may be irrecoverable and the coroner considers it appropriate to hold an inquest, the Minister may order the coroner accordingly.  It is worth saying that and perhaps in due course Professor Scraton can add to that.</p></speech>

Could it be clarified whether that means that the last burial in Tuam was in 1960 and in 2017 the bodies were discovered?  It omits a lot of the burials if one can read that at face value.

One of the recommendations or things that I have discussed with the Minister is the possibility of running the timeline arising out of this pre-legislative scrutiny parallel to that of the mother and baby home timeline, namely to commence it at 1922.  It would make sense to bring it along and expand it to that.  I hope that would be one of the recommendations that would come out of this pre-legislative scrutiny.</p></speech>

I also want to acknowledge and thank Catherine Corless for her advocacy and research on the Tuam site.</p> <p>  My first line of questioning is for Ms Corless and Ms Lohan on providing members of the committee with some understanding of what to expect at the Tuam site.  That site will be subjected to delicate archaeological work and efforts will be carried out on the process of exhumation, examination and identification.  What key findings were contained within the expert technical group report on the Tuam site?  That might help us to understand what is entailed in the practicalities of doing this work and the types of technology to be used.  I know Ms Lohan referenced that there should be a multidisciplinary approach to identification rather than solely basing it on DNA.</p><p>It would be good to get an understanding from a technical point of view.  My question to Dr. Maeve O'Rourke is in regard to the impact of not involving a local coroner in the investigation and treatment of all mass graves.  It is important we have realistic expectations and I am interested to hear Dr. O'Rourke's thoughts on that.</p></speech>

The Philomena Project was set up in 2014 as a joint enterprise between the Adoption Rights Alliance and Ms Philomena Lee, whose experience at Sean Ross Abbey was immortalised in a film that year.  It has been a lightning rod for families, and mothers in particular, who suspect their children are buried at the home, although the commission was unable to come to a conclusion on that.</p> <p>  However, more people would be turned if they were to hear the absolute grief endured by the family members, and mothers in particular, who do not know if their children are even alive, never mind where they are.  We must use every measure possible to convince people.  As Ms Corless said, they probably have guilty consciences.  We must move on from that.  If people really want to assuage their guilty conscience, they must demonstrate they want to help and assist.</p> <p>  Similar to Ms Corless, I believe the knowledge is held locally because, at a number of the Sean Ross Abbey commemorations, people from the crowd have come forward to offer snippets of information which have proved very valuable.  We must capture the good nature of people, people who want to do the right thing, and tell them now is the time to come forward.</p></speech>

It seems to me that it is not inherent or present within the legislation as it is constituted.  We are talking today about finding a model that speaks to the bereaved families.  To me, there is a model that could be used, and that is the Stormont House Agreement, where there was an historical investigations unit, an independent commission on informational retrieval, an oral history archive and an implementation and reconciliation group.  I wonder if some of those ideas could be inculcated into this legislation to deal with the issues of local knowledge, so there is information gathering, retrieval and processing so as to build a more complete picture for everybody.  That is the first question.<br/><br/>The second question relates again to Professor Scraton.  As we heard in the opening remarks:</p><blockquote>	The Bill implies that families of infants and mothers who died in institutional custody will be compelled to make a choice between exhumation and identification of their relative's remains followed by reinternment on the one hand and the coroner retaining the power to hold an inquest to confirm the deceased's identity, approximately when he or she died, where he or she died and, most important, how he or she died. </blockquote><p>Will Professor Scraton elaborate on that?  It seems to me that he and Dr. O&rsquo;Rourke are saying that if we proceed with the legislation as it is constituted at present, we are potentially in breach of Article 2 of the EHCR.  What I do not want, as one legislator, is to be in breach of any articles that deny people their natural rights.  That is all I will say.</p></speech>

First, in regard to 70 years, I do not know where that figure has come from, I do not know who dreamt it up or why, but I am sure there will be an administrative explanation.  There should be no exclusion.  I do not believe we can put a time limit on suffering and I do not believe we can put a time limit on lack of knowledge in regard to death.</p> <p>  Second, a really important issue was raised about the cost and scope.  I have heard this discussion so many times in regard to issues around mass death.  We heard it in the North of Ireland and we heard it over the investigation into Hillsborough, which cost millions of pounds.  The most expensive investigation in British legal history was into Hillsborough, which was just people dying at a football match.  The important issue for me here is that it will cost what it takes.  This was made very clear by the families.  I do not think we can put a price on truth or put a price on accountability.  While I acknowledge absolutely that this will be unprecedented in its cost, in its organisation and in its structure, I think it is a price that will have to be paid.  There is no question in my mind about that.</p><p> The next point, the issue around accountability, truth-telling and reparations, is a very important one.  We have seen it here in the North but that system and process are not ideal either.  Dr. O&rsquo;Rourke and I are currently involved in establishing an investigation here in the North into the mother and baby and Magdalen institutions.  What is so important to gain is that we see this outside of the notion of reparation as simply a material value.  Reparation is as much about knowledge as it is about value and I agree entirely with Deputy Sherlock&rsquo;s point that accountability is central to that in the information gathering.</p><p> If the proposed Bill goes ahead in its present state, it will breach Article 2 of the European convention.  There is no question in my mind about that.  I know that view is shared by Dr. O&rsquo;Rourke and the other signatories to our submission.  Article 2 takes the whole process to a quite different level.  It is an obligation and it imposes a series of obligations on the State.  However this is structured - I believe it has to be a relationship between a new agency and the current coroner&rsquo;s role - we have to accept that the coronial process in Ireland is not fit for purpose, even in its ordinary everyday workings.  Our report, which will come out next week, will demonstrate that.  Having said that, coronial investigation is crucial and central to each and every one of these identifiable deaths.  Therefore, the process has to connect the families who are suffering this appalling loss over time and accommodate that in the context of a full and thorough investigation.  This takes me right back to the point on which we started, namely, that the specific circumstances of how each individual died are crucial to every family.  That is the point of an inquest and it is what an Article 2 inquest would seek to uncover.  It would meet, therefore, the Irish State&rsquo;s human rights and domestic obligations.</p></speech>

Is there anything that Dr. O&rsquo;Rourke wishes to add before we wrap up?</p></speech>

I reiterate that in a situation of institutionalised abuse and conditions of neglect or other human rights violations, of particular importance is the clear separation of mothers from children, the denial of the opportunity to look after their child and their essentially being detained in a different part of the institution.  Those are part of the circumstances that people want investigated and have a right to have investigated.  It is not simply what is written on the death certificate; it is also the surrounding circumstances that are relevant to the inquest.</p> <p>  I will also add one point on international best practice, which is something I am known for promoting.  As I have said previously, we need to emulate the Stasi Records Agency.  This approach has been noted by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of Non-recurrence, in other words, the special rapporteur on transitional justice, to be international best practice for archiving and records access in the context of dealing with gross and systematic human rights violations.  The Government states it is rushing forward a Bill on access to information.  This cannot be just about one certain group.  It has to be about the rights of families to information.  It must not only be about access to personal files but also access to the entire administrative archives that have been created by commissions of inquiry and effectively sealed.  </p> <p>  Taking the Bill in good faith, if its aim really is to assist families of the deceased, I do not see how that aim could ever be realised in the absence of full unfettered access to all records relating to oneself, one&rsquo;s family members and the administrative system.</p><p>That is really important.  It was completely interesting and natural that we actually opened this entire session by Senator Seery Kearney asking about whether all the families have access to all the information they need even to begin to engage.</p></speech>

Under no circumstances can we have a hierarchy of families or a hierarchy of sites.  Obviously, Tuam has received the most attention.  Fortunately, for the families of those with children buried at the Tuam site, it is hoped the majority of their loved ones' remains will be recoverable.  That is not obvious with the other sites.</p> <p>  When I cast a glance through the report last week and this week, so many of the sites have not been investigated.  No conclusions can be drawn about them.  Particularly with regard to Sean Ross Abbey, the commission just said, without any corroborating evidence, that it does not think further investigation is warranted.  That is not the commission's place.  The families' wishes must be taken as sacrosanct, first of all, but we as a nation need to discover the truth behind these awful deaths.</p></speech>

I felt that the speaker was implying that, perhaps at Bessborough, the ground is too big to go over the whole lot of it.  One can, however, do test excavations in different areas on the ground in Bessborough and that would indicate where burials may be.  I will just add that suggestion.</p> <p>  I thank the committee today.

I completely concur with him that one cannot put a price upon justice.  My question, however, was more that Professor Scraton very clearly advised us that the current coronial infrastructure and resources are not sufficient to deal with this.  What we would benefit from, therefore, is Professor Scraton's view at least, and I appreciate it is only an opinion, on what level of resources and time would be required to conduct inquests into more than 1,000 deaths.  If we are not sufficiently resourced, should this be internationally led with local guidance?</p></speech>

I am sorry I did not answer her question.  The really important issue here is there should be no limitations.  That is the point I have been attempting to make.  I realise the issues of costs, skill and investigation are crucial to the Senator's question.  When our report on the coroners process comes out next week, the Senator will read that we consider the coronial process in Ireland is deficient, even in ordinary circumstances.  In other words, we have basically a part-time coronial system administered by a central process, which is inadequate, even for the purposes of everyday life or death.  Here, we are talking about adding a whole different process into the mix.</p><p> We cannot wait for reform of the coronial process.  We have to be able to deal with this with some urgency.  Therefore, we are proposing that the agency, if it is set up, would have dedicated coronial practice within it that deals exclusively with these cases.  The funding has to be found to make those appointments because the cases, as I have already said, will be Article 2 inquests.</p><p> On the question about the absolute expense, we have to, as best we can-----</p></speech>

I am joined by our senior policy and research officer, Ms Sin&eacute;ad Fitzpatrick.  We are delighted to have an opportunity to contribute further, following on from our written submission.  We have set out in writing the relevant human rights and equality framework and provided 25 recommendations on the general scheme.  We hope this information supports members in their deliberations.</p> <p>  IHREC is Ireland&rsquo;s independent national human rights institution and national equality body.  In this role, the commission holds a specific mandate to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights and equality, and to examine any legislative proposal and report our views on any implications it may have for human rights or equality.</p> <p>  The proposed legislation engages a number of fundamental rights, such as the right to private and family life, the right to an effective remedy and women's and children's rights.  I wish to set out clearly again that what happened in the mother and baby homes is a permanent stain on our society.  That we need legislation to set out how to deal with mass graves in rural Ireland is testament to that.</p><p>That legacy cannot be changed but taking real care in what we, as a society, and the committee members, as lawmakers, do now matters immensely.  This is not just another piece of legislation.  Rather, it could be an opportunity for the Government, these Houses and the State more broadly to demonstrate their commitment to a transitional justice approach to survivors of mother and baby homes and their families.</p><p> The discovery of the mass grave site at the former mother and baby home at Tuam in 2017, and the findings of the mother and baby homes commission of investigation final report that many of the homes did not properly record the burials of children who died in these institutions, engage serious human rights and equality issues.  Specifically, the right to life engages positive obligations on the State to investigate suspicious deaths effectively.  In addition, the right to private and family life are engaged in respect of burying loved ones and knowing the fate of family members.</p><p> The commission has issued our own public statements in respect of mother and baby homes, but in our engagement today, we will focus specifically on this legislation and our recommendations rather than wider analysis or commentary.  A human rights and equality approach to the legislation is required and should be reflected in the principles that underpin the rights.  In particular, the right of family members to know what happened to loved ones should form the central objective of the legislation.  The commission recognises that these rights are not absolute and it may not always be possible to retrieve, identify and return remains to family members.  However, this does not diminish the obligation of the State to make best efforts to respect these important fundamental rights.</p><p> Furthermore, the constant thread running through our written submission is the need to ensure there is meaningful participation and clear communication with those women and families who have been affected in the drafting and operation of this legislation.  Their testimony and direct participation, some of which has been sought in today&rsquo;s sessions, is intrinsic to its successful operation.  Participation, dignity and agency are fundamental human rights principles.  Among our recommendations is that, in the setting out of the role and functions of an independent agency, this legislation must incorporate into its establishment and operation a process of ongoing and effective consultation and participation which includes survivors and families of the deceased.</p><p> A key task for this committee will be to deliver effective legislation that will, as far as practicable, protect and preserve mass graves, such as Tuam, and provide for the identification and, where possible, the return of mortal remains to family members.  A process incorporating these principles, while painful, will play an important part in providing truth and justice to those who died and those who survived.</p></speech>

In terms of how this legislation is constituted or drafted at present, how would Professor Murphy propose to deal with the issue of transitional justice?  Transitional justice is a common theme running through every submission we have considered so far today, and I now have an honest understanding of what transitional justice is.  How would Professor Murphy inculcate that into the legislation properly to vindicate the rights of those who should have the right to know what happened to their loved ones?</p></speech>

Transitional justice is a response to systemic or widespread violations of human rights, and it is one particular approach that may be used.  In essence, what we are really saying is that the legislation must be underpinned by human rights and equality principles.  Transitional justice is based on five pillars, including the right to truth and justice, which I think is the key aspect, and it is something victims, their families and their advocates are stressing.  It also involves reparations, non-recurrence and memory process.  One of the weaknesses in the current legislation is that there are a number of sections which should really emphasise a human rights and equality approach and, right now, that is not the case.</p></speech>

I am aware the time is short and I thank Professor Murphy.  In conclusion, and to ensure I adhere to the time constraints, I ask if the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is advocating for a separate process inculcated within the legislation but a separate or independent process that would find truth and speak to all of the issues that the professor has just spoken to there.</p></speech>

At the outset I say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The legislation is seriously deficient in a number of respects.  Broadly speaking, it needs to be redrafted so that it has a clearer human rights and equality framework.  In listing the more specific deficiencies that we have identified in our broader report, the 70-year time limit in the legislation should be removed or reconsidered because this could exclude any sites prior to 1950 from exhumations and that, at the outset, does not seem to be an appropriate way to proceed given the historical nature of the mass graves and the mother and baby homes.</p> <p>  The views of the survivors and family members must play a central role and must be enshrined in the legislation and that is not something that must be done just as a courtesy.  They must be given this statutory right.</p> <p>  The coroner needs to have a recognised jurisdiction over burial sites and in the absence of the coroner having such jurisdiction, whatever is put in place has to be an effective mechanism to determine the cause of death.  There has to be, and it is critical, as the previous session identified, that in order to comply with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights there is an effective mechanism to investigate the cause and nature of the deaths.</p> <p>  In the agency being proposed in the legislation, it is important that it would be overseen by the Oireachtas rather than by the relevant Minister so that for transparency and openness purposes any reports made by the director of the agency on its work should be made to the Oireachtas as a whole.</p> <p>  Likewise, the remains and any personal artefacts should be returned to families and there should be a statutory obligation that unclaimed and unidentified remains should also be traceable.  It will almost certainly be the case that there will be a large number of remains that may not be identified and, therefore, when these remains are being reinterred and buried with the dignity that was denied them in the first instance, it is critical that this be done in a methodical and organised way to, perhaps, allow in the future for those remains to be exhumed at a later stage, should the possibility of identification arise.  Safeguards need to be taken around retention, storage, sharing and destruction of DNA and other records.  We also want to ensure that the proposed pilot programme for identifying victims must not in any way interfere with the State&rsquo;s obligation to make the best efforts to identify and return those found in mass graves to families.  That is just an overview of some of the issues and the report is quite comprehensive in this regard.</p></speech>

Following on from Deputy Dillon&rsquo;s questions, it is somehow palatable for us as a State to consider mass graves in, perhaps, the context of the Great Famine.</p><p>Dealing with them in this instance, our response thus far is the creation of this agency and bespoke legislation and this unprecedented step in the State.  In the nuts and bolts of it, where does Professor Murphy think the establishment of this agency should begin?  What should be its first steps?</p><p> I also have two quick questions.  Is Professor Murphy saying there needs to be power within the agency for a coronial jurisdiction of some sort, or something similar?  In the pre-briefings on this, we talked about having forensic specialists on site at the particular time who are answerable to the agency.</p><p> Given the fact that reporting to the Minister is an aspect of this, is the Minister not accountable, both to this committee and also to the Oireachtas insofar as it is open to parliamentary questions, oral questions and statements in the House, in order that there is accountability and follow-up commencements from a Seanad point of view?  I do not see it as not being synonymous with accountability if no one is reporting to the Minister.  I would like to hear Professor Murphy's comments on that.</p></speech>

Let me try to address them and forgive me if I do not think of everything.  In the first instance, however, we believe it would be preferable that the director of the agency reports not just specifically to the Minister but would report to the Oireachtas.  In our view, that is a more open and transparent system.  That is one point.</p> <p>  With regard to the coroner's jurisdiction, it is unusual that the coroner is specifically excluded from jurisdiction in respect of these particular mass graves.  That may be to do with resources or whatever because the legislation on the role of coroners is probably out of date in any event.  What we are concerned about really, whether it is the coroner or some other mechanism, is that there is an independent, resourced mechanism to conduct a proper and effective investigation into the causes of death to try to determine what they are as best we can.  Therefore, whether it is the coroner's court or some other mechanism is not critical; it is that there is an effective mechanism.  Even if it is the coroner, then he or she must be given the resources, etc. to be able to do this.</p> <p>  I am sorry.  The Senator asked quite a few questions.</p></speech>

To come back to the 70-year time limit, if part of the recommendations from this pre-legislative scrutiny process was to extend that to since the foundation of the State, does Professor Murphy think that would that address the needs?</p></speech>

We know it is the duty of the coroner to act, regardless of how unprecedented the scale of the investigation would be.  In the previous session, we heard from legal experts that the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice can direct the coroner to act.  Therefore, although it does not make sense that the coroner has not acted to date when it is the coroner's duty, and it does not make sense that this Act would disapply the coroner, there are still powers.  The Attorney General and the Minister for Justice have those powers to instruct the coroner to act.  Does Professor Murphy believe that should be done?</p></speech>

Surely, it would be preferable to have a statutory obligation on the coroner to perform this particular role or that the legislation would specify how it would be done rather than some discretionary power that the Minister or Attorney General has.  We would, therefore, argue that either the coroner is given and allowed to play a specific role or there is some other independent investigative mechanism to perform this role, and that it should not be at the discretion of the Minister or the Attorney General.  I do not in any way dispute their bona fides but it should be enshrined in the statute at the outset.  Even at a later stage when the statute is implemented, often things emerge that one has not thought of and these are that we think of right now.  If, therefore, anything is thought of right now that indicates a deficiency or weakness, it is imperative that it be addressed.</p></speech>

We are talking about agents of the State, and the State has an obligation under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights to ensure there is a proper investigation.  Therefore, it would be incumbent on the senior agents of the State to take that particular action.  I stress, again, that it would be better if this were a statutory obligation, enshrined in the Bill in the first instance, and the means and capacity were given to the agency or the coroner service to conduct the investigations.</p></speech>

I want to follow on from the question about the coroner service having failed to act.  Earlier, we heard from Professor Scraton about the need for a coronial investigation and inquest, a point on which I completely concur.  Is one of the reasons the coroner service has failed to act in this regard that the service is inadequately resourced?  That is what Professor Scraton indicated to us earlier.  If we are to deliver justice, it is critical that whatever we put in place, first, recognises that inadequacy and, second, is scaled to a point whereby it will be able to deliver justice.  Would Professor Scraton agree with that statement?</p> <p>  I want to home in on the point about the views of survivors being given a statutory basis.  That is critical.  How do the witnesses think we can best ensure that survivors are given justice and are satisfied through this process?</p></speech>

I listened to the previous session and heard that this is the case.</p> <p>  Going back to the coroner service, I agree that if it is given jurisdiction and resources, and that is enshrined in the statute, it is the best way to go forward.</p> <p>  It is really important that underlying our whole report is that, at all stages in the process, there is communication and transparency and the views of survivors and families are taken into account.  This is one of the most critical aspects of the report.  If I only had 30 seconds here today, that is what I would stress.  As I said earlier, it must not just be a courtesy or something that is discretionary.  It must be enshrined in the obligations of the agency, as it progresses through the various stages of this process, that it will, at all times, not just communicate with them but actually listen to their views and try to take those views on board.  That is key to achieving truth and justice.  We want to make amends for the wrong that has been perpetrated on these survivors and their families.</p></speech>

Will Professor Murphy comment on the current capacity of the coroner system?  The Covid period cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be called a normal time, but we are seeing in this period how overstretched are all tiers of the Irish judicial system.  If people are not potentially losing out on access to natural justice, there will at least be significant delays in seeing it be worked through.  All things being equal, what capacity does the coroner's court system currently have to deal with what would be a significant increase in the volume of its work?  I am interested in any quantification that Professor Murphy can provide in this regard.</p></speech>

To deal with something of the nature of the legacy of the mother and child homes, and the mass graves that we are aware of, will take a great deal of resources and expertise.  It is incumbent on the State to enshrine in the legislation a formal statutory mechanism to achieve that and then to ensure that the resources are there and it can actually be effective when we go to implement it and carry out the tasks in the legislation.  Right now, the legislation is deficient.  Even if the coroner was given the role, I do not believe that the coroners have that capacity.  I stress that we want to see an independent investigative mechanism that is properly resourced and professionally carries out the investigation to the extent possible.  The deaths occurred decades ago and it may not be possible to determine exactly whether it was malnutrition or neglect, but we have an obligation to do the best we can.  I respectfully suggest that the current proposal does not fulfill the obligation on the State to do the best it can in these circumstances.</p></speech>

I largely agree with what Professor Murphy is saying.  Many people's lives are caught up in this, both survivors and unfortunately little babies who just are not in this world any more.  They have passed on to another world, tragically.  Their stories need to be told.  There are 168 in Kilrush in Clare, my own county.  There was an inordinate amount of deaths.  In some years, it was double what the natural infant mortality rate was in the country.  Questions need to be asked and answered.  A major feature, which Catherine Corless opened her contribution with earlier, is that a number of years have passed since the unearthing of this tragedy and scandal at Tuam mother and baby home, and survivors are not getting any younger and want things to come to a conclusion.  Increasing capacity needs to be looked at on top of legislative changes.  I concur with that.</p></speech>

I will go directly to Ms Fitzpatrick.  Her submission addresses the pilot programme under head 47 of the Bill, which allows the agency to decide whether or not to proceed with a full identification process, based on a sample number of bodies exhumed from a site.  Will Ms Fitzpatrick speak to that?  Does she believe that this contravenes our human rights obligations?  Will she comment on that?</p></speech>

The basis and rationale for such a decision to take place could procedurally impact on family members identifying their own individual family members within a grave site.  How that would operate in practice would be a concern.  Another aspect is that the director would decide whether or not to proceed based on those samples.  There does not seem to be any kind of process of appeal built in to that for family members to participate or challenge that decision.  All of these decisions engage fundamental rights, as Professor Murphy said.  On that basis, natural justice needs to be built into the processes.  There needs to be an opportunity for families to challenge those and to have an understanding of why the decisions are made, that they are fair and decided by an independent body and review system.  That is why it is important from a human rights perspective and there are concerns about it.</p></speech>

We have the opportunity to make right the wrongs of the horrors of the mother and baby homes.  A key paragraph in Mr. Murphy's opening submission states: "A key task for this committee will be to deliver effective legislation that will, as far as practicable, protect and preserve mass graves, such as Tuam, and provide for the identification of, and where possible the return of mortal remains to family members."</p> <p>  What is the best mechanism to achieve this and how would legislation be amended and strengthened to achieve this?</p></speech>

The legislation provides for an agency to be established.  As I stressed at the beginning, practically speaking, it is really important to listen to family members and survivors in deciding what sites to select and where they will go.  The legislation is relatively limited to certain institutional sites so the agency will need to engage the relevant expertise.  I am not quite sure if I am answering the Deputy's question but, for example, to conduct an exhumation properly is a very sensitive area that needs very specific expertise, especially in respect of infant graves.  The forensic anthropologists will need to have experience and expertise, as will all the other persons who will follow in the examination of DNA and other evidence.  We advocated in our report that the approach to this analysis would be multidisciplinary because the broader the analysis and the more expertise there is, the more likely a successful outcome.  Where that is not possible, appropriate levels of memorialisation with a proper, dignified burial and memorial to these victims are also critical.</p> <p>  In the end, we want the legislation revised significantly to ensure that, where the process is undertaken, it is at all stages led by human rights and equality legislation and the transitional justice approach is adopted.  This involves making the victims and survivors central to the whole process and ensuring that the resources will be made available.  If this is done properly, in my opinion, it will take a lot of time.  It is again incumbent on us as a society, and on the State, to do the very best in the circumstances to ascertain the identity of the victims, to try to link them with survivors and to try to provide an appropriate and dignified burial, which, clearly, the evidence shows was not the case in the first instance.</p></speech>

There seems to be a move towards exhumation as the only way to achieve human rights adherence and justice.  How do we reconcile this with the fact that so many survivors do not want their babies disrupted in the burial grounds?  For instance, there is a hearing next week about the Bessborough development.  We need to take a step back on these exhumations because not all sites will be, or should be, exhumed.  How do we achieve human rights adherence in those cases?  We cannot have a blanket rule and we have to protect the graves of those babies.  In many cases, angel plots could be described as mass graves.  I want to ensure that can be answered in some way.</p></speech>

However, to my knowledge, the survivors are overwhelmingly in favour of the exhumation from that site.  I do not speak on behalf of the survivors, and I stress that, but the member's particular concern will be answered and addressed if the legislation incorporates a statutory requirement to engage with the survivors and the families at every stage.  I am quite sure that there are diverse views among survivors but my information is that they overwhelmingly wish this process to be undertaken and as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Under the Children Act 1908, the death of an infant while in State custody was required to be reported to the coroner.  This does not seem to have been routine or to have been policed.  The Constitution specifically recognises and protects the right to have nature take its course so that people may die a natural death.  Do the witnesses accept that the only way under UN transitional justice is to give the families the right to truth and justice?  This needs to be investigated further, for example, under the remit of the agency the Bill will establish.  I am afraid that this Bill removes urgency surrounding inquests.  Do the witnesses agree that to satisfy Ireland's obligation under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights to address human rights concerns, this would be a kind of justice?</p></speech>

That is critical to achieving what is the main objective of a transitional justice approach to finding truth and justice.  As another member asked, it might not be clear and maybe there is not a complete consensus among survivors but there is a consensus about achieving truth and justice.  There is an obligation on the State but it is also consistent with what we have advocated in our report to the committee.</p></speech>

Will Ms Fitzpatrick elaborate on her earlier point?</p> <p>  Bearing in mind that the context is that we are establishing an agency that will, hopefully, have increasing and evolving proficiencies and powers, which will then be able to facilitate a response to other burial sites as they emerge or as information on those comes forward.</p> <p>  Is there a best practice matrix for sampling?  As public representatives, we have all experienced developers sampling in a way that suits them to come up with a particular response but we have also had the experience of bona fide investigations on-site which then found human remains afterwards</p><p>Is there a best practice matrix?<br/><br/>Ms Fitzpatrick said that there would be no appeal available in the case of a decision not to proceed.  Any decision taken in administrative law is open to judicial review, so there is a judicial review option, and I suppose my question in that respect would be who has <i>locus standi</i>in that instance?  If one does not know whether one's family member's remains are buried there, then it is questionable whether a family member would have <i>locus standi</i>in that instance.  For this reason, I see a case for there being a statutory appeal mechanism.  I ask Ms Fitzpatrick to elaborate on those points.</p></speech>

However, there are a number of international resources that can provide very good guidance on how to approach the DNA sampling piece and the more comprehensive multidisciplinary approach to identification, including the Bournemouth protocol and the forensic guidance developed through EU funding by the Argentinian forensic team.  That, specifically, is quite helpful in its detail in terms of the different layers of multidisciplinary approaches needed.</p> <p>  The issue with the sampling is also that it cannot be seen in isolation from the full legislation.  There was a real focus on DNA identification as the way to identify and uncover who the bodies are and what happened.  If the Bill had a more multidisciplinary approach, incorporating different professionals and wider investigative powers, then that might not be so much of an issue but in an of itself, it is quite limited and could be problematic in terms of providing individual redress and truth and understanding to family members.  That would be a key concern on that side.</p> <p>  On the procedural aspect, the Senator made the point that while judicial review is arguably an open option, it is more limited to a full appeal of the facts in any given case.  There has been recent case law asserting that there is a requirement for statutory appeal or an independent appeal where the rights engaged are significant.  The commission would argue that this whole issue engages very significant and important rights in respect of the identity of human remains, the return of family members and understanding what happened to them.  The identification process is key to that.  Where a decision is taken not to exhume a mass grave plot based on limited sampling, that has a significant effect on the survivors and family members.  Therefore, a statutory and independent appeal would appear to me more appropriate and provide for more robust safeguards in that regard.</p></speech>

It is most important that we are having these discussions all day because it brings into focus all of the issues and where we can possibly strengthen the legislation.  From what I have seen so far, there seem to be very serious flaws and weaknesses in relation to the role of the coroner.  Therefore, it is good for us to be hearing that and discussing what possible amendments can be made in respect of that.</p> <p>  I have one brief question for Professor Murphy.  In response to Deputy Ward, he stated that if the scheme were to be implemented correctly, it would take a significant amount of time.  Does he believe that this is due to potential funding issues?  I often find that problems around timeframes can actually be caused by funding issues which people may express as timeframe issues.  For example, if the professor were to be put in charge of the scheme tomorrow morning, how long would it take to implement it correctly in the manner in which he thinks it should be done?  I am very conscious of the amount of people who feel that this has been frustrated at a number of opportunities.  I am most anxious - as I am sure everyone is - that we get this done correctly.  Professor Murphy put it perfectly in his opening statement when he noted: "That legacy cannot be changed, but taking real care in what we as a society, and you as law-makers do now matters immensely."  That is the crux of everything that we are trying to find out today.</p><p>Approximately what timeframe does Professor Murphy think would have to be applied to do everything correctly?  That is the only question I have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ray Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#KK00200"><p>That is quite a hard question to answer.  I do not consider myself to have the relevant expertise, but I will attempt to answer the question first based on my own knowledge.  This is an unusual answer, but if the agency that is established sets itself a limited objective then it can achieve that limited objective in a shorter time than if it sets itself the full task of exhuming all the remains.  Does the Deputy understand what I am trying to say?  If a preliminary examination takes place at a particular site and it is determined that we cannot go forward, then that can be closed relatively quickly.  It is probably something that I would not necessarily agree with.</p> <p>  In work that I have done with other professionals in Iraq, the former Yugoslavia and Cyprus, the estimate could be ten to 15 years to exhume all the remains, if that takes place, which I know will greatly dismay survivors.  The technical challenges of dealing with infant remains are extremely difficult.  As members know, for example, there are far more bones in the skeleton of an infant than there are in that of an adult.  After two or three years the bones begin to fuse.  It would be very hard to exhume them and to find remaining body parts that are not contaminated.  In some cases, for example in Cyprus &ndash; this occurred only in 1974 &ndash; the bodies were contaminated so it was not possible to extract DNA from the bodies.  We do not know what may have happened some of the remains in the sites, for example, in Tuam.  It is incredibly complex and technically challenging, but if I was asked to take over as director of the agency, I would insist on at least the capacity to embark on this in a thorough manner.  I remind members that the international obligation on the State is to approach this in using our best efforts to achieve the best outcome.  In the end we may not get the results that we want and some of the survivors and family members may be greatly disappointed.  However, it is critical that the State puts in place the proper legislative framework and then engages with the agency and resources it to undertake and embark upon this.  That will require hiring people who know how to do this and follow international best practice.  There are a number of sites that need to be investigated preliminarily and then hopefully there will be a more thorough investigation, in addition to the other issue of determining causes of death, etc.  It is incredibly challenging but it is really important that it is done well.  The beginning of that is to get the statutory basis right.</p></speech>

The primary focus of the recommendations of the IHREC is the need to ensure there is meaningful participation at every stage and clear communication with the women and families who have been affected.  The central approach of any agency that is established must be to try to determine this.  The ultimate aim must be to achieve truth and justice for the families, survivors and society as a whole.  What has happened is a shocking indictment of past practice in society and we owe it to the survivors and the victims to make the best efforts to resolve this in an approach that is sensitive and achieves the objective of truth, justice and memorialisation for future generations and that something like this will never happen again.</p></speech>

I was conscious that the Vice Chairman had a question and I wanted to cede the floor to him if he needed it.  We will hear in the next session from a group of survivors who are stating categorically that the home associated with them, which would be Bessborough, is not suitable for exhumations en masse and that they would rather memorialisation.  All of us are fundamentally opposed to the idea of it being developed on, giving due respect to the human remains, so I am not proposing that anything like that happens in its place.  However, how do we ensure that the human rights aspect will be respected?  I have spoken to many of the survivors individually and they are of a mind that they do not want exhumations.  One survivor said she wants a chair there where she can go and sit and think about her baby.  How do we respect that and ensure it happens?</p></speech>

The Senator presents quite a dilemma because the commission is advocating that we must engage with the survivors and respect their views and try to take them into account.  I do not speak on behalf of survivors and I would not purport to do so.  Bessborough is also problematic in that it is not exactly known where the bodies are interred.  That presents a practical problem as well.  In that instance, and this is a personal view rather than speaking on behalf of the commission, it is very important that we memorialise appropriately and if that is the view of the survivors and the families, it must be respected.  Memorialisation, which is an intrinsic part of transitional justice, conforms to the wishes of the survivors and it is appropriate and dignified.</p></speech>

Professor Murphy's view, in response to me earlier, was that most of the survivors want exhumation.  How did he come to the view that that was the wish of the majority of the survivors?

There are different stages in the Bill in terms of deciding whether to intervene to set up the agency part, the exhumation part, and survivor engagement should and can be built into each and every stage.  It would be important, if there is to be meaningful engagement, that that be reflected in the legislation.  It is clearly reflected in this part of the process, which is important, but it can be expressly and explicitly built in as an obligation on the Government and on the relevant State agencies to actively engage and seek the views of survivors and relevant family members as they progress through the process in the context of mass graves.  Every situation is different and every individual has a different need or wish in this context, and their voices must be heard.</p></speech>

I am here with my colleague Ms Elizabeth Carthy, and both of us will be happy to answer any questions.</p> <p>  The ICCL is an independent NGO that works to promote and protect human rights in Ireland. The ICCL does not represent particular groups but, rather, works to ensure the Government fulfils its human rights obligations in all relevant law and policy.  In our submission to the committee, we analysed the general scheme of the Bill in light of Ireland's human rights obligations and made a number of recommendations.</p> <p>  As other speakers have done, we underline the vital importance of taking a survivor-centred and family-centred approach to this legislative process, and of doing so at all stages of implementation.  We have to acknowledge that survivors and family members are a diverse group and have a variety of needs and wishes.  It is, therefore, vital that legislation on burials not close any doors or pose undue obstacles.  This includes ensuring that inquests can be held where appropriate. </p> <p>  Institutional burials and mass grave sites imply violations of a range of human rights, including the right to life.  Survivors and families have the right to an effective remedy, which includes the right to equal and effective access to justice, reparation for harm suffered and access to relevant information concerning the violations and reparation mechanisms.  Crucially, the State has an obligation to effectively investigate unlawful or suspicious deaths.  Taking reasonable steps to identify the deceased person and to determine the cause and circumstances of death are key components of this obligation.</p> <p>  The Government has previously acknowledged the importance of taking a transitional justice approach in the context of mother and baby homes.  The key pillars of a transitional justice approach are the rights to truth, justice and reparation, and guarantees of non-recurrence. </p> <p>  In its current form, the Bill has significant problems from both human rights and transitional justice perspectives.  First, it impedes an effective investigation into the deaths of those buried at mass grave sites as it disapplies the jurisdiction of the coroner; the legislation does not apply if the human remains at the site were "buried there following death in violent or unnatural circumstances" or if there is an ongoing criminal investigation.  This limits the scope of the Bill and appears to indicate a presumption by the Government that institutional burials were not preceded by violent or unnatural circumstances.  This does not stand up from an evidentiary perspective given that we know the cause of death for many babies in mother and baby homes, especially in the earlier half of the century, was registered as malnourishment, indicating severe neglect, nor does it stand up from a human rights perspective given that the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has stated, "Mass graves are crime scenes". </p> <p>  Under the current draft Bill, complex and challenging requirements must be met to set up an agency.  It provides overly broad discretion to the Government, additional broad criteria, an unclear proportionality assessment and overly restrictive obstacles.  A particularly problematic restriction is a time limitation of 70 years.  The rationale for this is unclear.</p> <p>  The lack of transparency regarding the agency's documents and records is also of concern.  The Bill effectively provides for the sealing of documents and records for a period of 30 years.  This is problematic and is inconsistent with transitional justice principles, in particular the right to truth.  Access to information is a key right that has taken on particular significance in the context of justice for mother and baby homes survivors and their families.</p><p> Overall, we consider that the Bill lacks a rights-based, survivor-centred approach and is inconsistent with a transitional justice approach.  We recommend that the Government take one of two possible approaches, namely, either significantly reform the Bill in line with international human rights law and transitional justice principles, or amend existing legislation to provide for relevant powers for existing bodies such as the coroner to address institutional burials.  We recommend that Ireland ratify the UN convention against enforced disappearances, as this provides a clear roadmap for dealing with enforced disappearances and is relevant for addressing mass graves and institutional burials.  Finally, we note this is one component of the Government's overall response to the severe and systematic human rights violations that occurred in mother and baby homes.  There is a broader need for the Government to respect its human rights obligations and transitional justice principles throughout this response and we call on it to do so.</p></speech>

We are again seeing a consistent message from everyone who has submitted to the committee in respect of the flaws inherent within the legislation.  It seems it has more holes in it than a block of Swiss cheese and considerable work will have to be done to amend it to make it fit for purpose.  It is encouraging to hear so many Government representatives on the committee, as well as Opposition members, coming together in what I interpret as one voice in respect of the need to amend the legislation.</p> <p>  Returning to the coronial process, there has been consistency in respect of the messages we heard from everyone from Ms Lohan to Professor Scraton and Dr. O'Rourke.  Everybody has consistently said that this legislation could put us at variance with our Article 2 obligations.  Does Ms Ansbro or the ICCL have a view on the coronial process as it is constituted and on whether the legislation as drafted deals sufficiently with the Article 2 provisions?  Does either the legislation relating to the coronial process or the legislation we are discussing need to be amended to take account of the statement by the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to the effect that mass graves are crime scenes?</p> <p>  There is no ambiguity in what Ms Ansbro said or in what the UN rapporteur says and, therefore, there should be no ambiguity in regard to how the legislation should be constituted to deal with the rights of those who are interred in those graves, how they came to be there and what the causes were.  I am trying to get a continuing sense of understanding of where the ICCL sits in respect of the current coronial system and whether Ms Ansbro agrees with statements made by other people who have submitted to the committee in respect of the Article 2 provisions.  Do we need amended coronial jurisprudence or legislation, or should we buttress this legislation further?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.371" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Doireann Ansbro" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#NN00400"><p>We very much agree with Professor Scraton, from whom the committee heard earlier.  Next week we will publish a report, of which he is the chief author, on the current coroner system.  The committee can be assured that we very much agree with him on this issue.  Some issues that will be highlighted in the report relate to the fact that at the moment, the coronial system operates on a part-time basis and is under-resourced, and there is not sufficient training for people in their posts or newcomers.  We consider that the coronial system as a whole needs to be reformed, and I can go into more detail on those reforms later if the committee so wishes.</p> <p>  As for how that is relevant today, it is tricky because we are also saying - this comes to the Deputy's second question - that under Article 2 there is a need for an effective investigation, which requires a number of aspects, including being thorough and family-centred.</p><p>The thoroughness that is required means, as other speakers have said, that we need to know who died, where they died and, very importantly from the perspective of this Bill, how they died and the circumstances around their death, which currently this Bill excludes, and that is a major problem.  We are saying that excluding the coroner's jurisdiction is a fundamental problem.  How does one reconcile the fact that the current coronial system is probably inadequate to deal with these situations with the need to ensure that there are inquests, where necessary and appropriate?  We would say that given the special human rights issues that arise in the context of mass graves, creating an agency that has the expertise, resources and training to carry out excavations, exhumations where necessary, and identifications, is important.  When one gets to the point of identifying how people died and the circumstances of the death, in particular where there are relevant triggering contexts such as evidence of a violent or unnatural death, some would argue that coronial jurisdiction is triggered by the fact that people died in mother and baby homes under State responsibility, essentially, given that it funded the institutions, and had inspection and oversight responsibilities.  What do we do if we have a currently inadequate system but need inquests?  We agree with what Professor Scraton said this morning.  We need to adequately resource specific coroners to deal with inquests for these kinds of institutional burial sites.  It is important and cannot be stressed enough that resources must be made available.  That means coroners need to have adequate training and the powers necessary to conduct the kinds of investigations that are necessary.  There needs to be a hearing and a process that is family-centred, where families can come and share their experiences.  All the things that go into a good inquest need to be applied in these contexts and the reality is that we need to resource specific coroners in order to carry out that role.</p></speech>

The question on which I am conflicted relates to the rights of those people who wish to be memorialised versus the law of the land, as it were, where in unnatural circumstances, the coronial process kicks in.  How do we balance the rights of those people who want to memorialise sites such as Bessborough, for instance, and establish whether that wish is superseded by the law of the land?</p></speech>

It is a difficult question.  On the one hand, the Government has an obligation to carry out effective investigations.  However, we must remember that this process has to be survivor and family-oriented from the start to the end.  That point cannot be emphasised enough.  Ms Fitzpatrick said it well a few minutes ago when she noted that can happen at every stage, including the drafting and implementation stages of the legislation, when sites are being identified and decisions are being made as to whether to carry out excavations or exhumations, and when decisions are made on what happens thereafter.  As we said in our opening statement, there are diverse views among families and survivors.</p> <p>  As regards Bessborough, in particular, we must remember that the commission stated there were 859 bodies of babies missing, so that potentially affects 859 families.</p><p>I do not know how many families we have reached out to but a clear, fundamental and primary thing we must do is to take an active role in reaching out to as many families as possible.  We then need to engage each and every family at every stage.  Different wishes will come up and it is vital that we engage at every stage and honour those wishes as much as possible.  I do not have a simple answer today but what is very clear is that we must take on board what families and survivors want and do our best to ensure that what they want is respected in how we deal with these mass graves.</p></speech>

Hopefully, we will have the information and tracing Bill very shortly.  We need a robust response in the information and tracing legislation to address any shortcomings in the GDPR.  Bearing in mind that the GDPR does not apply to the deceased, what elements would the witnesses like to see in that Bill to address any shortcomings they have found?</p> <p>  My second question concerns the coronial situation and the fact that there could be mass investigations and inquests.  If it is going to be a process that takes a long period of time, should we bring in the Department of Education to ensure we have pathways for careers and means by which we ramp up our capacity and response?  Who are the witnesses at the inquests?  If individuals know that a deceased family member was at Bessborough or Tuam but may not have the personal recollection of having been there themselves, how do we cross that barrier?  Who are the witnesses who are called in for that?</p></speech>

I do not have all of our views at hand because that is a separate piece of work we are doing and we have not yet completed it.  The fundamental principles that need to be incorporated into that involve ensuring that survivors and their family members have access to information not just about themselves but about the process, including the entire adoption system in Ireland in the 20th century.  There are so many unanswered questions and potentially extremely serious violations of human rights incorporated within that system, such as potentially enforced disappearance when one has the forced separation of families and family members who are still unknown and untraced.  To echo the witness from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, that legislation also needs to be underpinned by human rights and equality principles.  The piecemeal approach to these mass institutional abuses has gone on for too long.  We need to put human rights front and centre in all aspects of our responses.  That is key.  I echo Dr. Maeve O'Rourke statement this morning that the UN has described the approach to the Stasi archives in Germany as best practice.  I very much encourage the Government to look at that as an example of best practice in terms of record keeping and access to records.</p><p>Second, on the capacity, we heard this morning that these kind of excavations could potentially go on for years.  One of the points we made in our opening statement is that we need to not close any doors with this legislation.  We need to keep doors open.  We do not know.  Tuam was only discovered in 2017.  That is kind of incredible.  What are we going to discover in the next five, ten or 15 years?  Potentially, this work will go on for a long time.  Senator Seery Kearney is right.  There needs to be a significant ramping up of capacity in terms of expertise.  There is a lot of expertise at international level.  We need to draw on that.  We need to be making connections with people who have worked in other mass grave sites, bringing them in, using their expertise and training up our own experts as well.  Absolutely, I think capacity [<i>phrase inaudible]</i>in this response.<br/><br/>The Senator's third question-----</p></speech>

One of the fundamental problematic aspects of what came out of the mother and baby homes commission's reports for us, particularly what was its fifth report, which came out in 2019, was the idea that the commission believed there are people in Ireland who have a lot of information about mother and baby homes, about burial sites and about what went on who are not coming forward.  There is a fundamental question there about compellability - can we compel witnesses to come forward?  I would argue that these kind of inquests need to have that power to compel witnesses to come forward who have information about what happened, both in the homes and how the deaths occurred, the circumstances around the deaths, whether it is separation of mothers from their babies, why they might have died, what kind of neglect was happening and what kind of overcrowding and lack of medical care obtained.  There are so many questions to be answered and there are so many experts who are still alive because some of the homes were open until the 1990s.  There are people out there with this information and we need to find a way to bring them forward to share what they know in order to give crucial answers to families and survivors who have gone on for far too long without those answers.</p></speech>

Last month, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties asked the UN to request that the Government set up an independent investigation into mother and baby homes and the illegal adoption in Ireland in the 20th century.  Can Ms Ansbro tell me what the UN's response was?  I would welcome this.  There are too many unanswered questions and I would have difficulties with some of the conclusions from the mother and baby homes commission's report.</p> <p>  It is extremely important that we work with the survivors and their families in the context of access to information.  Ms Ansbro and Ms Carthy would have seen, in the context of the mother and baby homes, that the D&aacute;il voted in October to pass the legislation relating access and then we also ensured that the recordings relating to the commission's report were kept.  This information needs to get to the survivors and their families.  It is important that the communication is from all of us in order that we all can work together.  We heard some of the stories this morning and everyone is affected.  We all have a role to play.</p> <p>  In the context of the mother and baby homes report, the first of the 22 recommendations put forward is to give survivors access to their files.  All of us here have a duty of care to the survivors and the families to make sure they can get that access, but also that they can access information with no barriers or in the way they should.  That would be something that all of us have to work on together.  I thank our guests for their presentation.</p></speech>

We wrote to the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence a few weeks ago and we asked if he would consider engaging with the Government to feed in those principles at every stage of the its response.  Unfortunately, we have not received a response yet but we are still hopeful that we will.  We know that he has engaged on this issue on a number of other occasions.  We are certainly hopeful to have that response soon and we would be happy to let the Deputy know at that stage.</p> <p>  In terms of access to information, this cannot be underestimated as an issue of importance for survivors and family members.  Access to information is part of many of these different human rights obligations the committee has been hearing about today.  It is part of reparation.  It is part of effective investigation to find that information and then share it with family members.</p><p>Reparation is not necessarily just about monetary compensation, it is also about having information and having access to what happened.  As many other advocates have said in the past, it is not just about getting narrow information in terms of what happened to oneself or one's family members.  It is also about understanding the process as a whole, what actually happened, what went on in these homes and who was responsible.  There has not been enough emphasis on accountability.  Access to information is all very well but if we have information about a person who is responsible for human rights violations, we need to ask questions about how we hold individuals, as well as institutions, accountable.</p></speech>

The witnesses referenced the fact that the Bill allows for the sealing of documents for 30 years.  I ask them to elaborate on that point.  They also mentioned that our obligations would be different if we had ratified the UN's International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.  What would be different if we had ratified that convention?</p> <p>  Finally, I have a question that I also put to all of the other witnesses.  There seems to be an institutional aversion to providing actual justice and we have seen that historically.  The coroner service has not acted, despite the fact that it is obliged to do so.  We now have a Bill that disapplies the coroner.  If we cannot make amendments to this Bill to encourage the involvement of the coroner, would the witnesses agree with others who said that they would like to see the Attorney General or the Minister for Justice instruct the coroner to act?  Would they like to see that happening if we cannot introduce it in this Bill?</p></speech>

In terms of whether we would like to see the Minister for Justice or the Attorney General asking the coroner service to get involved, the answer is "Yes".  This is overdue and the coroner most certainly should be involved.  There is clear, triggering evidence of violent or unnatural deaths of babies in mother and baby homes.  The coroner should certainly be involved and there are questions around why the service has not been involved so far.  While we would like to see that happen.  However, I would emphasise the crucial point that it not good enough to just to trigger the jurisdiction of the coroner or ask the coroner to begin an investigation.  The Government will also have to provide proper resources to the coroner and perhaps appoint a specific coroner who is trained on these issues and who has the capacity and resources to carry out a proper and effective investigation, which is the requirement under Article 2 of the UNCHR.  I will hand over to Ms Carthy for the first two questions.</p></speech>

On the UN convention, this is actually a novel treaty in international human rights law because for the first time it introduces this right to truth that we have been hearing about all day, into an actual treaty.</p><p>We talked about the transitional justice framework and its rights to effective investigations, truth, justice and reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence but what is interesting about this treaty is that it incorporates those obligations within itself as a legal obligation.  That is the key difference.</p><p> With regard to the sealing of the documents, our understanding is that the Bill provides that all documents and records will be sealed for 30 years on the dissolution of an agency.  That is problematic and inconsistent with the right to truth because, as we keep coming back to it, the right to information and the right to truth are absolutely fundamental.  We need to be able to access the documents.  We also need transparency.  Transparency is a key principle in human rights.  We need transparency in all of our responses to this issue.  We talked a little bit about appeals and oversight in the earlier session with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  In addition to the right to appeal decisions and that kind of thing, transparency on how decisions are made is crucial.  If we end up sealing these documents, an issue might emerge after the dissolution of the agency that requires access to the kind of information that would be sealed for 30 years under this legislation.  It is, therefore, inconsistent with the right to information and truth and should be removed.</p></speech>

They are really great and really helpful to us.  Truth and transparency are obviously critical to the delivery of justice and must be delivered in a timely manner.  The work that is to be undertaken will take a significant length of time.  As the Bill is currently drafted, it includes a proposal for a dedicated agency as opposed to the existing coronial organisation, which is county-based.  In Ms Ansbro's view, is that the right way to go?  Should we go with one single agency with a national remit?  That is my first question.</p></speech>

That is my understanding of the Bill so far.  We believe we need specific coroners who have the resources and training to work with these agencies where there is a need for inquests or where coronial jurisdiction is triggered.  Given the urgency of the need to carry out these excavations, exhumations and investigations, rather than using the existing coronial system which, as I said at the outset, has significant problems that need to be solved, which will take time, we believe specific coroners who have the right training and resources to work with the agencies set up for the individual sites should be identified.</p></speech>

Earlier this morning, Ms Susan Lohan spoke about the reparation element.  I will mention the specific example she used; she said that the State should pursue the Bon Secours hospital group and organisation for reparations.  Can the witnesses point us to international precedents, or other precedents, of this being achieved successfully?</p></speech>

The first is that human rights obligations adhere to the State.  We cannot say that the organisation necessarily has obligations under, for example, Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, whereas the State does.  It is up to the State to decide whether, in certain situations, it is appropriate to pursue such organisations for reparations.  It is worth looking into the question of international precedent but I do not have any facts or figures at hand to share with the Senator today.</p></speech>

We are discussing the inquest, coroners, accountability and all those things in great detail but we seem to fall down on talking about what survivors actually want.  We keep stating that is what we wish to focus on.  Transitional justice is something the survivors keep raising.  Transitional justice seems to fall at the first hurdle when we even discuss the Bill, in terms of an inquest, the question of "why" and the truth.  If we cannot have the truth, how can we really provide the transitional justice that many survivors keep referencing?  I ask Ms Ansboro to address how the Bill contravenes the idea of transitional justice and the obstacles that need to be removed in order for us actually to provide truth in this space.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for her question.  She makes a really good point.  As previous speakers highlighted, a transitional justice approach provides a response to widespread human rights violations.  It is particularly appropriate in the context of the human rights violations that occurred in mother and baby homes.  One of the key components of a transitional justice approach is that it puts survivors at the centre, which is important in this context.  It is based on the pillars of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence.  It provides a framework through which the State can fulfil its human rights obligations.  As the committee heard from previous speakers, these obligations relate to conducting an effective investigation and providing the right to a remedy.  Coming back to another point raised by previous speakers, the need to put survivors and families at the centre of this is key.  That should include a statutory basis for them to be consulted, their wishes taken into account and families kept updated.  That should be included at every stage of the process.  It is key to a transitional justice approach and the Bill can and should be updated to reflect that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.409" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Doireann Ansbro" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#TT00500"><p>Does the Senator wish for me to come in on the obstacles?  The Bill stipulates five or six requirements in order for an agency to be constituted.  Taken together, those requirements constitute an overly complicated threshold to even create an agency.  To be honest, when the Department is going back to draft the Bill, it needs to start from scratch and look at how one can create legislation that enables the fulfilment of the rights about which we have been speaking, such as truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence.</p> <p>  One of the key aspects of the Bill as it stands is this idea of a proportionality assessment.  Head 3 of the Bill references this idea that the rights of people who may want the agency to carry out excavations or exhumations need to be weighed against several factors.  The problem is that those factors include things that should not be there in the first place in terms of a human rights approach, such as economic considerations, for example.  There may be various rights that we need to balance and weigh.</p><p>Perhaps this human rights approach to balancing rights is the answer to the question about how we respect the wishes of survivors and their families who may have different wishes.  It is crucial to identify the primary right, which in this case is the right to truth and the right to effective investigations.  If one limits that right - if a decision is made not to carry out an excavation or exhumation - we need to ensure that can only happen if it is necessary, is proportionate to a legitimate aim and meets a pressing social need.  The human rights framework for that proportionality assessment, which is missing from this Bill, is crucial if we are going to be genuinely demonstrating a commitment to an approach based on human rights.</p></speech>

We have heard again today about a lack of transparency regarding access to documents.  We saw how public confidence was absolutely rocked when this came up in the recent past.  As mentioned in the statement, the proposed Bill provides for the sealing of documents and records for a period of 30 years.  Access to this information is of the utmost importance, as has been said, and has taken on particular significance in the context of justice for the survivors of mother and baby homes.</p> <p>  Is the act of sealing documents for 30 years unique to Ireland?  I ask because I have not heard of it happening in any other jurisdiction.  Are there international examples of documents being sealed?</p> <p>  The ICCL has recommended "that Ireland ratify the UN convention against enforced disappearances, as this provides a clear roadmap for dealing with enforced disappearances and is relevant for addressing mass graves and institutional burials".  The Stasi archives were mentioned at the previous meeting and at this meeting.  Are there other international examples of how this has worked and, if so, how did they get over barriers to truth, justice and transparency?</p></speech>

Any talk of sealing archives is such a contrast to how these matters are approached in the places we refer to as examples of best practice.  For example, the whole point of unsealing the Stasi archive was that people could see what information was gathered on them.  I am not an expert on it but I believe there are certain thresholds where different people can access different information.  It is done in a very transparent way and the whole emphasis is on providing access to information for people.  If we are talking about sealing documents from the get-go here, we are going very much against international best practice.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses agree that we could have an investigation without a body?  Do they think that the conversation has placed exhumation and removal as the central purpose of the Bill, when we might need more restorative justice instead of transitional justice?  It is very difficult to find the how, the when and all the circumstances of all the poor wee lives that were lost, but we can restore some justice and try to restore some faith.  I would like to know the opinion of the witnesses on that.</p></speech>

My understanding of restorative justice relates to a framework in which, for example, a victim can meet a perpetrator after a court case as an alternative to sentencing.  I do not think it is a term that we hear in international human rights law, for example.  We talk about transitional justice because it offers a framework to address all of these different issues, including memorialisation and reparation.  What is really crucial about the whole idea of transitional justice is that it has different pillars.</p><p>The different pillars are meant to be applied together in a complementary way.  Truth is very important.  The four pillars are truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence.  Truth is very important so we know how to deal with justice and appropriate reparations.  Without the truth and knowing what happened, it is impossible to know how to respond in terms of adequate reparations.  Then there are guarantees of non-recurrence.  How can we guarantee this is not going to happen again if we do not have information about how it happened in the first place?  We say they are interlocking pillars that must be approached together.  When one takes the survivor-centred, family-centred approach, it can shed light on which one to place more emphasis on.  That is why the survivor-centred, family-centred approach is so crucial.  It offers the opportunity to respond in a way that is appropriate for each family who has been affected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#VV00200"><p>I am here instead of Deputy Phelan.  I wish to raise a couple of matters.  First, in January every year there is a release of documentation from the National Archives.  That occurs across many governments and is not unique to Ireland.  As regards the idea of it being a surprise or unique to this situation, I am a little disappointed to see that lack of context given the fact that it is normal governmental practice in the UK, Ireland and in many other countries.  Although the period of time is proposed to be reduced from 30 to 20 years, and there are discussions about that, there is a practice of doing this.  At the same time, we have the GDPR, which has superseded any instrument or practice like that in that it entitles one to information.  There is also a commitment to proposed legislation, which is coming through shortly, that deals with information and tracing.  That must be acknowledged and borne in mind in this context.  In fairness to the Minister, not to acknowledge it is being disingenuous on the part of parties on the committee or otherwise.  We need to park that.</p> <p>  I am interested in developing and exploring the Stasi model and how that might be employed in looking at resolving the conflict.  In the next session there will be two submissions from two parties.  Both are from Cork and both are affected by Bessborough.  One wants exhumations and the other does not.  We have very tangible and obvious opposites.  We cannot deal with one site and address those individually.  That leaves us with the real problem of not being able to resolve those two.  Under the Stasi model, is there some way of allowing truth and memorialisation and also addressing individual needs or not?  How would that be deployed?  Behind all of this there is also the spectre of tribunals and the fact that in the pursuit of truth, that gets overshadowed by the cost of legal teams, so we lose sight of what we were originally setting out to do.  Perhaps Ms Ansbro will elaborate on how that Stasi model would be available to us and could perhaps be of use in resolving a conflict on how this should be dealt with.</p></speech>

The key point we are trying to make is that it is important that if there is a need to access information as part of this idea of effective investigation and it is sealed for 30 years, it impedes the effective investigation.  We are talking about specific information that should be available within-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.418" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#VV00400"><p>However, we now have legislation at EU level that prohibits somebody not having access to his or her personal data.  Legislation and times have overridden that.  That is currently being very much embraced by Government.</p></speech>

On the second question about the Stasi model, I am not an expert on that and would like to come back to the Senator with an answer if I can.  However, my general answer would be around the idea of a proportionality assessment again.  Obviously, when one has these issues, one is talking about the right to truth and one may also have the right to privacy.  That proportionality assessment must be applied if somebody is saying he or she has a right to privacy and do not want this information exposed and somebody else is saying he or she needs it because it is necessary for the fulfilment of their right to truth.  That is when the proportionality assessment must be brought in and whether it is necessary to share that information must be considered as well as whether it is proportionate to the aim of public interest or whatever interest may come into place.  Again, therefore, when one has these different interests, human rights law provides a model to try to come up with a solution which demonstrates best efforts to protect everyone's rights in the best way possible using this kind of proportionality assessment.  That is the best I can do on that one.</p></speech>

I do not like to go back over things if there is no need.  I have an observation.  Ms Ansbro made an excellent point about Tuam only being discovered in 2017.  That is why it is so important, if at all possible, that we ensure we get this right and cover all potential sites because who would have thought, in 2017, that such a discovery would be made?  We just do not know about so many of the sites and so many of the homes.  Some of them were not included in the mother and baby homes report but that is why it is really important we get this right.</p> <p>  In all of the sessions so far, what is coming through really strongly is the issue of the coroner.  That goes back to the point that was being made about accountability and that is why it is important we have that.  It is very interesting and the whole point of pre-legislative scrutiny is that we get to tease everything out and get to hear all the various views, be they those of survivors, which are so important, or from experts in the field.  One thing that is really interesting to me is the issue relating to the coroner, which is coming up consistently.  This information will be really helpful to us in the remainder of our deliberations and when we are compiling our report.  I sincerely thank the witnesses for their presentations, which were really interesting.  The discussions so far today have been really good and positive.</p></speech>

Despite everyone running over, we did get through that and we have about ten minutes left.  If there is anyone, be they witnesses or members, who I skipped or who has a question or supplementary observation, they should indicate now.  I call Senator McGreehan.</p></speech>

This is very troubling for them.  Ms Ansbro referred to "Taking reasonable steps to identify the deceased person and to determine the cause of death ...".  That is good in the context of what was being said about transitional justice.  I return to my point about restorative justice, however.  We must restore faith, restore the lives and address the heartache in order to help these poor people, these women and families, who have really been suffering.  We are not going to find all the answers.</p><p>How do we reconcile those two things?  I state that because we are not going to be able to find all the answers, no matter how hard we try.  There will be many cases where if remains are exhumed, they may not be suitable for the purposes of investigation or perhaps even for reinterment.  The grave of such a baby has then been desecrated and there is no proper interment.  How do we look after those little babies who do not have family members?  I ask that question in the interests of best practice, because there are 9,000 babies and not all of them will have family members who will know to put their hands up or even can do so.  </p></speech>

They absolutely can, and I want to be clear that we are not saying the only way to vindicate the right to truth is through exhumations.  We are stating that the way to vindicate the right to truth is through investigations, and they can take different approaches.  What I understand from what I have heard and read before is that some families who do not want exhumations still want excavations, meaning that they want the place where bodies are to be identified but not necessarily for the bodies themselves to be exhumed.  That is certainly an option.</p> <p>  Returning to the survivor, family-led approach, if there can be a decision which can respect the rights of everyone as much as possible, then that is the way forward.  It is important to remember, however, that there are different options when we are talking about vindicating the right to truth and even about identifying the cause of death, because potentially it may not be possible to identify the cause of death by identifying the remains of one body.  Regarding an investigation into the general circumstances at the time, it could even be a case of compelling witnesses who still have knowledge of what happened at that time and looking into records and accessing records we know exist but that we have not been able to access.  </p> <p>  All those aspects are pieces of the puzzle in respect of solving the question of how these babies died and why their bodies were buried in this manner.  If we can identify where the bodies are, that will certainly be one stage of this process.  Memorialisation is crucial.  No matter what the different stages are before, the idea of restoring faith and dignity is crucial and it is a fundamental part of what all of us here should be doing.  Certainly, what should be in the proposed Bill is the idea of restoring the dignity of those to whom it was lost not only in life but in death.  That should be a fundamental and primary purpose of what we are doing here.  </p></speech>

It concerns sites around the country currently managed perhaps by religious orders that had ties to institutions and homes.  There may be burial sites on their premises and grounds.  As part of the human rights remit and powers of the proposed agency in respect of this process, perhaps we should ensure that the agency or local government has power in respect of addressing planning applications submitted for a site associated with a former home or where there is a mandatory obligation to carry out a geophysical survey or something along those lines.</p> <p>  It was well articulated this morning that there is a deficit of information in some instances in this regard.  As information comes forward, however, we should ensure that a mechanism or system is in place, in the context of future actions or choices of the agency, that will be able to gather the requisite information as the site is to be interfered with in the future.  That is something we must consider.  I just wanted to raise that issue.  I think it is a valid point and it was forwarded to me by someone with whom I am in regular contact.  </p></speech>

Witnesses appearing virtually before the committee from a location outside of the Leinster House precinct are as follows: Mr. David Dodd, BL, representing the Cork Survivors &amp;amp; Supporters Alliance, who is joined by Mr. Stephen Kirwan, solicitor at KOD Lyons.  They are all very welcome to our meeting on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme.  Before we commence this session, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the witnesses for taking the time to prepare their opening statements and to thank those of them who provided written submissions.</p> <p>  I also wish to take the opportunity to set out the purpose of today's meeting and how proceedings will be conducted in order to avoid any confusion during the meeting.  While acknowledging the harrowing experiences of survivors during their time in mother and baby homes and county homes, the purpose of our meeting today is to consider the policy provisions of the proposed legislation.  A discussion will take place on the provisions of the general scheme as they relate to the statutory basis and framework under which the Government may decide to authorise interventions at certain sites where manifestly inappropriate burials have taken place associated with institutions operated by or on behalf of the State, or in respect of which the State had clear regulatory or supervisory responsibilities.  There are also provisions for the establishment of an agency to carry out such interventions.  I remind members and witnesses that they are expected to adhere strictly to the subject matter scheduled for discussion today.  I also advise witnesses that the opening statements they read into the record should be the statements they provided in advance of this meeting.</p><p>Any deviation on these matters will be addressed through the Chair.<br/><br/>We are all very much aware of the restrictions Covid-19 has brought to all our lives.  It has also severely impacted the scheduling of public committee meetings.  However, members of the committee felt it important to hear from some of those who may be impacted by or have a professional view on the provisions of the general scheme.  It is the responsibility of parliamentary committees to consider and discuss topics in a balanced and fair manner.  In achieving this goal it is the committee, and only the committee, which determines the witnesses it engages with and it will do so in an unhindered manner.  This level of engagement will greatly assist the members of the committee in finalising our scrutiny report on the general scheme.  For this reason, and while strictly adhering to Covid-19 safety requirements, four public meetings of the committee have been scheduled over the course of today.  It is also expected that further public meetings will be scheduled in the near future to consider this matter further.<br/><br/>The committee wishes to have a productive public engagement.  However, I must remind witnesses that they should not mention names of individuals and organisations, even if that information is already in the public domain nor should they make charges against anyone by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable.  These are normal parliamentary procedures and exist to ensure that engagements are conducted in a constructive way.<br/><br/>Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I will read out the standard text regarding the provisions of the Defamation Act to remind them of their rights and obligations.<br/><br/>I want to take a minute to brief the witnesses on the work of the committee since the publication of the Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and the pre-legislative scrutiny by the committee to date on the general scheme under scrutiny here today.  While the committee has been limited in the number of public meetings held due to Covid-19 restrictions, it has afforded priority in its consideration of the following: the scrutiny of this proposed Bill; the issues that have arisen following the publication of the Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes; and the desire of members of the committee to ensure justice for the survivors of mother and baby homes.  These matters have been discussed at eight of the nine meetings of the joint committee held this year.  The committee has corresponded with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on five occasions in relation to various matters and has met with the Minister and his officials to discuss these issues wherever possible.  The committee has prioritised these issues above the other competing demands of its vast work programme, insofar as it reasonably can.  It stands ready to help to facilitate delivery of the recommendations and actions contained in the report into mother and baby homes however possible, and to undertake robust scrutiny of any and all related legislation referred, such as the general scheme under discussion here today.  A public call for submissions on the general scheme opened on 22 January with a deadline of 19 February.  This was later extended to 26 February.  Every effort was made to ensure maximum reach and accessibility during this process.  In total, the committee received 426 submissions.  The committee has also had substantial standalone correspondence from the public on these issues and appreciates the engagement and effort the public have made to date on what are difficult issues.<br/><br/>I wish to highlight some of the support services available to anyone affected by the matters under discussion today.  The HSE has a dedicated counselling service for former residents of mother and baby homes.  For more information on this people can call 1800 817 517 or visit the HSE webpage.  The Samaritans are available by telephone at 116123 and further supports can be found at <i>yourmentalhealth.ie</i>.<br/><br/>I am obliged to give the following advice on parliamentary privilege.  For the witnesses present in the D&aacute;il Chamber the following will apply: witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means witnesses have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.</p><p>Witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Acting Chair to ensure it is not abused.  If a witness's statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative any such direction is complied with.  For witnesses appearing virtually, I need to point out that there is uncertainty if parliamentary privilege will apply to evidence given from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if a witness is directed by me to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, it is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction.</p><p> I call on the witnesses in the following order: Mr. Higgins, Mr. Parfrey and Mr. Dodd.</p></speech>

It is difficult, with some metal in my right side, to sit for a long period.  I ask one thing of the Acting Chairman.  He has delivered a quite proper warning to us in respect of conduct and what one says in the House.  He has delivered it directly to individual members of this committee and to us as witnesses before the committee.  As he sits in the Chair with all the powers of same, he represents the committee.  I would like the following, whether by a ruling from the Acting Chairman, which I would unquestionably respect, or otherwise.  Will the Acting Chair tell me as a civilian appearing before the committee whether the committee, given that this issue has been raised in submissions with plenty of time to consider, has satisfied itself in a proper and appropriate manner and taken great care to ensure its capacity and powers to examine this Bill are <i>intra vires</i>?  Would he be kind enough to make a ruling on that?  I will accept it without question.</p></speech>

That is the number of attendees at the Wannsee Conference of 20 January 1942.  In drawing attention to this unfortunate coincidence, I must acknowledge that the members here are undoubtedly horrified by much of what they have been asked to consider and are personally greatly affected by it.  The coincidences, however, do not end there, in that both gatherings have a common purpose, namely, to produce a "final solution" to a pressing problem.  The Wannsee meeting was to find a solution to the overflowing concentration camps of eastern Europe.  Anyone with a flimsy knowledge of the 20th century knows how that ended.</p> <p>  This committee has a different problem.  It is asked to find a "final solution" to the rather untidy problem of mass graves of children, victims of a wretched bargain between church and State from 1923.  It is almost a singularly Irish problem.  Everybody knows where the bodies are buried, so what are we to do with them?  How does the State deal with its own egregious failings?  The answer seems to be that it must ignore the existing law and introduce a new law, removing the only mechanism that provides for a finding in law as to cause of death, namely, an inquest.  The result is that there will be no finding of blame or responsibility in law for their deaths.  The rationale seems to be that, as these children clearly had no rights while alive, why embarrass ourselves by giving them any rights in death?  This is indeed an unwholesome Irish solution to an Irish problem.  There is no doubt this committee will be peppered with the proposition that mass graves such as Tuam present almost insurmountable difficulties in extracting and identifying the victims and determining the causes of death.</p><p>As in all such grotesque events, truth is the first casualty.  Compared with grim events over the past 80 years such as Katyn, Srebrenica, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and so on, the mass grave at Tuam, in terms of recovery, identification and determination of causes of death, is a relatively simple task and we are happy to meet any assertion to the contrary with hard evidence.</p><p> If this Bill was genuinely conceived as a measure to bring dignity to these children and a measure of closure to their families, it would probably have been adopted on all sides and the need for pre-legislative scrutiny would not exist.  To the members of this committee I say that if they permit this measure to progress, they do so with their fingerprints all over it and I believe they will come to regret it.  This Bill should be returned to whence it came.  Nothing of worth, humanity or integrity can be retrieved from it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.441" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Parfrey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#CCC00200"><p>On behalf of Know My Own, I thank the Oireachtas for giving us this opportunity today.  The main issues of concern for us are: the investigation of grounds for burial sites; the issues around DNA; the role of the coroner, which seems to have been excluded from the Bill; and that the Bill should come under the remit of a person with the status of an ombudsman, independent of the Oireachtas and the Civil Service.</p> <p>  We are particularly concerned about Bessborough.  A company has two planning applications in for large residential developments on the grounds of Bessborough, where we believe there are possibly a lot of unexplained burials.  More than 900 babies died at the Bessborough home but the burial sites of only 64 babies are known.  Where the rest are is anybody's guess.  The order kept no records and so they were unable to explain where any of these burials took place.  We have heard stories, anecdotally, of babies being passed out through windows to workers for burial.  They could be anywhere on that site.</p> <p>  In its final report the commission did concede it was highly likely that burials did take place in the grounds but that the only way this could be established would be through an excavation of the entire property, and this would be too costly.  These are human remains, some of whom have close relatives who have been searching for them fruitlessly for decades.  I honestly do not believe one can put a price on that.  I was glad to hear Professor Scraton saying something similar at the earlier session today.  Costs should not be a factor.</p> <p>  Apart from anything, geophysical examination of the grounds may suffice.  There may not be a need for excavation.  A few years ago in Cork Prison, geophysical X-ray equipment was used to locate the remains of Thomas Kent who died more than 100 years ago.  This was achieved in a couple of days.  I do not see why this would not be possible in Bessborough and all the other homes.  I specifically refer to Bessborough because of the urgency of the situation as there are planning applications in the system.</p> <p>  With regard to head 65 of the Bill, which refers to the ten-year holding period for DNA profiles for any remaining unidentified bodies, we believe this is far too short a timeframe.  We recommend this be increased to a minimum of 50 years.  It only allows for DNA from parents, children, siblings or half siblings.  Again, we do not see how this can be explained.  Why could DNA samples not be taken from grandparents, cousins, aunts, or uncles?</p><p>Any method that might help to identify remains should be kept under consideration.  The door should not be closed to any of these methods.</p><p> We also feel that DNA sampling could start immediately.  It does not have to wait until the Bill comes in.  Some of the people we are talking about are quite elderly and as they may not have a whole lot of time left, we do not see any reason for this to be delayed or why it cannot start right away.  If these people want to make their DNA available; it should be taken while the time is still there.</p><p> On Bessborough, there are some heartbreaking stories.  I have a friend who had a baby in Bessborough and her baby died in St. Finbarr's Hospital.  She travelled over from England on numerous occasions asking for the burial site of her son.  A nun tapped around with her foot to indicate where it was.  It turned out afterwards, when the report came out from the commission, that her baby had been buried in the Famine graveyard on Carr's Hill.  That is not right.</p></speech>

There will be an opportunity for him to come back in once members start engaging with us on the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.444" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Dodd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#DDD00300"><p>I thank members for taking the time to hear from survivors and their representatives.  The Cork Survivors and Supporters Alliance, CSSA, represents a group of survivors of Bessborough Mother and Baby Home, including former residents and family members of women and children who resided within the institution.  The CSSA&rsquo;s membership includes family members of children who died while resident at Bessborough, and whose burial location is not recorded, and their supporters.  Many of these children were buried within the grounds of Bessborough in unmarked graves.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the CSSA does not seek for the remains of the children buried at Bessborough to be excavated, exhumed or otherwise removed from the site.  While the exhumation of remains in other sites, such as Tuam, may be an appropriate response, it is not appropriate at Bessborough.  Rather, the CSSA seeks for the remains of children buried on the grounds to be preserved in place.  Exhuming and moving the deceased children off the site is, in a way, just a direct means of dispersing the children who died there.  It is the opposite of memorialisation and it is not the appropriate way to mark their lives and deaths at the place where the events took place.<br/><br/>Placing exhumation and removal as a central purpose of the Bill runs the risk of the Bill being well intentioned but achieving precisely the wrong thing.  In one way, it could be said that it is just a convenient way of making the children disappear from sight again, and it is precisely the wrong response to what happened.  The CSSA seeks that the site be appropriately cared for and memorialised.  There should be an appropriate fencing of the burial ground to prevent animals accessing the site or people inadvertently and unknowingly walking on graves, and appropriate marking and commemoration, or both, of the children&rsquo;s burial places.<br/><br/>These are the standards that are currently applicable to burial grounds in accordance with the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878, as amended, and the Rules and Regulations for the Regulation of Burial Grounds 1888.  A core issue is that these standards were not respected or applied in Bessborough House, despite applying to the burial ground there, and that remains the position.  Given the failure to apply the burial rules, which are a statutory instrument to date, the rules should be elevated to the level of an Act.<br/><br/>There should be no difference of treatment between the burial grounds of the children at Bessborough, and mother and baby homes generally, and other children's burial grounds.  The CSSA seeks the maintenance, preservation and memorialisation of the children&rsquo;s burial ground on the site of the former Bessborough mother and baby institution and in the absence of legislative intervention, the issue remains unsettled.  In addition, there is a right of reasonable access for the survivors and family members of children buried on the grounds of Bessborough, which should also be recognised in the Act.  What underpins this is a universal human need and legal right.  It is something we all share and is best expressed in the following judgment from the European Court of Human Rights:</p> <blockquote> 	The right of every person to be buried in a dignified manner in accordance with the traditions and customs of his family hardly requires special justification or even to be secured in written form in law.  This right is clearly self-evident and stems from human nature as, perhaps, no other natural right.  Equally natural and uncontested is the right of every person to conduct the burial of a person who is related and dear to them, to have an opportunity to perform one's moral duty and display one's human qualities, to bid farewell, to grieve, mourn and commemorate the deceased, however he may be regarded by society and the state, to have the right to a grave, which in all civilisations represents a sacred value and the symbol of memory. </blockquote><p>That is from the European Court of Human Rights case, Arkhestov and others <i>v</i>. Russia.<br/><br/>We have provided some of the details of the burials at Bessborough but I am conscious of the five-minute speaking slot so I will move on.  The commission of investigation findings are well familiar to the committee so I will deal with its final report.  The commission appears to suggest the children's burial place at Bessborough cannot be identified in the absence of the excavation of the entire property.  The CSSA strongly disagrees in circumstances where contemporaneous and reliable Ordnance Survey of Ireland, OSI, mapping evidence clearly indicates the location of the children's burial ground.  That map has been appended to the submission.<br/><br/>The OSI has confirmed that the location of the burial ground is recorded on a revision map, the recording is reliable and accurate and the location would have to have been approved by the then occupiers, the Sisters of the Sacred Heart, and what is termed the name book and form 1.6 should also have been completed before any entry on a map could be made.  The children and relatives are buried at this location unless the mapper who attended the site in 1950 wrongly recorded the site of the children's graveyard or the Sisters of the Sacred Heart wrongly signed off on the location, which is improbable to say the least and not a view supported by the OSI, the State's expert mapping service.<br/><br/>It is noteworthy that the interim report of the commission failed to identify the original trace drawing and demonstrated significant confusion about the mapping evidence and what it meant and showed, all of which was omitted from the final report, following receipt of the CSSA submission.  The CSSA does not seek for the children's burial ground to be excavated or the children's remains to be exhumed or interred elsewhere; the children's remains should rather be preserved in place with appropriate marking and memorialisation, with a right of access for relatives wishing to access the graves.<br/><br/>In the view of Bessborough, the CSSA view excavation as desecrating the last burial place of the children, a place they have rested together for 40, 50 and 60 years.  There is a section on the legal background to burial rights but I will move on because I am conscious of the five-minute stipulation on speaking slots.  The fact that a duty to provide a &quot;decent&quot; or &quot;dignified&quot; burial was not respected in the past is no reason to disrespect the deceased children now.  Removing the children from their burial ground so the land can be developed by building apartment blocks-----</p></speech>

This session specifically includes survivor groups and I thank them for being here and for their considerable advocacy on behalf of themselves and others, their families and all survivors.  All of us as public representatives engage in this process from a position of being heartbroken, appalled and moved by what we hear.  We are in constant contact with survivor groups.</p> <p>  I consider the pre-legislative scrutiny process as one of the honours of being a member of a committee.  In this and other committees we come together as equals across all parties in the Houses and despite our political differences, we work as best we can to produce a report that represents the best recommendations we can for a Minister.  I very much value this process.</p> <p>  Senator Aisling Dolan is on the call but unable to speak, although she is in Leinster House, as I am.  I know she has had considerable engagement with Mr. Mulryan.</p><p>I am just acknowledging that.  As time is short, I want to give my time over to Mr. Dodd.  We are talking about institutional burials but, come the end of next week, we may not have a burial ground in Bessborough on which to take action if something is not done and some intervention is not taken very dramatically and urgently there.  I will hand over to Mr. Dodd to address that very crucial issue of the children's burial site in Bessborough and its imminent demise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.451" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Dodd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#FFF00200"><p>I thank the Senator and appreciate the question.  That highlights one of the major differences with Bessborough compared to other sites.  I want to explain this to the committee because it is important.  What may be right for one site like Tuam is different from what may be right for another site like Bessborough.  The immediate problem faced by survivors of Bessborough is that, next week, there is an expedited hearing before An Bord Plean&aacute;la, where the owner of the lands, the developer, as he is fully entitled to do, will apply to put apartment blocks on Bessborough.  Two of those apartment blocks will be placed exactly where the OSI, which is the State&rsquo;s expert mapping body, has identified the children's burial ground.</p> <p>  That identification is based on an original map from 1949.  On 3, 4, 6 and 7 October 1949, a senior mapper from the OSI attended Bessborough and he drew a very detailed specialist map in accordance with the mapping rules.  In accordance with the rules, a senior adviser then went out.  His name was Mr. B. J. O&rsquo;Rourke and he was there on 26 and 27 January 1950.  The data from the commission and the evidence is that many of the children's deaths happened before 1959 and there was a significant level of deaths in the decade before that - a very significant proportion of the 900.  He is there on-site and he draws in &ldquo;Children's Burial Ground&rdquo;.  He uses various notations which are important for mappers.  He uses up and down script and he capitalises it, so it is Children with a capital C, Burial with a capital B and Ground with a capital G.  He is very definitely indicating the location of the children's burial ground.</p> <p>  Next week, there is a planning application which is going to put an apartment block on the children's burial ground.  Whether anyone's personal view is memorialisation or exhumation, if there is an apartment block there, neither is going to happen, so that is an immediate pressing concern, perhaps not for this committee but for our members.  That is the context we are coming from.</p> <p>  I want to read out quotes from the ladies I met two nights ago, when we held a meeting with the members to get their views.  What they want is really understandable and not complicated, so I will use their words.  One said: &ldquo;We want somewhere to go to remember our children and siblings, to go up, sit on a bench, lay a flower, have a moment.&rdquo;   Another lady said: &ldquo;Bring flowers, say a prayer, talk to them, talk, sit down.  This is the way it should be in Cork.&rdquo;  That is what they said to me two nights ago.  These are very deep and understandable human feelings about the children they have given birth to and who died.  They do not know where to go to commemorate their loss or the loss of siblings.  These are very simple wishes which should be respected.</p> <p>  There is a huge amount of engagement that was done so that survivors are listened to.  It is very hard to look a survivor in the face and say they are being listened to when there is going to be an apartment block built on the children's burial ground, and the OSI, which is the completely independent State mapper, staffed by former members of the Defence Forces, all of whom are expert members, is saying to the survivors that this is where the children's burial ground is.</p></speech>

We have heard heartbreaking stories.  I am very vocal about the need to have survivors lead us in our legislation.  I work in Carlow with survivors and it is very important that we support and work with our survivors and listen to them.</p> <p>  I have one question on DNA.  As to the collection of the DNA sampling, have any of the groups' members started the process of collecting DNA as is covered under the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014?  A DNA database was established in Ireland.  It is used as an intelligence source for criminal investigation but also to help find missing people and identify unknown people.  Have any of the groups' members been in touch with Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, with regard to volunteering their DNA?  I also note that just last month, FSI was hiring forensic scientists, grade 3, in the areas of DNA and criminal physical analysis who will examine casework samples recovered from crime scenes to prepare reports of findings.  This is something that I can bring up with the Minister with regard to resources.  I listened to Mr. Parfrey as he spoke about this and it is important that the time be extended and that funding be acquired in this regard.  Funding should not be an issue.  We need to ensure there is funding available for families or volunteers who wish to undertake DNA testing.</p> <p>  While I feel honoured to be able to work with survivors, we need to do more.  Do we need to look at a long-term liaison officer position to give support and help to our survivors?  This has to be survivor-led and we cannot make mistakes on this issue again and have to get it right.  I thank our survivors and witnesses again today and the Acting Chairman also.</p></speech>

My question is for Mr. Parfrey.  He highlighted that the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters report states it is not known where the vast majority of children who died in Bessborough are.  We know that 859 of these children are unaccounted for.  Would Mr. Parfrey be in favour of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage issuing a compulsory purchase order to ensure that no developments hamper any of the potential aspects of this Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.464" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Parfrey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#GGG01000"><p>We are very strongly of the view that no development should be allowed on any of these sites until the grounds have been investigated.  The number of missing babies in Bessborough is horrendous.  Our feeling is that excavation has to take place before there is any development.  After all, the people of whom I spoke a while ago have spent decades searching for information need and they deserve closure.  If development is allowed to go ahead without the grounds being investigated, any hope of closure is gone forever.  Furthermore, the State should look at taking over the grounds of these mother and baby homes and of the various institutions and keeping them open as memorial gardens.</p><p>As I said, cost should not be a factor no matter what happens.  We cannot put a price on any of this.</p><p> By the way, we are talking about babies and infants.  Of the 31 mothers who died in Bessborough, the commission found General Register Office, GRO, records for 29 but it only found burial records for 12 in St. Joseph's Cemetery in Cork.  Where are the other 19 women?  There could be adults buried indiscriminately around Bessborough as well.  As Mr. Dodd said, this is very urgent because that planning decision will come shortly.  Everything possible should be done to block any development until the grounds have been examined or, better again, taken over by the State.</p></speech>

If any planning permissions are granted on that site, we should encourage the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to issue a compulsory purchase order to prevent development.  I also agree with Mr. Parfrey that the State should look into doing that with all sites associated with mass infant and children's graves.</p> <p>  If I have remaining time, I would like to offer it to Mr. Parfrey in case there is something he wishes to add to his statement but did not have time to earlier.</p></speech>

In the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, there was a testimony from one lady whose son died in Bessborough.  She wanted to be at this funeral but the home refused and would not allow it.  She said she was probably only 100 yards away from where his body was buried.  The home would not tell her where the body was.  She does not know if he was buried in a coffin or if he was just in a robe.  She does not know if any prayers were said over him.  Some of the behaviour was absolutely horrendous.  As I said, the people whose children are still missing need closure.  It is vital that they get it.  The State should consider taking over all those grounds.</p></speech>

The pressing problem for the survivors in Bessborough, certainly those I represent, is the idea that the apartment block will go on top of the children's burial ground.  Any commission that gets seven or eight of ten things right has done well.  If a commission gets nine out of ten things right, it has done exceptionally well.  Commissions do not get everything right.  When it comes to the location of the children's burial ground, we believe the commission did not get it right.  We have a good and rational reason for that, namely, that Ordnance Survey Ireland holds a map, which is available for inspection, that identifies that Mr. O'Rourke was out there in 1949.  He wrote down "Children's Burial Ground" in very deliberate writing and that went on to the printed maps, which are around in libraries.  To get that wording on to the printed map, the nuns had to sign off on the location.</p><p> We invited the commission to ask OSI to inspect the map but, unfortunately, in the time allowed, it did not do so.  From our perspective, there are 900 children missing and there is a document from 1949 by an expert at the State's mapping agency pointing to the location of the children's burial ground.  That is really compelling evidence unless one is saying that he got it wrong, which he did not.  Everything else on the map is absolutely perfect.  For us, therefore, the location is known.</p><p> On the question of compulsory purchase, we are in favour of the developer developing the lands.  Houses are good for people.  However, building should not take place where the children's burial ground is located.  There are ways and means by which both things can be accommodated.  We are not against development necessarily.  One can memorialise the burial ground in an appropriate and respectful way.  It is not brain science.  One ring-fences it so that animals do not get on it, one puts up an appropriate memorial and one allows the relatives reasonable visitation rights.  That is what we all get for our deceased and it is what the ladies of Bessborough want for their deceased, nothing more and nothing less.  I hope that answers the questions from Senator Fitzpatrick and Deputy Cairns.</p></speech>

Mr. Dodd referred to the very modest desire of the women to be able to visit and spend time at the burial site.  That is something nobody should even have to countenance being refused or denied.  It is very important that this request be fulfilled.</p> <p>  The work on this issue will continue for many years after we have finished ours.  As we look to move forward in completing that work, it is important to hear from Mr. Dodd and Mr. Parfrey what they would suggest is the best way to conduct communications on an ongoing basis with the women and survivors.  Clearly, very poor communications and a lack of communication have been a real characteristic of what has gone on in the past.</p></speech>

There has been a terrible lack of communication between the authorities and the survivor groups.  There has been a deliberate lack of information from certain quarters.  Survivor groups should be consulted on any issues relating to adoption, burials and mother and baby homes.  Without a doubt, they should be included.</p></speech>

Many of the survivors are vulnerable and have their own issues around communication.  Therefore, we have representatives like me, from the Bar, and others, including academics, representing them.  It cannot be that their voices get lost.  We have to keep coming back to listening to what they have to say.  We have to realise that they do not all believe or want the same things and there are complexities there we must acknowledge.  We have to do our best to create a space for them to have their voices heard, just like what has happened today, which is very much to the credit of the committee.  The chain reaction of the committee's hosting this meeting today is that we were able to assemble that group.  We spent two hours with them on a Zoom call, listening to all of the views and allowing people space to speak.  Although it comes to fruition here today, there is a whole iceberg below in terms of allowing people to get their views across.  When one speaks for others, one only ever does it inadequately.  We do our best to speak for the survivors, acknowledging that there are different viewpoints and that each is valid.</p></speech>

If there is any time left, I will come back in.  He mentioned the DNA matching process and the restrictive eligibility criteria under the Bill.

DNA is easily taken.  I am sure that most people would have no difficulty in agreeing to give DNA samples.  We believe that it should be open to a wider group of people rather than just the parents, children and siblings.  As I said earlier, we also feel that the data should be kept for 50 years rather than ten.  With modern technology, there is no reason that cannot be done.</p></speech>

I turn to the witnesses from the Tuam Home Survivors Network.  There is a line in the statement about giving dignity and respect and how we achieve that.  This Bill does not do that.

I am not entirely sure where the Senator gets that statement from but I understand what she is asking.  The word "dignity" has become overused throughout this process.  I have been involved in this for the past seven years.  Whereas the commission has acted independently, I do not know of a single, solitary substantial thing done by agency of the State and certainly not by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth which has made any difference whatsoever.  Dignity and justice are inseparable.  If one cannot give these children a bona fide death certificate, this legislation, which may decide, essentially asks us in many ways if we would like roses around the mass grave or if we would like bluebells.</p><p>We do not want either.  The death certificates of these children are a fantasy.  There is not a single medical certificate existing for one of those children in Tuam.  One cannot get a death certificate without a medical certificate.  This is not new law; it pertained then.  According to the death certificates, 25% of these children died from something as nebulous as debility.  We are all familiar with deaths through premature births of children.  The medical attendants certified that a child of three-and-a half who had never shown any symptoms or illness had actually died from prematurity.</p><p> Dignity without justice, justice without dignity.  We need these children to be treated with respect.  This Bill is a little like the commission of investigation Act.  People say it is not fit for purpose.  It is clearly not fit for anything.  How many of them have run into the ground?  I hope that answers the Senator's question.</p></speech>

I was not aware, until this meeting, that the burial sites of some 19 women in Bessborough are also unknown.  We cannot allow any immediate development on that site as it is.</p><p>I am relatively new Deputy and if there was ever a need for pre-legislative scrutiny, this meeting has shown it.  We have seen diverse opinions and heard heartbreaking life stories of survivors.  We heard that the Bill is not worthy and that children need to be exhumed, identified and given a proper burial.  We have also heard that children should remain <i>in situ</i>and that a permanent memorial be erected.  I can see the rationale for all the opinions.  I thank all the witnesses for their honest contributions to the meeting.  It is important that no voice is lost.</p><p>I have a generic question and I am going to put a bit of pressure on the Acting Chair.  I ask the Acting Chair to share the remainder of my time between the three witnesses.  We have all heard each other today but I ask them how we can best ensure, as we go forward in this process, that nobody's voice is lost?</p></speech>

We will have an hour to get through the rest of the speakers.  We will stick to five-minute slots until we get through the first run of speakers.  We will then have sufficient time to have a good, wide-ranging discussion.  Does Deputy Ward wish his question to be directed to the four witnesses or the three witnesses here?</p></speech>

Regarding Bessborough, Mr. Dodd mentioned the map showing the burial area.  I am concerned that the whole of Bessborough could be a burial site.</p><p>The burial sites of the remains of more than 850 babies are unidentified.  They could be anywhere on the grounds of Bessborough.  I would not be specifically concerned with the area on the map.  I do not know where the map came up with the idea that this was a burial area.</p></speech>

My answer might be at odds with my sitting here.  I would say we can do so by following the law.  I think the existing law is quite adequate.  In the case of Tuam, with which I am most familiar and which is perhaps the most documented, it is possible to excavate.  I know from the osteoarchaeology I have seen that in many cases, it is possible to carry out post mortems and to reach a determination on the possible or probable cause of death.  Not leaving us behind collectively, this is not a matter simply for survivors.  The Bill which created mother and baby homes was something as innocuous sounding as the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923.  That legislation was finally repealed in 2000, 21 years ago.</p></speech>

I think we need to follow the law.  I believe we need to resource the coroners' service and allow people still living to give evidence to the coroners' service about what transpired within those homes in order to allow a coroner to make a determination.</p></speech>

I am now three years looking for records of my sister.  Every time I go to bed at night, I think of her.  Why am I left this way?  Is she dead or alive?  I do not know.  The information I got is so scant.  It is unbelievable that they would do this to a human being who was recorded as having been born a healthy baby, but who died nine months later.  What did she die from?  Was it from malnutrition or neglect?  Was she drowned?  We do not know.  I want to know where my sibling is now.  I am being denied all this information.  Having done that to an innocent baby, now they are trying to stop us finding out anything about where she is.  We are denied and denied again.  It is so inhumane to think of what the present State and Government is doing to us.  It beggars belief.  I am so, so disheartened that they are still trying to make those babies suffer.  There are souls out there searching.  For a life to be brought into the world and then incarcerated - and then there is what was done to my mother - is horrendous.  That is it.</p></speech>

I direct my question to Mr. Dodd.  His contribution illustrates well, and provides evidence about, the children's burial plot.  We must work to prevent any development on that site and preserve and protect it at all costs.  I note Deputy Cairns, and another submission also, looked to that CPO method.  Perhaps that is something we can do, but I am not sure the remit of this proposed Bill is the place for it.  It is, however, somewhere we need to go.  There must be an input from the county councils as well regarding these institutions.</p> <p>  Returning to Mr. Dodd, how can we improve the process in situations where the ability to excavate and, therefore, explain what happened at sites is not permitted?  How can we improve the process for survivors and mothers to ensure that investigations are carried out to the greatest extent possible within the remit of this agency?  Explanation is one element of this process, and then investigation and memorialisation are other major aspects.  How can that best be done?  Having spoken to the mothers, I do not believe they are fit for a long-drawn out process of some 15 years.  They do not have that time.  How does Mr. Dodd think this process can be best undertaken to serve these mothers? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.505" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Dodd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#NNN00200"><p>My view is not of any relevance, but the views of the ladies whom I have been dealing with are based on what they were denied.  What we are trying to do is to fix the wrongs of the past, and everybody is trying to do that and to grapple with what is the right thing to do in that regard.  We know what should have happened in the past because human rights case law tells us what we know already in our heart of hearts.  People are entitled to be buried in a dignified manner.  Their families are entitled to bid farewell, to grieve, to mourn and to commemorate the deceased.  The problem is that these families did not get such opportunities.  Once we have identified the problem, we can then consider what the solution might be.</p> <p>  What I hear from the survivors whom I have been dealing with is that they now want to be able to fulfil that human need to go back to a place, have it dedicated, sit on a bench, lay flowers and talk to their sibling.  Mr. Mulryan certainly echoed many of the things I heard in the last year when listening to the survivors of Bessborough.  What is not listening to them is sending down diggers and excavating the land.  I state that because it is important to realise that the real game in town here is excavation and removal.  The owner of the lands wants to remove the remains of the children from those lands and make it someone else's problem, be that the State, the coroner or the relatives.  An apartment block is an understandable commercial objective, but from our perspective this is not right. </p> <p>  Therefore, the way to respect this situation from our perspective is to fulfil the rights identified in the case law.  I refer to the right to go to the location, to spend time there, to have the place dedicated and to fulfil what really should have been done in the past.  From our perspective, that is what should happen.  The narrative is very important because there is this idea that it is not known where the burial site is.  From our perspective again, however, the public body, namely, the OSI, is telling us that it has the record of the senior adviser going out to the location in 1949 on a specific day.  He was there for three days.  He records one of those days as being wet, and that demonstrates the level of detail that man went into.  He noted where the burial ground was, so we know there is a burial ground, we know there are 900 children and we know there is a man out there with the relevant expertise.  That is the best evidence for us.  We cannot, therefore, understand this idea that the site is not known.  We really cannot understand it.</p> <p>  The difficulty with saying the site is not known is that it will then be possible for the owner to proceed to develop the lands.  That is really the problem with going down that route.  From our perspective then, if one looks at the evidence it is clear where the location of the burial site is.  It does not mean babies were not buried elsewhere, but we know where the main children's burial ground was because there was a man out there who identified and drew the site and then he got the nuns to sign off on it.  When we provided this information to the commission, and admittedly we provided it very late, just some weeks before the report, we could not understand why the commission did not communicate with the OSI, which is a completely independent agency which has nothing to do with the Bessborough ladies or Bessborough at all.</p><p>From our perspective, the narrative that it is not known is dangerous because it allows avoidance of dealing with the problem.  Once one knows where the burial ground is, then it is quite clear what should happen.  The only way to stop that is to say we do not know where it is.  That is really our perspective on things.</p></speech>

I have listened to those experiences.  I know the Tuam area in particular as I come from Galway.  I previously met Peter Mulryan.  I would like to offer him some of the time allocated to me if he would like to contribute again.  He has spoken very deeply about his mother and his sister and even the impact on his own family.  It is very stark.  There has been a particularly heavy loss of life in the Tuam mother and baby home, especially in the 1930s and 1940s.  It was shocking.  We saw that from the report that was issued.  I would like to offer Mr. Mulryan the time if he would like to give any other information or provide feedback, for example, if there is anything he wants to say on the DNA process as well.</p></speech>

I have not been asked to give a DNA sample.  I do not know why that is.  I am available to do it.  I did it privately and I got a lot of information from it myself, but it would be so important to get it done again to find out if she is there or if she was sold off and is in America.  I just do not know.  She could be alive.  I went to America two years ago.  I was in New York and a few places giving talks in universities and Irish centres.  There was a great response.  The hope is that if she is out there, she will put her head up somewhere and look for me.  That is what I hope will happen rather than her being down in that sump of a septic tank decaying away in such a situation, not even put into a coffin, with just a bit of cloth left on a shelf under the darkness of night.  Somebody knows, but there are no records whatsoever.  It is scary stuff.  One would make some allowance for it in a time of war but there was no war in this country that meant people had to do that with such innocent babies.  We do not know how many thousands of babies died.  What were the religious orders thinking of?  Was the population in the country too high?  What kind of an idea did they come up with to neglect an innocent human being like that?</p> <p>  There has been talk of a memorial garden, but that is not enough.  These babies should be given back to their siblings and relations when they have been identified and the DNA has been done properly.  That is what we need.  We could take them to our own graves and graveyards.  We know where we can go to pray if they are in there, but they must not be left there even a second longer.  It is going on for the past six or seven years and it has been highlighted but we are no further on.  If somebody found a strange animal at the end of their garden or anywhere on the road, or even a dead fish in water, the first thing he or she would do is report it to members of the Garda, who would come along and investigate why the animal or fish died.  Yet here we have known numbers of babies and nothing was thought of them.  There is more respect for the wild animals in this country than those babies all over Ireland, given what was done to them.</p></speech>

His testimony has been incredibly powerful.</p> <p>  What we are trying to achieve today is to hear from as many people as possible on this proposed legislation to see where we can strengthen and improve it.  It is welcome to get everybody's view regardless of what they are.  I want to thank everybody for making the effort to travel.  It has not been easy for them with everything that is going on as a result of Covid-19.  We very much appreciate that they have given their time to come here today.  The opening statements were excellent.  They were detailed and set out exactly what each individual or group is thinking or wants to say about this issue.  I thank the witnesses for their engagement.  I do not know if they realise how valuable it is to us, as a committee, to get the opportunity to hear many different viewpoints.

I understand that we lost it for part of the proceedings.  For anybody who lost part of the broadcast, it will be put up on the website for everybody to watch.  We appear to be back live again so apologies for any loss of broadcast in the intervening period.</p> <p>  As Acting Chairman, I will take a few minutes to acknowledge all of the correspondence before us today and the compelling testimony the witnesses have given.  As I have stated in the earlier sessions, this is about ensuring that we, as members of this committee, broaden our perspective so that we try to make the best legislation possible.  We cannot do that without hearing from persons such as the witnesses.</p> <p>  Regarding Bessborough, I am proud to be from Cork but what is happening in Bessborough at the moment is very disturbing for any decent Cork person.  We all want a process that ensures there is memorialisation but that we do not fall foul of the coronial process where remains are found because that is a long-established process and it is based on legislation.  We need to find some compromise in the legislation between the two views around that and that will be a challenge for us; I say that honestly and openly.  I ask Mr. Dodd about the balance of arguments as between memorialising the entirety of the site and the responsibilities that exist in respect of adhering to the coronial process in circumstances where remains are found.  I ask whether the creation of an agency in such circumstances could undermine any process as to natural justice for the persons who may be buried in Bessborough based on the balance of probability and Mr. Parfrey's submission.  How do we strike a balance between memorialising the entirety of the site and the need to ensure that the coronial process where remains are discovered is not compromised?</p></speech>

That is something that the CSSA acknowledges.  From our perspective, when we talk about the whole of the site we are primarily focused on that small portion of it that has been identified in the evidence from the OSI as a children's burial ground.  We are quite happy to agree to let the developer develop the residential property elsewhere, but just not on top of that site.  It is important to mark that.  Others may have different views but we believe this is a legitimate objective that is achievable to give the survivors something.  The survivors have a special right to mourn their children.  If we think about the problem, the solution becomes clear.  If one does not fence off where one buries children and one does not mark their graves, one is treating them as if they did not exist and as if they had no lives, families or mothers.</p></speech>

The legislation before us is clear on creating an agency.  Mr. Dodd has expressed a very legitimate view on closing off a specific element of the site, and we are very cognisant of the fact that he is speaking about a very specific part of it.  He has already articulated that very well.  I am referring to the law, however.  Could Mr. Dodd express an opinion on the law and the coronial process as it relates to the entirety of the Bessborough site?  It may be that he has not considered that point, which is entirely legitimate, but if he has an opinion on it I would dearly love to hear it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.516" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Dodd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#QQQ00300"><p>Sure.  I would like to make two points on the existing law, if that is acceptable.  As it happens, I am also a legislative drafter.  I have acted for quite a few Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The first point when drafting legislation is that one has to understand what the existing law is before overlaying a new Act on top of it.  The Chair mentioned the coroner's court process.  As I understand it, that will simply continue.  For example, if the developer or any other person finds remains at Bessborough House, the normal process will just kick in.  I am not certain, therefore, that there is a need in that context for anything new, unless it leads to inaction that is unsatisfactory to members who want to do something to show and mark what has happened.</p> <p>  There is a second area to which this also applies.  There is already an Act that sets out how to treat burial grounds, the Act from 1878.  It still applies today.  It was transferred via our Constitution in 1922 and 1937.  There are rules and statutory instruments under that.  When we dig them out, we see they make total sense.  One fences off burial grounds.  One does it so animals will not walk on them and so humans will not do so without knowing.  One marks the graves.  My point is that there are already Acts to deal with this.  It is important when intervening in legislation that one does not inadvertently cut out what I describe.  From our perspective, if the law was simply applied in the past or today, we would end up with a solution, which is a fenced-off area, an area regarded as sacrosanct by the relatives and to which they could go to sit and talk to their deceased.  That, from our perspective, is the legislative background that is important to bear in mind.  I hope that answers the question.  I fully understand where the Acting Chairman is coming from.</p></speech>

I thank him for confirming the position on broadcasting.  I realise it was causing quite a lot of distress.  I have received messages and emails about it.  Other than a broadcasting unit decision, there is nothing else behind what occurred, and everything will be available online.</p> <p>  I have a couple of points.  Mr. Mulryan's contribution was incredibly powerful.  When talking about the social practices and beliefs of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, there is a danger of our distancing ourselves from them as they are seen to be of the past.</p><p>Hearing the distress that Mr. Mulryan experiences daily in the here and now on behalf of his sister and family is a valuable message that brings to life every word of this legislation, as well as how we as a committee should act as legislators in our recommendation to the Minister and how we should seek him to act in response.  The urgency has been impressed on us.</p><p> I have a number of points in response to the Know Your Own submission.  I agree completely that ten years is not long enough to hold DNA profiles.  Our understanding of DNA is evolving, as have methods of analysis, and the next session will deal with a number of those issues.  As the science of identifying people evolves, it is important we maintain DNA profiles for as long as possible in the hope that, eventually, we will be able to identify people.</p><p> Turning to the discrepancies between death and burial records, how does Mr. Parfrey propose this should be investigated and what can be done?  A penal sanction cannot have retrospective effect but does he propose a scoping exercise?  The Minister has proposed such an exercise to extend the appeal for information beyond the mother and baby home.  Will Mr. Parfrey elaborate on that?</p><p> To return to Mr. Dodd, it is not unprecedented for burial grounds to be built on or near to such sites.  Not far from Leinster House, there is St. Catherine's Church in Thomas Street, the burial grounds of which are now a park, while behind St. Mary's Church in Mary Street, there is a public square on the burial grounds.  Any burial ground associated with this site, however, has the inherent injustice of the inhumane treatment and, therefore, deserves elevation above any normal burial ground.  That is why I believe the Bill is absolutely necessary.</p><p> I would appreciate any further comments from our guests on those points.</p></speech>

That is why I wanted to emphasise that the CSSA is not anti-development.  It has no problem with residential homes and recognises that people need homes, so there is compromise.  It just does not want the development to be on the burial ground.  Bessborough is a large site and the development does not have to be on the burial ground.  It can be in many other places.  That is not an unreasonable approach to adopt.</p> <p>  While there are some instances where development has clashed with burial grounds, it is not the norm.  If a developer asks an architect for a plan to build and he or she finds a burial ground, he or she will give the developer a plan but will probably say not to build on the burial ground.  The problem here is there was no consultation with the survivors.  The architect drew up the plans and did not realise there was a burial ground, and is now trying to claim that there is none there.  That is the difficulty with saying it is not clear where the burial ground is.  Development has to happen.  Nobody is anti-development.  We are trying to be reasonable and have engagement.  That there was no consultation with the survivors before the plans were submitted is why we have ended up where we are.</p></speech>

Accordingly, a full Garda investigation should be initiated, and it should include Garda access to the archives of the religious order and investigate all living personnel, no matter what age.  The Garda investigation should involve all those who are still alive who worked within the institutions.</p><p>They should be compelled to give evidence about the procedure that was followed when a child died and about the whereabouts of the burial place.  Furthermore, most of the babies were buried without the involvement of any coroner and without any inquest.  Bessborough is technically a crime scene, as far as I am concerned.</p></speech>

We are about to wind down proceedings but, before we do, we must have regard to the fact that there will be an oral hearing in respect of the Bessborough planning application on Wednesday, 21 April.  It will be interesting to see what that process will bring in terms of closer investigation of the issue of investigations.  I am hopeful that if there are people watching from An Bord Plean&aacute;la now, they will have regard to how the Oireachtas is considering these matters and the pertinent points that have been made by our contributors today.  It should be noted that our contributors have made the point that survivors are not against planning <i>per se</i>, but there must be due regard and recognition of the sensitivities of the site and a process must put in place to deal with all of those.  That is absolutely noted.  Will either of the parties from Cork be parties to that An Bord Plean&aacute;la process when it emerges?</p></speech>

I am, of course, quite familiar with Tuam but I also know a great deal about Bessborough.  The committee gave quite proper credence to Mr. Dodd, barrister-at-law, and his considered and useful view of matters.  I am a retired solicitor, no longer practising, but I did, in fact, take the first case on this issue into the High Court with my good friend Peter Mulryan some five years ago.  For the first six days in court, I dealt with the matter without the aid of counsel, until I deemed it useful to bring in wonderful, learned counsel to act as a buffer between myself and the learned judge.</p> <p>  A number of members have raised the issue of burial records in respect of Bessborough.  It is quite extraordinary that there are no burial records.  This is a common feature of mother and baby homes.  It is an extraordinary thing.  In Bessborough, there was a death register and a collection of death certificates which the order had acquired or sought from the local registrar in respect of children who died, irrespective of where they were buried or not buried.  The extraordinary thing is that the death register and the collection of death certificates existed side by side for over 30 years before the practice ceased in 1953 and death registers were no longer kept.  I have a rather bad feeling that the intervention, or coming into force, of the Adoption Act 1952 might have had an impact in that regard.  It could no longer happen that a young man - for example, a US Air Force person passing through Shannon, where Bessborough babies were picked up, on his way to South Dakota - could find out many years later where he came from, come back, discover a death certificate and say, "Hey, I'm not dead."</p><p>There is a very unfortunate gap in the records that should be addressed.</p><p> As to the legislation as a whole, I accept that everybody concerned in dealing with this is very keen to deliver something that will deliver justice.  I have no doubt about that.  However, because of the very different circumstances of somewhere like Tuam where one can identify where the bodies are and where there are enormous difficulties despite quite remarkable work by Mr. Dodd and others and in other sites, we do not have precise burial places.  Bessborough is a nightmare.  I know that.  I have been there many times.  One cannot create a Bill that will be a one-size-fits-all.  There is no doubt that the fundamentals of our coronial system, which are fundamental to a system of justice in this country and have served us enormously well, are irreconcilable with much of this Bill.  They are quite irreconcilable.</p><p> The other thing I would point out is that after the peace process in 1998, this House and the Upper House passed an Act, which was an act of reconciliation and very proper, to trace the bodies of the disappeared.  There were quite a small number of these people and now there are fewer of them.  That Act is a very short one.  It worked to our existing law with respect to exhumation, inquests and post-mortems.  We did not need a new Act to dig up a large part of County Meath, excavate almost the entire beachfront of County Louth or go to France and dig up another chunk of land.  We did not need it.  That Act, and the institution that grew from it, has no sunset clause and no limit on its budget and yet we are talking about having to do the most extraordinary things in the case of Tuam to conduct an inquest.  I am not going to start defaming anybody but I think everybody knows-----</p></speech>

As the Acting Chairman can imagine, we are linking in with our group and getting feedback live.  One point I did not make but should have made is that not one mother with whom we have spoken is in favour of the idea of exhuming her deceased child.  They find that concept very traumatising.  They are already traumatised and not one mother has sought that.  They have expressed that as re-traumatisation.  This has been fed through to me as we have been speaking live.  It is not a point I hit off.  I just wanted to make that point to the committee.  Others may have views and logic and law may dictate it, but from a mother's perspective, exhuming one's child is really quite a visceral concept and those mothers are entitled to express the view that they do not want this to happen.  It is important I make that point as it is something I forgot to touch on earlier, so I am grateful to the Acting Chairman.  I hope it is okay to finish with that.</p></speech>

Perhaps as part of our consideration within this pre-legislative scrutiny we need to think about whether close relatives of the deceased should have a veto on what happens - whether there is an exhumation or what happens.</p><p>Maybe we need to explore that as an idea, bearing in mind that this would respect mothers and siblings, being the closest relatives, as opposed to wider family members or something like that.  Perhaps there should be people who get an absolute say and that view should be respected.</p></speech>

On that note, I propose that we close proceedings.</p> <p>  Before doing so, as somebody who is chairing this session, I personally thank the witnesses - Kevin, Martin, David and Peter - sincerely from the bottom of my heart for the compelling evidence that each and every one of them has brought before us today.  I speak as just one member here but please be assured that there is much in what they have said to which we must now give consideration.  While there is a view that we need to make haste with the legislation, we need to make haste slowly and have due consideration to the compelling arguments that have been made here today.  I thank the witnesses sincerely for the time that they have given us in coming here today.  Please do not underestimate the potency of what you have said.</p> <p>  Without further ado, unless there is any other official business, I propose that we publish the opening statements on the Oireachtas website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I again thank all the witnesses for their engagement with the members of the committee and for appearing before the committee today, both in person and virtually.  I assure them that all members of the committee, as well as the Chair, Deputy Funchion, are united in prioritising the work programme of the committee to assist the Minister in the implementation of the recommendations and actions provided for in the commission of investigation report into the mother and baby homes.</p> <p>  I thank our staff, who are working under tremendous pressure in terms of these hearings, for their work thus far today.</p></speech>

If not, we will proceed.  Apologies have been received from Senator Keogan.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I remind members who are participating remotely to keep their devices on mute until they are invited to speak.  Where possible, I ask that they have their camera switched on while speaking.  Members should be mindful that we are in public session.  I also remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament chooses to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate in this meeting from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be refused.</p> <p>  In this session, we continue our pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of a certain institutional burials (authorised interventions) Bill.  We are joined in committee room 3 by Ms Anna Corrigan.  Appearing virtually before the committee are Mr. Carl Buckley, Dr. Stephen Donoghue, Dr. Jens Carlsson and forensic archaeologists, Dr. Niamh McCullagh and Mr. Aidan Harte.  The witnesses are all very welcome and I thank them for taking the time to prepare opening statements and written submissions.</p> <p>  In order to avoid any confusion during our engagement, I will set out the purpose of today's meeting and how proceedings will be conducted.  While acknowledging the harrowing experiences of survivors during their time in mother and baby homes and county homes, the purpose of our meeting is to consider the policy provisions of the proposed legislation.  A discussion will take place on the provisions of the general scheme as they relate to the statutory basis and framework under which the Government may decide to authorise interventions at certain sites where manifestly inappropriate burials have taken place associated with institutions operated by or on behalf of the State or in respect of which the State had clear regulatory or supervisory responsibilities.  There are also provisions for the establishment of an agency to carry out such interventions.</p> <p>  I remind members and witnesses that they are expected to strictly adhere to the subject matter scheduled for discussion today.  I also advise witnesses that the opening statements they read into the record here today should be the statement they provided in advance of this meeting.  Any deviation on these matters will be addressed through the Chair.</p> <p>  We are all very much aware of the restrictions Covid-19 has brought to all our lives.  It has also severely impacted the scheduling of public committee meetings.  However, members of the committee felt it important to hear from those who may be impacted by or have a professional view on the provisions of the general scheme.  It is the responsibility of parliamentary committees to consider and discuss topics in a balanced and fair manner.  In achieving this goal, it is the committee, and only the committee, which determines the witnesses it engages with and will do so in an unhindered manner.  This level of engagement will greatly assist the members of the committee in finalising their scrutiny report on the general scheme.  For this reason, and while strictly adhering to Covid-19 safety requirements, four public meetings of the committee have been scheduled over the course of today.  It is also expected that we will have further public meetings in the near future to consider this matter further.</p> <p>  The committee wishes to have a productive public engagement.  However, I must remind all present that they should not mention names of individuals or organisations even if that information is already in the public domain, nor should they make charges against anyone by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  These are normal parliamentary procedures that exist to ensure engagements are conducted in a constructive way.  Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I will read out the standard text regarding the provisions of the Defamation Act to remind them of their rights and obligations.</p> <p>  I want to take a minute to brief the witnesses on the work of the committee since the publication of the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters and the pre-legislative scrutiny by the committee to date of the general scheme of the proposed Bill.  While the committee has been limited in the number of public meetings held due to Covid-19 restrictions, it has afforded priority in its consideration to scrutiny of the proposed Bill, the issues that have arisen following the publication of the report of the commission of investigation, and the desire of members of the committee to ensure justice for the survivors of mother and baby homes.  These matters have been discussed at eight of the committee's nine joint meetings held this year.  The committee has corresponded with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on five occasions on various matters and it has met the Minister and his officials to discuss these issues wherever possible.</p><p>The committee has prioritised these issues above the other competing demands of our vast work programme.  Insofar as it reasonably can, it stands ready to help facilitate delivery of the recommendations and actions contained in the report into mother and baby homes, however possible, and to undertake robust scrutiny of any and all related legislation referred, such as the general scheme under discussion today.</p><p> The public call for submissions on the scheme opened on 22 January, with a deadline of 19 February which we later extended until 26 February.  Every effort was made to ensure maximum reach and accessibility during this process.  In total, the committee received 426 submissions.  The committee has also had substantial stand-alone correspondence from the public on these issues and appreciates the engagement and effort the public have made to date on what are difficult issues.  At this point I would like to highlight some of the support services available to anyone affected by the matters under discussion today.  There is a dedicated counselling service for former residents of mother and baby homes and its telephone number is 1800 817517.</p><p> Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that is the case.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  I must point out that it is uncertain whether parliamentary privilege will apply to the evidence of witnesses appearing virtually from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if they are directed to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, it is also imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p> I will call on the witnesses in the following order to deliver their opening statement.  We will start with Ms Anna Corrigan, then Dr. Stephen Donoghue and Dr. Niamh McCullagh.  I invite Ms Corrigan to deliver her opening statement.  She has five minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.543" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna Corrigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#XXX00200"><p>My name is Anna Corrigan.  As well as being appointed spokesperson of the Tuam Babies Family Group I am also a victim of that which occurred in the home.  Eleven of our family are in the pit in Tuam.  My mother, Bridget Dolan, was forced to enter the home, and my two brothers, whom I did not know even existed until relatively recently, were born in that home.  One of my brothers is recorded as having died in Tuam.  The whereabouts of my second brother still remains to this day, unknown.  I also had an aunt who sadly died.  She is recorded as having died aged 13 in an industrial home in Loughrea, County Galway.  Like many others, her place of burial is currently not known.  My story is not unusual, there are many like it.  It is because of our stories and our experiences that it is essential that there be no further prevarication, no further procrastination, and no further obfuscation of the truth and that which occurred at Tuam, and for that matter, every other mother and baby home across the country.</p> <p>  Further, this issue is not limited to mother and baby homes, it is equally as applicable to industrial homes and any other institution.  I acknowledge that the purpose of today's hearing is not to consider anything other than the proposed legislation, but we are doing a disservice to the countless people that have suffered and continue to suffer, because of that which occurred and the seeming inability of those responsible to be truthful in their accounts if we do not acknowledge the background to this legislation and that which has prompted it.</p><p>Furthermore, we would be doing a disservice to the more than 700 bodies of children that remain tossed without a care into a hole in the ground, without a further thought, for decades.  Our initial position is that the legislation being proposed is not required.  An appropriate statutory framework already exists that allows for the exhumation of bodies found and analysis of what is discovered.</p><p> However, it is also accepted that legislation in one form or another is to be passed, given the clear intention of the Government to do so.  It is not an opportunity for the grass to remain undisturbed on that which happened in the past and it ought not be used as a tool to continue the opacity over this period in Irish history.  Those of us who are victims and survivors deserve and demand the truth not only for ourselves, but for those countless people who died not knowing.  As a result, perhaps three central themes ought to run through any steps being taken to exhume the Tuam site and-or any other identified site: to identify those buried; to establish whether there was any criminality; and to investigate that which led to such tragic events occurring so as to ensure that they cannot happen again.  The sole focus of this process should be victim-centric so as to attempt to answer the plethora of questions regarding what exactly was allowed to happen within establishments such as Tuam Mother and Baby Home.</p><p> The legislation in its current form does not do this; it does not focus on any of these issues and thus there is a very real risk that the questions so desperately asked by hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals will continue to remain unanswered.  The process ought to be as simple as possible and there ought to be no hurdles to surmount in seeking to investigate these sites and identify the remains that are found.  Unfortunately, in its current form the legislation would appear to be the opposite of this and it is replete with opportunities to prevent exhumation and investigation.</p><p> In closing, I implore any and all who are involved in the process to remember that there is an absolute and heavy moral burden upon them to do what is right for those that tragically lost their lives and those that remain not knowing.  Those held within the home were denied their human rights and Ireland failed to respect those same rights, seemingly adopting a position that unmarried mothers did not deserve that respect.  Ireland remains bound by its obligations to those international human rights treaties and conventions to which it is a state party; it must honour those obligations and do now that which it failed to do previously.  We demand, but more than that, we deserve, the truth.</p></speech>

I outlined my background and qualifications in my original submission.  Dr. Carlsson is an associate professor and an expert on conservation and population genetics.</p> <p>  In 2018, along with Professor Dan Bradley at Trinity College Dublin and Dr. Jens Carlsson and Professor David MacHugh at University College Dublin, I submitted a report when calls were being made for public responses regarding the options and appropriate courses of actions available to the Government at the site of the former mother and baby home in Tuam, County Galway.  The requests for public consultations in 2018 were partly made due to the findings of the expert technical group, ETG, in the previous year.  The ETG report was sceptical about the ability to identify the remains at Tuam using short tandem repeat, STR, DNA techniques.  In our report in 2018, we indicated that the ETG appeared to ignore the potential for using a technique referred to as high throughput sequencing, HTS, coupled with single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, SNP analysis, to analyse the DNA of the remains of the individuals at Tuam.  HTS and SNP arrays are now overwhelmingly the tools of choice for assessing genetic variability in humans and other species.  We can now routinely use many thousands to millions of SNPs for population genetics and genomic-relatedness analyses with unprecedented statistical power, but at a relatively low cost.</p><p>In speaking to members now, I shall reaffirm the executive summary of my submission to this committee.  The extraction of DNA from the petrous part of the temporal bone, alongside the use of HTS, coupled with SNP analysis, represents, by far, the most efficient way to analyse degraded DNA and identify the remains at the mother and baby homes.  Despite significant advances in analysing DNA and the establishment of a forensic DNA database that utilises STR profiling, Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, is unlikely to have the expertise to carry out the SNP analysis.  This is not particularly unusual as STR profiling is the standard analysis used for criminal investigations across the globe.  We need not, however, be restricted to this technique in identifying the remains at Tuam and other mother and baby home sites.<br/><br/>Despite the establishment of the agency to co-ordinate the operation of identifying the remains at a putative site, there are provisions within the Bill that anchor the FSI in the sampling, analysis and matching of the DNA. There are, however, fundamental differences between STR forensics and HTS coupled with SNP analysis.  The way the DNA is processed and matched with relatives differs between the two techniques.  Irish universities have academics with significant capabilities in SNP analysis, both HTS and array based.  As we noted in the 2018 report, there has already been a collaboration between University College Dublin, UCD, researchers, FSI and the Garda Technical Bureau in using HTS and SNP analysis and DNA extracted from the petrous part of the temporal bone to identify the remains of Thomas Kent, one of the Irish rebellion leaders, in 2016.  Indeed, the genetic identification of Thomas Kent was led by Dr. Carlsson&rsquo;s team.<br/><br/>The Bill under consideration allows for the agency to hire consultants.  The Bill should extend the operational activities of such consultants to enable them to work in partnership with the FSI.  This could be to sample DNA from the petrous part of the temporal bone from the remains, to allow for the processing of the extracted DNA using SNP arrays from any remains and to match the DNA.  Currently, the Bill mandates that the FSI conducts searches of DNA profiles on the DNA historic remains database in order to make a familial match.  This has the potential to be problematic as STR matches may use different software to any such matches using SNPs.  I have outlined the specific actions to implement these recommendations in my submission.<br/><br/>I would like the Oireachtas to view this as an opportunity.  In my original submission, I highlighted how some key opinion leaders in forensics are recommending how the community should be shifting towards SNP analysis.  The report from the Commission of Investigation on the Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters was not viewed favourably by many of the survivors of the homes or relatives.  By utilising advanced DNA technologies and collaborating with academics with the relevant expertise that exists within Irish universities, as exemplified in the identification of Thomas Kent, this Government can show the world that it is serious about identifying the remains at Tuam and other mother and baby homes.<br/><br/>Finally, I wish to repeat the quote from Dr. Alondra Nelson, the current deputy director for science and society in the Office of Science and Technology Policy, OSTP, in the USA, the author of <i>The Social Life of DNA</i>and one of the foremost experts on so-called DNA reconciliation projects:</p><blockquote>	There comes a time in the life of every community when it must look humbly and seriously into its past in order to provide the best possible foundation for moving into a future based on healing and hope. </blockquote><p>HTS with SNP analysis represents the best possible opportunity for the remains to be identified and for the State to move into a future based on healing and hope.  This assertion that SNP arrays would be significantly more effective at identifying the remains than STR forensics has consequences for certain provisions in the Bill, which I have outlined in my submission.</p></speech>

I am a consultant forensic archaeologist.  I led the forensic investigation team on behalf of the mother and baby home commission of investigation at the sites of Tuam, Sean Ross Abbey and Bessborough.  Today, I am also representing other members of that investigation team, namely, Mr. Aidan Harte, forensic archaeologist, and Dr. Linda Lynch, juvenile osteoarchaeologist.  It should be noted that we have not made a written submission but we have been asked to appear before this committee and hope to answer any questions it might have.</p> <p>  We have considerable experience, individually and collectively, of these kinds of investigations, including for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains.  Our expertise means that we are qualified to anticipate the many practical concerns and potential issues that will arise in any forensic excavation and recovery of remains at these and similar sites to which this Bill refers.</p> <p>  I was responsible for directing the test excavations undertaken by the commission at Tuam in 2016 and 2017, the reports of which are now publicly available.  Our reports on the site deal extensively with what was at Tuam and the manner in which these infants and young children were interred.</p><p>Subsequently, in 2017, I was independently requested by the former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to direct an expert technical group to report on options available to the Government on the appropriate excavation and recovery of the remains of these infants and young children.  The group comprised a range of international experts in mass grave excavation, DNA, forensic archaeology, forensic anthropology, coronial law and juvenile osteoarchaeology.  The group report was published in 2018.</p><p> In this report we identified a programme of humanitarian forensic action that should underpin the recovery of remains from the significantly challenging conditions observed at the underground chambers at Tuam.  This approach provides a structure that protects the dignity of the dead through the utilisation of proper processes of forensic recovery, management, individualisation of remains and identification of remains where possible.  The use of forensic methods and procedures in the recovery of remains allows increased opportunity for individualisation of human remains, a key step towards providing identity.  In our opinion, this methodology is relevant and appropriate to other burial contexts at similar institutional sites.</p><p> For the purposes of the committee it is worth reminding ourselves of the context of what we discovered at Tuam.  There is evidence of some commingling of skeletal remains in the subsurface chambers.  This means the mixing of the remains of two or more individuals.  The remains here are of infants and young juveniles.  A full-term infant skeleton comprises over 300 bones, with the cranium alone consisting of 34 individual pieces of bone.  It appears that many of these bones separated on skeletonisation and have mixed with others, making individualisation and subsequent identification particularly difficult.  It cannot be assumed that all of the individuals buried here will be identified, whether through DNA or other identification processes.</p><p> We broadly support the advancement of the Bill through the Oireachtas and believe the legislation should insist that appropriate actions and accepted best practice be applied at each and every stage of future investigations or excavation programmes.  The essential requirement is, therefore, that the Bill adopt principles of humanitarian forensic action and place them at the core of any new legislation concerned with institutional burials.</p><p> However, on the basis of our experience at Tuam, drawing on our individual professional experience, and incorporating the advice received from international experts, we have a number of concerns about the proposed legislation.  The Bill refers to "exhumation".  This is possibly a misapplication of the term.  It is intended to refer to situations where bodies have been interred in an appropriate way.  In the context of this Bill, we consider "excavation" to be the more appropriate term.</p><p> There is considerable reference in the Bill to DNA profiling.  Our 2018 expert technical group report was of the view that DNA profiling is, of course, possible.  However, the re-association of individual bones to one set of remains will create challenges for identification and reburial.  Every effort should be made to re-associate bones to an individual prior to DNA.  This will be a significant investment of time and expertise and may not be successful in every case.</p><p> We must bear in mind that we have a duty of care to all of the remains interred and not just those we can identify.  There is an absence in the draft Bill of clear direction and specification with regard to the process of forensic excavation, recovery and post-mortem examination of the human remains that will be uncovered.  The Bill does not address the post-mortem management of remains prior to identification, nor does it address what will happen to remains that cannot be identified.  There is no mention of how such unidentified remains are to be treated and how they are to be buried, and how will this be done in a manner that respects the dignity that they have been so far deprived of in death.</p><p> We have identified some technical issues in the Bill that we believe require some further attention.  These specifically relate to head 5 and the criteria for intervention in paragraphs 2(a) and 2(c).  Paragraph 2(a) states that certain burials will be considered inappropriate where the "remains are uncoffined".  We know that coffins decay and the practicality of establishing whether remains are uncoffined prior to intervention is unlikely.  The absence of a coffin cannot be considered a reliable indicator that no coffin was present at the time of burial.</p><p> Paragraph 2(c) states the burial depth should also be considered as an indicator of appropriateness.  It is not always possible to accurately confirm the original ground level at the time of burial due to numerous factors, particularly truncation of the site.  The original depth of the burial, therefore, cannot be established with any certainty prior to intervention.</p><p> It is our opinion that to provide dignity to those interred, their recovery must be undertaken with as much detail and care as technology, techniques, and circumstances will allow.  In our view, it is this forensic approach to the investigation and recovery of human remains that will lead to the truth of these infants and children; who they were, how they lived and how they died.</p><p> We are happy to answer any questions that the committee may have arising from this or our areas of expertise.</p></speech>

I address my opening remarks to Ms Corrigan.  I thank her sincerely for her opening statement, which began with her personal story.  In this session probably more than in any other session today, we need to begin by remembering that these were real people who had potential lives to live.  They could have been with us today and could have been mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers at this stage.  It is most important to remember them before we get on to any analytical discussion of how the process can be facilitated.  We need to remember that these were human beings who had all of their lives before them.</p> <p>  Ms Corrigan's submission set a template with three central themes: to identify those buried; to establish if there was any criminality; and to investigate what led to such tragic events occurring to ensure they will not happen again.  I think that reflects the theme of transitional justice that we have heard throughout today.</p> <p>  Taking that as our template and our guidance document, I turn to the contributions of Dr. Donoghue and Dr. McCullagh.  While I hear them, particularly Dr. McCullagh, being specific about language and express terms in the Bill, are there also express conditions or boundaries within the legislation that fetter the evolution of science to be of assistance in the future?  Are there different methods associated with DNA or other scientific methods that can be employed or that we should prepare for?  Is the legislation sufficiently open to facilitate scientific evolution over a number of years?  I am mindful that there is a ten-year limit on the keeping of DNA but I would be open to the committee urging that the ten-year limit be extended so that we facilitate science evolving.  </p> <p>  Dr. McCullagh said there was no prescriptive method regarding post mortem excavation and how the remains are to be handled.  Has a best practice been established arising from natural disasters or otherwise?  I am talking about events such as the one at Hillsborough.  How is that dealt with?</p></speech>

Obviously, our statement was very much focused on the DNA aspect.  Dr. McCullagh has particular expertise in forensic archaeology.  With regard to the openness of the Bill, my submission suggested that the term for the destruction times for samples for putative relatives was too short and appeared to be taken from those associated with the criminal DNA database.  I did not really understand the point of that.  There seemed to be quite a bit of haste to get rid of the samples and profiles of putative relatives.</p><p>I am not sure why that was.  With regard to the Senator's comment on ten years, hopefully further techniques will come along that could allow for better processing if there is not an identification of the remains.  I hope that could be extended further as well.  I do not know whether Dr. Carlsson has any comment to make on that.</p></speech>

We might be able to do things in a couple of years that we have a hard time thinking about now.</p></speech>

There are many international protocols for best practice.  These were outlined in the expert technical group report on how best to proceed from the beginning of the process, from site identification through to excavation, recovery processes, post-excavation analysis of the human remains by suitably qualified people, such as forensic anthropologists, a post-mortem examination and then moving forward to an identification and a coroner's inquest.</p></speech>

Is it necessary for them to be expressly provided for within the legislation?</p></speech>

If the term "forensic recovery" is not used, there will not be a forensic recovery.  That will result in the loss of quite a lot of information.</p></speech>

If one goes ahead with SNP profiling, it allows for matching with second-order relatives.  The Bill prescribes the people who can be used to identify the relatives by referring to relativity.  They are, essentially, mostly first-order relatives.  One of the great strengths of SNP profiling is that it allows for second-order relatives such as cousins, uncles and aunts.  There is one second-order relative mentioned in the Bill.  I cannot remember which; it may be a half-sibling.  It seems strange to mention one and not other second-order relatives.  This was referenced in an earlier session.</p></speech>

I suppose we are all learning.  It is important that we learn today what we can do best for the survivors.  I also thank Ms Corrigan.  There is no question that a series of wrongs was done to the babies in Tuam and I thank her for her powerful words.  It is not easy to testify at an Oireachtas committee and I welcome that she has done that so well.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Corrigan about the memorial side.  It is suggested in the Bill, as a possibility, that the agency might decide memorialisation of the site, without further intervention, would be appropriate.  What do the families want as a memorial?  I ask Ms Corrigan this because, after the investigation, it is so important that survivors and their families are involved.  They should have their say in what happens.  </p> <p>  We often see in Ireland graveyards with long forgotten names on overgrown headstones.  The people of Cork would love to be able to access the Good Shepherd grave site in Sunday's Well.  I do not think any of us want to see that happen here, but, rather, some kind of a grave site or memorial that would afford families a place to visit, maintain and form part of the memories of future generation.  Does Ms Corrigan have any suggestions for what the families might like?  It is important that we look at the bigger picture.  After the investigation, we must make sure that survivors lead this and we listen to them and their families.</p> <p>  I have a second question for Dr. Donoghue.</p><p>Ms Corrigan might come back to me.</p><p> It concerns me that DNA analysis is listed in the Bill as the primary model to lead to the identification of human remains.  We know it is not best practice to use DNA analysis alone.  Will Dr. Donoghue talk me through the other ways to identify human remains, the cost and the skill set needed?  I am aware, but open to correction, that Forensic Science Ireland does not employ any forensic anthropologist.  This might be from where the idea to include the hiring of consultants came.  Will Dr. Donoghue clarify that?  What would an ideal team look like and what specialties it would have?  Should we hire people from other countries, for example, the USA?  Would there be costs involved?  In that regard, what is the landscape at third level here?  Is there a labour force here from which we could potentially hire?  I ask because we do not want extra barriers.  Timing is of the essence for survivors.  Survivors and their families have been through so much and it is important going forward that we have the answers and we do not say this or that can happen.  I and several other members asked earlier about the DNA issue and the short timescale of ten years.  Some survivors sought a longer timescale of perhaps 50 years.  It is important that we work with survivors and listen to their concerns.  I ask Ms Corrigan and Dr. Donoghue to answer those questions.</p></speech>

It is at the very end of a process that we have not even begun.  We are still at a loss as to why the site was partially excavated and exhumed body parts taken out for carbon dating and the possibility of extracting DNA.  We do not know where those body parts lie.  We were left with that and the site was handed back to Galway County Council, backfilled and reseeded.  That is where it left us in 2017.  Here we are in March 2021 looking for a law to open up this site again.  Memorialisation is nowhere in our vision.  We are looking for our human rights, which were never afforded to our families, which we are being deprived of and to which we have entitlement under the laws of this land and under the European Court of Human Rights.</p> <p>  Both my brothers have been the subject of two open Garda inquiries since 2013 and 2014.  These have not been acted on.  I have never interacted with the commission and I am being deprived of my right to justice as a citizen of this State.  I act as the PR for the Tuam Babies Family Group and we also represent survivors.  A combined total of 11 of our family members are in Tuam.  We have been denied justice.  From the start of this process, we have never been directly communicated with.  We have elicited a lot of our information from social media.  We saw a digger on the site and somebody got up on the wall and took a photograph.  We had no direct feedback.  We got a press release in tandem with the press.  When the human remains were found we were notified at the same time as the press.  We were not brought in in advance to be told body parts had been found.  We are in an Alice in Wonderland situation and the further one goes, the more it is like going down the rabbit hole.  Things get curiouser and curiouser.  A lot has happened around this that has not come out in national media.  We have been gaslit quite a bit, despite the fact that we have 11 stated members of our family in that pit.  Everybody chooses to be a voice for us but we have our own voice.</p> <p>  Memorialisation is a long way down the road - when the bodies have been identified using SNP, as Dr. Donoghue said.  I got information under a freedom of information request and I cannot understand why SNP is not being used.  It was stated that Tuam was unprecedented.  If it is unprecedented, there is no need to go down the road of STR, which ties in with the criminal and Garda side.</p><p>There has never been any indication that the Garda would get involved here because it has been denied that it is a criminal site.  It has been taken that there is no evidence of criminality here even though the coroner took jurisdiction of Tuam in July 2017 but failed to act.  I was listening to the discussions this morning about the involvement of the coroner.  It was stated on the FOI documents I received that the coroner had taken jurisdiction.  He is obligated to act under the Coroners Act.  None of the children in that grave had medical certification of death.  Under section 18 of the Coroners Act, when a death is reported to the police, a superintendent or higher must go to the coroner and inform the coroner that the body lies in his jurisdiction because it does not have medical certification of death.  This was raised this morning.  I notified An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in September 2016 that this was the case in Tuam but this was not acted on.  The coroner took jurisdiction in Tuam in 2017 and we have had a partial excavation-----</p></speech>

Historically, we were one of the last countries in Europe to establish a DNA database, which is astonishing.  That said, in a very short period of time Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, has made tremendous progress.  Prior to the FSI coming on board, there was a history of sending our samples to the UK for standard strand displacement reactions, SDRs, Y-chromosome short tandem repeat, Y-STR or mitochondrial profiling.  At the same time, while that was going on, we developed within the Irish university landscape, world-class expertise in single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNP, profiling and archaeological paleogenomics.  That whole area is making huge strides with regard to identification.  Scientists are able to identify remains going back 10,000 years using variations of whole genome sequencing, WGS.  Regarding the other expertise, Dr. McCullagh is one of the foremost experts in her field.  She has huge expertise with regard to the North.</p> <p>  I will invite Dr. Carlsson to respond on this because he can elaborate further.  There is already a template for the type of collaboration that is required.  We do not need to bring in external experts, particularly with regard to DNA.  In terms of forensic archaeology, Dr. McCullagh and her colleagues have the necessary expertise.  We could definitely bring in the expertise from the Irish university system to work with FSI to develop the SNP profiling.  I invite Dr. Carlsson to describe the relationship with the FSI and the Garda Technical Bureau and the work done to identify the remains of Thomas Kent, which would be useful to the committee.</p></speech>

We started the collaboration immediately and went down to Cork.  We had expertise with us for extracting DNA from the petrous bone.  In fact, that extraction technique was developed at UCD and is now standard throughout the archaeological world for getting DNA.  FSI looked after contemporary DNA samples, which it extracted from living nieces.  That DNA, together with the DNA we extracted from Thomas Kent was sequenced at UCD for SNP analysis.  We were able to make the connection between them.  That worked very smoothly for us and I assume it worked really well for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and FSI as well.</p></speech>

She mentioned the absence of recommendations and approaches relating to unidentified remains.  Does she have any recommendations in terms of the best approach to that?</p> <p>  In respect of this Bill and all matters relating to mother and baby homes, it is important to zoom out and remember the gravity of it and that the commission of investigation was only formed in light of the discovery of the child and infant remains in a defunct septic tank in Tuam.  It was never the State's intention to do anything about it before that.  People have been let down time and again and continue to come before committees like this in hope that this changes.  I know the witnesses have had a journey in respect of this.  They spoke about the Garda investigations.  Now we see the coroner not acting in respect of the commission of investigation's report highlighting the mass graves in this country.  What would it mean for Ms Corrigan and other people to not feel let down this time by this Bill?  </p></speech>

There is also a legal aspect to it.  Can I refer that question to Mr. Buckley so he can give the committee the background to where we have been let down on the legal end of it?</p></speech>

The biggest problem with this legislation is that it is full of ambiguity.  It needs so much more certainty.  It is not victim-centric and there is a very real risk that the numerous loopholes within the legislation can be exercised in favour of those other than victims.  There is a distinct sense that it is ripe for political interference in that there is a requirement for a sponsoring Minister in head 3.  In respect of head 3 and the circumstances where an agency can be appointed, where is the balance of interests as far as victims and others are concerned?  The criteria for intervention are too restrictive.  Head 6 in respect of memorialisation has already been raised.  Memorialisation without intervention is given to Government Ministers.  With all due respect, that is not a question for Government Ministers.  It is a question for victims.</p> <p>  As has been alluded to by Ms Corrigan and others throughout today's hearings, all of the issues are being taken out of the hands of victims and that is not where this should be.  This should be in their hands and nobody else's.  Failure to do so infringes the Government's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  We have already heard about Articles 2, 3 and 8.  Effectively, what we are dealing with Tuam and the other mother and baby homes is an atrocity crime and we must be quite clear that it amounts to a crime against humanity.  That is where the focus should be - on the victims and an investigation into what happened, and not attempting to take it out of their hands and covering it further.</p></speech>

This is where the importance of the recovery strategy and post-mortem examination of remains really comes into play where one is essentially gathering as much information as possible about that individual such as his or her age at death.  There is new technology that allows one to assess the gender of infant remains.  These techniques and technologies are developing all the time.  A DNA sample would be extracted so that if other individuals come forward, these remains can be re-associated with the family and, ultimately, buried as an individual insofar as is possible but an individual about whom we know as much as possible.</p><p>The population of Tuam is regarded as a closed population because one has a list of deaths that occurred and ages of death.  It may be possible, although we do not know because we have not excavated or recovered any of these remains, to identify the broad age range, associate those back to the burial register and get a more complete picture.  However, it is all essentially based on being allowed to undertake forensic recovery to give those things as much chance of being successful as possible.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge that and the strength and courage of all of the survivors and their families.  I am conscious that this part of our sessions today is technical and can seem a bit impersonal, although we are not trying to be.  We only want to understand this and get it right.  I apologise if it seems cold and insensitive.  It is not intended to be.</p> <p>  My first question is for Dr. McCullagh.  She spoke about the humanitarian forensic approach and considerable time and expertise being required.  I took from her contribution as well her particular involvement and direct experience in Tuam.  We need to look at this beyond Tuam and from the full State's perspective.</p> <p>  Can Dr. McCullagh give the committee some view on the scale of expertise and time that will be required, the process that will be involved and, most importantly, the time that will be involved in terms of the survivors and their relatives being given some answers?  As the work will obviously be conducted over a prolonged period of time, what is best practice in communicating progress over a long period of time to survivors?</p></speech>

Most of the organisations that undertake similar work would have a family liaison officer who is constantly in communication with survivors and victims, and that is essential.  That was something that was identified in the first step of the expert technical group report.  Recommendations from across the globe with similar scenarios have been that communication with survivors and victims' families is crucial.  It is the crucial first step and it needs to be an open door.</p> <p>  What was the first question the Senator asked me?</p></speech>

The time that would be required in the laboratory for the analysis of the remains, not DNA analysis, was not possible to determine because we do not know the number of individuals who will be recovered from that scenario.  Unfortunately, an exact answer to the Senator's question for each process is not determinable at present simply because we do not know how many individuals we are dealing with.</p></speech>

It gives us guidance.  I did not expect it to be exact.</p> <p>  I am curious, though, that Dr. McCullagh stated that Tuam is the most complex.  I had thought that maybe, in some respects, Tuam would be more straightforward than other sites where there is debate over where the burial sites are.</p></speech>

Also, the remains have elements of mixing as opposed to the single graves likely to be come across at other sites like Bessborough and the types of graves we came across at Sean Ross Abbey.  They were individual graves as opposed to this scenario where many individuals are interred together in very inaccessible chambers.</p></speech>

We all recognise the human rights violations that have occurred and want desperately to try to right the wrongs, accepting we will never be able to achieve that completely.  What is the best guidance Mr. Buckley can give us in terms of listening to the survivors, some of whom do not want their babies exhumed?  How do we reconcile the need to address the human rights violations while also respecting the rights of the mothers who do not want their babies exhumed?</p></speech>

I would not like to put myself in the position or suggest I speak on behalf of all of those mothers and victims, because clearly I do not and I cannot.  What the question demonstrates, however, is the reasons there needs to be a proper and thought-out truth and reconciliation process for what went on in the mother and baby homes.  The commission of inquiry was not that and this legislation is not that.  It is a piecemeal approach to a tragedy that people need to sit down and deal with properly.  That is not being done and all those who have died and those who are still alive are being done a disservice.  As much as I can answer the question properly, it does throw up this other issue and shows the importance of that proper process to hear everybody's views and to make decisions taking into account those views.  This legislation does not do that and does not go anywhere near far enough.  Conversely, the commission of inquiry did not do that either as per the reports of many of those who sought to testify and give evidence.  Hence the reason it has been criticised so widely.</p></speech>

We had much discussion about the fact new legislation is not needed, but I am conscious there are State bodies that could have acted and did not.  I am concerned that if we do not - I will steal Dr. McCullagh's words - insist that appropriate actions are inherent in the legislation, they will not happen.  There is an element of trust but there is no trust in the State and how it has responded so far.  We cannot go on trust alone; it is an element of trust but verify.  Much of the best practice we need has to be in the legislation.  Otherwise, I would be concerned it would not happen.  Even if it can happen without being in the legislation, there is a risk that if it is not in the legislation, it will not happen.</p><p> I am also concerned about the challenges we face in terms of the technical aspects.  Dr. McCullagh talked about individualisation.  Will she talk to us about some of the challenges she anticipates and how we can address them?  Is it possible to address very technical stuff in the Bill without going too far?  As Senator Seery Kearney said, if we are too restrictive and technology changes, we will not be able to use the legislation.  There is a balance to be struck there.</p><p> With reference to DNA evidence, we are talking about taking samples from the temporal bone.  What is possible if a temporal bone is not recovered?  We are setting up a dichotomy between different kinds of DNA analysis, with STR on the one hand and HTS and SNP on the other.  Is it possible to do both kinds of analysis?  Are there advantages or disadvantages to them?</p></speech>

The question about challenges to individualisation and how we specifically address them in the Bill without becoming too restrictive in case things change for the future is for Dr. McCullagh.  The technical question around DNA is for Dr. Donoghue.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, the specific difficulty in dealing with infant remains in a commingled scenario is the sheer number of very small individual bones.  As I said, a newborn baby has 300 bones in its body and 34 are in the skull.  In Tuam, decomposition led to the separation of those bones in some instances.  It is something about which we have to be realistic.</p> <p>  Ideally, one would attempt individualisation, essentially bringing back all of these skeletal elements to form one individual, where possible, and then moving on to the DNA process.  The best possible chance of creating a situation where skeletal elements can be individualised is in the forensic recovery process.  In a practical sense, referring to a forensic recovery within the legislation will allow those standards to be put in place so that individualisation is given the best chance prior to DNA analysis.</p></speech>

It might be that STR technology will work but the chances are much higher that SNP technology will work.  The simple reason is that DNA degrades.  Think about it as dry spaghetti and we keep on breaking a dry spaghetti straw into smaller and smaller pieces.  The piece one needs for an STR analysis is longer than the piece one needs for an SNP analysis.  It is as simple as that.  It is a shorter fragment so one can tolerate more degradation and still get viable DNA data out of it.  That is the simple reason SNPs are probably better in this case.</p> <p>  Another reason is that there are so many more.  I think that quite a low number of STRs are used and, although they are statistically powerful, one can simply use many more SNPs.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about bone and what can happen if one cannot retrieve the petrous bone.  The petrous bone is so called because it is the densest bone in the body.  It will probably be one of the last bones to start dissolving as bone matter.  If one cannot find the petrous bone, people have, for instance, used teeth.  There are other tissues that can be interrogated for the presence of DNA.</p> <p>  I do not think we would be able to identify every body.  There is no guarantee, of course, but the best chance is with SNP analysis.  People have been able to get DNA from the petrous bone from 30,000-year-old newborns.  The best chance is getting the petrous bone and running an SNP analysis.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

I thank Ms Corrigan for her earlier answer.  I totally understand her concerns and the fact that it is so important that survivors and families are informed and that we work with them.  That will be very important going forward.</p> <p>  There are 22 recommendations in the report of the commission.  In the context of the latter, the Minister indicated that there will be information and access going forward.  It is crucial that Ms Corrigan gets the information she is seeking and is not fobbed off while trying to get answers.  I am aware there have been issues with accessing records.  We need to work together.  I understand that we have to get this legislation right.  The matter of timing and how quickly we can do it is so important.  I totally understand that information and access will be so important.</p> <p>  Dr. McCullagh expanded on the efforts and technologies that can be used.  I ask her to clarify how it will be possible to identify every baby at Tuam, for example.  It worries me that she is kind of saying that might not be possible.  From the point of view of survivors, with whom I have worked, it is important that we all do our best.  I do not know how long this will take.  What is Dr. McCullagh's plan?  What advice does she have for the committee on what we could do to help survivors to access their information far more quickly?  There is also the issue relating to DNA and all that.</p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses.  We have listened to many survivors and other witnesses today.  It has been hard on everyone.   It is important that we listen to everyone, especially the survivors, because that is the road forward.  The legislation must be right for everyone.</p></speech>

In the executive summaries of our excavation reports that were recently made available through the fifth interim report, we state that the site at Tuam specifically was put in a temporary holding situation whereby it would need attention immediately.  We put a timeframe of less than six months on the kind of protection mechanisms we had put in place, essentially stating that the site needed to be dealt with as soon as possible.  That was four years ago.  I know everybody wants this to be done very quickly, but the speed with which one can proceed to the next stage will also impact on the recovery mechanisms.  The chambers at Tuam have essentially been breached and, as such, have been introduced to a new environment.  We do not know what impact that will have.  We can only assume that the remains will degrade as time moves on.  That is a fact we must face.  Of course, as the experts have stated here, DNA is recoverable from many scenarios and massive historic timeframes but the difference in the context of the situation at Tuam is that there are mixed skeletal infant remains that are subject to the water table and fluctuations in water and are being separated from their individual articulation.  That is the fact of the matter.  It is a fact with which we can deal but we need to have the proper structures in place in order to deal with it appropriately and give the remains the best possible chance of individualisation and, it is to be hoped, identification down the road.</p></speech>

My questions are for Dr. Donoghue or Professor Carlsson, whoever is more appropriate.</p><p>This is probably the area that I understand least because of its technical nature.  I have some very direct questions on the technology.  The submission states the proposed high-throughput sequencing, HTS, coupled with single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP, analysis, allows for a greater likelihood of identification of degraded DNA.  In what way does the standard short tandem repeat, STR, technology that is currently used by the Irish national DNA database prove to be less effective in identifying and investigating the DNA?</p></speech>

There is no question but that the site at Tuam is very challenging.  There will be quite a lot of degradation.  One can think of SNP analysis as a way of garnering more data.  There is a better chance of identifying potential relatives because more data can be garnered.  Dr. Carlsson will talk a little more about degradation and why SNP is better than STR.</p></speech>

After death, stretches of DNA become increasingly short and eventually become too short to use STR.  The STRs would simply not work.</p></speech>

There might be just a few cases where STRs could be got to work and many more where SNPs could work.  Therefore, there would be two different types of databases.</p></speech>

What we did with Thomas Kent went one step further.  He was an uncle of the two living relatives whose DNA was used for comparison.

It is mentioned in this Bill.  It is a standard enough practice.  It is really based on statistics where there is not an exact match and one is looking for a best-fit match in terms of the number of hits with regard to the profile.  It is a standard enough practice, if there is not an exact match, to look for a familial match.  There have been many famous such cases in the United States.  The Senator might have heard of gruesome serial murderers who have been caught using familial profiling whereby the authorities compare with sons or relatives.  It is usually a first-order relative who is required for that kind of STR profiling.</p></speech>

It is good to see her although it is only virtual.  I hope we will get to see each other soon enough.  I thank her for her patience with me in answering all the questions I have been asking her over the years on this.</p><p>I know the dedication Ms Corrigan has given in her quest for truth and justice for all survivors and victims in Tuam.</p><p> I will ask all my questions together.  I want to pick up where Ms Corrigan left off earlier.  I am interested in this.  Ms Corrigan mentioned she heard by press release in March 2017 of the finding of young remains in Tuam.  What should have happened at that stage following the finding of remains of more than 700 bodies in Tuam?</p><p> My second question is to Mr. Buckley as I have had some questions back and forth with him.  What does he believe the legislation should focus on?  It seems to be somewhat unclear on the basis of the answers given.</p><p> My final question is to Dr. McCullagh.  Can a criminal investigation be triggered in the Bill?  Dr. McCullagh mentioned in her opening statement that the forensic approach will lead to the truth on who these babies were, how they lived and how they died.  The focus seems to be on DNA identification.  I have only a layman's understanding but I gather DNA will not tell us whether any potential criminal acts occurred in respect of how these people died, as was mentioned.  Moreover, Dr. McCullagh said we would require forensic anthropology and osteology for that.  Will Dr. McCullagh comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.619" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna Corrigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#MMMM00200"><p>I will start on the finding of the remains.  I would prefer to roll back before I go forward.  I was listening to Dr. McCullagh.  I realise I cannot ask direct questions.  I am at a loss as to how the remains were taken out of these small openings in the chambers.  Remains were taken out and sent for carbon dating.  They were also sent for the possibility of DNA examination.  I have tried to ascertain where these remains lie and have come up against a blank wall.  Forensic Science Ireland has said it did not receive them.  I got this information under freedom of information, FOI, legislation.  I am at a loss as to where they lie now.  Are they in the jurisdiction of the coroner?  That was the last I read of it in the FOI documentation but I could not get a direct answer.  Are the samples degrading?  How are they being held?  Why did the excavation stop mid-stream?  The opening up of these chambers may have caused more damage.  I do not really understand it.  Maybe the parts taken out belong to family members of those of us in the group or my brothers.</p> <p>  Reference has been made to individualisation with the remains.  I believe identification is more important.  That is where I would lean more in the sense of the collection of the DNA.  Mr. Geoffrey Shannon completed a report on this.  It is so important.  I am not referring to DNA from survivors but from family members, because survivors have a different set of needs and wants.  I am referring to taking DNA from family members and from the petrous part of the bone and the urgency of using SNP analysis.  I know STR analysis is tied into Forensic Science Ireland and criminal cases.  Yet, it was stated in the report that Tuam was unprecedented.  If it is unprecedented and if there is no evidence of criminality or involvement of the Garda, they why not use SNP analysis?  Why not go down that road?  DNA is so important to us with regard to these remains.  We cannot fully believe that every death certificate is the genuine article.  It has been stated by Fergus Finlay of Barnardos that there was possible interference with birth and death certificates.  That was in a newspaper article.  There has been considerable anecdotal evidence and it was mentioned around Bessborough in another newspaper article.  Can we be assured?  There is an urgency here as well.  As Dr. McCullagh said, the bodies are degenerating and the water table is fluctuating.  SNP analysis is the way forward because there is no tie to criminality.</p><p>There is something else I query.  When this information was released from the commission, it handed the site back to Galway County Council.  It was covered over again and it put grass seed on it, and now a law is needed to reopen it.  I find that crazy.  Tuam was taken away from the commission but nothing leaves the commission until the commission is over.  Then it was handed over to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for part 2 where Dr. McCullagh and her colleagues were re-employed by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, after having been on the initial excavation, making the initial find.  There are Chinese walls, they cannot speak about what happened under the commission because that is covered by the commissions Act, then the Minister, Deputy Zappone, presents that there are bodies that she has found - what should she do with them?<br/><br/>We have <i>locus standi </i>here.  There has been a lot of talk today about whether people come forward.  Our family members' names are lodged with our legal team so we have <i>locus standi.  </i>I have two police inquiries myself.<br/><br/>An element of trust comes in.  Where are the bones?  How are the bones taken out?  The DNA is very important to us.  Are they dead?  It even goes down to Ms Toni Maguire who came down from Northern Ireland.  She was involved in the exhumations around the cill&iacute;n&iacute;.  She said, as Dr. Donoghue and Dr. Carlsson did, that even a tooth would do.  That is where I stand on the remains.  We do not know where they are.  There could be parts of my brother.  We need immediate identification for DNA.  Individualisation can come later because, as the report stated, the bodies are commingled.  Dr. Carlsson spoke of how they extracted DNA from the petrous bone.  One body, if we have one skull, if we can access the petrous, if we can use the SNP the rest will follow.  We need answers to know if they there.  Are they dead?  That is the first question and then we will decide where we go from there.  We may agree as a family to move them over to the Tuam graveyard for proper interment once it has been determined that they are actually dead.  We know as adults that a lot of time has passed.  Sad as it is, we will not receive the full body remains for reinterment with family but time is passing and we are all getting older and our main issue is that our human rights are vindicated around the right to know what happened to our families.  Mr. Buckley will talk about how much our rights have been trounced on.  I am sorry if I am a little all over the place but there is so much involved in this and it is not just what members read in the newspapers.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.621" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Carl Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021041400002#NNNN00200"><p>I am very conscious of time so I will try to be quick.  I do not want to be quick or brief, but I must be, given the constraints.  An earlier comment put it quite clearly: there is no trust in the State.  All these individuals who remain in the various fields, pits and septic tanks, every one of them has been failed by the State.  Those who survived have been failed by the State.  There needs to be a process by which the trust is built.  It is for that reason I say that this legislation is not actually required at all.  What needs to be done is the coroners system needs to be funded and developed appropriately to deal with this.  That way, one can guarantee an independent investigation into every single issue.  It is a significant concern why the corner and the authority of the coroner has been explicitly removed in this Act.  That goes no way to establish or build trust in the State, in fact, it exacerbates the position further.  Every single victim, as Dr. O'Rourke said this morning, is entitled to an Article 2 compliant inquest as far as these issues are concerned.  This legislation, in its current state, will not allow that to be done.  It needs to be given back to the coroner, that way one removes any sense of political influence.</p><p>I am not suggesting there will be political influence, but on a strict reading of this legislation, there is clear room for it because all the major decisions are made by Ministers.  As I said right at the outset, that is wholly inappropriate as this should be a victim-led process, not a Minister-led process.  It is for that reason I say we dispense with the legislation entirely and we resource the coroner properly to enable appropriate investigations to be undertaken, because with this legislation, Ireland is not discharging its obligations under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is not discharging its obligations under various UN treaties it is a state party to, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Unless significant reform, or removal completely, is undertaken, those obligations will not be adhered to.  The UN has already commented a number of years ago as far as the Magdalen laundries investigations were concerned and found fault in what happened thereafter.  This is an ideal opportunity to put right the wrongs of history.</p></speech>

So, it is designed for situations where there is not a specific criminal investigation under way but that the evidence collected to that point can be used for a criminal investigation, and it will be accepted in a court of law, including the Coroner's Court.</p> <p>  In terms of what Ms Corrigan said, I am wholly in agreement with her.  Time is absolutely of the essence here.  I am a forensic archaeologist.  I am not an historical archaeologist, so this is moving into history and forensic means modern and action is required as soon as possible.  As members well know, not everything one reads in the media is true.  Certainly it was portrayed that we are against the application of DNA, for some reason, which is absolutely not the case.  The point we are trying to make is we need to go back a step further and ensure there are processes in place that allow the best possible opportunity for these individuals to be recovered, and reburied or returned to their families in as complete a state as possible.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Corrigan for her heartfelt presentation, and she is so right to be frustrated.  It is an absolute disgrace what we have done to families, babies and women throughout this country.  I think it was Mr. Buckley who made a valid point that we are doing this in a piecemeal fashion.  I do not think a truth and reconciliation process can be written into this legislation but it needs to be considered now, and the steps towards it, following the commission's report.  It shows how the commission has failed to deliver answers and how now, through this legislation, we are here trying to find the answers.  Possibly, this legislation is not the legislation to find all those answers and make sure we have truth and reconciliation.  I am speaking out of frustration that we are still here, still at the point where we have babies in a septic tank in Tuam and we do not have a clear path forward at the minute on how we look after them.</p> <p>  I have a question for Dr. McCullagh, and her contribution was fascinating.  On the reliability and limitations of forensic archaeological investigations on remains that may date to prior to 1940 or 1950, how reliable are they for Dr. McCullagh's analysis of the story of those bones or remains, when and if there is an excavation and examination?  I am just wondering about that reliability when it comes to very historical remains.</p><p>That is an excellent question and it has a good answer in that they are absolutely reliable.  Forensic anthropological analysis and osteoarchaeological analysis can contribute significantly to the understanding of the life of an individual.  Issues with degradation would have an impact.  If the ends of the bones have degraded a lot, it may be difficult to get the exact length.  Degradation may impact technical matters such as that.  If we are looking at remains from the 1940s, depending on the context in which they have been found, one would expect to be able to get some good results from morphological analysis of those.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we need to remove all of the ambiguity and all of the loopholes within that legislation that enable an exhumation or excavation to be stopped or prevented because it is replete throughout with options to do that.  In doing that, we remove the potential for political interference, which will add to the trust and enable trust to be built.  People have to have confidence that this is a genuine and independent investigation.  I refer back to Article 2 of the convention.  Any form of investigation as far as a death is concerned must be independent to satisfy Article 2.  It has to be effective, prompt and transparent.  The legislation currently does not satisfy any of those five elements.  Rather than trying to amend the legislation, if we insist that this legislation is required, notwithstanding what I have previously said, then we should go right back to the beginning and determine and decide what it is that we want this legislation to do and draft it appropriately, taking into account what we want it to do, but also having regard to Article 2 of the convention and the lack of trust among the community and the State.  If we start again and ensure that everybody's interests and obligations are satisfied and considered, then we will go some way towards that point.</p></speech>

I think there is great value in having that distinct and separate from the coroner.  However, I accept the points from earlier today that we need to look at the powers within that agency.</p> <p>  Heads 31 and 32 of the Bill provide for a cessation of the actions of the agency on the ground and refer to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is scope, that can perhaps be emboldened and enhanced, to trigger criminal investigation and the involvement of the garda&iacute; and have that external agency.</p><p>That has been missed in the commentary that has been put forward during this session.</p><p> I am curious about one issue.  I have had the experience of conducting and being involved in a development where human remains were uncovered unexpectedly on a large scale.  In that case we had on site particular forensic archaeologists.  A team came in for six months to work and to establish age and so on in respect of the remains, which went back a couple of centuries in some instances.  As for this agency, what people and particular professions should be on the ground?  I would like to explore with Mr. Harte the role of forensic archaeologists in that context.</p></speech>

A lot of what are considered traditional archeological skills are transferable into those teams.  The instance Senator Seery Kearney is talking about would come under the National Monuments Acts.  That is a tried and tested mechanism or procedure that has existed in the State since the 1930s.  One uses that experience alongside the other professionals coming from the more forensic sphere.  That multidisciplinary team would then essentially carry out the forensic excavation or recovery.</p></speech>

There is no objection in principle to any exhumation or excavation being stopped if it is to be passed over to the Garda.  We need to acknowledge, however, that that in itself creates potential problems because if the site is handed over, once that exhumation or excavation has already commenced it will potentially have contaminated the site from the point of view of a criminal investigation.  There should be an acknowledgement that every single site is potentially a scene of a potential crime.  That is the way it should be approached in the first instance, and I expand on this in much more detail in my submission.  If we treat each site as a potential crime scene from the outset, it ensures that the strict procedures for evidence collation and searching will be adhered to automatically instead of this potentially being an afterthought.  There is therefore potential for the legislation in its current form to prejudice any criminal investigation that might be required thereafter.  By way of example, the legislation in its current form provides focus on employees of the agency being empowered to extract DNA.  There is no mention of any other specialist, and I referred specifically to forensic anthropologists, although, again, I accept that there are agencies empowered within that legislation to hire consultants or specialists where needed.</p><p>However, there is a risk that, without the necessary qualifications and experience, the requisite expertise to conclude that there have been violent or unnatural circumstances insofar as a death is concerned will be missing, as it may simply be a case of taking DNA from skeletal remains.  As much as there is scope within the legislation to make a handover for the purposes of criminal investigation, I suggest that we should be considering a criminal investigation first rather than it being an afterthought.  If we take Tuam on its own, how can 700 babies be anything other than a potential crime scene?  Therefore, we are approaching this matter from the wrong angle immediately.</p></speech>

I have two open police inquiries.  One of my brothers is a stated missing person, having been reported as such to the Garda since 2013.  He is marked as dead in the home's ledgers but has no death certificate.  There is no medical certification of death and no reason for his death is given.  In fact, none of the children has a medical certification of death.  My other brother is another open case.  Both of their cases are in Tuam.  His case was reported to my local garda&iacute; in 2014.  Given the evidence that I have, I contend that he did not die of measles, but of neglect and malnutrition, because he deteriorated from being normal and healthy to emaciated with a voracious appetite at 13 months.</p> <p>  Where will the Bill leave me in terms of agencies and criminality?  I am a citizen of the State who is looking for my rights under the laws of the land.  As such, the Bill has to be applicable to these two open police cases.  It just so happens to be that the two children in question were victims of the Tuam home, which fell under the remit of the commission.  When I applied to seek my rights as a citizen, I was blocked and told by the Garda that it was dealing with the commission.  I told garda&iacute; that I was not dealing with the commission and that I was a citizen of this State.  I sought three exhumation licences for my brothers, but I was refused on all counts.</p> <p>  It puts me in a strange place.  The Garda has failed to act.  It was a criminal site.  Independent people came in, excavated it and exhumed bones.</p><p>Parts of my brothers possibly lie somewhere in somebody's filing cabinet.  I do not know where they are because nobody has reported back.  The Garda cannot follow through because it is deferring to the commission.  Again, has the site been contaminated if there is to be investigation of possible criminality?  It is just a conundrum I am kind of caught in.  I did not really get an answer on how the bones were originally taken for carbon dating and whether DNA was extracted.</p><p> There was mention of a liaison.  I have reported a missing person and I am entitled to a Garda liaison officer but I have not been appointed one.  Neither has anybody in our group.  Everything happening around all of this is a blatant trampling of our human rights in the same vein as what happened to our families.  We have never been afforded any acknowledgement of them, despite the report written by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon on our human rights.</p></speech>

The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to that person's or entity's good name.</p> <p>  Mr. McCann has come form the same county as me.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to present this effort on which we have worked over some months.  It is offered on the basis of being of assistance to various pieces of work currently taking place in trying to organise our island and how we live together.</p> <p>  Given the disturbing events of recent weeks in Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland, it is necessary to take some pause and reflect again on where we all are.  Some consideration was given by us to assessing whether this low-key event in the public sphere is helpful at this moment.  We consider it adds to the imminent relevance of the document we call the Proposal.  We hope and consider that the conciliatory approach shows the relevance, which is even more acutely demonstrated by the continuing tensions in our beautiful island and, in particular, in its magnificent North. Throughout the course of this long journey to peace there have been many courageous initiatory events, not least the acceptance of the Good Friday Agreement itself.  We suggest that Ireland North and South yearns to complete the steps to establish an enduring peace for generations to come.</p><p> I will quickly mention a story told about Mikhail Gorbachev, which some people may have heard before.  At the end of the communist era in Czechoslovakia, when there were mass public demonstrations in public spaces, the then communist government sent to Moscow for help.  Gorbachev arrived and as he was approaching the state buildings, he went to the crowd gathered there and simply told them that he was with them.  That was effectively game over for the communists in the Czech Republic, or Czechoslovakia as it then was.  V&aacute;clav Havel was still in jail at that time.  In telling that story, I am saying that events of this kind have been brought about in Ireland by many people who have brought us to a point where we have a degree of settlement and peace.  What we yearn for now is for this process to be brought to a conclusion.</p><p> If I may speak very directly to members, person to person, our political culture does not readily embrace the word "love", yet that human, and at times superhuman, quality that is love is not only potent in itself but is also the antidote to fear and anger, and it is the pathway to wisdom.  Its close ally and progeny, "forgiveness", is a challenge to anyone.  Still, it has the active force to move an individual, a community and society.  I include each of us personally in this.  Forgiveness has the force to move us from hurt, grief and past injustices, not necessarily immediately but over time.  Gandhi knew this.  It was characterised in his language by the word "Satyagraha".  He was the person who uniquely in our history has characterised the demonstration of love in the political and public sphere.  </p><p> It is in that spirit that we have the humble pleasure of presenting our proposal.  It is not the Gorbachev moment in all of this but it can lead to it or some event or series of events that can lead to a serious settlement of all our major differences on the island.  The invitation we make in our proposal is to negotiate immediately with representatives of the unionist community and all those who call themselves Protestant, unionist and-or loyalist, PUL.  This is our oar in the water of the ship of our collective destiny.  Sometimes the practice of love is manifest in the form of delicate diplomacy.  It is precisely this approach that we now advocate in this conversation and the actual text of the proposal, which I am assuming the committee members have read or will read in full.  It is not unduly long but it is fairly concentrated and with sufficient detail to represent an entire proposal.  I ask members to approach it with an open mind and a discerning heart.</p><p>  The central recommendation of our proposal is the obvious one of inviting talks, as I have suggested, with members of all sectors of the unionist community, including those who are former members of paramilitary organisations and those still associated with such organisations or who have been in the past.  It is for elected authorities in governance to do this or for emissaries to be sent on their behalf.  Those of us in the voluntary sector, and there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of us, will assist wherever possible in fostering an atmosphere of reconciliation.  The intervention of community workers and adults in Lanark Way on Wednesday night and Thursday night last week to persuade many of the younger rioters to desist and go home is one of the encouraging features of the past fortnight.  I am told that adults formed a human chain on the Springfield Road which had practical effect and obvious potent symbolism.  Still, we have no choice but to remain vigilant and encourage reconciliation, as I am sure members will all agree.</p><p> The conciliatory approach, while being the essence of our proposal, is not its inspiration, however.  The inspiration is the realisation that the creation of an entirely new state is not only feasible but provides the best possible approach to the future of relations and administration on this beautiful, enchanting island where we are fortunate to reside and bide some or all of our short enough terms of years.</p><p>One version of this proposal for a new nation and a new state has, as the committee will know, been presented by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan lately.  It is also the guardian and guarantor of the identity and the participation of those of the unionist tradition, which will be copper-fastened by the role of a new body with international input and guidance in which the particular position on heritage and identity and heritage of unionist folk, with their British identity, can be virulently represented and defended into the future.  I have developed an increasing personal empathy for the unionist family's whole position, as I long for the coming together for everyone in and on our island, embracing the entire history and all versions of it, referencing all of our mythology and above all celebrating the possibilities of a shared future on a shared island, however we may be governed.<br/><br/>Our present situation seems well characterised by two brief commentaries on the current situation.  The first from is from Mr. Mick Fealty, who many members will be familiar with from the Slugger O'Toole website.  I have a quotation from him and from Professor Timothy Snyder of the department of history at Yale University.  Mr. Fealty observes &quot;Whether it&rsquo;s unionism or nationalism doing it, <i>disruption </i>does not represent control any more than it represents a destiny.&quot;  Quoting Professor Snyder he states:</p><blockquote>	the whole notion of disruption is adolescent.  It assumes that after the teenagers make a mess the adults will come and clean it up.  But there are no adults.  We own this mess. </blockquote><p>The second commentary I will refer to, again fairly quickly, is deeply poignant in the present atmosphere.  It has personal resonance, as I had an internship with the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>.  It was the closest I ever got to being interned.  I suppose it is all right to attract a bit of humour to the past though I know internment was not a funny thing in any sense.  During my year of journalism training in 2012 I met the author of the piece I am referring to, Ms Gail Walker.  She has since been editor of the paper for five years and is now editor at large.  The following appeared in a strong opinion article in last Saturday's edition.  In it, Ms Walker does not offer an exploration of a new nation or any other engagement with the South.  There are no presumed outcomes and that is the risk we all take in setting out on a new road; there is give and receive, receive and give and all of us are changed, sometimes changed utterly.  The challenge initially is to explore all the destinations, bearing in mind that Scotland&rsquo;s position and the capacity of the UK to survive its departure is clearly under question as we await the census results - it has already been taken - and another imminent political poll from the Lucid poll agency which will be made available next Tuesday.  I am very touched by what Ms Walker wrote when she stated:</p><blockquote>	Being a unionist isn't easy in a place where people are constantly being told it's a numbers game and the egg-timer of history is running out.  When people think they're being defeated, they get scared, and they get angry. ...<br /><br />People here are easily wound up.  Sectarianism is rife.  Bigotry surfaces quickly.  Social media has brought us a whole new riot experience  the first Twitter Translink Bus Burning with drone footage. ...<br /><br />The past few days have reminded most people what really matters.  They want peace and to get on with their lives.  They want to live in a normal place where no one is above the law.<br /><br />There is an opportunity right now for leadership to occur, from within the main unionist blocs.  It remains to be seen if there is any individual with sufficient ambition or vision to say the few important sentences which would transform the unionist future.<br /><br />It's about owning the future, not harking back to old grievances or using old methods to highlight them. ...<br /><br />We have learned to hang together and not hang separately.  Everybody here should be able to have a good standard of living.  Most people would rather have this place work than not work.<br /><br />It's time for unionism to start talking about that on every street corner.  And that means in every part of west Belfast and all over the island and in London. </blockquote><p>Members who wish to read the full article will find a link in my opening statement.  Ms Walker does not offer an exploration of a new nation or any specific engagement with the South.  If anything, she probably wants things to remain as they are constitutionally.  However, the key, the moment of silence is that also implicit in what she says is that things cannot remain as they are constitutionally.  That cannot be the future.  There are no presumed outcomes.  We can explore the destinations, all of them, evaluate them together and then perhaps negotiate.</p><p>There is no event in family, business, club or public structure situations in any aspect of life - national, international or local community - whether it is conducting a law case, as I have done for many years, where there is a situation of difference, let alone outside division, in which one would not want to go and talk to the other person or group, sound them out and arrange a mediator, intermediary or go-between.  Please do not ask why we would do such a thing.  I ask, from a heartfelt concern for all the people on this island, for their present and future, and mindful of the past, why would we not speak to each other, all of us, and soon?  To quote my late father's well-used exhortation, "Get on with it".</p><p> I thank the committee for hearing this introductory statement.  Mr. Quinn and Ms Diver have some words to contribute.  I understand that is the normal procedure from what the committee has done previously.</p></speech>

It has been said that the largest political party in Northern Ireland is the non-voter.  There is a risk that the health and vitality of a democracy will decline as engagement declines.  Nowadays, there appears to be little likelihood of a positive inertia, that we can sit still safely with the <i>status quo</i>.  We will move in one direction or another, but we will move.  We will live with each other; our society will evolve for better or worse, locally, nationally or globally.  We are learning, however, that democracy is not just about elections and voting, it is about engagement and partnership - the dealing with.  Covid-19 has displayed the need for community engagement in the most practical of ways and, better still, it has shown the appetite there is for this engagement and the creativity it has engendered.  Apathy might be more of a myth than we expect.<br/><br/>Building engagement requires good infrastructure - trusting, respectful spaces for listening, learning and creative deliberation that in turn leads to concrete outcome.  Openness to the unexpected in terms of the options for those outcomes and from where those ideas might come is all part of the journey.  Most good things take time and patience.  The need for concrete outcomes that people see are addressing their concerns and aspirations, indeed, which help them to articulate and work through what these core concerns and aspirations mean, is essential.  We have tools to help with this.  Indeed, we have used some to a greater or lesser extent.  I will refer to just two.<br/><br/>Ireland is a leader in the use of citizens' assemblies.  We see the benefit derived from these processes for what were highly sensitive, even intractable, issues.  In Northern Ireland, in the community voluntary sector, we have one assembly on how to make social care for the elderly fit for purpose.  The reports from this were very supportive of the process.<br/><br/>Participatory budgeting, PB, is another tool.  This is not new to Ireland.  South Dublin County Council is one of several councils that run PB processes, I believe to the value of &euro;300,000.  In Northern Ireland, PB is also gaining momentum, but it is at the grant-making end of the spectrum.  We are endeavouring to move our processes towards the mainstreaming of PB, where the priorities of government programmes are shaped and voted upon by the citizens they impact.</p><p>We also have some structures that may evolve to support these activities.  In the Republic, there are the public participation networks, PPNs, of local government, and in the North, for example, we have our community planning partnerships.  I cannot speak to the PPNs but our community planning partnerships have quite some way to go to really engage citizens in a meaningful and decisive role.  Perhaps the limited role of our local government in the North may also be an impairment to this.  At the Executive and Assembly levels, there is a void at level of a civic forum.<br/><br/>All of this is an attempt to speak to a need for formal express channels for citizens to participate, where agency, and thus confidence, is built in ourselves and in each other, where what is sensitive and intricate may be discussed and deliberated upon respectfully and constructively.  I think we actually have glimpsed some of this.  This empowerment has been shown to support the understanding and trust between citizens and between citizens and their representatives.  We had the 2008 crash and its outworkings.  We now have Covid-19 and what may be the unforeseen consequences, and we have, of course, the challenges of climate breakdown.  None of these have respected any borders.  They have perhaps emphasised the need for our doing with each other in new and even surprising ways.  If such doing with at all levels engenders engagement, creativity and partnership, we might even find the journey to be ultimately affirming the best in each of us.<br/><br/>I will end by quoting Inez McCormack:</p><blockquote>	To enable the powerless to be part of making change.  That changes how they see themselves.  And that changes everything. </blockquote></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.675" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Quinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021041400002#H00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to address them.  I would like to focus on the cultural aspect of the proposal.  One of the most vital areas where gaps can be bridged and broken paths mended is recognising and reflecting all cultural differences and allowing the arts to perform a strong healing role in this process.</p> <p>  Culture plays a significant role in the moulding of who we are as individuals and, to a large extent, our world and local view.  Probably more urgent than ever before is John Hume's call for people to unite.  The words "diversity and inclusion" are often explained by the same definition.  Still, there are different steps to achieving a diverse and inclusive community.  Cultural diversity refers to the make-up of people of varying ethnicities, religions and cultures.  Cultural inclusivity, however, means to ensure people are seen, heard and valued, and this is what we need to do, with a good helping of respect.</p><p>One of the most fundamental tenets of inclusivity in the community should be genuine openness and equality.  While there is a risk of minority groups being marginalised, it is through transparent communication that we can bridge these gaps.  Respecting each other's cultural differences means being conscious of unique social behaviours and norms.  It is about being aware of the important customs and beliefs of members of one's community who are of cultures different from one's own, and recognising that culture.  It is more about ethnicity and understanding the rich histories that have defined the different ways of life for the people.</p><p> Art and the arts are a way to work this into the very fabric of what we are discussing.  There is nothing new about this.  It has been implemented across the island.  However, it can be honed and expanded upon until it starts to make a difference to the collective, rather than just to isolated pockets.  While cultural tolerance is the first step to inclusivity, having acceptance would be bringing things to a deeper level.  Embracing different beliefs and customs may mean educating oneself on the cultural characteristics, history, values, systems and traditions of another ethnic or cultural group.  This, done gently, can have an astounding result.</p><p> Art and culture can build community.  Art has the beauty and the property of binding.  Culture generates social capital and strengthens the character of communities.  Art brings people together physically at galleries, museums and performance spaces, as well as culturally through its capacity to tell a community shared story, inspire reflection and, crucially, form connections that transcend differences.  The communities in question require something to bring them together as one unified society.  The arts have the ability to help people identify with one another and begin to understand our differences and accept them truly.</p><p> It is possible to introduce more art into these social environments, which could start to shift the feeling of separation into sentiments of acceptance.  I think it can.  Art can be beneficial in many different ways.  A study done by neurologists in Germany proved that creating art can actually improve the functional connectivity inside the brain and increase psychological resilience.  Both being involved in and observing the arts can create healthier and happier beings and this can be helpful for everyone involved as a happier person is more likely to be more friendly and inclusive.  Most people have been personally moved by a piece of art, whether it was a song, a poem or a drawing.  This is typically combined with a mental experience to which we feel deeply connected.  This does not have to be experienced as a single or solitary event.  Luckily, art is one of the few things that can be truly shared and valued as a group.  This can be done with people from all walks of life coming together to create one amalgam of all their ideas, creativity and intuition.</p><p> To create a strong connection between humans, we have many different options.  We can paint murals in towns, as has been done, or start music programmes, art projects and more.  The more art a community has, the higher the cultural identity and diversity it will have.  It can help to reduce crime rates and increase and build social networks.  There are limitless benefits to the addition of the arts in any community.</p><p> Anyone can create art and no experience is necessary in order to participate.  It is an outlet for anyone and everyone to participate, regardless of skill, technique or background.  Everyone can take their turn in creating something.  In an increasingly distant society with gaps that desperately need to be bridged, we need to value the activities that can truly bring us back together.  If it is possible to unify a community with something as accessible as art, then it should be a priority to use that in any way we can.  The longer it takes, the harder it will be to find common ground to reunite us.  We must take advantage of the resources we have.   The best way to start any of this would be with the children because if they get it right, the rest will naturally follow.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Their approach is quite light and refreshing.</p><p>I am really interested in the witnesses' whole approach.  I like it.  With regard to the way we all need to start looking at the whole approach to Northern Ireland and its difficulties, if one thinks back to the Good Friday Agreement, there were many community and political leaders involved in the years leading up to the agreement.  Some of those are no longer with us.  I am sure many would think of David Ervine and many other community leaders who helped to bring about and establish the Good Friday Agreement. I was on a talk show recently and the presenter referenced the fact that we do not have such leaders at the moment.  That poses a difficulty but, with regard to the work the witnesses have presented to us this morning, there is a lot more work they can do outside of the political sphere.  Through engagement with communities, the approach they are taking will go a long way towards inspiring community and political leaders across Northern Ireland.  I see them as a very important part of the work that must be done to get to the point that Mr. McCann talked about and to complete the steps to establish an enduring peace for generations to come. <br/><br/>The obvious stumbling block at the moment is Covid.  We cannot establish talks so the quicker we get all of this out of the way, the better.  It is a real stumbling block, particularly from the perspective of a representative at my level.  I want to get in there and engage but I am not being invited to do so.  That engagement is necessary if we are to move on.  Even from the point of view of this committee, the unionist parties in Northern Ireland are not represented.  That is basic work on which we need to get started.  There are things like this that we need to do before we even get to the point of getting those elements of the Good Friday Agreement that have not yet been established up and running, such as the North-South institutions.  At a minimum, we need that unionist engagement at our level to make sure we bring everybody with us.<br/><br/>There is nothing in the main elements of the presentation with which I disagree.  I would love to work with Mr. McCann, Ms Diver and Mr. Quinn in the future.  Their work will be a really important element as we move forward.  Some things about which they talked are planned but we are precluded from doing much about them at the moment.  I would welcome talks with unionist communities in Northern Ireland.  There are several organisations across these islands, peace institutes.  There is one in Glencree and there are some in Northern Ireland as well.  They would love to do a lot more than they are doing but are also precluded from doing so.<br/><br/>I found some of the points Ms Diver made with regard to citizens' assemblies and building engagement very interesting.  Building engagement requires good infrastructure. That is a smart and refreshing approach which will not be seen as political.  Ms Diver's approach is really good and I would love to see her much more involved in presenting that approach to communities across Northern Ireland on whatever platform is available to her when Covid is out of the way.  It is very important that she does so.<br/><br/>I believe I have covered the main parts.  Mr. McCann mentioned and quoted Mick Fealty of the website <i>sluggerotoole.com</i>.  He has good Donegal blood in him.  He comes from the same parish as I do, or his mum did at least.  Mr. McCann had several good quotes from him.  My general response today is that I like the witnesses' approach and that I would like this committee to work with them much more in the future.  I thank them for their presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.680" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1556" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021041400002#L00100"><p>Like my colleague, Senator Blaney, I welcome the presentations by Mr. McCann, Ms Diver and Mr. Quinn.  They presented very interesting thoughts and proposals.  Does the witnesses' group have members from both communities?  It is unfortunate that in the presentation Mr. McCann had to refer to the events of the last week.  We all hoped that was something we had left behind and that kind of activity and disturbance in communities had been consigned to history.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Some very good articles have been written in the days since those disturbances, including by Deirdre Heenan and Joe Brolly.  They gave comprehensive analysis of some of the underlying causes and factors contributing to the violence, be it educational underachievement, poverty, deprivation or lack of political representation.  I am sure there is a mix of all those factors.  I fully understand that the issue is more complex than listing off a few factors but those are the issues we want to address.</p> <p>  Members of the committee have visited Belfast, Derry and other parts of Northern Ireland and, as we have discussed in the committee previously, I always found those visits to be the most productive from the point of view of informing us and engaging with people.  As a committee, we have to get back to meeting communities and their representatives and hearing their concerns at first hand.  As Senator Blaney and Ms Diver said, it is important that there is a focus on community endeavour and getting the best out of communities.</p> <p>  Ms Diver mentioned local government.  Unfortunately, local government has been destroyed in this State.  In Northern Ireland, there was a major rationalisation some years ago which led to huge local government districts.  My neighbouring council area is Fermanagh and Omagh District Council.  We lost town councils here and we have reduced numbers on the more rural county councils.  I think that was a big mistake.  There is nothing to beat having good representation and strong local representatives representing their communities and being very tuned in to what is or is not happening in communities.  From the point of view of having more public representatives alongside the public participation networks, PPNs, those non-elected groups will never substitute for elected personnel in delivering services and meeting the needs and concerns of local communities.</p> <p>  One point we might engage on further is strengthening local government.  Where there are substantial numbers of elected members on local councils, minority groups have an opportunity to gain seats through the proportional representation system.  It is important in that respect to have six-seat or seven-seat local district councils as it provides an opportunity to have people of different political groupings represented.  </p> <p>  It is important we do not take the focus away from elected representatives in meeting the many challenges that face our island as we go forward.  There can and must be such partnership but the focus must remain on elected representatives delivering on the mandate they have been given.  The mandate of every politician on this island is to implement the Good Friday Agreement.  That mandate was given to us through the referendum in May 1998.  Unfortunately, the potential of the agreement and its workings are not being maximised.  I suggest that we would not have had the recent violence and disturbances if we had maximised the potential of the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses' comments today.  They are positive and concern what we can do to shape the shared island and, I hope, a united Ireland in future, which I aspire to.  If one community makes progress in advocating for its aspirations, it should never be at the expense of the other community or mean that one community loses while the other gains.  There is a lot of work to be done by voices such as those of the witnesses.  I know from Mr. McCann's work and that of others in Belfast over the years that he reaches out to different communities, particularly to those that are less advantaged.  It is very important in the current context that work is focused on those areas as well.</p><p>It is very nice to see the witnesses and I thank them for their presentation today.  There is a growing desire to talk about constitutional change and to put it on the political agenda.  Any constructive proposals should be encouraged and considered.  I thank the witnesses for their work in this regard.  We have had a tendency over the last number of years to not talk about constitutional change.  I believe that we must facilitate being able to do that in a non-judgmental and respectful way.<br/><br/>The Proposal Initiative document states that: &quot;It has sometimes been assumed that an entirely new state was either unworkable, undesirable or both.&quot;  I am not sure that this is true.  There should be a spectrum of proposals that can be considered.  It is important that we allow that to happen and that we allow people to come forward with different ideas.  From reading The Proposal Initiative website, and for the purposes of clarity, is it The Proposal Initiative's idea that it is not about the North joining the South, that it is very much about the creation of a new constitution and a new state?  Are the witnesses talking about starting from a blank canvas?  While I do not discount the witnesses' view on that, I have reservations because it is very hard for us to start from a blank canvas.  We have seen over the past number of weeks a reminder of that.<br/><br/>The Proposal Initiative is one proposal but there are lots of different views.  There are people who will feel very strongly that it is about the North joining the South and that we retain our symbols to represent that.  We must acknowledge that people have different aspirations and that when we talk about the Good Friday Agreement, really our common purpose there was to reach peace.  This proposal, however, is very different because we are dealing with lots of different aspirations.<br/><br/>There is not only the spectrum of proposals, which I hope will come forward for people to consider, but there is also the spectrum of engagement.  Some people are already incredibly engaged in this.  They have their manifestos ready and know what their version of the new Ireland looks like.  Then there are others who are apathetic or who are afraid, and who do not want to engage at all.  We must understand that people are coming from very different starting points on this.  We too want to encourage an atmosphere of different ideas and proposals coming forward.  This is why today's meeting is very positive.  I am not sure that we are at the consensus stage.  We are at the conversation stage.  I am especially interested in what Ms Diver said about engagement and the different ways to do that.<br/><br/>Looking at the Good Friday Agreement, what would the witnesses focus on going forward?  If the past few weeks have shown us anything it is that perhaps are we looking at another stage for the Good Friday Agreement where we recommit ourselves fiercely to the principles, the spirit and the structures of the Good Friday Agreement, while at the same time respecting that people have different legitimate aspirations.<br/><br/>I may disagree with one part of The Proposal Initiative document, and I ask for clarity on it.  Interestingly, it uses the word &quot;conciliatory&quot; and not &quot;reconciliation&quot;.  That made me think a lot about reconciliation versus conciliation, because there is a question to be asked around whether it is reconciliation that we seek.  Have we ever been reconciled?<br/><br/>The opening statement today states:</p><blockquote>	The conciliatory approach, while the essence of The Proposal, however, is not its inspiration.  The Inspiration is the realisation that the creation of an entirely new state is not only feasible but provides the best possible approach to the future of relations and administration on this beautiful, enchanting island. </blockquote><p>I would say that we cannot leapfrog conciliation or reconciliation.  They must go hand in hand.  By creating a new state, we will not get away from our past or present.  That work has to be fundamental to everything else.</p></speech>

He probably does not remember it but we met in 1999 at a count centre in Dundalk when I was a young child.  It was nice to hear him mention his late father, someone who did tremendous work for business in County Louth.  I know we are approaching the ten-year anniversary of his death in the coming months.  It is nice to meet Neil again all these years on.</p> <p>  I loved the document that Mr. McCann has outlined.  He mentioned how aspirational it is and that it is something we should really be working towards.  It is really interesting.  I am interested in what would happen after we hopefully have a successful Border poll.  Would we have some sort of joint jurisdiction for a number of years while we try to amalgamate a lot of the ideas in the Proposal Initiative or will be going for a totally new state from the beginning?  It cannot be the case that Northern Ireland will be joining the South of Ireland - the Republic.  This has to be a new state where everything is on the table for negotiation, debate and discussion.  What is really good about the document Mr. McCann has outlined today is that it is clear on that point.</p> <p>  I would love to hear more about Mr. McCann's idea about how we would amalgamate our two civil services.  It is not until I read it there that it hit me that we have two completely different forms of local government and local authorities on this island in terms of how they work.  I would love to get a view about how we can amalgamate our two civil services at some point in the future.</p></speech>

This comes back to Senator Currie's question about an entirely new state.  Senator Currie's observations open a dialogue because all of the detail of this is not worked out and even if it were worked out in a document, that might not all be followed up.  We were seeking a balance between what points to an outcome and what is practical.</p> <p>  In terms of creating an entirely new state, we do not want a blank canvas and that is not going to happen.  It is sort of absurd and, from a legal perspective, if an entirely new constitution was to be generated, then there is a whole body of law that is built on legal decision-making and interpretation.  That work of defining rights was famously done by some judges in the 1960s in particular.  Ireland has a well-established position on having defined personal rights.  A great deal of the work on that was done by Mr. Justice Brian Walsh in the Supreme Court at that time.  It originated out of concerns about the fluoridation of water, which still happens.  In Belfast, I have the pleasure of drinking slightly more chlorinated water that has not been fluoridated.</p><p>Part of our proposal seems to be unique - I have not seen it anywhere but would be glad if someone has thought of it - in that one can create a new state and adopt whatever from the existing states in place.  Northern Ireland does not have an integrated, functioning state apparatus because it is spread over two jurisdictions.  It is whatever is vested in London, which, obviously, would not continue after coming together and the powers devolved to the Assembly, which have come and gone at different times.  The staggered process of assembly cannot continue, regardless of the Constitution and bringing the two parts of Ireland together.  It is stop-start governance and is desperately felt here, in the North.  </p><p> It would presumably work out that the mainstay of the new state would be the apparatus of the existing Constitution of Ireland drawn into the new state but it would not be a case of the North simply joining the South.</p><p> As for aspects of the North that function quite well, the movements of participative democracy are quite strong in many respects in the North.

My constituency has been mentioned a number of times today.  Obviously, there is a great deal of interest in it and I appreciate that.  My constituency is in west Belfast and, obviously, we were on the streets last week when some of the issues broke out on the interface.  If we are honest with ourselves, violence took place at the interfaces last week, including in north Belfast, because protests took place at the interface, which was completely and utterly crazy.</p> <p>  A protest at an interface such as at Lanark Way will lead to a riot and mayhem and that is exactly what we saw last week.  We must ensure we work closely together.  I commend the community activists, the residents associations and youth workers who stood shoulder to shoulder with some of us last week to prevent some of the riots.</p> <p>  We removed some of the barricades from the Springfield Road and we stood in Lanark Way to stop people coming down to have a riot.  Trouble still went on further up the Springfield Road but it was further away from the interface.  It was great leadership from the local community groups, youth groups and the residents associations who all live around that area.  They are fearful of what last week meant and what it means for the future, so they are working hard.</p> <p>  I have had a number of meetings with community representatives this week as well as last week.  While there is significant interest in west Belfast and on a community basis, we must to do more.  I refer to the people at this meeting and members of the Good Friday Agreement committee.  </p> <p>  While there is great interest and mentions on a number of occasions, the only person living outside west Belfast to contact me last week, party colleagues aside, was the Rev. Karen Sutherman, who came and stood with us on the line to prevent people from rioting.  That is proper leadership.  However, as the MP for west Belfast, nobody apart from my party colleagues lifted the phone to ask if he or she could assist in any way.  No one.</p> <p>  We must look at ourselves and ask ourselves if we can do more.  The answer is every single one of us must do more and ensure we engage because I have seen better leadership coming from some of the sporting organisations.  They have organised football matches between some of the soccer teams from the Falls Road and Village areas and they have reached out to people in the Shankill.</p><p>I was engaging with loyalism.  I was engaging with unionism.  I was engaging with many different aspects of life last week because what we witnessed on our streets was not good.  I am very thankful that no one was seriously injured or killed because that could have been the consequence of what we saw on our streets last week.  The point is we need to see implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in its entirety because, as was mentioned earlier, it makes our society a better place.  We need to make sure we are engaging.</p><p> I have some questions for Mr. McCann, Mr. Quinn and Ms Diver.  Any proposals that could assist have to be taken on board, looked at and carefully studied.  What type of engagement took place with the communities when these proposals were being drawn up?  Who were the witnesses talking to?  Were they talking to local community groups, local residents associations and local political parties when these proposals were being drafted?  It is very important to talk to communities and with communities, and it is more important to do those two things than to talk about communities.  That is where we have to get to.  If we can come together and engage, while making sure we are singing from the same hymn sheet in moving forward, we will move to a much better place in a much speedier fashion.  That is where all of our focus needs to be.  We need to engage.</p><p> In addition, and this could be part of the engagement, we also have to look at some of the work the PSNI was doing last week.  I was critical.  I was engaging and met with them on a number of occasions last week, and I spoke to them to probably 20 times a day and 20 times every night last week.  Some of the local neighbourhood policing officers were off duty.  We have to ask why they were not called back sooner.  Some of the policing operations we saw on Wednesday and Thursday evening left a lot to be desired.  I can only speak for west Belfast and there are other parts of the city.  However, when local neighbourhood police officers came back, we saw police engaging with some of the young people who were involved in the trouble on the previous two nights.  We saw the local neighbourhood police teams getting out of their jeeps and talking to young people for many hours.  One officer told me that he spoke to them for four hours solid.  There were no riots on Friday or Saturday evening.  Why?  It is because there was proper community policing.  That did not happen on Wednesday and Thursday night, and even though we demanded that the PSNI come in to do that proper policing, they did not do it.  There is a template already set out for policing in Belfast, the interface template, which involves moving resources into those areas at a very early stage to engage with local community groups, local youth groups and anybody they think may have the potential to cause trouble.  That is exactly what they did on the Friday and Saturday night but failed to do on the Wednesday and Thursday.  As I said, I am very thankful that no one was seriously hurt or injured.</p><p> We need to make sure we are doing more on reconciliation.  We need to ensure we are supporting the youth workers who stood for hours on end, engaging with some young people in society.  Yet, we see some from the loyalist side of the community putting posts up on social media, blaming some of the youth workers for engaging in riotous activity, when they were in fact doing the opposite.  They were there to keep the peace and that is exactly what they did.  There are many people doing a massive amount of good work and others who will sit back and maybe put posts up on social media, and that amounts to their lot in regard to trying to keep the peace in areas like west Belfast.</p><p>The point I want to make is that very few people, outside of my own party colleagues, contacted me to ask how they could assist.  We need to look at all of that.  It is not just about contacting me but about contacting some of the community groups with whom they have built up some sort of rapport over the years.  However, they failed to do that last week.  We need to ensure, as does this committee, that we look closely at areas like that, at how riots like that last week start and at how we can prevent them as well.  </p></speech>

There is a whole industry which has been manufactured of observers and spectators but I want to wholeheartedly commend the people on the ground who are trying to do their very best.  They are the ones who never get the recognition in the media or in all of the forums.  Many people are making money and are also making careers on the backs of those people who are really doing the hard work.  I have witnessed for myself the brilliant and fantastic work the women from the Shankill Road, the Falls Road and from different parts of the North have done.  That is the way forward for all of us.  Perhaps I might ask Mr. McCann to deal with the question on community engagement.  I may get a chance to come in later.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

There has been a year and a half of work called Dialogue Forum, of which I am chair.  It is a cross-community, cross-party and slightly cross-Border series of monthly dialogue meetings.  I am also part of community dialogue in the Duncairn community centre in north Belfast.  I am a mediator there and I am part of a series of engagements that is being launched in the coming weeks which will run over the next 18 months.  The funding only came in for that recently.  I have been involved with Dylan Quinn in Conversations NI and with Keith McNair who is, in turn, involved with youth education groups and is now located in the Clinton Centre in Enniskillen.</p> <p>  That is the background material.  This came into being reasonably quickly.  An additional process of consultation is in progress and we have gained from that.  David Holloway, who is the director of Community Dialogue, has been very valuable to the production of this, to give one example.  I appreciate that that has to deepen.</p> <p>  When I came to live in Belfast for work and because I did not know my way around or know many people, I chose to live in a reasonably safe area, where I am right now.  I will be located in east Belfast and I am engaged with some of the groups there already.  This is a work in progress and is designed to be completely participative and open to all and to be fed into.  It is designed in part to be simply a reflection so that people's own ideas can develop and it may in time disappear.  Its work would be done then.</p><p>In our discussions in recent months, some of us felt that a paper of this kind would be extremely useful, if only as an addition to the dialogues that are taking place, which must become much more meaningful and straight-talking.  I will be happy to engage further with Mr. Maskey and the Chairman and others in all this work.</p><p> I have been around west Belfast a fair bit.  I got lost on Lanark Way about a year ago but found my way out.  I must confess, I hailed a taxi and I know in Belfast one does not usually hail taxis; one telephones for them.  I was following a satnav that was not giving me fair directions.  It indicated I had approximately three miles to go to the Crumlin Road when it was only half a mile.  This is a delightful city and part of the world.  I have made it my home in recent years so that deepens.  I thank the committee for the challenge in that because if this does not change us as we are going through it, it will not be worth it.  It changes us; we are part of the change.</p></speech>

The important constructive engagement with Mr. Maskey will obviously be very useful.  I take up Mr. Maskey's offer.  If I could have his telephone number, I would be happy to ring him.  I do not have anybody's telephone number apart from those of my party colleagues at the moment.  Perhaps if we exchange our telephone numbers, it would be helpful to all of us.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I have not had an opportunity to read it yet but I had a look at the website this morning.  I appreciate the approach around understanding and empathy, which we could do with in spades in this debate and conversation but also generally in all our policy approaches.  Anything modelled on V&aacute;clav Havel's view of nation-building and engagement is a good thing as he is a good role model for all of us.</p> <p>  As others have noted, this initiative is, correctly, outside of the political sphere.  That is right.  In terms of this debate I believe in letting a thousand flowers bloom, essentially, because there are people who will be put off by perceived or real silos that they see in political conversations.  Indeed, there are people who would not necessarily go to a public meeting or are not involved in a geographically-based or networked group.  It is, therefore, good that these are proposals and ideas in which anybody can get involved.</p> <p>  I saw that Mr. McCann suggested potentially calling the new Ireland just that.  I do not disagree with the concept.  I agree that we are building a "New Ireland" but I am afraid that name is taken by an island in Papua New Guinea beside New Britain.</p></speech>

As I said, it is appropriate that the initiative exists separately.  Mr. McCann referred to a conversation around the need to evolve a new constitution and new sets of proposals and I agree that it is not a completely blank slate or <i>tabula rasa</i>.  How does he see that conversation evolving?  How far does he think it can go without formal interventions and forums such as citizens' assemblies being established on a formal footing?</p><p>Are there things that those of us who have our colours nailed to a mast in terms of being party political can do to assist with this approach?  Are there other things we can do, for example, to promote, encourage and stimulate the work Mr. McCann is doing?</p></speech>

In that sense, it certainly is in the public sphere and we very much welcome that.  Part of the dialogue process that has given birth to our work involves people who are involved in electoral politics, including, for example, John Kyle.</p> <p>  In terms of how we see the conversation unfolding, we expect it will have a number of levels.  Unionists, those who identify as PUL, or whatever people want to call themselves, have to be germane to that conversation.  It must take place with them and, in time, it becomes a negotiation.  That can be fostered at the community level but it is ultimately for the Government to make the proposal to members of the unionist community, including elected representatives in the Assembly and Executive and those who are not involved in electoral politics, and engage directly with them.  As far as I know, there are ongoing discussions between representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs and representatives of unionism, community groups, and former and existing paramilitaries on the unionist side.  As far as I know, and this is not the place to explore it or ask any questions about it, that engagement has not arrived at the point of saying, "Let us see what business can be done between us all."</p> <p>  The document we call The Proposal has a lot of elements to it.  If there is one particular thing for which we are asking in it, it is that somebody be sent to organise a process of engagement.  It is possible to meet online or in somebody's garden and we need to just do it.  We do not see any reason at all to defer an engagement that would lead in time to negotiations.  Let us get on with it or we will still be talking about it in another five years.</p> <p>  I value greatly the Border poll provisions in the Belfast Agreement, which are largely a reproduction of the Sunningdale versions.  The steps that were taken in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and then the Downing Street Declaration led to the recognition of Ireland's place in Northern Ireland's affairs, which has never been rolled back on from those times.  The problem is that the provisions for the Border poll are insufficiently drafted and there is capacity for severe chaos in that regard.  This is not to dismiss all that has been done, because I value it all, but I am very concerned that something may happen, or there will be a deliberate measure by the British Government, to trigger a Border poll.  The legal provisions are imprecise and inadequate and the British Government, through the Secretary of State, is given power to decide the date, the electorate - he or she can decide it should include everyone aged 16 and upwards, for instance, or be limited to over-25s - and the questions to be asked.  He or she can do so without consulting anybody; there is no reference to that at all.  I am not the first person to raise this point.  I know Colum Eastwood gave a very good account of it at the meeting the committee had with the academics from London and Trinity College.</p> <p>  There is a need to get discussions under way and we are advocating that for its own sake.</p><p>I do not think there is a sufficient protection of the wider Irish position within the border poll provisions.  If it ends up in the courts, the committee knows about the McCourt case that gave definition to what the requirements of the Secretary of State are.  That was not appealed at the Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland.  It could have gone to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court in London.  There is no clarity about that.</p><p> Border poll positions aside, it is time that we got everybody together to see what can be done, at the very least.  One would not go into a border poll without having done that.  One would not go to buy a car without having engaged with it, watched it go and discussed it.  This is the future of the nation and we are significant people in the world.  This needs to be managed carefully.  That is why I have no apology in invoking the word "love".  The only other place I know of where that was used was in Indian politics in the 1940s.  Its independence resulted in great tragedy, as we know, with the partition of India and Pakistan.  We can draw on the experience of the past to make these negotiations special and durable, and to avoid situations like that and the scenario where a border poll is won by a very small majority and somebody is disgruntled afterwards.  That is the simplicity of our proposal.  We think it is entirely coherent and capable of being adopted for an effective form of government for Ireland for the rest of our generation and long past it.</p></speech>

As the Alliance Party, we are cross-community, so we are not coming to this issue with a preconceived outcome or lobbying in any particular direction, but we recognise there is a lack of debate under way and we are happy to take part and give our perspective on things.  For me, the priority is less one of working out the detailed mechanics of how this would be done if a border poll were ever to be called.  A fair degree of work has been done in that respect already, although formal decisions have not yet been taken by any of the responsible Government actors in that regard.  Before we get to that type of issue needing to be developed further, the key issue will be developing the "what" and encouraging dialogue to occur.  What I grasped from the thrust of the proposals is that they are very much in keeping with that.  We are still in the foothills of these discussions.  Before anything is brought together by Government actors in a formal proposal to be put on a ballot paper, a plurality of discussions need to happen among a range of civic and academic actors and others.</p> <p>  I observe about unionist engagement that one should not underestimate how difficult this will be.  It is in everyone's interest in Northern Ireland to engage in discussions, even if one does not agree with the potential outcome.  If there is a plausible chance of change occurring, one is far better off being inside the room having one's voice heard rather than coming to the conversation either very late in the day or after key decisions have been taken without one's participation.  It is important to recognise that for unionism, especially at a political level, this conversation is seen as being an existential threat and it is difficult to cross that threshold and engage.</p><p>The more it can be established that discussions are being facilitated by independent or impartial facilitators, particularly in civic society and academia, the more chance there is in the short run to get civic unionist actors at least to engage.  Once that is seen as a safe thing to do, it may well be found that political unionism begins to engage.  The broad thrust and spirit of what is being said may well be correct and helpful in achieving that wider goal.  The obstacles are considerable but it is probably the best and most effective way of trying to approach it.</p></speech>

I hear what he says and yet I am not quite at the point where I am capable of understanding the intensity of the resistance likely to be found.  In our dialogue over the past year and a half there have been certain occasions when certain people have simply stated the <i>status quo</i>several times and then stayed quiet.  The following month they may have stated exactly the same.  There has been movement but it has not been dramatic.  There have been no conversions on the road to Damascus or on the road to Bangor.<br/><br/>I will ask Ms Diver to say a little more about the process of engagement, the business of participatory democracy, which is growing, and the whole business of assemblies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.717" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noeleen Diver" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021041400002#U00300"><p>I thank everyone for all the contributions and support.  On the understanding of civic engagement and the work we are trying to do at that level, I suppose we are drawing on the lessons of Brexit, the journey and process it has been and the varied understandings and expectations, most of which, of course, did not come to pass.  Lifting that across to our situation, where we know the seriousness of such misunderstandings and cross-purposes, we are very exercised by the fact we need this conversation, as Mr. McCann keeps saying, sooner rather than later.  This is why I referred to the fact that folk need help even to unpack the expectations and aspirations they hold.  What in fact do they mean and what is at the core of them?  We know there are different methods and tones for such facilitation and, within the community voluntary sector in Northern Ireland, there are a lot of conversations happening that perhaps go under the radar.</p> <p>  I am part of an organisation, Collaboration for Change, that is trying to excavate this kind of activism, in whatever faith, so that we can become visible to each other, learn from each other and then start to support each other.  That experience might not be at the political level at all.  It could be at the environmental, economic or social justice level, but the experience of that journey of exploration and listening, learning and developing action is utterly relevant, we believe, to the process we are addressing today.</p><p>I completely agree with the points that were made that there is a spectrum involved here.  There are not any, dare I say, golden or silver bullets, or bullets of any sort.  There is a spectrum of possibilities, and indeed why should we not cherry-pick and come up with different possibilities?  The experience of that, and I go back to Inez McCormack, the experience of agency unlocks so many things and people start to solve their own local issues for themselves.  I refer back to the descriptions made about west Belfast in the past couple of weeks but it is the encouragement of that, it is the facilitation of that and almost that we have the expectation of our citizenry to be able to do that and they are then facilitated to do that.</p><p> On the apathetic and the not engaged, that in a sense is not their fault.  It is how are we communicating and engaging with them, understanding what is important to them, so we know we have opportunities.  Another interesting one at the moment is community wealth building, which has quite taken off in parts of England and in, for example, North Ayrshire in Scotland.  On something that is concrete and matters to people and impacts people, the agency is gained to move into these very sensitive and intricate spheres.</p><p> I agree it is intricate and incremental.  There is a fear that people will run in different directions, but that is the patience, building and experience of it.  If we are on a spectrum of options, if there is a possibility that, as with Brexit, we will be in or out, and if there are other possibilities, we might need a deliberative system and a voting system that accommodate that multiplicity.  I refer the members to the modified Borda count by the de Borda Institute.  Peter Emerson has done a lot of work on that approach.  It allows the melding of possibilities to create the best that is possible.  Again, it is reconciliation and conciliation.  We talk about consensus, not consent, and what can I live with or what can I actually consent to.</p></speech>

I had some points I wanted to highlight.  It is very important to engage with civil society.  It would be a great idea for the witnesses to engage with an organisation called Ireland's Future which advocates for and promotes discussion which includes the viability of a new constitutional arrangement on the island.  It is guided by the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>The Good Friday Agreement is one of the most powerful agreements, bearing in mind the amount of work that went into it.  It is essential we are guided by its values and the protection of human rights, equality, and fostering mutual respect between all views and traditions that share this island.  I agree with Mr. McCann.  I am concerned that at any point the British Government could call a border poll and absolute chaos would ensue.  Planning and preparing is essential for a border poll in case it is called.</p><p>Returning to the Good Friday Agreement, I was concerned by something in Mr. McCann's briefing document:</p> <blockquote> 	The direction proposed here marks a big step forward from the 1998 Agreements.  It is not the only route to a new nation ... [but] its early timing removes the undesirable scenario of negotiation under the shadow of a potentially divisive and possibly narrowly won unity referendum under the overly vague terms of the 1998 agreement. </blockquote> <p>What does Mr. McCann mean by that?  How does he see a border poll being triggered?  Is there any benefit to a citizens' assembly.  What would that bring?</p></speech>

It could be on an all-Island basis or at whatever level is considered workable.  There could be a citizens' assembly that is based entirely in the South or in the North or they could be linked together.  I would favour an all-Island citizens' assembly to address all issues in relation to this and to have an open agenda in respect of our constitutional future.  I have attended a number of Ireland's Future events - maybe as many as seven.  I know Professor Colin Harvey slightly, and several others who are connected with the group.  I have also seen the Senator speak in Newry among other places.  That contribution is certainly respected and I am happy to accompany it on those terms.</p> <p>  As to the question of how a Border poll may be triggered, some of the potential problems are very unlikely to emerge.  However, if the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland happened to be interviewed about something entirely different and was asked by a sharp interviewer whether he had formed any view on the likely success of a Border poll in Ireland - for example, if he was dealing with the topic of Brexit or something to do with Britain - he could be caught on the hop.  The background to that might be that the LucidTalk poll next week is likely to show that there is an increase in the number in Northern Ireland who favour unity.  If the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland were to be asked about that poll and replied that, indeed, it looked like there was an increase in those in favour of unity, a statement like that could be taken as the Secretary of State forming an opinion on which a Border poll must be held and over which somebody would go to court in Belfast and try to force the issue.</p><p>That is one scenario or that could happen, for example, in an unguarded social moment.  I see no evidence at the moment that the British would dare try to call a Border poll voluntarily, on the basis that unionism, if one likes, would gain another seven years because it would be locked out for that period of time.  I cannot see that, although the level of mistrust and deviancy in political contact in Britain is a bit staggering at times.  All sides understand that quite clearly.</p></speech>

I think John Finucane MP and Deputy Conway-Walsh might want to come in as well.  The three witnesses are very welcome.  Ms Diver referred in her first contribution to the meeting about citizens' assemblies and how she felt they were very helpful and Mr. McCann reiterated that in his response to Senator Black's question.  In 1998 I was involved, along with Mary Nelis, who was an MLA at the time, in discussing the potential of the civic forum in the North initially but with a view to it becoming an all-Ireland civic forum.  We supported that level of engagement.  We felt it should be a bottom-up approach.  Mary used to say at every meeting that it was always the great and the good and she wanted to hear from real people.  We want to engage with people who have something to say, who have relevance, but who might not necessarily have a voice.  From that point of view, in my experience a citizens' assembly certainly ticks that box.  My question was primarily about the civic forum.  The witnesses might have covered that enough, but I am happy if they want to elaborate further.  I will let John Finucane MP and Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh come in for the last few minutes.</p></speech>

I was not too sure whether Mr. McCann was going to respond to the question now.  I will be very brief.  Like everybody else, I thank the witnesses not just for the content of their presentation today but also for the tone and tenor of it.  It is important that the debate is filled with that.  I wish to touch on the point Mr. McCann made about the fact that only the British Government has the control and the ability to call a poll.  That shows that there is a need for the Irish Government to plan and attached to that need is a sense of urgency.  Could Mr. McCann expand a little bit more about the context of the fact that the Irish Government has no ability to call such a poll and that it will effectively be reacting to the British announcement?  How does he see the Irish Government responding to that in advance and upping the preparations in advance of what people accept will be an inevitability in terms of the poll being held?</p></speech>

That has been well discussed previously.  The architecture already exists for a citizens' assembly.  We have had very successful citizens' assemblies here.  Is there any impediment that would stop the Government calling a citizens' assembly at any time?  I think that is the way to have an inclusive discussion on many of the matters raised today and that have been raised in other meetings here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-14a.731" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil McCann" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021041400002#Y00100"><p>To respond to Deputy Conway-Walsh, I am not aware of any impediment to a citizens' assembly getting under way immediately.  I would advocate that happening without delay.</p> <p>  There was a question directed towards Ms Diver but I will get back to Mr. Finucane first on the question of the Irish Government and its role in a Border poll.  There is no law arising out of the Belfast Agreement.  There are clauses in the agreement that refer to a role for both Governments but there is nothing in law that compels or enables the Irish Government to even be consulted or to allow the Executive or the Assembly in Northern Ireland to be consulted on a Border poll.  It might be consulted.  If the British are behaving with a degree of courtesy, it will be consulted.</p> <p>  I will be very direct.  We are advocating in very clear terms that negotiations with the unionists be invited in advance of preparation for a Border poll and that things be put in that order.  Mr. Finucane will probably disagree with my position on that, and fair enough.  I respect that but our intervention here, so to speak, is to say that we should get discussions under way immediately.  The very best outcome that we can recommend is that a border poll would be undertaken on foot of an agreement made among all the relevant parties.  That is what we advocate.  Reconciliation is a process that takes a long time.  Reconciliation is ongoing.  Conciliation is an approach that can take place immediately, and we are for that.  Mr. Finucane and I may well differ on that but I hope that if we meet at some stage we will have a gentle pint and a bit of craic also.  I respect there may be a difference of opinion on that but we are very clear that we want engagement on it now with everybody.</p> <p>  There was a question on an aspect of the work of the Civic Forum in 1998 that I think was directed towards Ms Diver.  It was to elaborate on its effectiveness.  I am sorry but I cannot remember if Ms Gildernew introduced that.  I do not know if Ms Diver would like to comment on the matter.</p></speech>

We must vacate the room at 2.30 p.m. exactly so there are three minutes remaining.  While Ms Diver is forming her final opinion, I take the opportunity to thank her, Mr. McCann and Mr. Quinn for attending and giving us an insight into their thinking and their proposals.  I laud them on the work they are doing and will continue to do.  There is a new connectivity now in terms of their group, Members of Parliament, particularly the representatives from the North, and ourselves.  Hopefully, as the witnesses said, we can meet in the future.  I invite Ms Diver to wrap up the discussion.</p></speech>

I referred to the civic forum because I believed it was an attempt at the time to build in genuine civic engagement.  The importance of that was seen.  It had several problems associated with it, and maybe perceptions.  For example, there were questions about whether it was a talking shop and whom it represented.  Also questioned were the relationship between it and the elected representatives and its role.  People asked what concrete possibilities could emerge from it.  Several have referred to the positive experience that the Republic has had of a citizens' assembly so I think there are more possible ways of constructing what we were attempting to achieve under a civic forum.  There are better possibilities.</p></speech>
