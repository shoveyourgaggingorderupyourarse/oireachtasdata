I am a member of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and I am joined by Mr. Patrick Kenny, another member of the CCPC.</p> <p>  The CCPC has a statutory function under the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 to promote competition and promote and protect the interests and welfare of consumers.  In the pursuit of those functions, we enforce competition and consumer protection law.  We also provide advice to the Government and other public bodies on issues relating to competition and consumer welfare.</p> <p>  The CCPC is concerned that the provisions contained in this Bill would be disproportionate and would, in the CCPC's view, lead to a restriction of competition in the market for veterinary services with negative consequences for consumers, including farmers and the wider agricultural sector.  Any perceived benefits of the proposed legislation are, in our view, unquantified and unclear.  The CCPC is concerned also about potential unintended consequences of the proposed legislation, should it be enacted.</p> <p>  Directive 2006/123/EC, commonly referred to as the services directive, is intended to provide a level playing field and eliminate barriers to the provision of services by businesses and professionals across the member states of the European Union.  The services directive requires that any legal restrictions on the exercise of a service are permissible only where they comply with the principles of non-discrimination, necessity and proportionality.  Any restrictions on the legal form that veterinary practices take should be justified on a clear evidential basis of protecting the public from detriment, including harm to the animals under the care of veterinary practitioners.  The CCPC is of the view that there is a real risk that an outright ban on corporate ownership could be successfully challenged as being disproportionate.  The proposed legislation could be at odds with efforts to ensure Ireland remains in compliance with EU law and continues to be a welcoming location for new businesses and investment by service providers.</p> <p>  The CCPC believes the committee should consider the adverse implications of the legislation on existing corporate-owned practices in the State as well as their employees and customers.  As the members of the committee are aware, the Constitution extends certain rights, including property rights, which may be affected by the passage of the Bill into law.  The role of interpreting the Constitution falls to the courts.  As such, I will focus our comments in the remainder of this statement to the CCPC's views on the impact of the Bill on competition and the disproportionality of introducing a ban on corporate ownership.  It is the CCPC's view that enhanced regulation could instead be employed to ensure veterinary practices continue to provide a high standard of care, irrespective of ownership structure.</p> <p>  Competition policy in its broadest sense involves the enforcement of competition law, including rules against anticompetitive practices, merger rules and, in addition, public policy measures that enable and support competition in markets.  It may be of assistance to the committee if I briefly discuss the importance of the public policy aspects of competition policy to the functioning of the economy.  These aspects of the CCPC's remit focus on the broader environment of legislation, regulation and administrative practices.</p> <p>  Public policy can give rise to restrictions on competition in a number of ways.  The CCPC recognises that there can be legitimate public policy objectives which, when balanced against those of competition, can lead to less competition in a market but which promote the public good in a broader sense.  For example, the high level of qualifications necessary to practise medicine and veterinary medicine are barriers to entry but the vital importance of protecting human and animal health justify those requirements.</p> <p>  Some restrictions, however, are less open to objective justification.  The CCPC and its predecessor agency, the Competition Authority, have engaged with government and other stakeholders in order to reduce such restrictions over the past number of decades through our advocacy activity and, in particular, through our market studies.  Examples include our recommendations and advocacy activity to open the market for legal services to greater competition and to reduce restrictions on the availability of GP services in Ireland.</p> <p>  The committee may be aware that the Competition Authority published a study of the veterinarian market in 2008.  That study found a number of unnecessary restrictions on competition between vets.  It made a number of recommendations intended to address those restrictions, including removing restrictions on advertising by vets.  The Competition Authority also examined ways of ensuring an adequate supply of veterinary services in the future, which is of particular importance for the agricultural sector.  We note the increased number of vets in practice in Ireland since the publication of the study.</p> <p>  The CCPC understands that the intent of the Bill is to prohibit corporate ownership of veterinary practices by non-vets.</p><p>However, the CCPC believes that a variety of types of veterinary practices, including incorporated practices, should have a role to play in this sector.  This was a specific recommendation in the competition authority&rsquo;s study as it found that the benefits of corporate ownership included improved access to capital for investment and the greater application of non-veterinary business skills.  There are further potential benefits, including cost savings, the ability to provide locations and opening hours that are more convenient for many consumers and flexible working arrangements.  The current Irish veterinary sector is similar to many other European countries, in that there are a variety of types of ownership of practices.  Veterinarians may work as sole traders, in partnerships, in incorporated practices and as employees.  Survey results published by the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe in 2018 indicate that the Irish veterinary sector is not unusual in having a range of ownership models.  Small practices predominate in Europe with almost half of veterinarians being sole traders.  In contrast, Ireland is home to a higher than average number of medium-sized and larger practices with approximately 40% being incorporated in some form.  It would appear that irrespective of practice type, vets continue to deliver a variety of vital services across European countries. </p><p> The CCPC&rsquo;s view is that the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 could instead be amended to provide a legal basis on which the Veterinary Council of Ireland, VCI, can regulate the operation of incorporated practices.  As members will be aware, veterinary practitioners are obliged by provisions in the Veterinary Practice Act, as well as the VCI&rsquo;s code of conduct, as to how they perform their functions in respect of their clients and animals under care.  As set out in the code of conduct the veterinarian&rsquo;s duty to his or her clients includes the provision of 24-hour emergency cover for the care of animals that during normal working hours could be considered as being under the care of the veterinary practice.  We understand that the intention of the Bill is in part to ensure that the availability of critical veterinary services, such as the provision of 24-hour care, is not reduced due to such services being incompatible with the priorities of management in a corporate owned practice.  However such a ban would appear to be unique in Europe and has not been applied in other similar professions such as GPs, pharmacies and dentists.  </p><p> It would be difficult to predict the effects of such a drastic measure on the current veterinary sector and we have not seen evidence that this analysis has been done.  The CCPC instead suggests that proportionate regulation could provide reassurance for consumers including those in the agricultural sectors, that veterinarians employed by corporate owned practices would continue to deliver such services as part of a regulated obligation on the practice.  The CCPC is aware for example, that the Pharmacy Act 2007, and subsequent regulations made under that Act, impose obligations on the owners of retail pharmacies, including where that pharmacy owner is a corporate body.  This approach ensures the benefits of corporate ownership can be realised for pharmacies, while maintaining a high standard of clinical care and compliance with the law. </p><p> The CCPC considers that there is an opportunity to reassess how regulation of veterinary services can remain responsive to changes in the market, while ensuring that restrictions on entry into that market are proportionate.  To that end we suggest that consideration be given to engagement with the VCI and the wider veterinary sector to establish how regulation can be developed, while ensuring that the market remains open to new entry and innovation and continues to protect the interests of consumers and animals.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Jackie Cahill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021102000002#B00300"><p>I thank the commission for its submission on this proposed legislation.  The commission has made submissions on similar legislation in the past and there are some inconsistencies in what we heard today with what the commission said on previous occasions in regard to legislation.  I will point to a couple of law points.  One relates to competition law of the European Court of Justice, ECJ, which states that the ECJ has held that competitive restrictions resulting from acts of professionally regulated bodies do not fall within the scope of EU competition law where such restrictions are necessary and proportionate to the regulation of a profession.  This amending legislation has three main purposes.  The first is to prevent laypersons, non-professional corporates from illegally practising veterinary medicine through the purchase and operation of veterinary practices in Ireland.  The second is to ensure that the practice of veterinary medicine remains within the regulatory compass of the Veterinary Council of Ireland as the VCI has no regulatory control over lay operators.  The third and most important purpose is to protect the consumer, animal health and welfare and public health.  That is paramount.</p> <p>  Allowing an unregistered person to own a veterinary practice would mean an unregistered person or body corporate would enjoy a level of control over substantive practice-related decisions, for example, the policy of the veterinary practice including practice protocols, the mix of work accepted and performed in the practice, the materials employed by practitioners in the practice, and the sale and supply of prescription drugs in direct contravention of the animal remedies regulations, section 28(4) together with Schedule 1, Part 1, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.  In lay terms what that means is that we have lay people purchasing and having the control of drugs.  </p> <p>  This committee has spent much time in the recent past discussing the availability of veterinary medicines and the way non-prescription veterinary medicines will be dealt with in the future.  There has been much concern about resistance to drugs and the dangers to human health therein.  Here we are now going to allow non-professional people to have the purchase and sale of those drugs under their authority, rather than under the authority of qualified professionals?  As an example, when a corporate body took over a practice in Northern Ireland, the veterinarian working there was denied access to the drugs that were in that practice when it was taken over.  He has made complaints about the fact that those drugs were then outside of his control.  They are some fundamental points.  Lay ownership of a veterinary practice will not be able to guarantee a 24-hour service because VCI's code of conduct requires a veterinary practitioner to ensure arrangements are made for 24-hour on-call emergency cover.  It is not binding on a non-registered person or body corporate to do that.  That is another point in regard to animal welfare and availability of the service. </p> <p>  We have seen corporates grow in other countries.  Unfortunately, the level of service and the cost to the consumer, rural and urban, has increased dramatically as a result.  Corporates will not pick a practice in Connemara or on a peninsula.  They will target large urban small animal practices in intensive farming areas.  Mr. McHugh mentioned the availability of veterinarians.  I know of a large practice that was recently taken over where 11 veterinarians were employed, three of whom partners in the company.  They were part of the purchase and benefited from the sale of the practice, but the other eight veterinarians working there saw their career progression meeting a stone wall.  To get a number of veterinarians into large animal practice is a challenge at the moment.  If we allow corporates to gain a stronghold however, the career progression for those young veterinarians will be severely restricted.  It will become even harder to entice veterinarians coming out of college to go into large animal practices.</p><p>If Mr. McHugh wants examples of other European countries protecting professions like this we can look to Germany.  I will read from an article, which states:</p><blockquote>	On 19 May 2009 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ... confirmed that Germany can have national legislation which prevents non-pharmacists from owning and operating pharmacies ... [the joined cases and case numbers are immaterial here].  This effectively is a ban ... on the outside ownership of pharmacies, and no pharmacy chains will be allowed to operate.<br /><br />According to German law, the principle of the owner-run pharmacy applies: thus only pharmacists are allowed to own and run pharmacies.  There is a ban on outside ownership, in order to thus ensure the job-related independence of the pharmacist. </blockquote><p>I believe one can easily correlate that with what we are trying to do with this legislation as regards the veterinary profession.  Therefore, it is clear.  The article goes on to state:</p><blockquote>	The ECJ came to the conclusion that the German ban on outside ownership is valid.  Although the ban could be seen as an intervention in the European freedom of establishment, this was balanced against the protection of health.  Each Member State can decide which scope of protection it wants to achieve for the population.  For this reason, a Member State is entitled to exclude non-pharmacists from owning and running a pharmacy if it believes that these persons do not have the necessary job-related independence and therefore constitute a risk for the public health. </blockquote><p>I spoke to a veterinarian who rang me because he knows I am sponsoring this legislation.  His practice where he worked was recently bought by a corporate entity; in other words, by laypeople.  He was told that part of his remit for the following year would be to increase the sale of drugs by 10%.  We have people coming in whose aim is to increase their bottom line.  They are not coming from a profession that takes an ethical oath as regards animal welfare when they qualify.<br/><br/>While I welcome Mr. McHugh's observations about competition, I feel the opposite is the case in allowing the change in legislation, which from 2005 to 2015 was supported by the Competition Authority at the time.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland's interpretation of the Act was to prohibit the sale of veterinary practices only to veterinarians and to restrict the ownership to veterinarians.  The interpretation of that legislation was changed in 2017.  This committee had a number of committee meetings around that time.  We will be talking to the Veterinary Council of Ireland at a later date.  This amendment to this legislation, however, was borne out of those meetings when the committee at the time, of which the Chairman, Senator Daly and I are probably the only three surviving members, was extremely unhappy with the explanations and reasons that were given to us for the change of interpretation of the legislation.  I have seen advice from the present Attorney General, however, who gave advice to the veterinary union at the time, which very strongly argues that the interpretation taken at that time is not in accordance with the legislation.  This amendment is to make that crystal clear and to reaffirm the previous Veterinary Council interpretation of the Veterinary Practice Bill.<br/><br/>In conclusion, there are clear precedents in other European countries for this kind of restriction.  It is very much within EU law.  It is up to each member state if it feels that it is warranted from a public health point of view.  At the end of the day, public health is the most paramount thing that we as legislators must protect.  It is clear that what is happening at the moment is in clear breach of the animal remedies regulations, which is under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is very clear that allowing laypersons to have control of the purchase of prescribed drugs cannot be in accordance with that regulation.  There is, therefore, urgency on us to act.<br/><br/>We have also seen cases in France where veterinary practices have been delisted because the French authorities felt what was happening there was not in accordance with public good.  The fact that we have corporates established here does not make the Veterinary Council's interpretation of this legislation correct.  As I said, veterinary practices that were owned by corporates have been delisted in France.  There is clear precedent for legislation, therefore, as per the amendment to the Bill that I am sponsoring.<br/><br/>While I take on board Mr. McHugh's concerns as regards competition, I feel they are unfounded and that the service we have had provided to us for generations by veterinary practices has worked extremely well for us and for animal welfare.  Whether it is local shows or whatever, veterinary practitioners have never been found wanting in providing voluntary services in their community.  We have a model that has worked extremely well in providing an excellent service to the consumer at a reasonable cost.<br/><br/>I am very strongly of the view that this amendment to the Bill will ensure that lasts for further generations.  From the point of view of the consumer and the young veterinarian coming into practice and, as I said, most importantly of all, from the public health and animal welfare point of view, it is absolutely essential that the practice of veterinary medicine is kept under the control of veterinarians.  As I said, we see precedence in other European countries and it is clear that this country, under EU law and competition law, has the remit to amend this legislation.</p></speech>

As part of the opening statement, I set out that competition restrictions can be allowed where they are necessary and where they are proportionate.  I think it would be very important to set out what the problems are here, which the Deputy has done for a few areas, and then what the potential solutions are and whether they are necessary or proportionate.  As I mentioned, we do not have these arrangements where such corporate ownership is banned for GPs or pharmacies in Ireland.  It is not, therefore, deemed necessary or proportionate in those areas.</p> <p>  I will not get into a detailed discussion on the points of law.  I am not a lawyer.  What I would say is that there are real risks in terms of this legislation.  There are a number of cases where similar restrictions have been found to be in breach of European law.  I would suggest that it would be very important that this legislation is subject to legal scrutiny to understand what the risks are in terms of that law.</p> <p>  In addition, there may well be constitutional issues in terms of the impact this has on corporates that are currently in place in Ireland, which is very difficult to predict.  As I understand, it would mean some owners of businesses would be criminalised and would need to take actions to divest themselves of that business, which may be a very complicated and painful process for what may be relatively small or even family-run veterinary practices.  Legal issues would, therefore, have to be very carefully considered.</p> <p>  In terms of the issues identified by the Deputy, similar issues will come up in terms of GPs and pharmacies, corporates and the individuals responsible for medicines.  Those should be very carefully considered, therefore, but I think the right way to do that is through the regulator, as has been done in other sectors.</p></speech>

Am I correct that the commission's concerns are primarily based on the competition aspect of its role rather than the consumer protection aspect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McHugh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021102000002#D00200"><p>No.  We view them as intrinsically linked.  We provide advice to the Government and public bodies on issues around competition and consumer welfare.  When stringent restrictions are introduced in a market preventing consumers from having choice, it is not good for consumers in the long run.  It means that there will be less competition in the market and fewer places for consumers to go, and it will ultimately be consumers who suffer.  We come at this from the point of view of consumers and consumer welfare.</p></speech>

Which of these relate to the consumer as opposed to the competition aspect of the CCPC's role?</p></speech>

We have spoken about the impact on consumers, including the agricultural sector as a consumer of veterinary practices.  That is set out in the submission.  As in any market where there are restrictions, the ultimate impact is on consumers.  They are the ones who tend to suffer from a lack of competition, a lack of new entry and a lack of innovation because of, for example, fewer services and higher prices.  That is why we have been given the remit by the Oireachtas to make presentations in respect of legislation and identify where there are competition issues that impact on consumer welfare.  To a large degree, we are here today for the benefit of the consumer and to stand up and be the voice of the consumer where legislation like this risks harming consumers in the long run.</p></speech>

A number of parts of the country are not as well serviced by vets as others.  Will Mr. McHugh point us towards the recommendations that the CCPC has brought to the Government to address these deficiencies in veterinary services?</p></speech>

That is still an issue.  That is one example of a recommendation.  The issue is still a live one in terms of how many courses are available in Ireland for vets.  The number of points that are needed to do a veterinary course in Ireland is very high and there are still questions about the supply of veterinary courses.  These are issues that the CCPC and previous bodies have raised previously and remain something that needs to be considered carefully by the Government.  Addressing this would have benefits for the farming community in terms of users of veterinary practices, but it is not just about the farming community.  There are many users of veterinary practices and many consumers are impacted.</p> <p>  Over the past ten or 15 years, our understanding is that the number of vets has been increasing, which is welcome.  This increase has coincided with an increase in the number of corporates in the sector.  From that point of view, the increase in the number of corporates has not damaged the supply of vets.  The increased supply of vets is welcome, but that is not to say that more work could not be done in the area.</p></speech>

Mr. McHugh will know that this legislation would essentially revert the situation to an interpretation of the Veterinary Council that was in place from 2005 to 2018.

In that time, did the CCPC make submissions or recommendations to the Veterinary Council or the Government to the effect that that interpretation should be changed?</p></speech>

If vets want to enter partnerships, they should be free to do so.  If they want to operate as stand-alone sole traders, they should be free to do so.  If a corporate wants to invest in a practice, it should be free to do so.  We have seen that in a number of markets.  As set out in our submission, it brings many benefits.  If consumers, including farmers, do not want the service provided by those corporate entities, they will not use those particular practices.  If they get a better service, quality or price elsewhere, that is where they will go.  That fundamental point about the impact of this legislation remains, not just for the veterinary sector, but also other sectors in Ireland.  The CCPC has had an issue with vested interests.  Where walls are built around professions or market sectors, it can have a damaging effect on that market from the point of view of consumers.  This is a principle that we feel strongly-----</p></speech>

We are looking at international evidence, particularly from our closest neighbours in Britain, where the free-for-all model Mr. McHugh advocates has been to the detriment of the consumer.  How can the CCPC say, as a consumer protection authority, that a scenario that was working well for the consumer should be changed to a scenario that we know has been detrimental to the consumer in other jurisdictions?</p></speech>

This proposed legislation would be unique in Europe.  It also raises legal issues, which we have discussed, in terms of the services directive.  A number of corporates, as we understand it, have entered the market in Ireland in recent years and they are currently players in the veterinary sector.  We have not seen evidence that that has harmed consumers in a significant way that would require this significant legislation to be brought in.  We are not saying there are no issues or that particular corporate structures are the right answer.  We are saying the markets should be open to choice for consumers.  Where there are issues, and there may well be, the regulator should look at those and come up with proportionate solutions.</p></speech>

He indicated the commission was aware that "the Pharmacy Act 2007, and subsequent regulations made under that Act, impose obligations on the owners of retail pharmacies".  He also stated that this approach might be warranted.  When was the last time the CCPC advised government to pursue any of those three options?</p></speech>

However, seeing this legislation and recognising that there may be issues in the market, this is our proposal which we think is proportionate, can address the issues that may be in the market and is the right route to dealing with them, rather than the significant and draconian legislation we have here.</p></speech>

It appears to me the CCPC always goes to great lengths to protect multinational corporations at the behest of vested interests and to the potential detriment of the people who should be protected in this, namely, consumers, farmers and those living in rural communities.  If we are to take international evidence, they could lose significantly as a result of this legislation.  I thank the witnesses for being here.</p></speech>

Deputy Cahill and the previous speaker have covered many of the areas of interest for me with regard to the proposed amendment to legislation and the opinion of the CCPC.  I will seek clarification on a few points, ask a few questions and make an observation.  Would I be correct in saying that competition law and the CCPC's opinion are superseded or trumped in every case where protection of health, service provision or public interest is at stake?  If Deputy Cahill is correct and we end up with no veterinary services in rural Ireland for large animals and the agricultural sector, would the necessity to provide same supersede anything the witnesses have told us or any competition laws?  Can the witnesses clarify that?</p><p>The next issue follows on from Deputy Carthy's conclusion.  If the <i>status quo</i>were to remain, as the CCPC wishes, the current opinion of the VCI were to stay in place and the proposed legislation were not introduced, there is every chance that we could end up with a monopoly or cartels within the Irish veterinary service.  I thought the CCPC's role was to protect the consumer from such but I get a different impression from the submission today and the interaction with the two previous speakers.  I would go so far as to agree again with Deputy Carthy - it is becoming a habit - that the CCPC seems to have more interest in protecting corporates than the consumer.  We are teasing this out so I want the witnesses to come back to me on this, but the CCPC's stance will, in my opinion, lead to a monopoly and cartel in the industry.  There is a strong suggestion of such in other areas which the CCPC has been approached to deal with.  How, if the <i>status quo</i>remains, will the CCPC help to avoid that?  If it happens, how will it deal with it?</p><p>In a similar vein, what if animal drug manufacturers are among the corporates that come in and buy up a number of veterinary practices, amalgamate them and give a directive to their vets, who are supposed to be independent, that they can only prescribe or sell the drugs of the parent company, which is how corporations work?  This would be big business for them.  How would that pan out, as Deputy Cahill asked, in an era where we are all conscious of microbial resistance?  It is part of World Health Organization and One Health policy.  That would affect end consumers and farmers.  If we do not take action now, how does the CCPC propose we deal with a scenario like that?  That would be evident in animal drug manufacturers setting up large veterinary practices by taking over smaller ones or companies whose main interest would be in animal health insurance taking over a number of veterinary practices, concentrating on the small domestic animal, dropping the large animal and the agricultural sector and leaving a void in rural Ireland.  Their main emphasis at point of contact, that is, the reception, would be sale of animal health insurance as opposed to the service they provide.  Do the witnesses not see major problems with that down the line?  Would it not be more prudent, as Deputy Cahill is suggesting, to close the door before the horse - pardon the pun - has bolted?</p></speech>

I will take a few of those issues.  On competition law, the issue here, which we highlighted in the opening statement, was around the services directive and the ability of services in Europe to trade across Europe without restrictions in place.</p><p>That is not a competition law issue, but a wider issue linked to the European Single Market whereby entities have the right to trade and invest across that market, and obviously Irish companies and farmers have benefitted a great deal from the Single Market.  That is the issue.  As we have said, and we are agreed to some extent, restrictions can be in place where they are necessary and proportionate.  The issue today is that this has not been necessary, as far as we know, in the veterinary sector in any other European country.  It has not been necessary in other sectors in Ireland, such as general practitioners, dentists and pharmacies.  Many of the issues the Senator raised, which are very real and are issues we would be interested in, would be very similar in those sectors, and the solutions that have been found there are from a regulatory perspective.  That is what we would go back to and suggest.  These very real issues should be looked at, in terms what is necessary and proportionate, from a regulatory perspective where there is a regulator in place.  Where there are potential risks with regard to drugs and how they are prescribed, that is something that could be looked at in the context of what rules and regulations are put in place on those practices and on those vets in respect of prescriptions and making sure that consumers and farmers have the ability to shop around wherever they wish for their drugs when they have been prescribed by a vet.  They are able to have choice as regards getting the cheapest or the best service they can.  That is something we would strongly support.  We do not believe that this legislation is needed to address that point.</p><p> The Senator is absolutely right with regard to monopolies and cartels.  That is something we are very concerned about and it is something we work on throughout the economy.  It has not been a particular issue in the veterinary sector thus far, but it is something we would take action on if we thought that there was a monopoly that was going to harm consumers in terms of providing a service or a higher price, ultimately leading to what we call a substantial lessening of competition.  We would take action where we saw that happening.  One area where this might be relevant is that we would like the power to be able to call in mergers.  Currently, any mergers above the threshold must be sent to the CCPC for approval before a merger acquisition can be enacted.  We would also like to have the ability to call in problematic mergers below that threshold.  Where people have evidence that there may be monopolies or there may be problematic arrangements in place and there may be a lack of competition or a lessening of competition in any area in any market, we are always interested in hearing about it.  When we do and where we have the evidence, we will take action.</p><p> Another issue I wish to discuss is the actions taken by the CCPC, our views of consumers and our views of corporate.  With regard to competition, to pick one area of our remit, we have recently completed cases against private motor insurance companies, against Ticketmaster and against a UK furniture wholesaler.  These are not small companies.  Some of them are massive multinationals.  Where we saw that there was an issue, we gathered the evidence and where the evidence justified it, we set out our case and secured changes in those markets.  We will continue to follow the evidence.  Regardless of how big a company is, where there is evidence of a breach of competition law we will take action.  The record shows we do that, and we will continue to do it.</p></speech>

There has to be an issue and then the CCPC will analyse it, forensically examine it and decide what action could be taken to reverse it.  We are legislators and we are trying to be proactive.  Can Mr. McHugh see where the difference in our opinions is, based on the proactive rather than the reactive?  Everything he has said shows that the CCPC is a reactive organisation.  Something has to have happened and there has to be a problem before the CCPC will set out to address it and take action.  Where there might be a difference in our opinions is that we are trying to be proactive.  Would Mr. McHugh agree with that analogy?</p></speech>

I would not describe it as such as regards mergers.  We will prevent mergers happening where there is a substantial lessening of competition.  Perhaps the biggest difference is what is necessary and proportionate to deal with the potential problems in the veterinary sector.  We are not saying there are no problems.  What we are saying is that there is a regulator in place and that the evidence needs to be collected on what the problem is and what might be the options for solutions, including forward-looking ones.  In terms of identifying those issues and addressing them, that is what regulators are for, to a large extent, in many markets.  They are very successful at identifying problems and preventing them.  Our view is that these issues, which may be very real, would have to be examined, the evidence would have to be collected by a regulator and then decisions would be made on what are the best steps to address them, including regulatory actions, as opposed to legislative solutions that have a huge impact on the sector and a potentially huge impact on individuals, customers and employees of the organisations which may be impacted by this legislation.  That may be an area of difference today.</p></speech>

One of the recommendations in our presentation is that what should be examined is the ability of the Veterinary Council of Ireland to have an impact on the corporates that run veterinary practices as well as the individual vets.  We referenced the Pharmacy Act and how that works so our proposal is-----</p></speech>

That is a step that would be reasonable to take in finding solutions to potential problems.  I believe that the natural step of a regulator expanding its remit to deal with issues, compared with this legislation which would be unique in Europe and which raises legal issues, is much more proportionate and reasonable to try to solve the problems that may well exist.</p></speech>

It has about seven pharmacies, all very good businesses.  I also represent a number of villages and smaller towns that have no pharmacies.  What would the CCPC do if I were to report a village that did not have a pharmacy to it?</p></speech>

On the issue of pharmacies, we previously had a situation in Ireland whereby a pharmacy was not allowed to open if it was too close to another pharmacy.  That is the type of very strong regulation and restriction that does not benefit consumers.</p></speech>

If an area that is currently serviced by a veterinary practice is not serviced by such a practice in the future, it means that farms will be essentially inoperable.  They will not be able to operate as they do currently.  Mr. McHugh has highlighted and recommended an approach that simply will not work in the sector we are describing now.</p><p>Mr. McHugh has outlined and championed a scenario that sees pharmacies moving to the areas of greatest profitability, as opposed to providing the best service to consumers.  That pinpoints the difficulty I have with the commission's approach.</p></speech>

It has farmers and other consumers who use it.  That will continue.  If the veterinary practice is providing those consumers with the services they want, they are absolutely free to continue using that veterinary practice.  We are not here saying one corporate structure is better than another.  We are here saying consumers should have choice.  Where consumers use a business and where it provides that service, they will continue to do so.</p></speech>

Take a scenario in which an area is currently being serviced by a couple of vets and a new entity driven by profit moves into the area.  The vets who are operating are working for a non-vet whose objective is profit-making and they undercut the existing vets in the areas that are most profitable, usually small animal care, and increase charges for large animal care to the extent the existing vets cannot continue.  What would the CCPC do in that instance?</p></speech>

They provide a service consumers want in those areas and whichever corporate entity comes in I do not see why a partnership with multiple vets, or a corporate entity with non-vets, or a sole trader is going to choose one particular path to go down.  The idea one particular type of corporate entity is going to have a really radical impact in certain areas is one I find hard to follow.  What we are saying, and what I keep coming back to, is those consumers should have the choice of where they want to go.  Where those consumers and farmers in those areas have used that veterinary practice, get they the service they want and that veterinary practice makes a profit, as I take it they currently do, then that will continue.</p></speech>

Maybe it was my articulation of it.  We have looked at the California Department of Consumer Affairs, which has adjudicated on this scenario, which has become widespread there.  We have seen what happened in Britain, which apparently has not formed any part of the commission's deliberation.  There is a need to analyse how vets currently operate and the prospect of a system dominated by non-vet corporate entities.  I believe if the commission were to approach that with the concerns of the consumers at the centre of its deliberations, the officials would have a very different position today.</p></speech>

In many markets, that is the role of a regulator.  Regulators can do an excellent job.  We think the VCI would have a role to play here in looking at those issues and proposing solutions.</p></speech>

Between 2005 and 2017, that was working perfectly well.  When the interpretation of legislation was changed in 2017, the competition authority did not raise any issues.  However, I think the witnesses have conceded that the VCI, which is the regulatory body, has no control over lay operators and that is a fundamental point.  I have a question for Mr. McHugh.  The regulatory body has no control over the ownership of practices.  Suppose the owner of a practice is buying veterinary medicines and supplying veterinary medicines that are prescribed drugs and which, I read this earlier, clearly is in contravention of the animal remedies regulations.  Does he consider what is happening and what the VCI has allowed to happen to be legal?</p></speech>

I am registrar and CEO of the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  I am joined today by Mr. Joe Moffitt, president, and Dr. Ail&iacute;s N&iacute; Riain, deputy president of the veterinary council.  On behalf of the council, we welcome the opportunity to discuss the Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill 2021 with the Oireachtas joint committee and thank the members for the invitation to appear before them today.<br/><br/>The veterinary council is the statutory body responsible for the regulation and management of the veterinary professions, being veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses in Ireland.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland is a statutory body set up under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, as amended, and is under the aegis of the Minister for Agriculture, Food, and the Marine.  The principal function of the council is to regulate the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in the Republic of Ireland in the interests of animal health and welfare and veterinary public health.  The functions of the veterinary council include protection of the public through the supervision of veterinary education, the maintenance of the register of veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses, the registration of veterinary premises, and through disciplinary action in cases of professional misconduct. <br/><br/>One point we wish to make clear at the outset is that the veterinary council does not express a view one way or the other on the desirability or otherwise of a restriction on ownership of the sort proposed.  Rather we fully acknowledge this is a policy issue for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  What we hope to do is to identify some of the practical and other issues that may arise in an effort to assist the committee in its considerations.  The council acknowledges it is a wholly a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas to adopt legislation that facilitates the regulation of the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in a manner that is in the best interests of the public and maintains high standards in the practice of veterinary medicine.  In addition, the council respects the role reserved exclusively for the Houses of the Oireachtas to determine matters of policy regarding public interest and animal health and welfare.  Our principal function is to regulate and manage the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in the State in the public interest in accordance with the legislation.<br/><br/>The proposed amendments contained in the Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill 2021 include some significant changes to the ownership of veterinary practices.  The matter of ownership of veterinary practices has not been addressed in Irish legislation heretofore.  The Veterinary Surgeons Act 1931 and the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 do not speak to ownership of veterinary practices.  The Veterinary Surgeons Act 1931 included a prohibition on corporate bodies practising veterinary medicine.  While we can only speculate on the intent of any such legislation it may be that such provision was to ensure that any person suffering losses arising from the actions of a registered person in the practice of veterinary medicine were afforded the opportunity for redress against any individual, preventing the evasion of civil liability by any individual.  The legal requirement for veterinary practitioners to hold a policy of professional indemnity insurance was introduced in 2012 under the Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Act 2012, thereby addressing matters relating to civil liability in the public interest.  In contemplation of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, there may have also been some intention regarding the taxable income structures in operation.  Historically,  section 54(2) of the Veterinary Practitioners Act 2005 was interpreted to prevent a body corporate from owning a veterinary practice.  However, legal advice received by the council advised that the legislation does not speak to the ownership of practices and, thus, the council has no legal authority in determining the ownership of practices under current legislation.  The council has in the past been incorrectly painted as the villain in matters regarding ownership of veterinary practices.  No legislation to date has addressed the issue of veterinary practice ownership.  The council can act only on the powers conferred in law in the interest of animal health and welfare, public interest and public health.  The council has no legal powers over the regulation of the market regarding corporate ownership of veterinary practices.  The parameters of our powers, as established under the Veterinary Practitioners Act 2005, do not extend to ownership.  No legislation previously enacted by the Oireachtas has dealt with the matter of ownership of veterinary practices.  Irrespective of approach to ownership of veterinary practices, the council must and will continue to ensure the highest standards of veterinary medicine in the regulation and management of the professions. <br/><br/>The question of corporate ownership and other forms of legal ownership, and the linked issue of lay ownership, have been topics of some debate within the profession in recent years.  In this regard, the council engaged Grant Thornton to carry out a significant consultation process in 2019, following which it published in July 2019 a report entitled Analysis of the VCI Consultation on Corporate Ownership of Veterinary Practices, which will be referred to as the Grant Thornton report, a copy of which has been provided to the committee.  We commend this report to the committee and urge that it be considered in detail as it contains much useful background and contextual material.  Importantly, it makes clear that a significant number of veterinary practices are, in fact, incorporated, that is, they are companies.  It is against this backdrop we appear to inform and assist the committee in its consideration of legislation.  The sole objective of the council is to continue to be a trusted and effective regulator and to assist the committee in any policy considerations to ensure practicable, durable and enforceable legislation in the public interest. <br/><br/><b></b>We reiterate the point that the council does not express a view one way or the other on the desirability or otherwise of a restriction on ownership of the sort proposed.  Rather we fully acknowledge that this is a policy issue for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Our hope is to identify some of the practical and other issues that may arise in an effort to assist and inform the committee.  We as a veterinary council currently hold no information on the ownership of veterinary practices as we have no legal basis to make any such request for information.  We currently issue what are referred to as certificates of suitability, as deemed appropriate, to applications from registered persons for specified veterinary practice premises, which meet regulations and standards as laid down by the council.  We collect data and information on any registered persons associated with any veterinary practice, the nature of the veterinary services offered, confirmation of professional indemnity policies held and other such relevant information.  We do not have any information on the owner of a single veterinary practice currently in the country.<br/><br/>It appears that there may well be a significant issue regarding pre-existing corporate structures where there are already owners, that is, shareholders, who are not registered veterinary practitioners.  It would appear from the proposed amendment that they would be committing a criminal offence by reason of the simple expedient of their ownership.  It is not clear if this is the intent of the amendments proposed.  Also, it occurs that there may well be legal or constitutional issues here around property ownership and expropriation that might need to be considered.  In the event that there is a real prospect of a requirement to compensate shareholders in the case of expropriation, the council understands the matter of any potential redress for such impacted parties arising as a result of legislative change will be a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In this regard, the council understands the proposed legislation will benefit from detailed legal scrutiny in due course.  It is suggested that if restrictions on persons other than registered veterinary practitioners are to be brought into effect then it will be necessary to ensure there are appropriate enforcement and investigative powers to ensure that any law can be enforced.  The council is anxious to ensure that any proposed legislation to be enforced by it is suitably robust and capable of enforcement by it in the public interest and in the interest of animal health and welfare. <br/><br/>The council again highlights its wish to assist the committee in the consideration of these matters in a constructive way.  The objective of both our recent written submission and our appearance today is to highlight aspects of the draft legislation that may require further consideration or refinement to ensure that any legislation endorsed by the committee is informed, practical and enforceable.  We respect that matters of policy are reserved for the Houses of the Oireachtas and, accordingly, the council can adopt no position on draft legislation which may fall to it to enforce, if enacted.  As will be apparent from the Grant Thornton report, there is a broad church of opinion within the professions and among the public on the question of corporate ownership and related issues such as lay ownership of veterinary practices.  Many of the views of stakeholders are held deeply and passionately.  The council suggests that there is much important information and useful context in the Grant Thornton report that should shed light on the divergent views and some of the issues that arise.</p><p>The report also deals with regulatory structures based on regulation of the individual or regulation of the practice in veterinary regulation in other jurisdictions, in addition to detailing the structures of regulation relied upon for other health professionals, such as doctors, dentists and pharmacists.</p><p> Irrespective of the approach to ownership of veterinary practices, the council must continue to ensure the highest standards of veterinary medicine in the regulation and management of the professions.  We will continue to work to ensure that the high standards expected and enjoyed in the veterinary industry are upheld, and that the quality of veterinary care is continuously improving into the future, in the best interests of animal health and welfare and the public interest.</p><p> I thank the Chairman, Vice Chairman and the committee for the invitation to address them today.  The president of the Veterinary Council, the deputy president and I are happy to address any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

The fact I brought forward this amendment came out of a couple of meetings of the joint committee in the last D&aacute;il, when we had the Veterinary Council with us on more than one occasion.  It was the unanimous view of the Oireachtas committee that we were unhappy with the explanations we got as to why the interpretation of the 2005 legislation was changed in 2017 and 2018.  From 2005 to 2017, it was regulated such that only veterinary practitioners could own veterinary practices but that interpretation of the legislation then changed and allowed lay people to purchase practices.  After a number of these practices were purchased, it was then decided to hold a consultation process to get the views of different stakeholders and individuals, as Ms Muldoon noted.  After that consultation process, the Veterinary Council continued to interpret the legislation in a different way from it did previously.  That is what has brought us here today with this amendment to the Veterinary Practice Bill.</p> <p>  I fully accept the Veterinary Council is not a policy maker and that it is there to regulate.  There are a number of points I want to make.  Senators Paul Daly and Tim Lombard were on the previous committee, as was the former Deputy Willie Penrose, who had a very legalistic mind and was extremely unhappy with the way things had progressed.  We are all here around this table to make sure what we do is in the best interests of human health and that human health is protected, which is the first fundamental, and then to protect the consumer and to protect animal health and welfare.</p> <p>  We have seen in other jurisdictions that where corporates have gained a stranglehold on the ownership of veterinary practices, the service to the consumer has deteriorated and the cost of that service has increased.  Leaving that aside, the unambiguous reality is that the Veterinary Council has no regulatory control over the operators and lay operators are now the beneficial owners of a number of veterinary practices in this country.  That is a very fundamental point and is what has caused us to bring forward this legislation.</p> <p>  While I accept the animal remedies regulation is outside the Veterinary Council's sphere of regulation, it is central to this as well.  As a committee, we have been discussing animal medicines, in particular the availability of non-prescriptive animal medicines, and the worry about resistance among animals and, more importantly, the danger of resistance to drugs for human use, as well as the over-usage of those drugs.  The Department&rsquo;s view is that it wants to regulate the availability of those remedies very significantly.</p> <p>  We now have a situation where lay people are able to purchase drugs and keep them in their control, and the Veterinary Council has no regulatory control over those people.  This happened in Northern Ireland, where a vet was locked out of the practice where he worked and kept away from the drugs that were in the practice.  We have physical evidence of where this has happened.  While I accept the animal remedies regulation is in the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Veterinary Council&rsquo;s regulatory powers over drugs and the usage of drugs, in my view, are seriously diminished when veterinarians are not in ownership of the practice.</p> <p>  Ms Muldoon said in her statement that ownership was never in the legislation but the previous position was that a veterinary practice in a commercial premises must be wholly owned by veterinary practitioners.  The Veterinary Practice Act operates in conjunction with the code of professional conduct governing the veterinary profession, and that is the statement that was made, namely, the commercial premises have to be completely owned by veterinary practitioners.</p> <p>  I do not want to get into a civil war with the witnesses and I would not see that as in any way constructive in the scrutiny of this legislation.  I have been focused on this since the Oireachtas meetings we had and, before that, when representations were made to us by stakeholders about their unhappiness at what was happening in the interpretation of the legislation by the Veterinary Council.  My view is that the Veterinary Council, in changing the interpretation of the legislation, operated outside its remit.  If legislation was to be changed from how it had been operating for the previous 13 or 14 years, it should have been done with amending legislation and that should have been done by the Oireachtas.  If the Veterinary Council was unhappy with the legislation, it should have proposed to the Department and to the Government that it wanted that legislation amended.  Changing the interpretation of it was, in my view, outside its remit.</p> <p>  As I said, we have this legislation and we are doing pre-legislative scrutiny of it today.  With the last witnesses, I read out different European Court of Justice decisions which clearly state that, as a state, we have the remit and the authority to make changes and to make any profession restrictive, if we want.  It has been done in Germany, where legislation has been brought in for pharmacies, which is not far removed from what we are talking about, to ensure there is a ban on outside ownership and that there is job-related independence of the pharmacist.</p><p>That is done in Germany so we are very much in line with EU law in bringing forward this amendment Bill.  As I said, the principal reason for bringing the Bill forward is to ensure the VCI will have the authority to regulate the operators in the industry.  As it stands, the VCI has not got authority over the owners.  I think that is clear.  They are lay operators and the council does not have authority over them.  The protection of the consumer, animal health and welfare and public health must be paramount.  This Bill will reinforce the powers of the VCI to regulate the industry in the interest of all the aspects I mentioned.</p><p> The VCI representatives have made it clear they cannot come in here and dictate to us on what is a policy issue and I respect that.  They have come in to give their views on what the impact of the Bill will be and that is fine.  I would say clearly that protecting public health by limiting the sale and supply of critically important prescription drugs to veterinary practitioners and pharmacists and ensuring the independence of veterinary practitioners and their practice of veterinary medicine are, in my view as a legislator, two very important things to do.  This amendment to the legislation will in my view ensure the VCI has the regulatory power to do that.  As it stands at the moment I am convinced the council has no regulatory authority over lay operators.</p><p> There are an awful lot of other issues regarding career paths for young vets.  They will see that corporates taking over practices will curtail their career progression and these are obviously all important issues as well, but human health and the control of medicines is paramount.  These are my principle reasons for bringing forward the Bill but as I said there are other reasons.  We in this country have been very fortunate to have an excellent veterinary service over generations at a reasonable cost.  While we have issues in some isolated rural areas with the availability of vets for large animal practices, I am very clear in my mind that lay ownership of veterinary practices will actually hinder the entry of young veterinarians into the sector.</p><p> Lay corporates will target the more lucrative practices.  With some practices that mix small animals and large, the small animal work keeps the practice viable and if that is taken away by a competitor that has no interest in large animals it is going to make it harder to provide services in rural areas.  Vets will tell one it is the small animal work that subsidises the other side of the business.  I think we all agree ensuring public health is protected is paramount.  That is my reason for bringing forward this Bill.</p><p> Some people will say we have corporates in now and ask what we are going to do with them.  Again, there are cases in France where practices have been delisted.  Corporates were set up and the French authorities delisted them so in my view that is something that can be addressed and overcome.</p><p> What we as a committee must decide is whether this Veterinary Practice (Amendment) Bill, which would confine ownership of veterinary practices to veterinarians, is in the best interests of public health and animal health and welfare, whether it protects the consumer and whether it is the best possible way to ensure a 24-hour service is provided at a reasonable cost to the consumers vets deliver that service to.  I am very much of the view this is the way forward for us.  As I said, we have seen other countries which have corporates taking over practices in rural areas and the level of service has declined to such an extent that animal welfare has become as serious issue.  I do not want to see us descending to that.  I am first and foremost a farmer and I always had a very good relationship with my veterinary practice.  The services practices provide, virtually at the drop of a hat, must be admired.  That we have such a service provided to us is the envy of other sectors.</p><p> This amendment Bill will ensure that service is protected and that the VCI has the regulatory power to ensure public health and animal health and welfare are protected to the utmost.  As I said, I fully accept the council representatives cannot pass a view on the Bill and that it is our job as legislators to do that.  I accept the representatives can come in and point to where they see issues with the impact of this Bill.  We have been discussing the best way to proceed on this for three or four years now .  I am convinced this amendment will deliver what we want for our citizens and also for the veterinary profession.</p></speech>

In that regard, I must outline the role of the council in regulating the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing by the individuals who deliver that service all around the country.  The VCI's role is in terms of safeguarding our register to ensure any person on it is fit, suitable and suitably qualified and educated.  We accredit and approve the programmes of education such as veterinary medicine in UCD and the veterinary nursing courses around the country.  Members may have some experience of these from relatives graduating from them.  All these inputs work to support the standards, from continuing veterinary education throughout the career of any vet and veterinary nurse, to the code of conduct which is binding on any vet or veterinary nurse in the country.  All these tools available to us as a regulator help to support the strong standards we enjoy in the country.<br/><br/>Regardless of any model of regulation, be it on the individual, a veterinary practice or on ownership, no regulator will be able to control the deliver of services <i>per se.</i>They are market matters.  Regardless of the preferred model of regulation, that cannot be controlled.  The current model is similar to that enjoyed by the medical, dental and pharmaceutical professions.  Regardless of the model or regulation, which these Houses will ultimately determine, the role for the VCI as regulator is to ensure we can effectively regulate those standards, as we have been doing for many years, and that his country and all the consumers and farmers around the country, and ultimately society, benefit from those high standards enjoyed in the regulation of vets and vet nurses by the council, through all the means available to us.</p></speech>

It is clear to me lay owners are outside the VCI's remit and that it has no power to regulate them.  I can give an instance where a lay operator owned a practice and the vet he had working there left and that practice continued to sell drugs even after that vet had left the practice.  For a two-month period there was no vet working in that practice.</p><p>This clearly shows that the Veterinary Council is not able to regulate lay owners of veterinary practices in the way it would want to.  That is the point I was making.  I do not expect the council to be able to ensure that there is a service in every part of the country.  That is not the council's job and people will decide, mostly for financial reasons, whether an area is viable.  Thankfully, it is not yet the case that there are areas without a veterinary practitioner.</p></speech>

We have a fair amount of information about the number of vets.  The shine of the profession has not been impacted and it is as popular as ever.  We have one programme of veterinary medicine in the country.  Currently, there are 3,175 vets on our register, 28% of whom qualified abroad.  There is a significant appeal to the profession and high levels of demand across it, so much so that we see many entrants to our register who have qualified abroad.  I will cite a statistic that might be of relevance or interest to the committee: some 55% of people who joined the register in 2020 qualified abroad.  We are seeing significant numbers joining our register from programmes of veterinary medicine outside of Ireland.  That speaks to the continuing high level of interest in and demand for entry into the profession.</p></speech>

I will start where Ms Muldoon finished and ask her to explain matters to me as someone who does not fully understand how this works.  She stated that the council ensured "the highest standards of veterinary medicine in the regulation and management of the professions."  Is it the case that, as Deputy Cahill said, it is the council's job to regulate the individual registered vet as opposed to the entity for which he or she works?</p></speech>

We do not know who has ownership.  I cannot tell the Deputy who owns any practice in the country.  There are approximately 770 veterinary practice premises, all of which operate following the issuing of a certificate of suitability by the Veterinary Council to an individual registered with us.</p> <p>  As to how we regulate, individuals join the register after being proofed or assessed by the Veterinary Council as being suitably educated and qualified, as being of sufficiently good standing if they have worked abroad, for example, if they have encountered disciplinary matters, and as continuing their veterinary education, given that, regardless of whether vets have been qualified for five, ten, 20 or 40 years, they must maintain their competence and skill to ensure they can deliver a strong service.  We also have a code of professional conduct.</p></speech>

I am sure such cases are few and far between, but what about instances of alleged misconduct or breaches of the regulations or legislation?  The council would investigate the individual vet in such an instance.</p></speech>

If they will bear with me for a moment, I will quote from its code of professional conduct, prior to its amendment.  It is very specific in saying "Any veterinary practice established in commercial premises must be wholly owned by a veterinary practitioner or group of veterinary practitioners who must be fully responsible for the conduct and practice and for the ethical and legal obligations falling upon its veterinary practitioners."  It also states "The attention of veterinary practitioners is directed to section 54(2) of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 which prohibits the practice of veterinary surgery or medicine by corporate bodies."  That was then.  Perhaps we can have some discussion on this.  I want to question the witnesses initially about the position then before moving on to the present.  That was the VCI's code of practice and its interpretation of the Act.  How did it police that at the time?  What would it have done if a corporate had appeared at that time or if the VCI had seen corporate ownership?  The VCI has said here today that it has no control over ownership but in that code of practice, it specifically said that it was responsible for ownership.  It was telling the veterinary, agricultural and corporate worlds who could own a practice and who could not.  If a matter is included in the VCI's code of professional practice, it has responsibility for it.  It has to do what it says on the tin.  How did the VCI police that issue then?  What interactions did it have with veterinary practice owners?  At that time, when the VCI admitted this was part of its role, how did it know who owned veterinary practices?  The witnesses know the point I am trying to make.  I will move onto the situation post the amendments in a second.</p></speech>

I fully accept that was in the code of conduct prior to 2018 but, to the question of whether the council could have taken any action against any individual practice whether veterinary-owned or otherwise at that time, the answer is "No" because the legislation does not give us the power to do so.</p></speech>

As far as I can see, it effectively deregulated the ownership of veterinary practice.  Deputy Cahill is now trying to regulate it again.  The council moved off the field.  It actually usurped the function of the Oireachtas.  It deregulated ownership because, based on its own code of practice, it was the regulator.  It moved off the field and changed its code of professional conduct based on outside legal opinion, an interpretation of an Act of the Oireachtas, a law of the land.  Did the council consult with the Oireachtas, the Oireachtas legal team, the Attorney General or the Department?  Where are their opinions?</p></speech>

The Veterinary Council of Ireland can only enforce the legislation we have.  I fully accept that at the time, an interpretation of the legislation was reflected in the code of conduct, whether correctly or incorrectly.  That was then clarified in legal advices given to the council to the effect that the legislation does not speak to ownership.  The council is a statutory body and can only use the powers given to us by Leinster House.  Once legal advice that the Veterinary Council of Ireland did not have powers in respect of ownership was received, the correct process for the council was to reflect that position, which is what it did.  This did cause consternation.  In hindsight, the Grant Thornton report and the associated consultation and engagement with the stakeholders was very helpful.  That has now been put in place.  That report will be very helpful not only to the Veterinary Council of Ireland, but also to this committee.  The issue is very divisive.  We know that.  Our role is to regulate effectively.  That is what we have been doing and what we will continue to do with any legislation that is in place.</p></speech>

Does Ms Muldoon see where I am coming from when I say that the VCI deregulated ownership by changing its code of professional practice?  There is nobody there to regulate it now and the VCI previously had it in its code of practice.  Rightly or wrongly it was perceived that anyone who would go to find out who regulates ownership would reach the VCI's code of professional practice and conclude that it was the regulator.  People would assume that the VCI's code of practice was so definitive on ownership that it must be the regulator.  Ms Muldoon is saying that while that was in the VCI's code of practice it had no interest in ownership and it was not regulating it.  At least the VCI was saving the industry from corporates because people would see that and assume the VCI was the regulator.  Therefore the VCI deregulated ownership.</p></speech>

The VCI interpreted that in a particular way.  When one looks at all the legislation at no stage does it speaks to ownership.  It is arguably no different to other legislation for professional regulation but none of the Acts speak to ownership and so the VCI can only reflect the powers it has which are given to it by Members of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

We have to regulate with all the powers and regulatory tools that are provided to us.  We are an effective regulator and we will continue in that, armed with the regulatory tools to allow us to do what we need to do in the public interest to make sure standards in the practice of veterinary medicine and nursing remain strong.  I cannot comment on whether the regulation of ownership is advisable or not because whatever legislation is in place has to be enforced by the VCI.  It would be inappropriate for the VCI to make a comment on policy because those matters are squarely reserved for these fine Houses.</p></speech>

More specifically, going back to the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, which according to the report of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission would appear to prohibit vets from incorporating.  I am conscious that Ms Muldoon said that the VCI does not have the details on the incorporation of any practices.  Was there ever a feeling on behalf of the VCI, based on what was in the 2005 Act, that it should have those details, given that a lot of practices have probably built up valuable property over time?  In most instances practices probably have a property company and a trading entity, which would be the practice itself.  Surely some of those practices would have been operating outside of the remit of the 2005 Act, even before we come to lay operators coming in?</p></speech>

Neither do we hold any information on the ownership of any practice.  The elements the Deputy sets out are not visible to us because we do not hold that information.  I cannot say that would not have been an issue in 2010, 2015 or 2020 because at no point did we ever gather that information or would we have had the power to do so.</p></speech>

If there was a specific section in the 2005 Act that said that practices should not be incorporating then the VCI probably should have been doing that at the time.  I accept that it was not being done.  I will ask Ms Muldoon an easy question to finish up with.  There are 3,175 vets and 28% of them would have qualified abroad.  Some 55% of new entrants studied abroad.  There is a case to be made that we should probably have an additional route into veterinary in Ireland.</p></speech>

Without question there is strong demand for people to get into the profession.  We know there is a popular and well-regarded programme of veterinary medicine in Ireland but ultimately there is only programme of veterinary medicine here so it might be a matter for the committee or the Department to consider further.</p></speech>

Ms Muldoon will not comment on whether there is an issue pertaining to the regulation of owners or not.  I want to go back to the point on the regulation of individual vets.  Does it operate on the same basis as the system that the Irish Medical Council has?  Does the VCI have the power to strike off a vet for misconduct?</p></speech>

The VCI is strong in enforcing the standards through the code.  In 2020, for example, one vet was erased from the register and four vets were suspended.  Removal from practice is a fairly significant sanction as it involves the loss of livelihood for a time, all of which is supervised by the High Court once censure is imposed.</p></speech>

Members and others participating in the meeting room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contacting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and they will note that every second seat has been removed to facilitate social distancing.  I urge those attending not to move any chair from its current position and to also maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for full co-operation on this.  Members participating in the meeting remotely are required to do so from within the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  The purpose of this meeting is an engagement with the Workplace Relations Commission on resourcing and capacity.  Since the establishment of the committee, the resourcing and capacity of the Workplace Relations Commission and how it addresses issues facing migrant workers have been raised on a number of occasions.  I am pleased we have an opportunity today to discuss this matter with Mr. Liam Kelly, director general, Mr. John Kelly, director of information, and Mr. Brendan Hogan, assistant principal officer and regional manager, Workplace Relations Commission, and from the International Transport Workers Federation, which was recently in contact with the committee regarding this matter, Mr. Michael O'Brien, fisheries campaign lead.  This discussion is focused solely at a general level.  The committee has no remit to discuss or refer to cases relating to any individual employer or employee.  I request that members and witnesses respect this throughout the meeting.</p> <p>  Before beginning I will notify the witnesses about parliamentary privilege and explain some limitations to that privilege in the practice of the Houses in regard to references that might be made to other persons in evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, some of today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The opening statements have been circulated to members.  I thank the Workplace Relations Commission for the comprehensive briefing material it submitted, which has been also circulated to members.  I now invite Mr. Liam Kelly to make his opening statement on behalf of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.231" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021102000002#A00300"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and the committee for the invitation to appear before them and to have the opportunity to outline the important work of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, its resourcing and, in particular, its statutory functions and work in relation to vulnerable workers.  As mentioned by the Cathaoirleach, I accompanied by officials of the WRC, Mr. John Kelly, director of information, inspection and enforcement division, and Mr. Brendan Hogan, inspector regional manager, with particular responsibility for fisheries.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the commission plays an important role in Irish society in terms of fair and proper treatment of people in workplaces and in the non-discriminatory delivery of services.  In carrying out this role, staff of the commission interact with people and businesses in many ways.  They deal daily with employees, employers, trade unions, employer bodies and other representative bodies in the private and public sector and with persons who feel they have been discriminated against by service providers simply because of who they are.  From a service point of view, our functions focus on maintaining industrial relations stability through assisting collective bargaining, mediating and adjudication in individual disputes, whether work or service delivery related, identifying and raising awareness of good practice, improving industrial and employment relations generally and promoting, monitoring and enforcing compliance with employments as defined in Irish legislation.  The commission has offices in Dublin, Cork, Ennis, Sligo and Carlow, and following significant investment over the past number of years, the full range of commission services are available in each location.  </p> <p>  The commission has a staff complement of 206 whole-time equivalent civil servants, who are staff of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  These resources are supplemented by a further 42 external adjudication officers who are contracted to assist the adjudication service dispose of adjudication complaints on a case-by-case basis.  There has been a 25% increase in our staffing resources since the establishment of the commission in October 2015.  This increase has been required to service increasing levels of demand and service expansion.  The extra resources to date have been assigned, in the main, to adjudication at administrative level and adjudication officer level and in areas such as ICT-corporate, the legal division, mediation and the inspection services.  In terms of inspection, provision for the assignment of an additional ten inspectors was made in the context of the budget allocation for the commission in 2022.  It is likely that these will be assigned and operational in the near future.  The overall resource requirement of inspectors will be reviewed further with the Department next year.</p> <p>  In terms of its activities this year, the WRC has continued to provide most of its services remotely, with the exception of on-site inspections, which have combined important work on monitoring the application of the return to work safely protocol with the commission's statutory functions in relation to employment rights.  Separately, in line with Government guidelines, commission staff have returned to their offices on a staggered and phased basis since 20 September 2021 and some face-to-face hearings and conciliations have taken place in that time, again in line with Government health guidelines. </p> <p>  If I may, I would like to outline to the committee the work of the commission and, more specifically, how it delivered its services during the challenges posed by the pandemic.</p><p>The commission&rsquo;s information and customer service unit provides information to employees, employers and citizens generally by way of an information line which deals with over 50,000 calls annually and might deal with 60,000 this year.  The WRC website, information leaflets, presentations to stakeholders and targeted social media campaigns are also provided.</p><p> In any given year, the commission&rsquo;s conciliation service works with parties to collective disputes to assist their resolution and some 85% of such disputes are resolved at conciliation.  The service has remained active at those demand levels throughout the pandemic and has provided this service primarily remotely and equally successfully, albeit in circumstances that make it more challenging for the parties to engage as closely as they might do in person.  The issues in dispute have largely reflected the current economic and company level circumstances.  Some 1 million employees are encompassed by these negotiations annually. </p><p> In a similar manner, the commission offers mediation in individual disputes, both by telephone and in person, and, more recently, virtually.  These assist parties to resolve matters themselves without the need to have them dealt with at what can sometimes be a challenging adjudication hearing.</p><p> The commission works with trade unions, employer bodies and all stakeholders in publishing codes of practice and works with employees and employers to inculcate good practice around fairness and the proper conduct of industrial relations and the observance of employment rights at company level.</p><p> Specific complaint referrals to the adjudication service increased by 50% between 2016 and 2019 and required the additional resources to manage this demand, as mentioned earlier.  While this demand tapered slightly in 2020, the volume received in that year still represented the second highest total received in any year since establishment.</p><p> After the pandemic hit, the WRC quickly introduced a service delivery model that comprised virtual and in-person hearings.  While the initial impact of Covid-19 on scheduling hearings was significant, by early 2021 the weekly number of hearings scheduled had returned to pre-pandemic levels and the number of hearings taking place is now some 30% to 40% higher in any given week than was the case pre-Covid.  This scheduling level is challenging for the WRC and the parties but it will enable to the WRC to return to pre-pandemic equilibrium in the near future.</p><p> Since the WRC was established, the inspectorate has fully completed a total of 33,000 inspections, recovered some &euro;12 million in moneys owed to employees and pursued compliance to prosecution stage in almost 600 cases.  In addition to carrying out its employment legislation inspection and enforcement role, the WRC inspectorate continues to carry out checks to ensure compliance with the Government&rsquo;s return to work safely protocol.</p><p> In its invitation, the committee indicated that it would be considering how the commission addresses issues relating to migrant workers.  With the permission of members, I will outline the statutory functions and work of the commission in this critically important area.  A key component of the WRC&rsquo;s mandate is to ensure that employees are aware of their rights under Irish employment law.  For migrant workers, information and knowledge is key.  The WRC website is translatable into 108 different languages and publications specific to migrant workers have been translated into up to ten key languages.  Social media plays an important role and the WRC has run many campaigns on social media to assist migrant workers.  For example, this summer the WRC participated in a Europe-wide campaign on Twitter targeting seasonal workers and prospective employers in the horticultural sector in Ireland.  This was interlinked with a large number of inspections carried out in this sector throughout the campaign.  A similar campaign on social media targeting the hospitality sector was carried out over September and October as the sector reopened.</p><p> In matters relating to migrant workers, the commission also works closely with Departments and international bodies, such as the International Labour Organization, the European Labour Authority, Europol and the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority in the UK, as well as with important actors including the International Transport Workers Federation, the Citizens Information Board, the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, embassies and others.  In addition, as part of their work, all inspectors are trained in identifying indicators of human trafficking.</p><p> Since its establishment the WRC has carried out inspections in over 60 meat plants.  Just under half were non-compliant and the main areas of non-compliance involved employment records, employment of persons without permission and breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act.  As part of the seasonal workers campaign mentioned earlier, some 28 inspections have been carried out and contraventions have been identified in the areas of national minimum wage, record-keeping, public holiday entitlements and terms of employment.</p><p> The WRC also participates in European campaigns co-ordinated by Europol under the European multidisciplinary platform against criminal threats, EMPACT, programme.  Sectors which Ireland has identified as of concern include nail bars and pop-up car washes.  As part of this programme, in May 2019 inspectors carried out 169 inspections focused mainly on labour exploitation in the car wash and nail bar sectors.  This operation also involved the Garda, officers of the then Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p> In the fishing industry, since the introduction of the atypical worker permission scheme in 2016, which allows the employment of non-EEA workers on whitefish vessels over 15 m in length, the WRC has carried out 490 inspections of the 170 vessels in the scheme.  To date, some 20 prosecutions have been brought against fishing vessel owners for offences under employment legislation.  However, unlike typical inspections, WRC inspectors do not have responsibility for enforcing compliance with rest period and maximum working hour requirements in the fishing sector.  That role is carried out by the marine surveyors of the Department of Transport.</p><p> I thank the Cathaoirleach and the members of the committee for their kind attention and am very happy to assist the committee in its deliberations in any way I can.</p></speech>

I will take the statement I issued in advance as read, for the most part, rather than reading it out in full because that would take more than the eight minutes I have been allocated.  I want to make this an interactive session, if possible, and respond to some of the points that have been made by Mr. Kelly from the WRC.  The statement goes into some recent historical context and I want to take time to acknowledge the pioneering work of my predecessor, Mr. Ken Fleming, who put the plight of migrant fishers from outside the EEA on the political map in this State.  The recent historical context also shows that my predecessor made strenuous efforts to try to make the atypical work permit scheme work in the interests of fishers to give them a liveable income and a bearable work regime.</p> <p>  It is by accident rather than by design that the department of law at Maynooth University yesterday published a report based on a qualitative study comprising 24 in-depth interviews with migrant workers, giving the up-to-date situation.  It is a coincidence that was released yesterday.  There was fairly widespread media coverage of the report.  The Maynooth law department has circulated that report to all Deputies and Senators.  The report paints a picture of the five and a half years the atypical work permit scheme has been in existence and concludes that the situation has not fundamentally changed in that time.  I cannot contest the various statistics that have been presented by Mr. Kelly from the WRC in terms of its overall performance across the entirety of the Irish workforce but there are legislative and operational impediments to achieving justice, not only for fishers.  I will make some points about the legislative reforms I believe are necessary and which have implications for a wider cohort than just migrant fishers.  That will be the main focus on my address.</p> <p>  I will begin with the case of undocumented migrant workers, especially fishers, who do not have the right to have their cases heard by adjudication at the WRC because the position taken is that an undocumented worker's employment relationship with an employer is not legal to begin with.  The only route that has been open for the past seven years to vindicate the rights of undocumented workers who have been cheated of wages has been a provision in section 2B of the Employment Permits Act whereby the initiative is taken by the WRC at the behest of the Minister to conduct an investigation before taking a civil case against an employer to try to recover wages.</p> <p>  There is a case study that I cannot go into in immense detail, for obvious reasons, but committee members are aware of the case because I emailed them about it in July.  That case has brought me here to address the committee.  Through parliamentary questions and a freedom of information request related to that case, we have managed to establish that the provision in the Employment Permits Act has yielded something for an undocumented worker in either one case or no cases.  My assessment is that if a documented worker came to the International Transport Workers Federation or any trade union movement, the quality of testimony they would provide to us would be of comparable strength to that provided to the WRC in the case in question.</p><p>However, it seems to me that they set an enormously high bar, probably beyond reasonable doubt, before they decide to take a civil case and hence, have not taken civil cases in the course of the last seven years, whereas we would take our chances in bringing a case to adjudication and on the balance of probabilities.  Certainly, we have got results in that forum.<br/><br/>It is something that could potentially be resolved by the employer-sanctioned directive.  Ireland and Denmark are the only two states that have not transposed the directive.  I sent a link to the committee containing analysis in advance of the meeting.  Unfortunately, given the way many labour inspectorates across Europe, and also in Ireland, operate, it can be very difficult for an undocumented migrant worker to engage with the WRC or via WRC inspection because there can be consequences for his or her status in the country.  That was not always the case.  When the WRC's predecessor, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, was in operation, there was what we would describe as a firewall between the labour inspectorate and what the Garda and the immigration authorities would do, which enabled undocumented migrants to engage with the NERA with a great deal more confidence than is currently the case.<br/><br/>Moving on, there are also issues in obtaining full justice for documented atypical workers.  I refer to the cognisable period under the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  What that basically means is that if any of the majority of us had an issue with our employer, for example, in respect of unfair dismissal or unpaid wages, we would not hang about for longer than six months.  In all likelihood, we would take the case and seek redress fairly promptly.  That approach works in most instances.  The reality is that because of the way the atypical work permit scheme is constituted, as a visa scheme with exemption, the exemption being that the worker is tied to a particular vessel owner, even though a documented migrant atypical fisher may be aware that he is being underpaid, he will not feel that he can take a case with confidence to the WRC while he is tied to that employer, because to do so would precipitate the ending of the employment relationship.  It is just a simple matter for the vessel owner to write to the Department of Justice and say that the employment relationship has been terminated.  The fisher is then left with a small window of opportunity to try to find an alternative employer to engage him under the terms of the scheme or he will become undocumented.  There are hundreds of undocumented fishers working in the Irish fleet, who entered under the atypical scheme and fell out of it for various reasons, not just the reason I described previously, but sometimes through injury.  <br/><br/>The point we wish to make is that the cognisable period does not work in practice.  I provided the committee with details of a particular anonymised case study, which was reported in yesterday's edition of the<i>Irish Independent</i>, of a pending WRC case where the claim we are bringing relates a four-year period.  Unfortunately, if the WRC rules in the claimant fisher's favour, at best, he will get a small fraction of the moneys that he is due because of the cognisable period time limits.<br/><br/>On the working time at sea directive, the issue is that there is nowhere to go to seek a remedy.  The directive is not a gift from the EU; it is the product of an international campaign waged by seafaring unions around the world that was taken on board by the International Labour Organization and translated into a convention.  There was engagement at EU level between seafarer unions and employer representatives, from which an EU directive arose.  It has been transposed in a botched fashion by the Department of Transport, to the effect that there is no way for a fisher to seek a remedy.  Mr. Kelly, of the WRC, has referred to the fact that the Marine Survey Office has the responsibility to prosecute cases for excessive work hours, but it still remains the case that other working time legislation issues can be heard by the WRC.  The directive must be retransposed correctly so that we can seek an effective remedy from the WRC.  We will embark upon judicial review proceedings if we cannot get that.<br/><br/>My time is running out, so I will make my concluding remarks.  One cannot contest the statistics provided by the WRC in terms of the number of inspections it has done in the fishing sector in the course of the lifetime of the atypical work permit scheme.  It has done over 400 such inspections.  Within that 400, a high rate of non-compliance was found, with the WRC detecting over 300 infractions of various types.  The WRC has stated that 20 prosecutions have resulted from the infractions.  I would say that where there have been convictions, they are simply not dissuasive, to the effect that there is repeat offending within the sector.  While there has been a provision, from the outset of the atypical scheme, for vessel owners to be banned from availing of the scheme if they are found to have been guilty of various infractions, not a single vessel owner has been banned in the course of the five and a half years.  We lack dissuasive penalties.<br/><br/>On the question of proactive inspections that are carried out, while infractions have been detected by the WRC, things can be missed.  To give an example of another anonymised case study, a recent WRC case for unpaid wages, the respondents referred to the fact that six weeks into the engagement of two Filipino fishers, a WRC inspection was carried out at the quayside, and nothing was revealed by the two fishers in respect of their dissatisfaction with the job.  Come on; what fisher is going to reveal to a State inspector, after six weeks on the job, that he is dissatisfied with his working conditions?  I am sure that example could be replicated many times over.<br/><br/>I have identified some very simple amendments that could be made to a number of the Acts that would better equip the likes of the International Transport Workers Federation, ITF, and SIPTU, which has some pending WRC and Labour Court cases, to achieve full justice for migrant fishers in terms of unpaid wages.  Even if those amendments were made that the working time at sea directive was correctly transposed, it would enable us to achieve justice after the abuses have taken place.  Really, the core abuse arises from the employment relationship, which I realise is a matter for the Department of Justice.  However, what we need, at minimum, is sector-wide permits that give fishers the freedom to change employers within the sector if they find that their working conditions are unbearable.  We must liberate them from such situations.</p></speech>

I have a few questions.  I am looking at the report published by Maynooth University in this area.  It is a decent report.  One of the key recommendations of the report, recommendation 3, states: "The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and the Marine Survey Office of the Department of Transport (MSO) should perform more outreach work and speak directly to migrant fishers in private as a matter of course".  I know that Mr. Kelly has outlined details of the cases and the numbers and all of that, but we cannot lose sight of the fact that we are dealing with people.</p> <p>  An obvious deficiency has been identified in the report.  Perhaps Mr. Kelly can take us through how migrant workers are dealt with by the WRC.  Is it routine to bring an interpreter when carrying out inspections?  The report found that that is not happening.  I would say that the WRC is already limiting its capacity to elicit the sort of information that it might need if the inspectors do not have an interpreter with them.  I ask Mr. Kelly to talk us through how this happens and how the inspections take place.  The Maynooth University report has found that the inspections are not necessarily working.  In Mr. Kelly's opening statement, he said that 20 prosecutions have been brought against fishing vessel owners.  I know, from talking to people in the industry, that the vast majority of employers, and indeed, any decent employer, want this scheme to work and want the workers to be protected.  However, it seems to me that a core of rogue employers are not being dealt with.  The report has found that they are employing workers who are not being spoken to in private, which I find quite unusual, and in some cases, they may not be able to speak even if the opportunity to speak in private is there, because there is no access to an interpreter.  I ask Mr. Kelly to comment on that first, followed by Mr. O'Brien.</p></speech>

The Deputy has raised a few key issues.  One is the use of interpreters.  The Oireachtas joint committee previously suggested that we should also use interpreters on the quayside and we are open to doing that.</p><p>The context of inspections can be challenging.  We may get short notice of a trawler having arrived at a quayside during the middle of the night and we have to mobilise our inspectors to go there.  It can be very difficult to organise interpreters, particularly where a number of nationalities may be on board.  That is a key issue.</p></speech>

On that specific point, I understand that if a vessel arrives during the middle of the night it might be difficult to scramble a team together, much less a team of interpreters equipped with all the language skills.  At a guess, however, the vast majority of inspections do not take place in the middle of night.  Where one has notice of the arrival of a vessel and that will account for the majority of cases, there will be an opportunity to have interpreters.  In the small number of cases where inspections are carried out in the middle of the night there may be difficulty getting interpreters but in the instance of routine inspections, interpreters are still not available.  As Mr. Kelly said, a recommendation that they would be available was made previously.  I am struggling to understand why interpreters are not used when they could be used.  I appreciate there are instances where it may not be feasible.</p></speech>

Mr. O&rsquo;Brien referred to how there may be occasions when people are reluctant to talk to us on the quayside.  We acknowledge that is true.  In those instances, we provide contact details in order that we can be contacted subsequently.  Any subsequent meetings with fishers are held with interpreters present.  We recognise parties may be of the view that if they talk to us through interpreters on the quayside, this may in some way highlight the fact they are talking to WRC inspectors.  We are sensitive to all of that and recognise this is a very challenging situation.  We are examining whether we should review our policy and have interpreters available when we know when a ship is due to dock and the language skills that will be required.  We are quite happy to report back to the committee on that.</p></speech>

We dealt with an issue related to work permits at the committee previously and while information on them was on the WRC's website in a range of languages, which is welcome, the signposts signalling people to go to the website was only in one language.  The information is good when one accesses the website but if an individual cannot access it, it is of very little use.  Will the inspectors bring with them material on workers' rights in different languages?</p></speech>

All inspectors bring with them a multilingual questionnaire.  As we talk to the fishers we take them through the various questions on their rights, for example, do they know what their rights are and what they are getting.  That is in their native language.  We do what we can in those circumstances.  I will consider the broader use of interpreters and am happy to do so.  It is clearly an issue which has been raised by the International Transport Workers Federation, ITF, the recent Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, GRETA, report and the Migrants Rights Centre Ireland report, which are very good reports.  We have to consider that.</p></speech>

Given it is a small scale sector and pockets of people can be geographically spread around the country, it is apparent we need to think about and do more to reach them close to where they live.  While social media is an important tool, we cannot beat presentations or talking to fishers face to face.  It is our intention to work with trusted parties such as the ITF, Citizen Information and migrant rights groups to set up town hall meetings, if possible, where we can outline what people&rsquo;s rights are on board vessels and hear any issues they have in order that we can advice how best they can address them.</p></speech>

I cannot do my work on a day to day basis without having interpretation at my disposal.  The Egyptians all come from a small number of fishing villages close to the port of Alexandria.  They speak Egyptian Arabic.  The Ghanaians, who are another big group, speak a language called Twi.  Some speak English, as it is a former British colony, but not all of them do.  The Filipinos tend to come from the island of Cebu and speak Cebuano, not Tagalog which is the dominant language in the Philippines.  We need to use literature in those languages and have interpretation at our disposal.</p> <p>  Mr. Kelly mentioned in his opening statement a Twitter-based campaign that was run during the summer.  It was done in English but WhatsApp and Facebook are the platforms to use to communicate with these people.  Twitter is not their platform of choice.  I raised that in an email with the WRC when the campaign was being announced.  </p> <p>  Another issue is that the Filipinos and Ghanaians tend to live on the vessels; the Egyptians do not.  That makes them very difficult to reach.  My natural comfort zone is to have big town hall meetings to address everybody at once.  It is not always possible to reach everybody.  What may work better when doing inspections is to hand out, for example, a business card with a hotline or contact number that would allow a three-way WhatsApp phone conversation between the WRC inspector, the fisher and an interpreter at a time that suits all three.  That would be a much better way to proceed.</p> <p>  It would be helpful if all the fishers who came to Ireland under the atypical scheme were made aware of the ITF's existence.   Some of them are aware of it but because we lack, mandatory recognition for trade unions, or anything like it, I have to engage in sleuthing and go out and find these people.  I even have to go to Senegal in West Africa this Sunday for a week-long conference during which I will have face to face discussions with the Ghanaian seafarers union to try to get an information campaign running in the Ghanian fishing communities in order that some of them would engage with the ITF before they come to Ireland.  In that way, we could give them some inkling of vessel owner they would potentially work for and advise them to beware of the various pitfalls.  These are the measures we have to take because we do not have the access we need to these fishers before they set foot in Ireland.</p></speech>

That is in the context of 170 vessels.  I am interested to hear about repeat offenders.  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien outlined that the provision that exists for repeat offenders to be barred from the scheme has never been used.  Any decent employer in the fishing industry would want the scheme to work and would show solidarity with those migrant workers.  However, there is very little incentive to be a decent employer in this area if one is getting undercut all the time by employers who are not paying the proper rate.  Of the 20 prosecutions, do they relate to the same 20 people?  Twenty prosecutions in the context of 170 vessels represents 12%, which is unacceptably high.  Do the prosecutions involve the same people, and if they do, why are those people allowed access to a scheme, which, essentially, is a pipeline of cheap labour for them to exploit?  I am struggling to understand, if there are repeat offenders, why they have not been barred from scheme.  Mr. Kelly might be able to explain that to me.</p></speech>

We have done 490 inspections of 170 vessels.  Not all vessels have been inspected twice.  We return to vessels where contraventions had occurred previously and where there is a risk associated with them.  That is critical in using our resources effectively and in driving compliance within the scheme.  We return to those vessels where issues arose in the past.</p> <p>  In the context of the scheme, there is a provision where breaches occur that the vessel owner is not entitled to use the atypical scheme.  That is a matter for the Department of Justice in assigning permits.</p><p>We do not report those as breaches when we bring them to prosecution.  It is certainly something that we should examine in any review of the scheme.</p></speech>

I and Senator Gavan, who is also on this call, have used the services of the WRC as former union officials and I appreciate that it is stretched.  It does not strike me as best practice, however, to not notify the Department of Justice of breaches of a scheme it administers and for the WRC to expect that, somehow, the officials in that Department will just pick up this information in the ether.  I will put it that way, but I probably mean something a bit stronger than it not being best practice.

Mr. O'Brien referred to research carried out by the department of law at Maynooth University, MU, in his statement and subsequent remarks.  I only received the report yesterday, so I have not had the opportunity to go through it in detail.  A brief analysis of the research showed that it highlighted poor working conditions and the need to reform the atypical working scheme, which Mr. O'Brien also argues for.  The Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, has confirmed to me that the scheme will be reviewed following discussions with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Deputy English.  That development will be welcomed by all members of the committee.</p> <p>  I also noted that one of the authors of the report, Dr. Cl&iacute;odhna Murphy of the department of law at MU, stated "that inspections and policy changes have improved the industry".  Mr. O'Brien seems to have a different opinion to that.  I ask him to inform us of his views on those remarks.</p></speech>

She did acknowledge what the Senator referred to.  This research was not a hatchet job by any stretch of the imagination and a minority of the fishers whom she interviewed had better experiences and better relations with their employers.  The picture was mixed, to say the least, but predominantly it was not a good one.  I noted the response from the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, concerning the proposed review of the scheme.  I hope there will be a decent level of engagement with the ITF on what the outcome of the review will be.  We are clear that any scheme perpetuates an exclusive relationship of short-term and renewal contracts between a migrant worker and a single vessel or single employer will be a recipe for abuse and for those fishers to be taken advantage of.</p> <p>  Returning to the comment made by Deputy O'Reilly, this is not just a question of the WRC not proactively informing the Department of Justice of convictions of vessel owners.  It is the same situation with the Marine Survey Office, MSO.  Therefore, other agencies are also not feeding in information to the Department of Justice and the information on who the repeat offenders are in this area is not being centralised.  That is why no vessel owners have been banned from the scheme.</p></speech>

My first question for Mr. Liam Kelly.  Is there an EU standard in this area?  Some of the procedures outlined by Mr. O'Brien were surprising.  Is there an EU standard regarding a permit being tied to an individual vessel?  I refer as well to redress being so difficult where a contract is illegal, the issue of yellow-carding people who have used a permit scheme but then abused it and the six-month statute of limitations or "cognisable period" as it is called.  Are those procedures part of European standards or are we free to modify some of those aspects?  I ask that because there does seem to be a legislative bias here against proper enforcement of the rules.</p> <p>  My second question concerns when a permit is issued.  I presume an employee and an employer are involved in that regard.  Would that not be the time to have the big push in respect of the interpretation of what rights the employee has in that context?  Might there also be an opportunity in that regard to have a provision for some sort of compliance statement to be provided by either or both of the parties involved 12 months later in respect of what has been happening regarding the conditions of the permit?  Can we make better use of that moment to ensure that people have better access to the enforcement system?</p></speech>

I will take the questions in no particular order, if the Deputy does not mind.  Starting with the scheme, when a worker is given permission to work within atypical working scheme, some of the revisions made to it in the time since it was established now mandate that the contract of employment is provided in the fisher's native language.  A link is also provided to the WRC web page where information can be found on rights and how to file a complaint.  That information is translatable into 108 languages and there are also various leaflets available in the main languages of the countries where fishers usually come from.</p> <p>  The employment contract is also required to state explicitly the pay for the hours worked.  That is the national minimum wage.  A minimum of 39 hours must also be paid, regardless of whether fewer hours were worked.  There is also a requirement for workers to get their pay slips and the records of the hours worked.  The letter of approval that goes to the worker has a section with the employment rights explained in the fisher's native language.  In that context as well, a review was undertaken as part of the mediation agreement between the WRC and ITF in respect of it being permissible for people to transfer from a boat within the currency of the atypical working scheme.</p><p>Broadly speaking, people are informed before they become aware of what their rights are and where they can go if they feel those rights are not being observed.  I understand and accept that in some cases there may be issues with literacy and we have to work to get past that in those cases.</p><p> Turning to the cognisable period, that does not just apply to fishers.  It applies across what is called Schedule 5 cases in the Workplace Relations Act, so it applies to the national minimum wage, organisation of working time and matters such as that.  Mr. O'Brien raised that.  Insofar as the legal framework that our adjudication officers can look at, it is within six months of the notification of the complaint, and in reasonable circumstances 12 months.  In reality, in quite a lot of cases the 12 months is examined.  For example, there was a fisher case quite recently where due to the individual's language skills, the adjudicator said that in that case it absolutely should go back 12 months because the individual may not have been aware of his rights.  In instances also of what is called the Von Colson principle in terms of the organisation of working time, it may be that as a dissuasive effect up to two years' pay may be allowed in circumstances where that happens.</p><p> With regard to Europe-wide approaches to campaigns and inspections, we work closely with the European Labour Authority on campaigns on employment records.  We work bilaterally with countries to ensure that people who come here know what their rights are and who they should go to if they are being breached.  Only four weeks ago, I met Mr. Boiangiu, the director of the European Labour Authority, to outline how we might progress the process in that area around bilateral agreements and practice for inspections drawing on the work of other inspectorates across Europe.</p><p> In terms of sector-wide initiatives, from time to time we carry out what is called inspection ready campaigns.  For example, last year we met Meat Industry Ireland and outlined that if an employer is to be inspected, there are certain expectations of the employer.  There have to be accurate records and they have to be up to date.  They have to be in a particular format.  The employer needs to be able to show that payslips are given to employees and also has to list the number of employees.  We work with the sectors and that is just one example of how we can drive compliance in particular risk sectors.  I mentioned some of them in my opening statement.  They will come as no surprise to the members of the committee.</p></speech>

Is the idea of tying a person to a vessel a Europe-wide approach?  It seems to be a fundamentally flawed model.  It undermines people's rights if they are going to be indentured, or whatever the word used to be.  To what degree is there a European standard for the way in which this industry works and for enforcement?  Is there potential to identify better practice from other European countries or does Ireland have the freedom to move?  I know that once rights are conferred in one part of Europe, they automatically apply in other parts of Europe.  Is Ireland constrained in any way in seeking to change some of the features of the legislation that Mr. O'Brien identified?</p></speech>

I am not sure what the Department's or policymakers' room for manoeuvre on some of that is, but I can refer back to the committee on it.  In terms of the scheme's approach to the length of contract for fishers on boats, that is consistent with European standards or how things are done across Europe.  However, as was mentioned, the scheme will be looked again, and all these questions are absolutely appropriate for discussion in that context.</p></speech>

I am from an area where there are a number of fishermen and I am concerned about the general impression that might be given about the industry generally, for example, that abuse is widespread.  I ask Mr. Kelly and Mr. O'Brien to comment on that.  I am worried about the owners of boats and people who are doing their best to comply, who are working hard and so forth, and that the impression might be given that the entire industry is abusing workers.  Perhaps they would comment on that because it would be wrong to give that impression to the public.  Certainly, in the media and elsewhere that appears to be the wide paint brush that is being used at present.  To start with the general point, how widespread is the abuse?  Are there many people and employers who are complying and doing their best to comply?</p></speech>

We carried out 45 inspections in September, during which we found 45 contraventions which applied to 17 vessels.  In looking at the contraventions, it is important to consider what we find.  It may be that records are inadequate.  In some cases the minimum wage is being paid, but under the scheme it is required to be paid weekly and in some cases it is not and is paid, perhaps, a month in arrears.  The fisher is in receipt of the moneys, but not in the way in which the scheme was designed.  We have come across some instances in which employers have misinterpreted the scheme and have become compliant with the 39 hours minimum wage, in that it was the rate of pay for the week.  Many employers have become compliant in that regard over the time.  Yes, we find some employers who we say are more likely than others to offend and we go back to them again, but when we say that there were 45 contraventions many of them were to do with record keeping or the slow payment of wages.  That is not to say that they are not contraventions.  We take them seriously and we work with employers to make sure they become compliant, but I wish to put that as a general context.</p></speech>

We are talking about 170 to 180 vessels out of the entire fishing fleet of 1,900.  The vast majority of those would be smaller vessels, probably family owned and family run.  That is not to say that some of those vessels do not employ undocumented migrants.  They do, but our focus is on the larger vessels in the fleet.  It cannot be said, therefore, that we are arguing that the entire industry is guilty of wrongdoing.  However, a high proportion of the eligible vessels in the scheme are.  That is the plain fact.  To date, 35 fishers have been admitted into the national referral mechanism for human trafficking, including three individuals this year.  They are incontrovertible facts.  I do not know what more I can say about that as the figures for non-compliance speak for themselves.</p> <p>  With regard to the contract, the standard atypical contract provides for a 39-hour average working week.  It is true that the amendment to the scheme specified that the workers must be paid for every hour worked, but the reality we often see for those who are in the atypical scheme and who come to the ITF is that they get the &euro;350 into their bank account, but they work far more hours than that overall and there is an accumulating shortfall of wages due to them.</p><p>We can get the data from the fishing monitoring centre of the navy in terms of when the vessel is at sea and piece together and substantiate the case the fishers make to us of underpayment.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. O'Brien for his enormous work on this issue.  He is continuing the strong tradition and enormous work of Ken Fleming, my former colleague in SIPTU, who did so much to shine a light on practices in the sector.</p> <p>  My first question is to the WRC.  I thank the representatives for the documentation that was submitted.  Looking at the documentation, the number of inspections and the contravention and prosecution rates, a quick calculation suggests that across all inspections, there is a contravention rate of about 39%.  In the fishing sector, the figure is 73% for 2020.  I want to gain a better understanding of what happens in the WRC when figures such as that are seen.  What mechanisms does the commission have to communicate to the Department that contravention of the law is endemic in the sector?  I am sure there are good employers in the fishing sector but with such a high rate of contravention, what mechanisms exist to communicate with the Department?  How has the commission responded in terms of the allocation of specific inspectors to the fishing sector?</p></speech>

It is about 40% in terms of contraventions across all the sectors we cover.  Some sectors have more risk than others.  Some do not have high labour intensity or turnover, which depresses the figure.  In other sectors, the risk of contravention is higher.  We report to the Department regularly on contraventions, as well as in the annual report to the Minister.  They are fully aware of the work we do in the area and the risks.</p> <p>  In terms of the inspectors assigned to fishers, that work, given its very nature, can be dangerous at times.

There are currently seven inspectors but there were 16 at one stage.  We have lost some through attrition.  An additional four will be trained shortly to bring us to 11, which is approximately 16% of our total complement of inspectors.  They are fully trained in relation to safety at sea.  They do the proper training courses and are available to move to any port in Ireland.  While they may be based in particular counties, when we need to send inspectors to a particular port, they are available and ready to go.

If there are two boat landings, we need more.  If we are doing what you might say is a campaign in a port or region, we need all our inspectors on the ground.

A number of legislative changes need to take place.  I will pick up on the earlier question put to Mr. O'Brien on how widespread exploitation is in the sector.  Does the fishing sector have such a high level of contravention of employment law in other countries or do we have such weak legislation that it facilitates exploitation because the permit is tied to the employer in this country?  Are freewheeling employers part and parcel of the fishing sector or do we have weak or poorly drafted legislation in this country?</p></speech>

I have identified gaps in the legislation that impede the International Transport Workers Federation, as well as unions like SIPTU, which also take fisher cases, from obtaining full wage recovery.</p> <p>  On international comparisons, I am not greatly familiar with the regimes in every country.  In Scotland, a similar situation prevails but the UK system has a standard contract that provides for &pound;1,200 per month.  Once they are beyond the 13-mile limit anything goes, so the situation is quite grave there.  I will attend a meeting of the ITF's European affiliates that organise the fishing sector on 15 November in person in Brussels so I will get greater detail in terms of how we stand up compared to others.  There are issues in terms of the structure of the fishing industry here and the species fished.  That lends itself to proportionally more migrants from outside of Europe being brought into the industry than in continental Europe.</p></speech>

I refer to the Maynooth study and thank the researchers for doing it.  The headline findings were that over two thirds of the participants observed they could work between 15 and 20 hours per day.  One third reported feeling safe on the vessel, so two thirds did not feel safe.  Over half of the participants had been subjected to racial and verbal abuse.  On the point Senator Crowe made, all but two of the interviewees who had been in Ireland since before 2016 indicated that conditions in the sector had worsened overall since that time.  We cannot say it is the first time we have heard about the horrific conditions that exist for undocumented migrant fishers in Ireland.  There has been a criminal failure by the State to stand up for these workers' rights.  To get a sense of how widespread the problem is, how many undocumented fishers does Mr. O'Brien estimate work in the sector in Ireland?</p></speech>

I have engaged Bord Iascaigh Mhara about this.  It is carrying out an online survey in the English language and is depending mostly on vessel owners to disclose the composition of their crew.  Members can guess that skippers and vessel owners employing undocumented migrants will not disclose that in the survey.  I am told it is open for crew to participate but I have made the point already about the language barriers.  Basic things like Internet access and so on are extremely difficult.  I have put it to Bord Iascaigh Mhara that if it conducts a similar labour survey again, it should engage with us and we could assist in promoting the survey among various groups.  We have WhatsApp groups with the language-based communities in the sector.</p> <p>  In terms of our best guess, when the atypical scheme was conceived, the best estimate of the interdepartmental group that proposed the scheme was 500 migrant fishers in the fishing fleet five years ago.</p><p>When the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, announced he was setting the cap at 500, the immediate response of the vessel owner representative associations was to ask that it instead be set at 1,000.  That gives some idea.  Before the deadline for enrolment in the scheme passed in mid-2016, there was an amnesty phase to regularise the situation of pre-existing migrants.  Fortunately, the media furore and attention died down and we got some 250 people enrolled.  There has been a churn in the subsequent five years but the reply to the most recent parliamentary question on the subject indicated that there are approximately 230 people currently registered under the atypical scheme, spanning 180 vessels.  The reply also indicated that 45% of eligible vessels do not employ anybody under the atypical scheme.  It is like a leaving certificate maths problem trying to figure out how the 180 largest vessels in the fleet are being crewed if there are 230 atypical workers.  Each of them most likely has an Irish skipper.  There are one or two Egyptian skippers who have obtained Irish citizenship but they are very much the exception.  There are a number of EU-based share fishers from Poland and Latvia, as well as a number of non-European fishers who have obtained a stamp 4 visa for various reasons.  The numbers, however, do not add up and the best answer I can give as to how many are involved is "hundreds".</p></speech>

In regard to the cognisable period, Mr. Kelly's response to Deputy Bruton was that it can be set at 12 months in exceptional circumstances.  Even allowing for that, does he accept there is a problem whereby what may work for regularised workers may not work for others?  In the example given of the person working for four years and having an underpayment potentially of &euro;114,000, the maximum that person would get is close to &euro;30,000, which is only a quarter of what he or she would otherwise be owed.

Does Mr. Kelly agree that this presents a significant problem and means that it is, in effect, in the WRC's hands as to whether a case is pursued?  Mr. O'Brien has made the argument that the WRC seems to be operating on the basis of a very high burden of proof, probably beyond reasonable doubt, in such cases.  He claimed that, over seven years, it has taken, at most, one case relating to these matters.  Does Mr. Kelly accept that point?</p></speech>

Regarding the bar that Mr. O'Brien mentioned, I do not want to talk about the particular case to which he referred.  It was discussed with Mr. O'Brien at the meeting that was mentioned.  There are issues with that particular case in that we felt it did not have a reasonable prospect of success.  However, I would not take or extrapolate from this that we have a high bar.  Those were the circumstances of that particular case.</p></speech>

We are hearing about how widespread the problems in the industry are and how workers do not have another recourse.  Yet, the WRC has taken only one case in seven years.</p></speech>

That is how cases come to us.  One such case was the case that was mentioned and there was one other case.  On the broader issue of the difficulties for people who are undocumented in taking a case to the WRC, I acknowledge that fact.  I understand that several legislative proposals have been brought forward to see how we can move forward in that regard.</p></speech>

Round one has concluded and we will now begin the second round of questioning, starting with Senator Gavan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021102000002#H00900"><p>I thank Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Kelly for their presentations.  I am incredibly frustrated listening to what they have said.  In 2017, the predecessor to this committee, of which the Chairman and I were members, compiled a really strong report on exploitation in the fishing industry, which included 12 excellent recommendations.  The findings of the report were not contested by any member of the committee, all of whom felt very strongly about the wrongdoing in the sector.  I pay tribute to Mr. Ken Fleming in particular, who gave powerful testimony to the committee detailing shocking stories of abuse.  I am at a loss today because from what I can see, that report was put on the shelf and has been ignored by the Government.  That needs to be put on the record.  Four years on from outlining the most horrendous issues of exploitation in the industry, those 12 recommendations have been ignored.  That is appalling.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for Mr. Kelly in reference to the report.  Recommendation No. 6 was that extra funding be made available to the WRC to allow it to continue with a rigorous inspection regime of the relevant Irish fishing fleet.  Mr. Kelly indicated that the number of inspectors fell from 16 to seven and he is hoping to bring it back up to 11.  Why was the recommendation on inspector numbers, made four years ago by the predecessor to this committee, not implemented?  Why has the WRC not kept at least a minimum of 16 inspectors in place over recent years?</p></speech>

As I said, there is a training requirement for all fishing inspectors because of the safety issue.  It was not possible to increase the number to the previous level in the past couple of years.  Going back to previous discussions, we believe that, broadly speaking, we have been able fully to carry out our responsibilities in the fisher sector with the number of inspectors we have.  There is no doubt, however, that the numbers have fallen over the period referred to by the Senator.  We are currently trying to address that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.302" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021102000002#H01100"><p>I am frustrated because it was an explicit recommendation that resources be increased.  Mr. Kelly indicated that there has been an increase in general terms in WRC funding, which is welcome,  but he has also conceded that there has been a drop in the number of inspectors in what is probably the most exploitative sector anywhere across the State at present.  I want to register my disappointment in that regard.  I must move on now as I am conscious of time.</p> <p>  My second question relates to interpreters.  If I heard him correctly, Mr. Kelly indicated that the WRC is open to the use of interpreters and is looking at whether they should be available.  The fifth recommendation the committee made four years ago was that interpreters be readily available to the WRC.  Has the commission ignored that recommendation as well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.303" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021102000002#H01200"><p>Not at all.  Interpreters are readily available to us.  Perhaps I was not as clear as I might have been on that point.  We use interpreters all the time when we are following up interviews with atypical fishers or we need to talk to undocumented people who have particular issues.  Mr. O'Brien referred to a WhatsApp service, which is something we have been looking at in the context of having a conversation with fishers who require interpreters.</p><p>As I said, we have struggled with getting interpreters, maybe at short notice, on to a quayside.  I accept that this does not happen that often.  There is an issue with interpreters on the quayside and the willingness of fishers to talk to us while the interpreter is there.  We give cards to all fishers to be distributed with our contact details.  As I said, in many cases there are follow-up calls to us and we use interpreters as part of those discussions.  They are readily available to us but the point is the most recent reports suggest we should look at whether we should have interpreters at the quayside in every instance.  We must consider that seriously.</p></speech>

I apologise as I want to give Mr. Michael O'Brien an opportunity to come in again.  I really hope we will not be here again in two or four years to find this question of the number of inspectors and interpreters is still there.</p> <p>  Will Mr. O'Brien comment on the fact that we had an excellent report from this committee four years ago and it appears to me that effectively all 12 of the recommendations have been ignored?  He might tell me if I am wrong.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.306" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021102000002#J00300"><p>Exactly.  It is not just about the recommendations of the committee.  I rewatched the presentation given by my predecessor, Mr. Ken Fleming, at the time and it was pretty powerful and dramatic.  The ITF took High Court action against the State when it became apparent to us that the atypical scheme in the hands of some vessel owners was effectively a tool for human trafficking.  That resulted in a settlement agreement in April 2019 and there were approximately 20 points of reform that altered the position on paper.  For example, there were basic points like providing the contracts in the language of the fisher and a stipulation that they should be paid for every hour worked.  They had to be given some window of opportunity to change employer if they could not endure the abuse being suffered.</p> <p>  The Maynooth report published yesterday was to study in particular those fishers who worked in the sector in the course of the subsequent two and a half years.  Frankly, a significant number of vessel owners are incorrigible.  We must end the system of a tied relationship.  It is the last chance saloon for the atypical scheme and we need sector-wide visas at an absolute minimum.  Short of full trade union organisation, it would create upward pressure for pay and conditions if the fisher has some kind of mobility to leave the worst abusers in the sector.</p></speech>

Deputies O'Reilly and Paul Murphy are next.  Mr. Kelly is indicating he wishes to speak but the time in the slot has run out.  He might come in during another slot.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021102000002#J00600"><p>I will get back to the recommendations but I join with Senator Gavan and others in expressing our thanks to Mr. Ken Fleming for all the work he did in this area.  Nobody can dispute that he was passionate and committed to shining a light on poor work practices.  I say again, for the record, that we are not dealing with the majority of employers in this instance but employers who want to do the right thing are being hampered by the fact there are rogue employers for whom there seems to be precious little sanction.</p> <p>  I want to go back to the two matters I raised previously with Mr. Kelly, starting with the meetings he spoke about, the fact it is good practice and that the intention is to have them soon.  I appreciate we are under restrictions etc. and nobody really knows with any certainty what way that will go.  All things being equal, is Mr. Kelly looking at having these meetings in the first three months of the next year?  I am seeking a commitment that the meetings will happen and an acknowledgement that they must be only part of the work that needs to be done.  I have organised workers in industries where they were very reluctant to come forward and much more work must be done.  Town hall meetings are definitely part of the process.  Is that the commitment this morning?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.310" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021102000002#J00700"><p>Absolutely.  It is something we have thought about doing as society opens.  It is an area we must address and not just with fishers.  There are other sectors where people come in from both within the European Economic Area, EEA, and outside it.  We need to look at maybe reaching into communities and areas where people from particular countries may congregate.  We recognise the deficiencies sometimes apparent in social media and it is always a learning experience for us.  We accept and recognise, both in our work and with the European Labour Authority, that the personal approach is absolutely required.  We need to work with community leaders and people within sectors.</p> <p>  We will absolutely do that next year and we must worked with justice parties like the ITF or the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI.  We must ensure that if we set up a town hall meeting, somebody will come.  Those are the types of bodies that can help us in that regard.  If it cannot be done because of geography, we will have to look to see how best we can deal with it as we are dealing with matters this morning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021102000002#J00800"><p>Will Mr. O'Brien elaborate on the issue with a Twitter campaign?  That is a version of social media but anybody who uses social media knows there are horses for courses.  Will Mr. O'Brien detail how the Twitter campaign may have been limited in its reach?  What could be done about that?  If there is a social media campaign and we add town hall meetings to it, what else can be done to reach out to these communities?  I know the ITF and others are doing this but these people need to link not just with their union - anybody who knows me can tell I see it as a person's best protection at work every single day - but other services as well.  How can we join this and what would be the recommendation to the committee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.312" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021102000002#J00900"><p>As I said earlier Twitter is a very public platform but it just does not appear to be the platform of choice for migrant fishers.  Eight months into the role, I have become acquainted directly with approximately 150 fishers and WhatsApp is the platform of choice.  It is relatively secure.  They also use Facebook, which can be used with private settings.  That is how they communicate.</p> <p>  On the question of town hall meetings, it is difficult to get many fishers together in one place and at one time.  A typical voyage or fishing trip could be two to three weeks and sometimes they might land on shore and go back out on the same day.  If a town hall meeting is to be organised, particularly for the prawn sector, it should be on the night of a full moon.  Some Deputies and Senators may laugh if they are unaware because on such a night all the vessels would be in Howth Harbour.  The prawns behave differently and cannot be caught easily and that is when fishers will be available.  I cannot vouch for fishers of other species but a certain critical mass of fishers could be gathered if it was timed that way.  Otherwise, there might not be a great attendance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021102000002#J01000"><p>That is very good advice and I was aware of it because I live in a small fishing community.  The full moon does things to prawns, although I do not know what.  There was a submission from Mr. O'Brien and the ITF to the committee and it references the penalties applied, arguing they are not dissuasive enough to prevent repeat offending by some vessel owners.  I stress it is a small number of vessel owners but these are the people who give the industry a bad reputation.  The decent employers are getting lashed by that bad reputation as well, which is unfair.  It is in everyone's interest to stamp this out.</p> <p>  The reference was to penalties not being dissuasive enough to prevent repeat offending.  Reporting people for abuse of the scheme to the Department of Justice might be a good way to start.  What is Mr. Kelly's view on the penalties available and whether they need to be increased or different?  How can we deal with the question of repeat offending?  It strikes me there are thousands of fishing vessels around the coast and there is a small number of rogue employers.  We should be dealing with them.</p><p>Therefore, the penalties must be dissuasive enough in order that the employers who want to do the decent thing are not competing on an unequal playing field.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.315" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021102000002#K00200"><p>It is important to remember that, as the Deputy says, there are 170 vessels in the scheme.  There are 200,000 employments we need to inspect as well.  We are very much committed to the scheme and the number of inspections we have carried out to date shows that.  On the dissuasive effect of the penalties, I take her point on referral to the Department of Justice for repeat offenders.  In that context, if there is a review of the scheme, that would be the appropriate place to discuss it to look at it in the round, in order that we have the full information on what the appropriate dissuasive penalty would be.  I would be reluctant to say any more than that.  Broadly speaking, it should be discussed in the context of a review.</p></speech>

I appreciate Mr. Kelly is reluctant to say but surely the penalty must hit them in the pocket as otherwise they will not hear the message.  Does Mr. O'Brien have a view on what would constitute a sufficiently dissuasive level of penalty to discourage employers who do not seem capable of doing the right thing in some instances?</p></speech>

You are talking about fines of &euro;500 when a full catch of 5 tonnes of prawns on the basis of a two- or three-week fishing expedition nets &euro;25,000 and fishers are being paid minimum wage, if that.  Members can see the economics of it.  You are talking about Circuit Court or maybe High Court-level prosecutions and four to five-figure fines, or jailings in some instances, because of the scale of some of the abuses.</p></speech>

I have a question for him.  In his opinion, what impact would the Government's proposed documentation scheme for migrants have on the fishers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021102000002#K00700"><p>I am really glad this question has been asked.  Scores and scores of fishers I have been speaking to in the course of the year and who are undocumented are at the edge of their seats over this scheme because they feel it is a potential route to being documented, again, in some instances, or for the first time in a small number of cases.  The Department of Justice is proposing a stamp 4 scheme which, if these fishers obtain it, will give them the freedom to move employers or even move out of fishing altogether.  The problem is - there is immense anxiety among the fishers about this - the terms of the scheme as announced and of which we are yet to see the full details are that a person must be undocumented for four continuous years or three years in the case of a person having a child.  The problem is many of the fishers we would like to be regularised out of the scheme do not quite fit that bill.  They entered Ireland in a documented fashion but maybe two, three or four years ago fell out of the scheme and are currently undocumented but cannot point to being undocumented for four continuous years.  The other issue concerns those who are actually in the atypical scheme, some of whom have been in the scheme since its inception and are therefore on their sixth atypical contract.  They are asking me how it is fair that they are in their sixth year as an atypical fisher on a stamp 1 visa, tied to this employer who is not very nice to them and when they put in an application via a solicitor, as does happen, to the Department of Justice for a change of status to stamp 4, the Department always says &quot;No&quot; but yet, the fisher's crew-mate who has been undocumented for four years has a clear path to a stamp 4.  Members can see how divisive it is.<br/><br/>I say this to the Government Senators and Deputies in particular.  I ask them to please convey this to their colleagues and the Minister.  There is a promise out there.  Sorcha Pollak from <i>The Irish Times</i>interviewed me about this six weeks ago and the Department said the scheme would be &quot;inclusive&quot;.  The Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, said the other day in response to the Maynooth report that this documentation scheme may offer a path.  I really hope so because this would be the mainstay of the ITF's work, alongside everything else, if this scheme is not inclusive and you have hundreds of undocumented fishers left in limbo-land and then scores of long-term atypical workers who are going to be, in their eyes, leapfrogged by people who have been undocumented while they are stuck in their exclusive relationship with abusive employers.  This scheme has to be got right.</p></speech>

I presume he would agree with Deputy Bruton's highlighting of a fundamental problem with the atypical scheme being the tying of a worker to a particular employer and that it massively shifts the balance of power in the employer's favour.  It certainly creates an environment whereby this sort of abuse is more likely to happen.</p></speech>

The fishers have a high threshold for abuses, I am sorry to say.  For the Egyptians, there is unfortunately a mythology within the sector that if they do the five years within the scheme that they have a clear path to a stamp 4, which unfortunately is not the case.  Many of them are led to believe it is, so they will put up with those abuses at the hands of individual employers.  For the Filipinos and Ghanaians, even the pittance they are paid counts for a lot when they send much of it back home and consequently, they will put up with it, albeit at great risk to themselves.  It is true the fishing sector is a small one relative to the overall size of the workforce in this country but the dangers posed to fishers are very acute.  You are talking about back injuries, loss of digits, premature aging and the wear and tear of doing it.  It is a young person's job but some of the fishers out there are in their 40s and 50s and frankly, they look like old men.  They need to be able to move on to do other work and they have earned their right to do so.  People in this country have made enormous sums of money out of these individuals' labour and to be frank, they deserve a break from the State.</p></speech>

Turning to Mr. Kelly, I wish to follow up on the question of one case in seven years, as we finished our engagement when he was making that point.  Is he basically saying that is because the Minister has only made what sounds like two requests, those being the one successful case and the case the WRC decided not to pursue.

I have a few more questions.  One is about resourcing.  Famously, I think it was former Deputy Joe Higgins who made the point about how there were more dog wardens than labour inspectors in the State.  Would Mr. Kelly consider the number of labour inspectors to still be considerably less than what we need?  Finally, I assume he is aware of the allegations made by George McLoughlin, who was a former inspector for the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, the forerunner and predecessor of the WRC, who has made two protected disclosures.  I have spoken to him and he makes a credible case of repeated failures to have proper inspections take place, including into the fishing industry, as well as tipping off of employers, not having unannounced inspections and so on.  Would Mr. Kelly like to respond to any of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.330" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021102000002#K01700"><p>I will take the latter point first.  The protected disclosure to which the Deputy refers was made a matter of weeks after the establishment of the WRC and referred, I think, primarily to the work carried out by inspectors during the period of NERA.  It was made to the Department and the Department assigned an independent investigator to carry out an investigation.  My understanding is the result of investigation - we were not shown a copy, for the reasons I will outline - was there was no systemic wrongdoing in the work of the inspectorate and as such, no issues for us to deal with.  I do not know if that answers that particular point.</p> <p>  On the number of inspectors, there is no labour inspectorate or regulator in the world which would say it had enough inspectors to carry out inspections.  In the end, there are two ways to drive compliance.  One is through outreach campaigns, because it is not possible in any circumstance to visit every employment in any given year or any number of years due to the sheer volume of employments.  Thus it is really key we have a very good and up-to-date outreach campaign along the lines of some of the issues we have discussed today.</p><p>In the early part of this year we established internally a communications unit to help us work on the outreach that the information customer service does.  We will get better and will hone it so that it is more effective.  It has to be sustained and supplemented by inspectors.  We have engaged with the Department over the past while about increasing the number of inspectors.  As I mentioned, we received additional funding for ten inspectors, which is an 18% increase in our overall number of inspectors.  We will assimilate them over the next six to seven months and will train and on-board them.  At some time towards the middle of next year, we have agreed with the Department that we will return to this discussion to see if that can be moved forward in subsequent years.  It is no secret that we are working to build up our total inspectorate numbers.</p></speech>

I take what Mr. Kelly said earlier on that there are some contraventions that are administrative and so forth but there are also some that are very serious.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Kelly to comment on trafficking and the extent to which the WRC has encountered this in the fisher industry as well as across the board in his other work and what actions have been taken there.</p></speech>

As part of our standard functions, we report all suspected trafficking cases in the fishers&rsquo; sector to the Garda as these people are very vulnerable and perhaps exploited.</p> <p>  On the most recent campaign, the so-called Palace campaign with the fishers, of all of the fishers that we spoke to we came across three who were undocumented.  They are out there and all of our inspectors are fully trained in looking for signs of trafficking to be reported to the appropriate authorities because they are the most vulnerable people who we come across as part of our functions.  </p> <p>  As for what are the types of signs we look for, one is the abuse of someone&rsquo;s vulnerability on the part of the employer.  Are the employees restricted in terms of their movements?  Are they subject to violence or intimidation as part of their work?  Are their travel documents retained for any periods?  Are they involved in debt bondage?  These are just some of the things we look for when we talk to workers on the ground; these are questions we may look out or ask of them.  If we do find anything we refer to the appropriate authorities, as this is very serious.  This is in addition to our work with the European Labour Authority in identifying where channels of trafficking come from in particular sectors.</p></speech>

This requires five years continuous documented employment but also being continuously in the State for the preceding full year. This unfortunately knocks some of them out because if they make a short visit to Egypt, or wherever, that disqualifies them.  It is more costly also than obtaining a stamp 4 but certainly, it is an option that is recommended to them if they can obtain it.  It is not as available to them as this documentation scheme potentially can be.</p> <p>  I will comment on the human trafficking side of things so that people are aware.  We have had human trafficking legislation in Ireland since 2008 and we only arrived at our first ever conviction a few months ago involving two Nigerian sex workers who were brought over here.  That is the reason that the United States State Department has downgraded Ireland again to a tier 2 watch-list country, alongside Romania, Azerbaijan and Belarus, as the worst performers in Europe in combating human trafficking.</p> <p>  Alongside the symptoms of human trafficking that Mr. Kelly described, there is also being coerced into an illegal act.  For example, if one is told by a vessel owner to hide an over-quota catch from the authorities where the fishing of a quota species is involved, all of the migrants who have come to us have testified to us about that.  They may also have been told to hide from the authorities, be that the Naval Service or the WRC.  That is also an illegal act which they may have been coerced into doing.  </p> <p>  There is also fear of denunciation and trafficking by deception.  Most people who have been admitted into the referral mechanism were brought in legally on the strength of the contract that there were promised.  They then experienced something that was severely at odds to this.  That is how the conviction was arrived at for the two Nigerian sex workers who were promised something entirely different but when they came to Ireland they were treated as sex slaves.</p> <p>  The Department of Justice in its response to the 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report, TIP, report in July uniquely contested that fishing is a site of exploitation and trafficking.  It did not contest any of the other sectors that are seen as vulnerable?  Why was that?  The reason, I believe, is because the perpetrators are Irish and the people who were convicted in the Nigerian sex workers case were Nigerian.  The perpetrators in this sector, however, are Irish, which is why we have not had a conviction as yet.</p> <p>   I am going to a meeting in 25 minutes' time of a number of NGOs and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  There are going to be reforms to the national referral mechanism, which are welcome in order that we are not dependent solely on the Garda to admit people back into the scheme.</p></speech>

Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege and go through some housekeeping matters.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or to engage otherwise in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks.  It is imperative to comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or against an official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  For anyone watching this meeting, Oireachtas Members and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or to join the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask any member partaking via Microsoft Teams that prior to making a contribution to the meeting, they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If attending in the committee room, as a number of members are, they are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p><p>They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and leave at least one seat vacant between themselves and others attending the meeting.  Attendees should also maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.</p><p> I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Ar dt&uacute;s, rachaidh m&eacute; i ngleic le pr&oacute;tacal Thuaisceart &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>First, I will update the committee on the Northern Ireland protocol.  Last week, the European Commission delivered on its promise to people and businesses in Northern Ireland to address their practical, genuine and real concerns.  The European Union's proposals will make it easier to move goods and medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.  They will also provide a framework for Northern Ireland having a greater say in how the protocol works.  However, the European Union cannot resolve these issues alone.  We need a partner who is willing to work with us.  We want to get to a jointly agreed and durable solution that provides stability, certainty and predictability for people and investors in Northern Ireland.  Now is the time for the UK Government to engage constructively on practical solutions in order that the benefits of the protocol can be shared by people from all communities.  It was clear from talking to my European colleagues in Luxembourg yesterday that there is strong support for the Commission&rsquo;s approach and strong solidarity with Ireland but, most important, there is strong interest in the issue from around the European Union.</p><p>Yesterday, at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg, I also discussed a range of other issues on the EU agenda, including the Commission&rsquo;s second annual rule of law report, the Conference on the Future of Europe, Next Generation EU<i></i>and the draft conclusions for the European Council taking place tomorrow and Friday.  I am happy to speak on any or all of these areas with committee members in further detail. </p><p>The European Union is a union of laws and values.  The rule of law is a fundamental principle for all EU member states and it is of vital importance that the rule of law is preserved, protected and promoted across the Union.  I welcomed Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen&rsquo;s strong words on protecting the rule of law and European values in her recent state of the union address.  I also welcomed her speech in the European Parliament yesterday morning - which I did not see live as she delivered it at the same time as the General Affairs Council meeting was under way - in which she once again emphasised the importance of the rule of law.</p><p>Ireland has consistently supported the development of a more comprehensive range of tools by the European Commission to ensure that member states stick to these basic obligations under the EU treaties and basic democratic norms.  This includes the Commission&rsquo;s annual rule of law report and the rule of law budget conditionality mechanism.  As EU member states, there is an onus on us all to comply with determinations of the European Court of Justice with a view to maintaining our shared legal order.  As part of membership of the Union, it is also essential that member states accept the primacy of European Union law, which is a principle of the European Union going back to a time prior to when Ireland was a member.</p><p>The judgment of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, which has been made official, is therefore a cause for serious concern for Ireland.  This ruling is the latest development to heighten concerns about judicial independence in Poland following justice system reforms.  These include changes to the disciplinary system for judges, which the Court of Justice has said are not compatible with EU law.  This development underlines the importance of ongoing scrutiny and discussion of the kind provided by the rule of law dialogue.</p><p>I also updated my Council colleagues yesterday on Ireland&rsquo;s national programme for the Conference on the Future of Europe.  I will also participate in the second plenary meeting of the conference this weekend as will my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Pippa Hackett.  I also raised an issue, of which the committee may wish to be aware.  The European Council meeting will take place this week and the plenary meeting of the conference in December is scheduled for the same week as the December European Council meeting in December.  That will affect the ability of ministers of state with responsibility for European affairs in various European countries to physically attend the meeting in Strasbourg.  However, I certainly encourage Oireachtas members to be there in person.</p><p>We must all do as much as we can to publicise the conference and encourage greater public engagement.  We cannot be indifferent about the conference as it is too important in terms of the valuable opportunity it provides for ordinary citizens to have their say on Europe&rsquo;s future and also the recommendations which might ultimately result from the process now under way.  I thank the committee for its engagement in the Conference on the Future of Europe.  I know it has been a priority of the committee for some time.  I am happy to take questions from members.</p></speech>

I thank him for his comprehensive update.  I would like to touch on two issues.  The first, to which the Minister of State referred, is that of Poland and the rule of law.  Can he give us some further detail on what potential actions the European Union is considering taking in this regard, not only with respect to the treatment of the judiciary but also the treatment of women&rsquo;s rights and the attempt to row back on female reproductive rights in Poland, which is of major concern to many citizens in Ireland?</p> <p>  The second issue is the Northern Ireland protocol.  The Minister of State referred, mainly with respect to Poland, to the supremacy of European Union law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.  That still remains the key issue, unfortunately, with the protocol.  We are all well aware of the Commission&rsquo;s position on that.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the next steps in this ongoing negotiation and process and what we might see happen in the next number of weeks or months.</p> <p>  Regarding the Conference on the Future of Europe, are there detailed plans for what Ireland will do to engage with citizens?  Are there projects or events planned in the coming months, of which the committee should be aware?</p></speech>

To follow up on the questions asked by Senator Chambers regarding the Northern Ireland protocol, we need practical solutions.  The Commission has made its proposals and I hope there will now be constructive engagement.  Vice President Maros &Scaron;efovi has risen to the occasion, consulted widely and come forward with these practical solutions.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's view on the comments by David Frost regarding the European Court of Justice and his suggestion that it would not be an acceptable arbiter of any disputes.</p> <p>  I agree with what the Minister of State and Senator Chambers on the rule of law, with particular reference to Poland.  To follow up on what Senator Chambers asked, what are the tools available to the Commission to deal with Poland and this issue?  I understand some sort of legal process is under way under Article 7 and there is also the issue of funding.  Will the Minister of State outline what tools are available to the Commission to deal with Poland?</p> <p>  I hope the Minister of State does not mind my raising an issue he did not mention in his opening statement, namely, the issue of enlargement in the context of the admission of the six countries that comprise the western Balkans.  The summit in Slovenia does not seem to have been particularly successful.  Presumably, the Minister of State can clarify that Ireland is totally supportive of the accession of the six western Balkans countries  I ask him to comment on what happened in Slovenia and why the summit was not a particular success?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021102000002#C00700"><p>Members have raised interesting questions that cut across a number of issues.  Senator Chambers asked specifically about the next steps with respect to the protocol.  As we speak, the UK team is in Brussels discussing with its counterparts at a technical level.  I understand the discussion is focusing on the EU papers - the documents published last week.  David Frost and Maros &Scaron;efovi will meet again.  I noted from Mr. Frost's Lisbon speech last week that there is an openness to engage, and that is happening.  We must welcome and acknowledge that a discussion is taking place, much of which is being kept confidential.  We must also acknowledge that the European Commission has come a very long way, supported by the member states.  That is really welcome.</p><p>We will certainly be as constructive as possible in the coming weeks and continually reassure our friends in Britain that, as far as we can tell in all our engagements and in the European Commission's engagements, business and the people of Northern Ireland are, by and large, happy with what has been proposed by the European Commission.  This will lead to a substantial reduction in checks while at the same time, importantly, protecting the Single Market, which is crucial for Ireland.  It gives Northern Ireland the real benefits of the best-of-both-worlds approach, with Northern Ireland in the Single Market for goods but also part of the customs territory of the UK.</p><p> The European Court of Justice was raised by both Deputy Haughey and Senator Chambers.  It is important to be very clear.  First, in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement there is no role for the Court of Justice.  In the protocol it has a very limited and specific role which, to be honest, I cannot see really arising in practice.  It is difficult even to think of how it could arise in practice.  Essentially, Northern Ireland is in the Single Market for goods.  Disputes relating to goods' standards or whether goods are allowed in the Single Market could theoretically end up in the Court of Justice of the European Union but, as I understand it, it is such a theoretical issue that there is currently only a handful of cases across the entire European Union relating to goods before the Court of Justice.  In fact, cases in the Court of Justice relating to goods are actually some of the foundational cases dating back up to 50 years, which Senator Chambers and Deputy Haughey would probably have studied in college.  They go back that far and they are foundational aspects of the Single Market.  All that the provision in the protocol does is apply that.</p><p> Ultimately, any single market for goods needs regulation, which is the rules of the European Union.  The protocol lists a certain set of regulations that apply to goods in Northern Ireland and, ultimately, there has to be an arbitrator, a court, that is the bedrock of the Single Market, and that is the Court of Justice of the European Union.  It is part and parcel of the Single Market.  When we say Northern Ireland is part of the Single Market for goods, it means that goods can flow freely from Northern Ireland to the European Union and, most importantly, between the North and South on this island, which is the rationale for it, that those goods must adhere to certain standards and, ultimately, in theoretical cases, that the Court of Justice of the European Union could decide on issues relating to those matters.  The rules for the Single Market are so set in stone and specifically set out in the protocol that it is very hard to see how this issue would arise in practice, but it is part and parcel of the Single Market and the benefits that it gives to Northern Ireland.  I do not see it as a burden in any way.  In fact, I do not see it as an interference in any way with British sovereignty.  Northern Ireland is in the Single Market as a type of exception with a specific international agreement, which is what the protocol is.  This is simply part of it, and I doubt there will be many lawyers in Belfast taking cases to the Court of Justice of the European Union on goods issues.  It is very difficult to envisage it.  However, it is part and parcel of what Northern Ireland gets with the Single Market.</p><p> Poland is obviously a major concern, and Senator Chambers and Deputy Haughey asked similar questions about what we can do about it.  There are many hard and soft powers.  The Article 7 proceedings were mentioned by Deputy Haughey.  That is one of the most important measures the European Union has.  However, it is very difficult to operate in practice.  There are the Article 7 hearings that take place at the General Affairs Council, on which I sit.  Ultimately, if they were voted up to the European Council, technically some voting rights could be withdrawn as punishment for a breach of the rules, but the voting majority requirements to get it out of the General Affairs Council are quite steep and at the European Council there must be unanimity, which would be difficult to achieve in the current political circumstances, as members of the committee will understand.  However, the Article 7 proceedings have been started and it is difficult to see a way to finish them.  It is important.  We had Article 7 hearings in June and that shone a light on certain issues at that time, particularly in Hungary.  Yesterday, we had a rule of law dialogue where we again shone a light on particular issues.</p><p> In terms of the practical next steps, the public pressure from the D&aacute;il and Seanad and from the general public in Ireland on LGBT rights, for example, has had a direct impact on some of those towns that had LGBT-free zones.  We can talk to our friends, the Poles, and say that we do not believe this is acceptable, that it needs to change and the reasons are that it is about human decency, human dignity and human rights.  In quite a number of cases, those designations by local authorities in Poland have been reversed through public pressure, much of it coming from Ireland.  In addition, the European Commission has withdrawn funding for certain municipalities in Poland which have initiated these designations.  That public pressure cannot be understated.  There is also, of course, the conditionality regulation, which would make the disbursal of European moneys, particularly from the recovery and resilience fund, conditional on adherence to the rule of law and democratic values.  That regulation is in force, but it is being challenged in the Court of Justice of the European Union at present.</p><p> The Commission is taking this very seriously and carefully.  For example, it has not yet approved the recovery and resilience plans for Hungary and Poland.  It is also conscious that there is a case before the Court of Justice.  Ireland took part in that case in support of the Council.  Last week, our lawyers were arguing that case.  That is a very important step by us to show that we take this very seriously.  We certainly support the conditionality mechanism and want to see it implemented, provided the Court of Justice rules in favour of it.  That is a very practical measure.  The Polish and Hungarian people are our friends and common Europeans.  We have to keep talking and keep a dialogue going in respect of all these issues.  That is very important.  The committee can play its role in that too, and I am sure it does.  We need to keep in touch.  They are our friends and not everybody in those countries agrees with the direction the governments are taking, and that provides an opportunity.</p><p> With regard to enlargement, Ireland is totally supportive of the enlargement of the European Union.  The Taoiseach made very strong comments in Slovenia on that.  He had good engagement with his counterparts from the western Balkans countries, in particular.  I have had similar engagement, too, and I strongly encourage the committee to have whatever engagement it considers fit with its counterparts in the western Balkans.  Yes, there are obviously processes to go through.  We have to make sure that the rule of law, democratic values and economic reforms are all bedded down, but we should be as encouraging and helpful as possible.  In any of my engagements with colleagues from the western Balkans I have offered Ireland's full support not only in terms of the ultimate ambition of EU membership but also our help along the way on the road to it.</p><p> I hope that answers the members' questions.</p></speech>

I will follow up on a number of the issues he has dealt with.  Obviously, the Irish protocol remains paramount for us.  In fairness, it appeared that the Commission and Vice-President &Scaron;efovi pushed themselves as far as they possibly could to find a solution which, I believe, a considerable number of people in the North, even with a unionist background, who are businessmen, farmers and so forth will be quite happy to work with.  I have not seen the large level of demonstrations and whatever else is happening within political unionism.  Is the Minister of State aware of whether there is that general constructive feeling on the ground of just getting on with it?  We have the background noise of Boris Johnson and particularly David Frost while we have the positive that there is an element of engagement, which has to be welcomed.  To a degree, one is second-guessing on the basis of what someone says which might be for a particular constituency, and that can change overnight.  I understand that the Minister of State cannot give complete clarity, just his interactions with regard to the North, particularly as regards the business community and so forth in respect of working this.</p><p>We also had the European Commission representation in Ireland and they said officials from the Commission were ready to go the minute these documents were done, from a point of view of ensuring all this was workable.  We are all in agreement that the Irish protocol is the only show in town and is not for moving.  As long as the EU and the Commission maintain that as the starting point and we get workable operational changes, that is where the future is.  Anything else that is possibly being threatened would be utterly unacceptable, particularly in an Irish context.</p><p> Senator Chambers brought up the Conference on the Future of Europe and the events that are to be organised throughout this State.  The European movement is carrying out lead in relation to it.  It is about ensuring we get out and beyond those that are interested.  It can be difficult for even regular, localised politics to get to those who see themselves as outside the political sphere.  There is an onus on us to make it real and involve as many people as possible.  The northern dimension is a big thing.  We have a democratic deficit and there seem to be moves towards dealing with that.  Will the Minister of State go into a bit of detail on that?  Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi has been supportive.  It is difficult in the North in that there is not representation or, necessarily, engagement on a localised level.  That is something we would have to deal with.  </p><p> What is the timeline for the rule of law issues, as regards the case in front of the European Court of Justice, ECJ?  We have all asked what leverage there is within the European Union as regards dealing with breaches of the rule of law.  I accept what the Minister of State has said to the effect that positive peer pressure can have an impact regarding local authorities and localised actions by councils that were twinned and pieces of work like that.  Our first port of call should always be talk and negotiation, rather than leverage, but there is the question of the recovery and resilience funding.  The multiannual framework or whatever one wants to call it is the big money issue.  There was a difficulty in twinning that with rule of law issues.  Where does that stand?</p><p> There are other issues beyond those, such as those relating to Poland and Hungary.  I imagine those states from time to time say there is rule of law for them but not for some of the more senior members of the European Union or those who were there earlier.  I am back talking about the disgraceful way Catalonian representatives have sometimes been dealt with by the Spanish Administration.</p><p> On the European Council, the main issues regarding Government focus at this point will relate to that.  We are in a different place here as regards the pandemic.  Just when we thought we were out, we are back in.  It is almost like a Mafia film.  The big issue is around none of us being safe until all of us are safe.  I heard a great amount of narrative around the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, TRIPS, waiver.  We have had a Commission representative state it is a misnomer and that there is greater capacity in the pharmaceutical community now to produce what is needed.  How do we deliver what needs to be delivered throughout the developing world and provide more than COVAX, which is only looking at 20% of the populations in developing countries?  I am not wedded to a TRIPS waiver, but we need a solution that means the developing world can get vaccines relatively cheaply and then we can deal with the logistical questions of getting them out.  The likes of the European Union has a huge role to play in this.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State.  I listened to what he said and it reminded me of the discussion we had last week with Barbara Nolan.  We discussed the rule of law.  I will make one or two comments and ask one or two questions.  Coming back to Article 7, at one level one wonders if it is toothless.  How can we get out of the General Affairs Council and the European Council?  It depends who votes what way.  It is not that I have an issue with that but how useful is it in this situation?  My question is deeper than that.  If the ECJ were to come back with a finding that did not allow the EU to proceed, that would have significant ramifications for current and future issues around the rule of law.  That is musing on my part.  I do not necessarily want the Minister of State to comment unless he wants to, but I would be delighted to hear it.</p> <p>  As to how we proceed, last week when discussing this with Barbara Nolan, I said I agreed that we need to tread very carefully.  The escalation this week was significant.  For the first time since I left the Parliament, somebody contacted me about that speech.  That surprised me.  This person found it so significant and wondered what my perspective was.  I listened to Sean Kelly MEP.  I have heard him make many speeches over the years on this and other issues, but his speech indicated a very strong position.  I would consider it a change in position from the Government.  Would the Minister of State be happy to comment on that?</p> <p>  When it comes to conditionality, we had many debates.  My concern about conditionality is always that it is a double-edged sword.  If we use the withholding of European funds, that becomes a weapon for those in power to say there is an impact on the people of Poland because the EU is withholding funds.  I understand there is carrot and stick and that money talks; nonetheless, we could get badly bitten by this.</p> <p>  The last point I will make is a general comment.  When we talk about the supremacy of EU law, it is important we understand that we do not have EU law in every circumstance.  Things happen throughout Europe that we as individuals, as politicians or as members of political parties might not agree with but not all of it is covered by EU law.  That means the European Court of Justice can only act in certain circumstances.  Sometimes we need to be careful when we talk about the EU acting in areas where it does not have competence.</p><p>It is something I have noticed over a long period of time and it can confuse people outside the system.  It is not that I am an expert in it - far from it - but I have seen on many occasions people talking about the EU acting when in fact, there is probably no legal basis for it to act.  I will be speaking in the D&aacute;il in a short while so I must leave soon.</p></speech>

The Government has organised a number of events.  Obviously, Covid has restricted things.  With EMI and through the Department of Foreign Affairs, I have met a wide range of groups in my capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, including meetings on a regional basis and meetings with marginalised groups and civic society.  I have met young people, LGBT groups, people from the Gaeltacht, islanders and inner-city representatives so I have met a wide range of groups.</p> <p>  Covid has hampered this process.  With restrictions having eased, we are planning other events.  The Conference on the Future of Europe is not dependent on the Government organising meetings or events.  Everybody can do that.  This committee has done it.  The D&aacute;il and Seanad can do it.  Fianna F&aacute;il has done a seminar on the Conference on the Future of Europe.  I encourage other parties to replicate that.  We will do more as well.  There will be Government-run events.</p> <p>  We are looking at the citizens' panel that will take place in Dublin in December.  That is obviously a European event.  It is not our event but it probably would be an opportune time for all of us to raise the profile of the Conference on the Future of Europe at that time because there will be substantial media interest in these randomly selected European citizens coming to Dublin to have their conversation.  If any of the Irish randomly selected citizens would like to speak out about their experience, it would be really helpful and interesting because about eight Irish citizens are involved in this.  I do not know any of them.  Commissioner Reynders, who is also responsible for GDPR, said that if we can get this through GDPR, he would certainly like to facilitate it.  If anyone out there who is involved, it would-----</p></speech>

I would certainly encourage that.  I ask anybody who would be interested - and I do not know their identities - to please speak out and say whether he or she thinks it is a good or bad process and what he or she thinks of the issues involved.</p> <p>  Regarding the protocol, I again thank the Opposition and members from all political parties for the unified approach to Brexit in this country.  We adopted that approach in opposition and I see the Opposition doing it now.  It is so important that when a member of the Government, whichever party is in government and that changes all the time, goes to Europe there is a united approach in this country on this issue.  It speaks volumes to our colleagues in Europe.  When I arrived at the General Affairs Council yesterday, quite a number of my European colleagues approached me to see what my reaction and the Irish reaction was.  I had spoken to some of them already.  Members will find that, by and large, European colleagues listen to the Irish reaction and accept it.  Many of them do.  Yes, there will be different nuances from some member states regarding particular issues but, generally speaking, the Irish approach is certainly asked for and adopted.  I thank my colleagues for that.</p> <p>  I know that this time last year, I was telling Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that a European minister was coming to the Deputy's constituency along the Border.  It did not happen because of Covid and we did not know about numbers but another minister from another country has indicated that they want to come to see the Border this year.  We wonder all the time whether the interest is being sustained.  It is being sustained.  All long as Covid allows it, which I suspect it will, I will invite Border Deputies to meet that minister once the visit has been arranged and we get confirmation.  We have not confirmed it yet.  It is fantastic to see that interest and that ministers from other countries ask to visit the Border.  That is very welcome.  They are also very aware of the peace process and are as frustrated as the Deputy and I are at times but they also know that what we are doing here is to make sure there is peace on the island and prosperity in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  I broadly welcome the unionist approach, particularly when they talk about welcoming, engaging and acknowledging that the Commission came a long way.  These are phrases we heard from the unionist community.  That type of reaction gives space this week for talks.  The significant and immediate public support from business and agriculture on a cross-community basis was really welcome.  People in Europe are pleased to see that and that what they feel is a good package has been received as such.</p> <p>  There is a lot of background noise.  I acknowledge it is very difficult to stay out of that at times but sometimes we have to do so, for example, to allow space for these conversations to take place this week and in the coming weeks.  I hope the process will not be too long.  The Commission has gone a long way and it is very hard to find real arguments.  The argument about the European Court of Justice is not a sovereignty question.  We saw the issue of weights and measures this week.  Again, nobody knows what an ounce is - let us be honest about it - so I suspect that is not going to be an issue.  We already have some exemptions in Northern Ireland.  For example, there was never any issue with miles or yards on signposts in Northern Ireland so sometimes these issues are exaggerated.  We want what is best for business and people in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  I might briefly discuss Covid.  What the Taoiseach would like to see this week from the European Council, particularly with regard to Covid, is very strong messaging on booster vaccines.  That is something he has been talking about and about which he is very keen.  We have seen the efficacy of the booster vaccines in countries where they have been applied.  We are delighted that booster vaccinations for the over-60s have got the go-ahead from the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC.  We are obviously concerned about the rest of the population, particularly healthcare workers, who have been among the longest vaccinated.  We know about the effect of the vaccines waning.  The European Medicines Agency has already spoken about booster vaccines in a very positive way and I think the Taoiseach will be very keen to have the issue advanced at a political level as well.  He will be looking for strong statements on this from the European Council.  </p> <p>  Regarding the rule of law, which was raised by Deputies &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Harkin, many different measures are being used but, ultimately, we just have to keep talking as well.  That is what I am saying.  I could go through the entire Article 7 process.  There is a long process and we are not near the end.  It is useful to keep these issues in the spotlight.  It is not just for us to keep them in the spotlight.  It keeps them in the spotlight in home countries as well.  The European Court of Justice made a decision in July and the Commission sought from the court what it calls an exceptional step to impose a daily penalty on Poland citing a lack of compliance with the July court decision.  It has, therefore, been taking this matter very seriously.  This is only for a matter of months.</p> <p>  Deputy Harkin asked what would happen if the conditionality regulation fails at the ECJ.  I do not think I should get involved while the court is deciding the case.  Ireland intervened in a very strong way in support of the Council position.  I think that will be very strong.  This funding is important.  We want to see progress, particularly in eastern Europe and less developed economies, but we are also paying for it.  We pay for that with a generous heart.  The Taoiseach and the previous Government did not join the frugal four at the time but when we are funding this, it is reasonable for us to ensure that democratic values and the basic values of the EU are upheld.</p> <p>  I disagree with Deputy Harkin that there is any change in the position of the Government.  I have spoken to the Taoiseach and at meetings of ministers with responsibility for European affairs.  We have taken a very strong line on this and I am very strong in my interactions with the General Affairs Council and the public media regarding these issues.</p><p>We have also been a member of a like-minded group on the rule of law for quite a number of years so we are certainly not out of the mainstream on these issues.  I would not say there is a change in position from Government on this.  The Government is very strong on this, and it is likely to be raised at the European Council.  It is not on the agenda at the moment but it is certainly likely to be raised.  There will be some strong statements on this which will be looking for action.  </p><p> On the supremacy of EU law, the European Single Market for example could not function if there was a standard set by the European Union and then some countries opt not to comply with that but to have a different standard.  It is not actually a matter of power, or sovereignty.  It is really a matter of practicalities about how we ensure that the rules are the same in every country.  Those rules traditionally were those of the Single Market but of course our values are also fundamental to us.</p><p> It is important when we are talking about the European Court of Justice to keep saying - it is a great phrase from an Austrian colleague - that Europe is not Brussels or Strasbourg or Luxembourg.  This is Europe.  Achill Island is Europe.  Recently we had a judgment from the European Court of Justice as Gaeilge.  I met the plaintiff who took the case, he is from County Meath.  This is our court.  It is not some foreign court as it would perhaps have been described in the debate in Europe.  This is a court that is the ultimate arbiter of areas, and Deputy Harkin is right, where the European Union has competence.  If the European Union does not have competence then the European Court of Justice will not get involved.  It is our court.  Our people are on that court.  Gerard Hogan, one of the most respected legal jurists in this country ever, who has just been appointed to the Supreme Court here has just come from being Advocate General to that court.  So this is a court with a huge Irish influence over the years and that continues today with the current appointees as well. </p></speech>

I thank the Minister, Deputy Byrne, for a comprehensive answer to what was a considerable number of questions.  On the rule of law issue, I accept that talking has to take primacy.  I accept what is happening at the minute and the processes in regard to Article 7 and then the recovery and resilience funding, which matters because money counts on leverage.  At one stage when budgets were being finalised there was talk of there possibly being rule of law implications but there was a constitutional difficulty around that.  Has the European Council or the EU in any general sense looked at that?  Are we any further on in regard to operating that on a wider basis?  I refer only to having the leverage, one might not necessarily ever use it.  Better to have the stick than not have it.</p> <p>  The other question goes back to - obviously we are in a different place in regard to Covid-19 at this time and booster vaccines could be a mitigation that would make a huge difference, so that needs to be top of the agenda, I agree with Deputy Byrne on that - the TRIPS waiver and the European Commission has placed itself in a particular place on that argument.  I do not particularly care if somebody puts a plan out and says "here is how we deliver for the developed world" and I mean something more than COVAX, the best-case scenario for which is 20% of the populations in developed countries and that is accepting there will be logistical difficulties in regard to it working.</p></speech>

The recovery and resilience fund was agreed last year as part of the budget negotiations, an unprecedented financial boost from the European Union to try to boost the economies of the entire European Union.  We need to get away from - and I do not accuse this committee of this - sometimes speaking in terms of "how much is Ireland getting" and "how much is Italy getting" or whatever because actually a country like Ireland benefits no matter who gets it.  Our companies will be trading with those countries and we depend on those countries doing well.  Also some of the money that is allocated to other European countries will end up being spent here, maybe on computer or pharmaceutical companies, whatever the case may be.</p> <p>  There was concern that funding would be subject to rule of law conditionality so there were many discussions this time last year from October to Christmas between the European Council and the European Parliament.  Ultimately agreement was reached after much discussion and the rule of law conditionality regulation was put in place.  It was then challenged by Hungary and Poland, and it was part of the political agreement with the European Council that they could do that.  That case is now pending before the European Court of Justice.  We supported the conditionality regulation, and the rule of law conditionality in regard to funding being allocated.  We took part in that case at the European Court of Justice.  Our lawyers were central to the arguments being made in support of the European Council position.  We will await the outcome of that decision.  I cannot give a timeline but I understand it will be relatively soon.  It took place only last week so we will let the European Court of Justice decide that case.  My understanding is it will possibly be next month but I am not a spokesperson for the court so we will let it do that, but it has happened very quickly.  That is the sequence of events and once this goes through, I hope in accordance with the arguments that we made, the challenge will not be successful.  It would then be a real tool for the European Commission.  It will be a game changer in terms of what can happen.</p></speech>

It would force a change of pace.  At the moment the European Commission has not approved the recovery and resilience plans for Hungary or Poland.  Some other countries have not put them in, but in those cases they just have not done it yet.  I am happy to let the European Commission do its job there and I support what it is doing.  I do not want to make its job more difficult on that because this is very important to all of us.</p> <p>  On vaccines and the TRIPS waiver, this is discussed on a regular basis.  What I would say is that the European Union has done more than any entity or any geopolitical actor to provide both doses abroad but also the components for doses.  While there was an export mechanism, one supply of vaccines was actually refused to be exported.  There has been a huge exporting of vaccines.  There are COVAX, direct donations, on which the Irish Government has given a major commitment.  We must also recognise that the research and development part of this is really important for the entire world, but that research and development does not come out of nothing.  I pay tribute to those Irish people who have been involved in this.  We have a very strong name for pharmaceuticals.  We have not heard too much about the aspects of the supply chain that were in Ireland but there were some.  Obviously we recently heard that Pfizer is opening a plant to supply more of that supply chain.  The issue of the TRIPS waiver will continue to be discussed and there are varying views at a European level on that, to get agreement on it.  What the Government will do, and it is absolutely committed to this, is make sure that as many people throughout the world get access to this vaccine as quickly as possible in whatever the most efficient method is.  We have been very clear about that all along.  </p></speech>

I welcome our witnesses this morning, who will be providing us with an update on the challenges faced by organisations working in the area of child welfare.  From Barnardos, via Microsoft Teams, I welcome Ms Suzanne Connolly, CEO, and Ms Laura Keane, project leader of Barnardos in Limerick.  I also welcome Mr. John Church, CEO of the ISPCC, who is appearing in the committee room.</p> <p>  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending.  They should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of a medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  I ask for everyone's full co-operation on this.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against either a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.  I ask members to confirm prior to contributing to the meeting that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I now call Ms Connolly from Barnardos to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

Barnardos warmly welcomes the opportunity to speak to the committee on this important issue.  I am appearing today alongside my colleague, Ms Laura Keane, who is a project leader working in one of our centres in Limerick.</p> <p>  Barnardos provides front-line services to vulnerable children and their families in our 45 centres throughout Ireland.  We offer a range of early intervention targeted services in our centres, in family homes and in schools.  Last year, Barnardos worked with almost 18,000 children and their families, helping them with their children's behavioural, emotional, educational, physical and social needs.</p> <p>  Since the onset of Covid-19, children and young people have had to stop doing all the vital things that had been part of their everyday life and crucial to their well-being.  They were excluded from meeting with friends, going to school and taking part of activities, all of which impacted negatively on their social and emotional development, as well as their mental health.</p> <p>  The impact of Covid-19 is not equal across all children.  Many of the children we work with experience a huge amount of adversity in their lives.  They are living with domestic violence, parental addiction, poor parental mental health, acrimonious separation and poverty.  Covid-19 and its impact was an additional burden on these children.  We saw parents deal with worsening mental health, increased substance use and conflict within the home.  This has inevitably led to some parents struggling to cope themselves.  When parents cannot cope, it impacts on their children's well-being and mental health.</p> <p>  Our 2021 back to school survey, in which almost 1,500 parents participated, reinforces this.  It found that 52% of parents had faced increased mental health difficulties, 50% experienced increased stress at home and 15% reported increased substance use.  A substantial portion, 29% of parents, stated that they were concerned about the impact these issues were having on their children.</p> <p>  Additionally, our back to school survey found that 63% of parents said they were worried about their children's emotional development, coping skills and ability to talk about their emotions.  Some 58% of parents were worried about their children's stress levels, while 57% of parents were worried about their children's anxiety.  Furthermore, 49% of primary school and 46% of secondary school parents stated that they were concerned about their children's social skills, peer relationships and ability to interact with others, while 47% of primary school parents and 58% of secondary school parents were concerned about their children's loneliness and their children not having the level of social connections they needed.</p> <p>  The transition out of lockdown has continued to be difficult for children with whom Barnardos works and it affects their development.  A significant proportion of children are struggling to engage with education, for example.  They are struggling to adhere to routines, follow rules and even sit still in the classroom.  For them, this is due to anxiety and being concerned that they are too far behind their peers to catch up.  As a result, their learning has regressed and sometimes, they are finding real difficulties with self-esteem and anxiety.</p> <p>  A degree of anxiety is normal.  All children and adults are anxious at times and most children and adults have the capacity and skills to manage this anxiety and not let it impact too much on their everyday lives.  Some children have families and friends who will support them through periods of worry and stress.  For many children, however, anxiety is immobilising.  It prevents them from  leaving their rooms or homes and stops them from making friends, going to clubs and schools and generally living their lives.  We know and research demonstrates that enabling parents to support their children within the family is one of the most successful ways of addressing children's mental health needs.</p> <p>  One of the key things we do in Barnardos is support parents by working to improve their relationship with their child by introducing and maintaining routines in their homes and helping parents understand how to manage their children's behaviour.  All this is done through our Partnership with Parents programme, which by strengthening parenting capacity improves children&rsquo;s mental well-being.</p> <p>  As well as providing parental support, we also recognise the importance of providing direct support to children by helping them learn how to understand and manage their emotions.  We do this through our This is Me programme, which works individually with children to support their social, emotional and cognitive development and integrate their hearts, bodies and minds.</p> <p>  During Covid-19, our family support services adapted to respond to the issues families were facing.  This meant staff responded to parenting challenges, providing them with the flexible support they needed to make sure they could focus on parenting as effectively as possible.  We believe that children and families can overcome the additional mental health issues and challenges that have resulted from the pandemic.  To do this effectively, however, they will need appropriate support, which will require adequate provision of universal services, as well as specific targeted support.</p></speech>

I will be pleased to address any questions members might have as the session proceeds.</p> <p>  Through our Childline services, children tell us first-hand about the experiences of their daily lives.  In our operational year of October 2019 to September 2020, our listening service answered more than 240,000 contacts from children and young people.</p><p>Our therapeutic support service, which works with children and families on a one-to-one basis for up to six months, worked with 458 children.  The mental health impact of Covid-19 featured heavily across these services.</p><p> When restrictions were first introduced in Ireland, children were among the first to be impacted.  Cut off from school and from extended members, friends and the sports and activities which can play a vital role in their lives, they reached out to Childline for support.  In the first week of school closures, Childline experienced an instant increase in demand across its online, phone and text-based services.  While demand for our phone and text services were sustained thereafter, children continued to seek support in increasing numbers online.  It may have felt as though their conversation could be overheard at home.  </p><p> In the initial period of the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, our listening services saw an increase in contacts around mental and emotional well-being, suicide and self-harm.  Many children told us how their feelings of anxiety stemmed from every aspect of their lives.  They picked up on what their parents were going through and what was being reflected through the news and on social media.  Tensions which had been simmering under the surface in homes arose and in some cases children experienced adverse childhood experiences for the first time. </p><p> Between the closure of schools in March 2020 and the usual end of the primary school term in late June of that year, the Childline website experienced an increase in users of over 100%.  Between March 2020 and July 2020 our listening services answered over 2,500 contacts from children seeking support around their mental and emotional well-being and, in addition, we answered over 600 contacts from children who spoke with us about suicide.  The impact of intense Covid-19 restrictions reintroduced in December 2020 was felt acutely by children around Christmas time.  They spoke with us about issues including loss, anxiety and suicide ideation.  One call was received from a young girl who was living in care but felt that nobody was thinking about her.  While her challenges have begun long before the global pandemic struck, the sense of isolation, fear and anxiety which had stirred up inside her over the months of tight restrictions had brought her to a place where she felt she could not go on and that she urgently needed to talk. </p><p> Since October 2020 the Childline listening service has answered over 5,500 contacts in total from children seeking support around their mental and emotional well-being.  They tell us how they feel anxious, unhappy, lonely and more.  </p><p> The Childline therapeutic service, which offers more directed therapeutic support to children, young people and their families, is now seeing significant stress and anxiety around school and peer interactions.  Children have become more withdrawn.  They are out of the mode of socialising and perhaps they have changed too and they are not quite sure where they fit in any more.  There are increased levels of anxiety, with more children feeling as though they cannot leave their bedroom or their house and as though they cannot go back to school or to the so-called normal.</p><p> Our E-therapeutic support model now allows us to support these children and young people online.  The model of E-therapeutic support allows us to engage with young people online, offering the same levels of therapeutic interventions as our face-to-face sessions, with a focus on goal orientation to match the young person&rsquo;s strengths and needs at the time of our work together.  </p><p> We were fortunate during Covid-19 to have our E-therapeutic support programme evaluated through a pilot review and the results confirmed that where a young person wishes to engage therapeutically online, the impact of this work matches that of a face-to-face engagement.  We are confident from the evaluation of the pilot that we have a robust proof of concept that highlights the potential in this service model and the role such a model can play in supporting children and young people post Covid-19.</p><p> Mental well-being and anxiety continue to be among the topics spoken about most frequently by those who turn to our services for support.  In the years since October 2020 we have answered around 26 contacts each week from children and young people who tell us they feel actively suicidal, have suicidal thoughts and feelings, or have previously attempted suicide.  In that same period, we have answered 923 contacts from young people speaking about self-harm.  We anticipate that children will continue to experience acute challenges related to the impact of Covid-19 on their mental health for some time to come.  We must ensure that they have access to the supports they need, when they need them.  </p><p> I thank the members for their attention and I look forward to engaging with them.</p></speech>

It is a sombre exercise listening to the facts relating to the impact of Covid-19 on children.  Even though children were probably spared the worst ravages of the illness and this pandemic in respect of mortality and sickness, they were not spared the disruption of their lives as it had a very significant impact on children.  I can only imagine what kind of fear there was with the onset of the pandemic.  Most adults when they heard what was coming must have experienced a fear factor and that would have seeped down to many children and disrupted their lives incalculably in some ways.</p> <p>  There is a legacy from the pandemic in what it has done to children and it is important to address those issues as quickly as possible.  In practical terms, what legacy issues can both agencies address in respect of the disruption that the pandemic has caused, in particular, for children?</p></speech>

The short answer is that we do not really know but we are starting to see these.  The basis of our intervention in Childline and the ISPCC is helping children to build resilience in order that they can cope with these adverse childhood events.  There is much research to show that everyone will encounter adverse childhood events and this is certainly a significant event, as we can see.  The data are there and the committee can see from our colleagues in Barnardos and within Childline that the anxiety levels and tensions were through the roof.  The first indication we got was 27 March, which was when real lockdown happened, and from then on we a saw 30% increase in our calls to Childline.  Much of what happened at that stage was about fear, the fear of not only getting the virus but for loved ones and of one's grandmother getting it, which were the initial calls we received in Childline.</p> <p>  As we went on people began to realise that this was not going to last just a few months or was just time off school - which is usually great - but was going to go on for much longer.  With the announcements yesterday it looks like some of the restrictions are also going to go on for a little bit longer.</p> <p>  From our perspective, our hope is that it highlights the need to at least match mental health services with the investment that we have in the physical health services side.  Those mental health services are significantly undervalued.  If one looks at the WHO recommendations, it recommends that 12% to 14% should be invested in those services and we are currently at 5%.  We are way off in the supports we provide to young children.  If one looks at the waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, these are unacceptable.  If anything, we need to act very quickly in starting to look after the children and young people because these adverse childhood events will impact society later in life.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.395" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Connolly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021102000002#B00600"><p>First, as adults, both as parents and as this committee of elected representatives here and all of the professions, we should do all we can to let children know that we are there for them, that we can support them in their anxiety and enable them to think positively about their future.  The reopening of schools was crucial and key.  We now need to ensure that children can thrive in schools, go to and stay in school and that they can develop to their potential.  That is why I was so pleased that that happened.  The closing of the schools had a very significant impact on their well-being, as well as on their other activities.</p> <p>  As Mr. Church has said, we need a variety of services. We need both the generic universal services which say that a degree of anxiety, worry and stress is normal.  However, when that stress begins to interfere with one&rsquo;s everyday life and capacity, that the services are then available.  That needs to be across a continuum, from services such as Childline and the services that we provide in the communities and homes.  These must also come, as Mr. Church has alluded to, from the more specialist CAMHS services, where children really need particular types of attention because of the level of this anxiety, because they have potential disorders such as obsessive-compulsive, or because there is suicide ideation.  Perhaps Ms Keane would like to add to that.</p></speech>

I echo everything said by Ms Connolly.  I will answer the Deputy's specific question on what we can do to counter the impacts or the legacy that will be there post-Covid for the children and families that Barnardos works with.  One of the key ways we can support children into the future is by creating that sense of belonging and connectedness for them.  We do that primarily in our work on the ground in Barnardos by supporting parents to have a better understanding of their child's needs; have a better insight into their emotional world and what is going on for them; build up their skills to be able to support their children in their overall development; and improve parent and child relationships and communication.  In my work on the ground, a key way to support children post-Covid is by supporting their parents to better able to be that front line of support to them.</p> <p>  The other key piece of work we are doing at the moment is working with children one to one to build their resilience, as mentioned by Mr. Church, and to develop their capacity to cope with stress, to understand what stress does to their bodies, and to help them to calm themselves and to re-engage with those really critical opportunities of education, hobbies and social networks.  From a practical perspective on the ground, our direct work with parents and children is helping them to develop those skills to mitigate the impact of what they have been through.</p></speech>

We are all aware of the very long waiting times for intervention, and we know that early intervention is crucial for children's well-being.</p> <p>  We spoke a few minutes ago about the first port of call for children being their parents, or whatever circumstances is their family model.  What advice does Mr. Church have for children in that regard?  Anxiety is a fact of life.  It is how one deals with it.  In the past 18 months, this has manifested in all sorts of ways for everybody but particularly for children.  Some children may have inverted this and may have shown behaviour they have not shown before.  With regard to parents, siblings and the child's family group, the pandemic did a number of things but it may also have brought people closer in communities and within families, which is very important.  That went a number of ways also.  When parents are speaking to their child, what is the best way to engage around certain types of anxieties that children may be having during the pandemic and post-pandemic?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.398" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Church" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021102000002#C00300"><p>First, it has to be acknowledged that the majority of children and young people have been amazing during this Covid period.  They showed incredible resilience.  They got back to school and they got back to sports.  However, the numbers we have presented here today show that a worrying number of children are being left behind.  The ISPCC's  philosophy of resilience building does involve the parents.  The nature of Childline is that it is a confidential service.  The children contact us and they are the centre of our service.  Very often the issue is how to communicate with the parent.  The children may say, "My parents are not listening to me", or "I do not know how to talk to my siblings".  The services we provide help children to do that.  We have also introduced a parent hub, something that Barnardos has also done, in recognition that the parent is a significant part of this also.  We are moving more of our services towards early intervention and prevention.  The one bit of advice that we would give to parents is to continue to talk. Talking is very good.  Talking makes you stronger.  People are probably better at it now than when I was a young fella.  That is a very good thing.  It is not a sign of weakness.  Parents should talk from a very early age with their children, and make that brave move to start very early.  They should also talk to teachers and to coaches.  Very often teachers are the ones who recognise signs, and will come to a parent on the sideline to perhaps say, "I have noticed something about Johnny and he has been a bit quieter".  Talking is very important, as is listening.</p></speech>

If the parents are okay then children are able to feel they can be supported and they do not have to worry about their parents.  I would like to put this into the mix, and perhaps Ms Keane would like to add to that.</p></speech>

In regard to how parents can best respond to their children's mental health needs and their children's anxiety, it is absolutely about minding their own first.  It is the notion of the adult putting on his or her own oxygen mask before putting on anybody else's.  In a sense, parents learning ways to manage their own stressors and anxieties, to remain calm and to focus themselves is the first step in responding adequately to their children's needs.  Beyond that, it is absolutely as Mr. Church and Ms Connolly have said, it is about talking and open communication within the home.  That starts from the very early years of a child's life, that sense of "you can come and talk to me about anything".  It is not just about the talking and the open communication, it is also about shared joy and fun between parents and children.  It is very important to have that sense of safety, nurture, fun and joy at home.</p> <p>  As Mr. Church has already mentioned, the third piece is talking about the child's experience extending out into the other spheres the child is part of, including school life, friendships and community involvement, and making sure there is a sense of how the child is doing in all of those areas.  Those are the three layers, as I would see it, for how a parent can best support their child's mental health.</p></speech>

It is very insightful and informative with regard to the impacts on children.  It has been a very difficult time for everybody.  Hopefully we are coming to a conclusion, somewhat, of the terrible ravages of this pandemic.  I thank the ISPCC and Barnardos for all of their work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1452" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021102000002#C00700"><p>I thank Mr. Church, Ms Connolly and Ms Keane for coming before the committee this morning.  The one beauty about these committees is that a lot more can be said and printed here than in any media or newspapers.  It is a great opportunity to get the truth and the real stuff out there.</p> <p>  I will turn first to Barnardos with a question for Ms Connolly and Ms Keane.  The opening statement showed there was an 82% increase in stress, a 50% increase in stress at home, and a 15% increase in substance use.  This was all during the lockdown.  The witnesses spoke about all of the options and the additional challenges resulting from the pandemic, such as funding.  The last budget provided for a measly &euro;24 million.  I do not believe the &euro;24 million will keep the services in the ticking over position, as they stand now.  Ms Connolly and Ms Keane spoke about helping parents to engage with their children and children to engage with their parents.  There is an old cliche, a problem shared is a problem halved.  When it comes to mental health or anxiety, however, or anything on that scale, it is very difficult for the child to go to a parent because we are naturally a reactive society, unfortunately, so the problem shared is not a problem halved, it is a problem doubled.  The first thing the parent does is to react.  The child sees that and there is another reaction and then it escalates.  Mr. Church said, and he is right, that the schoolteacher or the sports coach is normally the one who first picks up on this.  Are the organisations facing major challenges in trying to get parents and children engaged?  Obviously, there are additional issues there.</p><p>On the second one, in his opening statement Mr. Church said in the space of 11 months the society's services had listened to calls from nearly 250,000 children.  I am actually lost for words.  Nearly 250,000 children in the space of 11 months.  That is in only one service.  We have been trying to get this through to Governments over the years.  Again, we are a reactive society.  We will wait until there has been a tsunami of suicides and then we will say, "God, how did that happen?" or ask why is this or that broken, when we are hearing from the witnesses coming into the committee telling us about the issues and trying to resolve them and they are not being listened to.  I found the following line stark since we are talking about children.  We know in adults and maybe young adults it could be prevalent but the ISPCC had: "... over 600 contacts from children who spoke with us about suicide."  "Suicide" is the full-stop word.  It is the last one.  You have gone beyond anxiety, social exclusion and stuff.  That is very worrying.</p><p> I am very interested in the society's  e-therapeutic support programme because we have a different generation there now.  However, again many of these people do not have broadband, the Internet or computers to be able to get that.  The other line was, "... 26 contacts each week from children and young people who tell us they feel actively suicidal, have suicidal thoughts and feelings, or have previously attempted suicide."  That is 26 per week.  I am not going to do the maths now but we have been talking about mental health and mental health services for a very long time.  What seems to be coming up all the time is the lack of services.  Then when you go to whoever is in power, they tell us of the lack of resources and that they cannot get staff.  We had it here two or maybe three years ago when 114 assistant psychiatrists were promised.  They did step up to the mark and did hire them but they were not doing psychiatry, they were doing paperwork.  There is a massive breakdown within the system.  </p><p> I do not want to come across as always being negative because there are people in the front line here who are absolutely amazing but it is about how we pull together all the supports to support the likes of Barnardo's, the ISPCC or any of the other NGO groups.  It is heartbreaking for us listening to this.  You can imagine the stress on families.  I have seen it in my own family and I even struggled with it during Covid.  We are used to being out and about and meeting people but I was actually struggling from social anxiety and was trying to condition myself back into getting out and being confident around people.  However, thinking of the present organisations and children who are most vulnerable, it really hurts me when I hear these statements.</p><p> I have two questions.  Do the witnesses agree that between here and, say, next May we will see a tsunami of mental health issues coming to their services?  It is a weird one.  May is normally the highest factor month for suicides.  It is not in the dark, grey days of December or January but the start of summer, which is crazy.</p><p> I asked my second question at the last meeting.  There was &euro;24 million and apparently a &euro;10 million one-off payment to be invested in new mental health services this year.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in put forward a package of more than &euro;113 million, which would have been the largest in the history of the State.  That shows who we are serious about and who listens to people.  It is a difficult question the witnesses may not be able to answer on the budget for this.  I think Mr. Church mentioned the WHO and investing 10% or 12%, whereas I would say we are investing less than 5% in mental health services.  It is not always about money because throwing money at the problem will not fix it.  We have to go back to the start and look at salaries, the training for psychiatrists, psychologists and so forth.  That takes years and because the system is so toxic it is not being fully supported.  Those who have the empathy to work in those services lose faith because they do not have their own supports and see children falling through the cracks.  Is it therefore a matter of going back to the start and saying we need to streamlines services, we need to streamline training, we need supports to be put in place and we need proper budgets ringfenced every year?  Also, as the Chair will be aware, we are talking about all the stress and anxiety of Covid and so on and we are talking about investing in mental health services, yet we have the Owenacurra Centre, in my own town of Midleton, that has never had Covid, has never had a suicide and because of lack of investment from the HSE in the maintenance of the building it is going to shut down that service in the middle of a pandemic.  It is ludicrous.</p><p> Do the witnesses understand what I am saying when I refer to supports and trying to get people to work together?  It is a lot to take in but I would love to hear the opinion of the the witnesses on it.  It is not a quiz or a competition.  I just need their honest opinions because we can take it back.  When you are in committees like this, at least the public outside are hearing the truth and hearing it from the witnesses who are in here.  I do not think many people would have been aware that the organisations' services have been under so much stress during Covid and how well they have coped with it.  I do not see any of them throwing the rattle out of the pram, if they know what I mean.  They have kept their decorum.  However, we also need to know how well they are prepared going into the future with this trend, which I suspect will increase in the next couple of months, and how they will cope with it.</p></speech>

How do you eat an elephant?  First, I will directly answer the Deputy's questions and then I will develop my answers.  Will there be a tsunami of mental health issues?  Yes, absolutely.  The issues we have encountered during Covid were on the rise anyway.  Suicide ideation and anxiety were on the rise anyway.  Life is different.  It seems to be more challenging for children nowadays.  Maybe it is the way we parent; I do not know.  However it is a very tough environment for children growing up now.  I will get on to budgets in a minute.  To our last point about parent-child interaction, Childline is a confidential service so sometimes the only person or service children have a relationship with, in terms of their issue, is Childline.  They cannot talk to their parents.  All I can say is, on 27 March thank God we got essential service status.  It meant the 220 volunteers across six units in Ireland could travel in and out.  I shudder to think about that not being available.  At least we were there, because we were needed.  We went 24-7 with not only our telephone but our web chat and text service, which was very positive.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about our e-therapeutic services as well.  Funny enough, it dealt us a positive hand in that we were forced into piloting video therapy.  All our 21 therapeutic staff were taken off the road and we went straight into video.  Then we took the chance to do a pilot.  All 468 children were put through this pilot and the results were comparable with face-to-face.  That is hugely encouraging.  We have presented that to Tusla already and we will present it to whoever wants to see it.  To the Deputy's point, we are not throwing the rattle out of the pram.  We are coming up with solutions.  Another solution we introduced during Covid was an external service called SilverCloud.  Members may have heard of it.  It is a cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT-based online intervention.  We have already taken 70 children off the CAMHS waiting list.  There were 2,700 on that list waiting 12 months.  We are running the pilot.  Not only are the children coming through very well, the parents are coming back to us - because they are involved - and to our point earlier about getting parents involved, they are saying they are noticing a difference.  We are saying now to Government we have got solutions within our infrastructure and we have got the capacity to see four times the number of children per day than we would face-to-face, with similar outcomes.  Members may ask how that is the case.  We are operating in the environment children are used to.  Children are living online.  They are used to texting, chat and video.  That is their environment.  We are coming into their environment instead of forcing them into a face-to-face environment.</p> <p>  Suicide ideation was always on the increase.  Self-harming is always an issue.  We would often have instances of people self-harming on the call in the middle of the night with a volunteer.  It is the only place in the country they can go.</p><p>There is nowhere else open except accident and emergency and hospital.  At least we are open 24-7.  We get only 30% of our funding from Government but to back up the Deputy's point, and I have said already, we are coming to the Government with solutions.  We would like to come with solutions.  We have an infrastructure that has taken 30 years to build up with Childline and we have committed volunteers.  We are now going online and we can see four times the number of children with similar outcomes.  That is a good starting point in eating the elephant.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the fact that I think online services have a future and are meeting a need, as Mr. Church highlighted, I feel passionately about in-person services for vulnerable children and their parents and the importance of delivering those services where children and families can access them.  It is important to see what is happening in the home and to have a warm, welcoming service in a centre.  We need to be there for the long haul for children and families because some children have had multiple traumas in their early life and need intensive services and service provision.  We also need to be very careful, particularly when talking about children, as we cannot separate their overall development from their mental health needs because if children have anxiety, it affects their education and their social abilities too.  Whatever we are doing, we have to plan with a range of organisations working together to ensure the best outcome for a child.  That is really important.  We need to listen to children and parents and be clear about what works.  We offered online services during Covid as well but what we found was that people really wanted our staff to be there, professionally, socially distanced, 6 m away, waving to them from the road to say, "We are here for you".  We delivered hot meals to those parents and their children and the children could not wait to get back into centres.</p> <p>  It annoys me, from a funding point of view, that the services provided by the community and voluntary sector do not get sufficient recognition by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the thinking about what is needed.  We are constantly having to spend a lot of effort in explaining what we deliver, why it is important and why it meets a need.  That is very effortful and sometimes it takes away from the effort we could be putting into developing more and more programmes that work for children and families.  I also feel it is important that we do not talk about just the problems but about the solutions.  With the right services provided by organisations like Barnardos, the ISPCC and others, as well as the State and different professions, we can meet children's needs and give them hope and possibilities for their future, and a sense of purpose and meaning.  That is important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.407" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021102000002#E00300"><p>I will answer the question about whether we as organisations on the ground feel we are facing a tsunami of mental health issues over the next number of months.  We are seeing an increase in mental health difficulties for children and parents already so I would absolutely be concerned about that continuing.  We see children who are finding it difficult to make and sustain friendships now that they have gone back to school because they have regressed in their social skills.  They are struggling to play with friends in the schoolyard, they are lashing out more and getting into fights more.  Children are more isolated and withdrawn.  As Ms Connolly mentioned in her opening statement, some children are struggling to leave home at all, and sometimes struggling to leave their bedrooms, such is their level of anxiety and isolation.  We are seeing children with increased regulation difficulties.  They are struggling to sit still in class, they are more disruptive than they would have been and more aggressive in their behaviour.  As Mr. Church mentioned, we are seeing a marked increase in children presenting with sometimes severe anxiety and indicators of depression as well.  We are seeing increases in children self-harming and having suicidal ideation.  We have seen already a significant increase in all of those things.</p> <p>  As regards parents' mental health, we are encountering parents with higher levels of stress who are struggling to cope with the daily challenges of parenting, bearing in mind they are supporting children who also have a higher level of need.  Some parents are struggling to re-engage with society and supports themselves.  We are absolutely seeing an increase in mental health challenges for children and parents and the concern is that is going to increase.  One of the questions was how we are finding parents' engagement with the supports that a service like Barnardos can offer.  We are actually seeing positive engagement from parents on the ground.  As Ms Connolly said, what parents are telling us is that they want us to be there in the home, supporting them directly and supporting their children to get through these challenges and to help them develop their skills and insight to be able to mitigate the impact of Covid and support their children's development.  Services like ours always have waiting lists.  We could do much more than we are currently able to do if we were adequately resourced.  That is what I am seeing on the ground.</p></speech>

There is so much going on as I am listening to the witnesses speak.  First, I thank them for the phenomenal work they are doing.  I can safely say I speak on behalf of the members in that regard.  Unfortunately we are low on members today due to the fact that Wednesday is a hectic day here in Leinster House.  It is a small committee anyway.  I want to ask about the process of the organisations.  If a child rings the ISPCC or Barnardos or connects with them in some capacity, what happens?  What is the process?  Obviously there are different processes for the two organisations but I ask the witnesses to take me through the journey towards a positive outcome for that child.  I am sure they do not always get positive outcomes but just give me an example.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.409" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Church" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021102000002#E00500"><p>Our greatest engagement with the greatest number of children would be through our traditional Childline phone line and online.  We introduced the web chat service and kids love it and interact with it.  We also do face-to-face services like Barnardos but through a different model.  Those children come through referrals from GPs and Tusla, mainly.  To take a typical phone call, I would first note that it is confidential.  A child rings or contacts us through the web chat service and that child and our volunteer both have a pseudonym.  Immediately he or she is told that this is non-judgmental and non-directive.  We believe everything the child says and that is the process.  The volunteers are very well-trained and are also supported through their own couselling intervention because it can be very difficult sometimes.  The majority of our outcomes or interactions are very positive.  We get repeat callers.  We get children calling on Christmas Day, which is actually quite a popular day, sometimes just to say what they got for Christmas.  Then in the afternoon they are worried about the alcohol level that has risen in the house.  It ranges from children just being lonely with nobody to talk to, to having difficulty with their exams.  They can call as often as they like but we are working towards empowering the volunteer to refer that individual to some of our other services.  We have often directed other children and young people to services outside our own if we feel there is an issue of suicide, alcohol, drugs or whatever.</p></speech>

Sometimes we get children of 19 as well.  These are issues that our volunteers are very well-trained on and we can deal with them for children under 18 but it is about building the resilience of the child.  The conversation with the child is important.  We do not provide solutions.  We do not direct the child as to how to do things.  We establish what their network is and what their supports are first and foremost and encourage them to come up with a solution.  That may take a number of phone calls or online chats but we believe it is the way to do it, as opposed to prescribing for every child.  Let them come up with the answer and they can ring any time.  Some of our busiest times are online chats in the middle of the night when the house has gone very quiet and the parents are in bed.</p><p>At least they can now go online and have a chat with somebody, who could be in Limerick, Castlebar, Drogheda or elsewhere.  We have a number of units around the country.  Children get exactly the same welcome and go through the same process in each instance.</p></speech>

We take self-referrals from parents, referrals from schools, public health nurses, doctors and community projects, and we take a number of referrals from Tusla's child protection services and duty and intake social work services.  There is a very broad range of services referring into Barnardos, including families themselves.  The journey then proceeds to an assessment of the child's needs, taking into account his or her unique strengths and challenges, and the strengths and challenge within the family unit.  The idea of the assessment is to determine what the parents are able to bring to the table, what other supports they have around them that can be drawn on, and what is available through school and other services.  The purpose is to come up with a plan of support to target particular areas of need for that particular child.  For each child, an individual, tailored plan is drawn up based on his or her unique circumstances and needs.</p> <p>  Many of the interventions we provide are for parents, as I mentioned, with a focus on developing their insight and skills in supporting their child's development.  There is a focus on how to support their relationship and communication with their child, with an understanding that this is one of the best ways to support children's well-being.  Other areas of support we offer to parents following the assessment include support in providing structure and positive routines at home in order that children have a predictable environment that supports their overall development.  We also work with parents on understanding their children's social and emotional needs and identifying practical ways in which they can make sure their children are achieving in those areas.  Parenting input is something we regularly offer families after we have completed an assessment.</p> <p>  The other key service we offer is one-to-one work with children.  This is often focused on developing their emotional literacy, including understanding their feelings and how they can manage their behaviour more positively and make more positive choices.  We work to help them to communicate and interact more positively with family members and peers.  That is very broadly the journey on which a parent or child would embark when they come to Barnardos.  The focus is on providing specific, tailored plans that respond to each family's unique circumstances in the context of the particular community in which they live.</p> <p>  The benefit of this very direct model of support is that it means we mostly work in family homes and are really tuned into the challenges and strengths going on around a child.  It allows us to develop very connected relationships with parents and children because we are in their world and we know what that looks and feels like.  Our model is very much strengths-based, with an emphasis on meeting parents and children where they are at and drawing on the positives that are already there in terms of making changes.  That is a very broad run-through of the process.  It is different for every parent and child who comes through the door.  Ms Connolly may wish to pick up on anything I missed.</p></speech>

I am aware that Ms Keane has to leave soon but I have a couple more questions before she does.  There has been concern during the Covid-19 pandemic that there was an increase in parental misuse of alcohol, prescription drugs and illegal drugs.  Gambling has also come to the fore as an issue.  Can Ms Keane say a little about the impact of that behaviour, particularly around alcohol misuse?  I do not know whether anybody really understands the impact it can have on a family.  Even the individual engaging in the behaviour may not understand its impact, particularly on children.  Has Barnardos seen an increase in alcohol harm and drug misuse?  What are its findings in that regard?</p></speech>

Many of the parents and children who come to Barnardos were experiencing multiple challenges in terms of their well-being before the Covid crisis and had a great deal of adversity to manage in their lives.  A significant number of the parents we work with come from very difficult childhood experiences themselves.  During the Covid period, we definitely saw an increase in drug and alcohol use, a rise in conflict and violence within family homes and an exacerbation of existing parental mental health difficulties.  Obviously, all of that had a direct impact on children's well-being and mental health.</p> <p>  On the specific point about an increase in drug and alcohol use in homes, what we saw and heard from families was that their home life really became like a pressure cooker during the Covid lockdowns.  Those issues may have been in the background already but, suddenly, everybody was at home together, all day and every day, and there was stress on top of stress and none of the normal outlets, releases or reliefs in terms of school routines, work or social connections within the community.  We certainly saw an increase in that type of pressure.  In terms of children's direct lived experience, they saw parents being less emotionally and physically available to them because they were more likely to be using substances.  Routines fell away in family homes and there was a sense of unpredictable, chaotic home lives, without any of the buffers that were there before Covid such as community activities and hobbies and, critically, school routines.  There was a sense of people being in a pressure cooker scenario without any of the usual outlets.</p></speech>

Does he believe there is a connection there with the pressure on families during the Covid period?</p></speech>

We are almost like the emergency department of child services in the middle of the night.  For all the reasons Ms Keane outlined, Covid led to a pressure cooker situation in which not only were children unable to leave the home but the alcoholic or perpetrator also could not leave.  There was a major issue in that regard.  As to how it manifested in terms of children contacting us, there was a fear before and after incidents of violence as well as anxiety at certain times of the day because they knew their father or mother was going to start consuming alcohol, get violent and abusive and take it out on them.  A lot of support, including supports for our volunteers, was needed to deal with those issues.</p> <p>  I referred in my opening address to our online services.  The 24-hour web chat facility and visits to our website saw a really significant increase because children did not want to be overheard.  That is our hypothesis anyway.  It makes perfect sense that if the perpetrator heard the child making a telephone call, he or she would be subject to the sort of abuse that was the reason for making contact.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  The witness reports are very interesting and I want to drill down into some aspects of them.  Picking up on the previous point, Mr. Church mentioned that children continue to seek support in increasing numbers online because they may be concerned that a telephone conversation could be overheard at home.  Can he substantiate that hypothesis, because it is an important point?</p><p>If a child makes the switch from a telephone call to online, Mr. Church is hypothesising as to the reason for it.  Does he have anything to back that up?</p></speech>

In our engagement with the children, they said it to us.  We do not have actual numbers; we are only lucky that we have a service there for it.  Another hypothesis might be that children are moving away from the telephone anyway.  We have seen a slow decrease in telephone contact to online, but as that trend went way up, it was very clear that it was correlated with the lockdown.  I am quite happy to stand over that hypothesis.  If we did some research, I think it would show that.  It makes perfect sense that some of the children who are contacting us, normally by telephone, would switch to online because they do not want to be overheard.</p></speech>

They would talk about having thoughts of committing suicide because nobody listens to them or understands them.  It might be related to some sort of adverse childhood event that has happened.  We deal with a lot of abuse cases as well.  I am referring to children who have been sexually abused and emotionally and physically abused.  That can often result in a child feeling that the only way out is suicide.  On self-harm, I have grown to understand it more during my time in the ISPCC and from listening to the psychologists about it.  It is seen as a way of relieving anxiety and tension.  Young girls in particular will self-harm during the telephone or online engagement in order to relieve that stress, tension and anxiety.  It is something I could never have imagined was possible, but it happens regularly enough for us to be concerned about it.</p></speech>

During the Covid period, which is the period under review today, the fear was around getting the virus and in regard to parents dying.  Every day, as we all know, there were reports of numbers and deaths.  This was being recounted to us.  This information was all over social media and traditional media.  That played havoc with children's emotions.  It was the fear of getting the disease, that their loved ones would get it, including their grandmothers, and the isolation from their grandparents etc.</p></speech>

The issues were particularly around violence in the home and domestic abuse.  We were in close contact with Women's Aid over that period as well.  What Women's Aid was listening to by way of its services on the adult side was being mirrored on our side for children.  Covid played havoc with children's emotions.  They were missing their friends.  There was significant isolation and feelings of isolation and anxiety about being repeatedly being taken away from their day-to-day model of life and routine.  The disruption in routine and the affects of that became a huge part of our conversations with children by way of the telephone in particular.</p> <p>  Many of the children who contacted us, in particular during Covid, did not do so to get a diagnosis and nor do we seek to diagnose.  They are only children.  At the end of the day, they were telling us how they felt.  Our job is to listen and try to help them cope.  Our epicentre is somewhere between 11 and 15 or perhaps 13 and 16 years of age.  At that stage of life, many children do not know what is going on in their lives.  All they can do is talk about how they feel, which is very good.  </p></speech>

We are in schools as well.  We are on social media too.  We advertise our number on social media.  Every call is a self-referral.  We often get what is known as a "silent call", which is when an individual who has taken some time to get up the courage to call Childline does so but remains silent.  We engage with that person for up to two minutes maximum.  We seek to reassure the child that he or she can be heard and that we are there to help and we are not judgmental.  It is about building up that confidence with the child.  Very often, the child calls back and starts to talk.</p> <p>  In regard to the question regarding the 11-year-old, one of my first calls when I joined the ISPCC was from a ten-year-old.  It is a typical ten-year-old testing the water.  We ask the child for a name that is not their real name, the child gives a false name and the volunteer introduces himself or herself and tries to build up a relationship with the child.  The average call is just over 60 seconds, but the range could be from ten seconds to 35 to 40 minutes.  The latter would tend to be the older teenagers who are probably more confident to call.  It is quite distressing.  We get six and seven-year-olds calling Childline.  They may have come across the number or, maybe, their friend has talked about it.  You have to try to get into the mindset of a seven-year-old, using very basic language, to tease out what the issue is.  </p></speech>

It is literally just one or two words sometimes.  Thankfully, our volunteers are trained.  We have a very young volunteer base as well.

Children will express their feelings through their behaviour because they are not necessarily that articulate.  It is our role as adults to think about what the child needs and what will support him or her.  Earlier, Ms Keane talked about an assessment of need.  That is really important.  You need to think about the best way you can help that child and that family.  We are aware that some of the children will have externalising behaviours.</p><p>You know they are unhappy because they let you know.  Whether they are shouting, kicking or being very disruptive, you will know they are unhappy.  Other children will go back into themselves.  They will be quiet and may not come out of their rooms.  They may eat less.  To meet their needs, it is important that the adults around them notice that and do something about it.  Within Barnardos, we have a range of services.  Ms Keane is representing one service but we have 45 centres throughout the country and we provide a range of things.  Across those services, we really try to think about what a particular child needs and to address those needs.  We have early years services and, as we know, children at this age make their distress very clear through their behaviour.  Older children may show it differently.  If a child is not settling back into school and connecting with their friends and if they are no longer doing the things they did before, you will know that child is unhappy.  It is our job to see what we can do to help such children get back on track.  </p><p> Recently, Barnardos arranged another service.  At an event last Friday, a parent and a young woman of 17 or 18 spoke about their experiences of the service over several years.  They talked about how the service enabled them to get help when they needed it.  There was a time when the young person did not want to talk to her mum and dad.  Even though they wanted to be there for her, she did not want to talk to them.  She wanted to talk to somebody else outside the family.  The parents said they wanted a professional to help her.  They were at the end of their tether.  They were able to say that the service they had got from Barnardos, which provided a project worker, had made a real difference to their lives and to the life of their child in particular because she was struggling with her mental health.  I hope that is helpful.  I do not know whether Ms Keane wants to add anything.</p></speech>

The children Barnardos works with are predominantly in middle childhood and children do struggle to articulate what is going on with them and how they are feeling.  They need support to learn those words and those skills.  A lot of the time, it is about looking at what their behaviour is telling us.  A significant piece we can support parents with through our work is trying to see behaviour as their children's way of communicating with them.  The children may not be able to say they are feeling worried or scared or that they miss their friends.  They are more likely to show that by acting out, withdrawing or whatever it might be.  One of the most important parts of our work is helping parents to understand what their children are showing them as a means of communication.  I wanted to reiterate that very important point on what behaviour shows us.</p></speech>

The Barnardos representatives have said that we know children are among the groups most adversely impacted.  How do they know that?</p></speech>

Almost 1,500 parents have told us that their children have been impacted.  We also know through our services.  We have always seen it, even before Covid.  When you go into a family home, you can quickly know what is there for a child and what is not.  You sense the atmosphere.  Sometimes you are dealing with families who are living in poverty.  That gives you strong evidence.  There may not be enough food around, the house may be cold or, although this is a bit unkind, the parents may not really be there because you can see they have taken a substance.  You know the children's needs are not being met.  During the Covid pandemic, we were involved in supporting families where domestic violence or acrimonious separation are features.  We were out talking about this.  Children have told us in Barnardos about the impact of living with parents who cannot talk to each other civilly.  I am not even talking about the horrific cases where actual physical abuse is going on.  Children tell us.  They actually use the line that it gives them a sick feeling in their tummies.  I could give the Deputy numerous examples of the impact on children.</p></speech>

The Deputy is absolutely right; it needs to be asked and there needs to be evidence to support what we are saying.  One of the things Barnardos has said is that we really want to understand the impact of what has been a very disruptive school year on children's education.   The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Government itself have carried out research on this and we understand that some children who were lucky enough to be well-resourced at home, which is to say they were not worried about money, had access to digital facilities and their parents supported them, may not have suffered that much educationally.  However, we are really worried that children who did not have that support at home, did not have access to broadband and who struggled to motivate themselves or be motivated to do well in school will suffer.  Interestingly enough, Ms Keane has to leave in approximately four minutes because she is going to meet a family and Tusla to talk about a particular situation in which a child has not gone back to school.  I will not ask her to talk about that particular case but there are probably other things going on in the family outside of the child not doing well educationally.  I imagine there are struggles with parenting and so on.  We know from our targeted family support work that children have really been impacted where they did not have the support at home that other children have.  That is the reality.  The other thing-----</p></speech>

It relates to e-therapeutic support.  Will the witnesses elaborate a bit on that?  How does a child access that?  How do I, as a legislator, or any adult know that people cannot masquerade as an e-therapeutic support provider and that children will not find themselves straying into difficulty unknowingly?  What safeguards are in place?</p></speech>

Over the years, as children changed, Childline introduced new online services as well.  Like Barnardos, we have traditionally done face-to-face interventions as well.  These are predominantly funded by, and individuals are predominantly referred through, Tusla.  Two years ago, we undertook a strategic review.  We wanted to bring our resilience-based service to more children.  We asked ourselves how we should do that and what was the best way to ensure increased reach as we scaled up our services.  We came to the conclusion that scaling up our face-to-face business or supports would result in a significant expense relative to what we could achieve through online or e-therapeutic supports.</p><p>We wanted to look at what type of typical interventions that would mean.  As a lot of work is being done in the UK, Scandinavia and Australia on this, we looked at what others are doing.  Then suddenly Covid hit and we were forced into a live pilot, which was a blessing in disguise, in that the 450 children who we would normally see face to face were forced to go through the same programme online through a video call.  At present, we do a video call but we also have a service called SilverCloud, which is a cognitive behaviour therapy, CBT, based online intervention.  That is a pilot and is being funded by the HSE.  The HSE is looking at this as an intervention for children.  It is already there for adults.  Some 70 children have been referred off the CAMHS waiting list, and we intervene.  It is a self-assessed six-week programme but we know when a child has dropped off so we intervene.  We talk to the child and ask if there is any way we can help the child to keep on the programme.  Then we talk-----</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses as they were quite informative.  I am particularly interested in Deputy Lahart's engagement on Childline and the operational element of it.  Are there many repeat calls?  Does the ISPCC profile the callers to try to establish if there are repeat callers?  What does the ISPCC do to support the repeat callers in terms of referral to other agencies?  Is Childline just a specific listening service or does the ISPCC intervene through referrals if it believes that is necessary?  I am trying to get a handle on that.  Mr. Church said there were 240,000 calls in the first nine months of 2020.  That is remarkable and I would like to know how much of that is repeat business, as such.</p></speech>

On the nature of the service, it is a listening service.  It is not like a triage to refer somebody on, because it is confidential.  It is one service in a list of services.  The child could very well be seeing a psychotherapist and could be within the system already.  It is another option for a child to ring and have a confidential chat because the child knows he or she will not be judged, will not be told what to do and will not be chastised.  We get a number of children calling repeatedly.  We are looking at this as well, with a view to seeing whether there is anything we can do for the child if he or she rings ten times in a short period.</p></speech>

Does the ISPCC feel a certain responsibility if a particular child is ringing consistently with a particular issue whereby the child could be in imminent danger or there is a serious problem?  When does the ISPCC decide to escalate it to a different level and bring in the services that would support that child?  I realise it is a delicate matter, but I am interested to know.</p></speech>

The volunteers are trained to know what the child is saying.  If the child is in imminent danger, the volunteer would tell the child what rights the child has and what services are available, but ultimately the child has to say, "Yes, I need help".  Then, under the Children First legislation, if there is any identifying or identifiable information we are then obliged to act.  We refer children to the Garda and to Tusla depending on the time of the day if there are issues with abuse in the home.</p></speech>

That is recognising that children and young people, and indeed their parents, would often have had adverse childhood experiences that will stay with them throughout their lives unless they get the appropriate type of service.  That service needs to recognise that it is necessary to have quite well-researched, informed, professional support for people who have been through the trauma that is adverse childhood experiences.  As Barnardos goes forward we want to bring that understanding into all the services that we provide for children and families.</p> <p>  Sometimes people are not able to move on in their lives because they are still carrying the hurts of things that happened to them in the past.  One needs to think of ways of working with them that enable them to express those hurts and then move on.  The way that will work for people will depend on what they are like, but sometimes it is really about connecting into their bodies, what their body is telling them and then what that will mean about how they can manage their emotions and make different choices.</p><p>Something we must be aware of is that knowing what to do does not mean someone will actually do it, as the pain and hurt might be too much.  I encourage the committee to examine the evidence on understanding the impact of trauma.  Children can sometimes misbehave, particularly in schools, and adults can believe that is deliberate, but the children are just expressing the difficulties in their lives and emotions they do not know how to process.  When encountering children who are challenging, adults must ask themselves what is happening to them that has led to them behaving in that way and how can the adults help them.  To a certain extent, this is also true of adults.  People often engage in addiction and behaviours that are damaging to themselves because they cannot deal with trauma in their lives and the pain of living.</p></speech>

We all saw how young people were criticised for hanging out in groups during the lockdown when no one was meant to be in a group of more than two people.  I have spoken to community garda&iacute; in my area and others who are involved in meeting children.  It is easy to tell children to disperse and go home, but that is not an easy thing for them to do when home is not a safe space.  That is a major factor we saw.</p> <p>  I will touch on a matter that was not covered in the opening statements but about which I spoke in the D&aacute;il last night, and I wonder whether the witnesses have had experience of it.  We are seeing people as young as ten years of age being groomed by older criminals into criminality in terms of drug use, drug crime and transporting money.  There has been a visible increase in the number of young people experimenting with drug use.  For example, one can see discarded nitrous oxide or laughing gas canisters, which are known as silver bullets, when walking around my area.  Their increase during the pandemic was noticeable to everyone.  Have the two organisations experience of young people being groomed into criminality and experimenting with drug use and how do they deal with these issues when presented to them?</p></speech>

Ms Connolly's organisation probably deals with it more than we do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.492" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Connolly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021102000002#K00500"><p>Grooming is something we are aware of in some of the communities in which we work.  I will not mention which communities due to confidentiality, but we are concerned about the issue.  With the Garda and other partner agencies in those areas, we are considering what alternative choices can be made available to children.  Keeping them in school is important, or if not school, then school-type alternatives that can track these vulnerable children.  Being involved in activities, be they boxing, football or something else, can keep children off the streets.  We also want to consider how to support parents in this regard, but as the Deputy mentioned, that is difficult if the home environment is such that the children do not want to be at home.  They are vulnerable to what the positive attention they get might afford them.  We know of young children who are being given pizza to do something for people.  As they get older, that becomes runners and other things.</p> <p>  This is something that Barnardos cannot address on its own.  There would have to be an interagency approach.  We have to give children alternatives.  We all have to work hard towards this.  Ms Kellie Harrington is an amazing role model because she talks about some of the challenges she has had in her life and what boxing has done for her, but also about how important her current job is and how she wants to keep it.  The more we can get role models out there, the more children, who are being exposed to adults who want to groom them, can listen to them.  They do not necessarily want to listen to a Barnardos worker, but they might listen to a local football hero or the Kellie Harringtons of this world in their communities.  That is what I hope we can achieve through working together.  It is heartbreaking to see innocent children being brought in and groomed and, before they know it, being caught up in criminality, and then so are their families.</p></speech>

I have been dealing with families who are doing their best to mind their children, but when their children are outside, it is difficult to mind them all the time.  I agree with Ms Connolly.  There is a cohort of good young people who are not sporty, in youth clubs or interested in school.  When there are gaps in services, young people tend to fall through them, and that is when the dangers show themselves.</p> <p>  I agree that there needs to be alternatives.  There needs to be a cross-departmental and multi-agency approach, not only to mental health, but also to the matters we are discussing.  One hat does not fit everything.  As legislators, we need to start cross-departmental approaches.  The budget was just passed and each Department is mindful of using its own budget, but if there was a cross-departmental budget from which two Departments could pull funding, it could work.  Getting one Department to fund something under another Department is difficult because people are mindful of their budgets.  That is my tuppence worth.</p> <p>  I wish to pick up on a point, although I do not want to sound like I am lecturing because that is not my style, and if I did not say that now, I would be kicking myself later.  I come from north Clondalkin in Dublin Mid-West.  It had one of the highest rates of youth and adult suicide in the State at one stage.  Many of them were people whom I went to school with and grew up with.  It is no coincidence that the very first Jigsaw and Pieta House projects were in my area.  The community demanded something because they - or, rather, we, as I am part of that community - were very worried.  As I was entering the room, I heard the term "committed suicide", so I wish to raise the matter with the witnesses.  That term adds to the stigma.  I do not want to lecture people on this, but "committed" views something of a crime.  What we have learned in our community down the years is that changing the language helps young people and others to speak about suicide.  "Died by suicide" is the term we use.</p> <p>  According to Mr. Church, over the past year, the ISPCC has received 26 contacts per week from children who are suicidal or having suicidal thoughts and 923 young people who have spoken about self-harming.  What is the ISPCC's referral pathway for children who are feeling suicidal or actively self-harming?</p></speech>

Until such time as we can identify the child, we cannot refer him or her.  We can only support the child and help him or her in building resilience.  As soon as we get any sort of information, we can refer a child.  This is sometimes a source of frustration within the service, and definitely a frustration for some of the volunteers.  We are looking at whether we can do something more.</p></speech>

Without identifying the child, are there pathways of referral?  Does the ISPCC ask the child to speak to the one good adult or a sports coach?  That is what I was asking about.  Is there that pathway?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.496" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Church" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021102000002#K00900"><p>Absolutely.  I am glad the Deputy asked me to clarify.  All of our volunteers know every single service available and we constantly encourage the child to seek those services' support.  It is proof of how many contacts we get every day that children find the Childline service of use and importance to them.  Children want to be listened to.  Some children want it to be confidential.  It is one part of a support mechanism for a child.  If we can identify the individual at any stage or promote the services that are available, we do that.</p></speech>

I always like finishing on a message of hope.  Ms Connolly of Barnardos stated, "We believe that children and families can overcome the additional mental health issues".</p><p>I believe that as well.  Ms Connolly mentioned the challenges from the pandemic but also that, in order to do this effectively, Barnardos will need the appropriate support, which will require adequate provision of universal services, as well as specific targeted supports.  I agree with that wholeheartedly.  Is Barnardos running into barriers to finding that specific support for young people who are adversely affected by mental health issues and their families, not just during Covid but at any time?  How would Ms Connolly see us, as legislators, breaking down those barriers for Barnardos?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.499" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Connolly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021102000002#L00200"><p>What I would say to legislators is that it is very important they ensure the community and voluntary sector and the services they provide get the money they need to be run effectively.  It is not just Barnardos.  We work with children and families on the edge.  On the Deputy&rsquo;s point about children who die by suicide, we have situations where parents have died by suicide and children are left without their parents.  Along with others, we provide crucial services yet we have not had any increase in the basic budget we get from Tusla for ten to 12 years.  That is not right.  It is not right for the children, young people and parents we work with in the heart of local communities.</p> <p>  We have waiting lists.  When children, young people and their parents need a service, they should be able to get that service.  They need it when they need it.  It is tragic.  I have heard over the past couple of months of at least three parents who have died by suicide, including one situation where a young boy found his dad.  That dad was trying really hard to stay off drugs but he was at that crucial time where he was detoxing and he accidentally slipped up, or we think that is what happened.  I do not want to be talking to the Deputy in a year&rsquo;s time with those things happening again.  We can do something with the right resourcing and, as we said, with really good interdepartmental ownership of the issues.</p></speech>

Sometimes we have only a very short window of opportunity to be able to assist people in whatever way they are trying to progress their lives and to make life better.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that when they seek a service, there is a service there for them so they can get the care they need when they need it and where they need it.  I thank both witnesses.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions that follow on from Deputy Ward&rsquo;s questions.  The first is a question around what supports Barnardos and the ISPCC could use if they had a magic wand.  Today, what would they say the ideal is?  What would be their ask?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.502" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Church" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021102000002#L00500"><p>On the question of why we are here and what the committee can do, I mentioned earlier that we need to move towards parity with the budget that is there for the physical health side of things.  It is easy to talk about a broken leg but, if anything comes out of Covid and this committee eventually, it is that mental health is a significant issue, particularly for children, which is our area.  We need to move towards increasing the allocation for mental health.</p> <p>  We would absolutely support the recommendation by the Mental Health Commission to recruit 138 additional child psychologists.  I mentioned earlier the pilot we are running with SilverCloud.  For us, it is a no-brainer.  The children are benefiting from it and we can see four times more children through this than face-to-face, although I am not saying we will stop face-to-face and we are looking at hybrid models.  Some children need a bit of face-to-face and a bit of online, and some need full-time face-to-face.  It is about increasing that budget and listening to those like ourselves and Barnardos with regard to the solutions.  We are almost like a subcontracted service in that the Government is subcontracting to all of our agencies.  We are highly trained and highly professional and we have the capacity and infrastructure to do it.  We just need more funding and we can clear that waiting list.  For me, personally, seeing 2,700 children on the CAMHS waiting list is totally unacceptable and it can be fixed.</p></speech>

I would also say the services we provide should be about the needs of the child, the parents and the family, and that we have wraparound and that we are all accountable for working together in that context.  For me, the magic wand would be that any child and any parent in need of a service receives warm, welcoming, responsive, evidence-based approaches that want to help them and want to make a difference.  It is also very important that we are a society where we recognise that to seek help is a strength and to be able to receive help is a strength, and that we are all in this together.  That is something I wanted to say, namely, we are all in life together.  As a country, if we chose to use our resources effectively, we could do fabulous things in terms of meeting the needs of children and their parents across a range of issues, but in particular in the context of their mental health and well-being.</p></speech>

I have one final question and I will let the witnesses go because I know they have had a long day.  Both organisations work with crisis and it is a kind of crisis management to deal with trauma, and people are in a bad way when they contact their services.  What recommendations would they have in this regard?  Is it within their capacity to run a service that could provide intervention and prevention skills before it gets to that point where children and young people are suicidal?  I hope I am making myself clear.  Is there some organisation that does that already or would Barnardos and the ISPCC have the capacity to do that?  If so, how would they go about it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.505" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Connolly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32021102000002#L00800"><p>The best example of that is two things Barnardos provides, one of which is support for young mums and young dads, as soon as the mum is pregnant, to ensure they can be the best parents they can be.  A particular point is to ensure the mother stays in school or stays in education and continues to do well because we know that makes a big difference to outcomes for children, and that is research-based and evidence-based.  The other thing we have in Barnardos is our early years family support service, which is providing that holistic approach to young children who really need it, and then we support their parents as well.  We need to intervene early and we then need to ensure that children transition well to school and stay in school, or that they have alternative choices.  They are the sort of things that are really important.</p> <p>  School is a very important context, or like-minded education supports for children who are not &ldquo;good&rdquo; academically but who might have a trade.  It is that children are supported to have their needs met and have their developmental potential achieved.  That is what I would like to see.  Barnardos, alongside other organisations, is part of that trajectory for children.  It comes back to the point I made that we need a mixture of the universal and the targeted, and that there is a range of professionals and volunteers who can meet that need.</p></speech>

If we look at mini-rugby or mini-GAA, it is about having a presence there.  We use some of the ambassadors and we will be using them a lot more, so there would be those like Kellie Harrington, if we can get our hands on her, and we would have them on social media, giving messages to children that it is okay to talk.  One of the programmes we introduced during Covid, thankfully, is one that addresses the transition from primary school to secondary school, which we know, from talking to children and from Childline data, is a particularly traumatic time.  It runs from ages 11 to 12, 12 or 13 and 13 to 14.  We have introduced a programme called Smart Moves and 50 schools have taken us up on that.  The Minister for Education is very keen on that so once we have done an academic term on that, we would be hopeful of engaging with all schools at that level.  We have identified in our strategic review that the 11 to 13 age range is a key intervention time to build resilience for children.</p></speech>

In my role as Chair of the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health, I am getting a lot of inquiries from family members of young girls in particular, for some reason, aged maybe 13, 14 or 15, who are self-harming and have suicidal ideation.  We can recommend therapists or CAMHS but the waiting lists are off the Richter scale, even for private therapists.</p><p>Will the witnesses advise whether I should refer any of those young girls to either of their organisations?  To give an example, one of them is only 14 years of age, has suicidal ideation and is self-harming.  Her family members are out of their minds with worry and do not know what is to be done.  Where should I go to seek help with her case?</p></speech>

I would say that, rather than focusing on a particular profession, we need CAMHS to address the situation of children who are at serious risk to themselves because they are engaging in self-harming behaviours.  If there is a Barnardos centre close to the family's location, I certainly would advise the Chairman to refer them to that centre to see whether we can offer a response.  Whether we can do so depends on the degree of self-harming.  We certainly can support the parents and talk to the young person.  However, if there is a serious level of self-harming, what is needed is the help of a psychiatrist.  The danger, ultimately, is that the young person may seriously harm herself.  We can offer certain things but not to the degree to which specialist psychiatric intervention may be needed.  Having said that, I am aware anecdotally from my own work that it is not unusual, as Mr. Church mentioned, for self-harming sometimes to be happening to a smaller degree.  It all depends on the intensity of it.</p></speech>

All attendees are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a manner as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  For witnesses, in particular those attending remotely from a place outside of the Leinster House campus, they should be aware there are some additional limitations to parliamentary privilege.  They would enjoy greater privilege were they able to participate in the meeting physically.  Obviously, that is not possible for a variety of reasons.  I ask them to be mindful that there may be some differentiation in the level of the immunity that they may enjoy in terms of parliamentary privilege as opposed to being in a position to be physically present.  Finally, I ask all participants to strictly adhere to the subject matter rather than straying into other areas.  We want to keep the discussion on topic. </p> <p>   The format of the meeting is that each organisation will be invited in the order in which I have introduced them to make an opening statement.  Each organisation will have three minutes to do this.  Once all the statements have been delivered, I will then go around the members and invite them to put questions to the witnesses.  We have a procedure whereby each member is allocated seven minutes for the first round, including both the questions and responses.  If time permits, we will facilitate a second round of questions.  We will see how we go.  Members may have other questions asked in the first round, or indeed, some other Members may join the meeting.  I know that there is at least one Member who does not normally attend the committee and has indicated his wish to join the meeting later on, namely, Deputy McNamara.  He is welcome to join the meeting, as is anyone else.  Non-members will contribute to the meeting after committee members have asked their questions.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Collins to make his opening statement to the committee.  He has three minutes.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.520" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bob Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021102000002#B00200"><p>The 2015 legislation that established the Policing Authority was intended to make a difference, and it did.  It created an independent, external oversight arrangement for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where none had ever existed before.  It created a greater structural distance between the Department and the organisation, and it created a distance between politics and policing.  It was the settled view of the Government and Oireachtas that this was necessary.  That was less than six years ago.</p> <p>  These heads of Bill, and the Commission on the Future of Policing report on which its approach is based, take a significant step back from that character of oversight. Repatriation to the Department and re-internalisation within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the potential to alter significantly the relationships between the Garda, the Department and the proposed new authority.  There is, and there will be seen to be, an inescapable drawing back from those changes that were deemed so necessary just six years ago.  Nowhere, in the commission report or in the heads of Bill, is there any significant or convincing argument why such a sharp shift is necessary or appropriate. There is much to welcome in the Bill.  The joining together of the authority and the Inspectorate has the potential to be greatly beneficial both to the oversight and inspection roles.  The authority also welcomes the changes made since the initial draft heads were first outlined last year.  However, there continue to be issues that are of considerable concern to the authority, for example, returning responsibility to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for determining the policing plan.  The authority&rsquo;s much reduced engagement will not be out of its own statutory capacity but at the invitation of the Commissioner.  That is a significant shift of policy and practice and weakens oversight.  What is its logic?</p> <p>  The same is true in respect of the Garda strategy.  The termination of the authority&rsquo;s role in appointments is a major change of direction.  Apparently based on a wholly unfounded sense that the new arrangements would give the Commissioner a greater role in appointments, this shift flies in the face of the Garda culture audit and the widely felt unhappiness at recruitment practice within the organisation.  This is a retrogressive move.</p> <p>  The weakening of the authority's role in the appointment of the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner follows the same pattern.  So does the return to the Commissioner, under some unspecified regulatory framework, of the recruitment of superintendents, a critically important role in the policing service.  Why these steps, in respect of appointments, are being taken is, to put it mildly, unclear.</p> <p>  The role of the new Garda board seems to suggest that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is no different from any other State body.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is precisely because the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is so wholly different in its role, duties and powers that a strong external oversight mechanism is necessary.  The value to the organisation of outside expertise is not in question.  However, what is virtually certain is the risk that the new structure will alter the nature of the current oversight, will cause confusion as to roles and responsibilities and have the potential to pose unnecessary difficulties for the Commissioner.</p> <p>  The authority worries that this Bill will convey the wrong messages about policing.</p><p>It will be seen as a backward step.  It has the potential to slow and inhibit, rather than support and encourage, the programme of change to which the authority is committed and to which it knows the Commissioner is also committed. </p><p> If anything shows the importance of strong, independent external oversight, it can be seen in the authority&rsquo;s handling of the homicide review and of the current issues with the cancellation and handling of 999 calls.  The strength of that capacity should not be put in doubt. </p></speech>

I will focus on three points, those of community safety, the functions of the new policing and community safety authority, PCSA, and the inspection function within that authority.</p> <p>  The Bill provides for a national strategy on community safety, which supports a previously made recommendation by the inspectorate.  For multi-agency co-operation to be effective, there must be strong enabling legislation, accompanied by a recognition by relevant agencies of their role, a strategic commitment to meeting their responsibilities and, where necessary, providing appropriate levels of resources. Without this in place, community safety will remain as the responsibility of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p> <p>  The community safety responsibilities of the PCSA are diluted from the role envisaged by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which recommended that the PCSA promote inter-agency working and scrutinise the role of all agencies as they affect community safety.  In addition, the PCSA will be limited to the functions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to the delivery of policing services.  The PCSA will not be responsible for oversight of the delivery of security services, as is currently the case for the inspectorate.  This will become the responsibility of the independent examiner who will also have oversight of the use of legal powers such as surveillance.  While such powers are used to investigate crimes against the State, they are also used to investigate other offences, including serious and organised crime.  It is important to ensure there are no gaps in oversight between the role of the independent examiner and the PCSA in this critical area. </p> <p>  The role of the Garda board to monitor implementation of organisational performance is similar to the objective of the PCSA.  To avoid any confusion regarding objectives and functions, the roles of and relationships between the Garda Commissioner, the Garda board and the PCSA need to be further clarified. </p> <p>  While the inspectorate welcomes the power to allow PCSA inspectors of policing services to carry out unannounced visits to Garda stations, it should be set out in legislation and not be reliant on a memorandum of understanding.  It is also important that provision is made in the legislation to ensure the PCSA is provided with all information and documents necessary to exercise its functions. </p> <p>  While provision is made for conducting joint inspections by prescribed bodies, the attachment of conditions on this taking place does not appear to be sufficiently strong enough to ensure that joint inspections will take place.  Enabling the PCSA to publish reports of self-initiated inspections and monitor the implementation of recommendations arising from inspections will close two current gaps in inspectorate powers.  The inspectorate believes inspection should be a core function of the new PCSA. </p></speech>

In this statement we will summarise our key concerns with the policing, security and community safety Bill, as outlined in more detail in our two written submissions.</p> <p>  The ICCL welcomes the provisions for reformed police oversight mechanisms, which we regard as being broadly in line with recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Robust oversight is crucial in order to ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is complying with its human rights obligations and is held accountable to the people it serves.  Provision for independent and effective investigations into complaints against police is a key human rights requirement on the State.</p> <p>  The ICCL recognises that a number of welcome reforms have taken place within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, strong and effective oversight of policing is central to the police reform process.  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland was clear that reform of Irish policing is impossible without significant strengthening of our police oversight structures, including the provision of additional resources.  The proposed establishment of a new policing and community safety authority, an independent examiner of security legislation, and a reformed Ombudsman are welcome. The increased references to human rights contained in the Bill compared with the 2005 Act are also encouraging. </p> <p>  We outlined eight recommendations in our first submission on how the Bill can be strengthened from a human rights perspective and today we will highlight four.  The first recommendations is the Bill should remove all prosecutorial powers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both victims and accused persons have the right for their case to be prosecuted by an impartial legal professional.  This was a key recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The second recommendation is the Bill should include a provision on the mandatory collection of disaggregated data on policing and use of police powers.  These data should be based on equality grounds, socio-economic status, geographic location and ethnicity.  Such data collection is required under international human rights law.  The third recommendation is that the Garda code of ethics should expressly include human rights standards.  A breach of the code should constitute a disciplinary offence.  The fourth recommendation is that while we welcome provisions for independent inspections of Garda stations, the ICCL calls on the Government to provide for wholly unannounced visits to Garda custody suites unconnected to a planned inspection.  Independent visits to Garda stations and other places where people are deprived of their liberty are a crucial safeguard against abuse and are a requirement under the optional protocol to the UN convention against torture, which the Irish Government has signed but must ratify and implement as a matter of urgency. </p> <p>  The ICCL urges the Government to ensure that the oversight bodies foreseen by this legislation are properly resourced and given sufficient powers to ensure that proper reform is delivered.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.527" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Drew Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021102000002#C00700"><p>Good evening Chairperson and committee members.  I thank you for this opportunity to give evidence to the committee.  Certainly after the publication of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na accepted its recommendations in full.  That remains the case.  This has been followed by organisational commitment in implementing those recommendations under the Government&rsquo;s A Policing Service for the Future reform programme.  This has seen a large number of initiatives introduced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to improve the policing service we deliver to the public and provide additional supports for our personnel.  For example, we have enhanced community policing as demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic.  More than 820 garda&iacute; have been redeployed from administrative roles to the front line   Divisional protective services units are in place in every division staffed by more than 300 specialist garda&iacute;.  A new Garda anti-corruption unit has been introduced to promote the highest levels of integrity and professionalism within the organisation.  We have had the establishment of a human rights unit and investment in human rights training across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An organisational redesign under the Garda operating model has continued throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>  For our people, we have introduced measures such as a more transparent promotion process, improved internal communications and additional health and well-being supports.  These significant advances would not have been possible without the support of our personnel.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fully supports accountability, oversight and the independent investigation of public complaints as a route to public confidence in policing.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na agrees with the commission&rsquo;s view that Garda oversight should be streamlined, should not lead to micromanagement of the Commissioner by those oversight bodies, and should not impinge on the operational independence of the Commissioner.  The commission also said that the Commissioner should be a true CEO in charge of all executive functions who would have the support of an internal board in carrying out those functions.  However, what is proposed under the current wording of the Bill will see the introduction of a wide range of oversight structures and bodies with overlapping remits that will see the Commissioner of the day spending disproportionate time reporting and accounting to those bodies rather than actually overseeing policing, security matters, and the leadership and direction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An example, under the proposed Bill, is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be accountable for inter-agency co-operation to the new policing and community safety authority, yet the other State agencies involved would be reporting to the new national community safety steering group, to which we will also report.  </p> <p>  The Bill, as proposed, will effectively outsource many of those levers of control in key areas such as the budget, discipline, standards and policing operations from the Commissioner to different oversight bodies - in effect, the micromanagement and erosion of operational independence that the Commission strongly warned against.   It also gives the replacement for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, more legal powers to conduct investigations into Garda personnel, including Garda staff, which garda&iacute; investigating crime currently enjoy.</p><p>Investigations by the new GSOC could run on for long periods without any obligation for them to inform the Garda or employer about the nature of what they are being investigated for and whether it is criminal, misconduct or civil.  This would appear to be in breach of an individual's human rights as well as being incredibly stressful for them.  Furthermore, I as Garda Commissioner and  the employer may not be made immediately aware of investigations related to serious matters.  My management team and I have met with the Minister for Justice and senior Department officials to discuss our concerns, as detailed in our 75-page submission to the committee, and those discussions have been productive.</p><p> To conclude, the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing were necessary, timely, and have already benefited the people of this country in terms of the policing service provided.  What we are asking is that the proposed Bill more accurately reflects the commission&rsquo;s recommendations so An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can continue to operate ethically, efficiently, and effectively to keep the people safe.</p></speech>

I only have a short time so I will get straight into the questions.  It would be great if the answers were straight to the point, where possible, just so I can get through them.</p> <p>  The first question is for the Mr. Harris.  It relates to head 30.  Has the Commissioner any concerns about head 30 and how the written directives from the Minister could affect a Commissioner's operational or independent control?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.531" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Drew Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021102000002#D00400"><p>I would set that in the context of the many other means by which direction and control of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could, in effect, be impinged upon.  We have the policing priorities, the security priorities determined by the Minister, the approval of the strategic plan, the annual plan and then the other plans that flow on from that.  Furthermore, I am accountable to the Garda board for my performance and then also accountable to the new authority for the performance of the organisation.  In respect of head 30, this is issuing a directive to the Commissioner with the consent of Government but that must be a lawful directive and one that obviously meets our obligations on human rights compliance.  If that was not the case, obviously I would make comment in that respect.  There just seems to be an awful lot of influence being brought to bear.  One of the concerns is the amount of influence being brought to bear in terms of three-year, one-year and then more extraordinary matters in terms of my direction and control of the organisation.</p></speech>

He spoke a little about the accountability structures and who he is accountable to.  Has he any concerns about the confusion within those accountability structures in some parts of the Bill and how that might affect his work?  I am thinking of heads 11, 23 and 28, which all state the Commissioner is not accountable to the board whereas head 25 states he or she is.  Does Mr. Harris have any concerns about who he is accountable to?</p></speech>

The board, in effect, assesses my performance so that makes me subservient to that board because it is assessing my performance on an annual basis.  I also have a responsibility to the authority in terms of the performance of the organisation and then I have responsibilities to the Minister as well.  Thus in effect I have a number of different bosses.  I am also reporting in to the national community safety steering group.  I have concerns, which are reflected in our submission, over how we deconflict this and the amount of time I am going to spend dealing with accountability bodies.  That is dysfunctional in terms of leading an organisation of this scale and complexity and the complexity of the demand we are dealing with as well.</p></speech>

I also have a question for the Policing Authority.  Do its members believe there is the need for the creation of an internal board, as provided for in this Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.535" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bob Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021102000002#D00800"><p>The authority does not favour the board as it is represented in the Bill.  As I said, the authority sees real value to the Commissioner and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in having external expertise.  That is the kind of arrangement envisaged in 2005 Act but was never acted upon.  That was 16 years ago.  The Commissioner has made some reference to it but from the authority's perspective the risk is there will be a confusion of interlocking engagements.  If the Commissioner has uncertainty as to whom he is accountable, there will also be uncertainty as to who ultimately is responsible for some of the elements.  There is a difference between accountability and giving account.  There is a risk the internal board, the Garda board, will have an oversight role that either duplicates or gets in the way of the oversight role of the proposed new PCSA.  As I said, there is value in having external expertise available to the Commissioner across a range of areas.  The authority has identified a number of those areas which are significant for the life of the organisation and which are essential to its effective performance and are not just back-office or administrative issues.  They are crucially, critically, central to the quality of the policing service.  That value is unquestioned.  It is about the interposition of that board and the potential dilution of the clarity of the oversight.</p> <p>  My final comment on this is the authority from its inception has made it absolutely clear it does not want An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to create material simply for our existence.  It is giving the authority access to material that is already there.  There has never been a suggestion that the authority wanted to be part of the executive management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, let alone micromanage it.  That is not our role.  I do not think anybody could point to any instance in which that has happened.  The board has a real value but there are real risks in the way it is constituted in the heads.</p></speech>

I have a question for the ICCL.  It relates to the provisions on prosecution by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland's recommended that the Garda should not have a role in prosecution.  What does the ICCL feel are the implications of this?</p></speech>

Part of the right to a fair trial is to be represented by a legal expert.  We are concerned that even though this was a very clear recommendation by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, we now have the old system replicated in this legislation, whereas the Bill provides the opportunity to move forward in line with the commission's recommendations.  Clearly, there are resource implications and to provide for sufficient numbers of prosecutors in the country, resources will need to be allocated to the DPP and the hiring of new prosecutors to replace the functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at present.  It is in line with that general recommendation by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland to remove non-policing functions from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We think this is a missed opportunity to emphasise and ensure the right of people to have a legal expert representing them is fulfilled.</p></speech>

I wish to address a couple of comments Mr. Collins made in his statement.</p><p>Mr. Collins seems to make the point that there is a concern that this is moving away from reforms that were clearly necessary and appropriate in the past.  He indicates a sense that some of the matters that were very concerning for many people regarding how the Garda was run and managed in the past had been dealt with to some extent through the establishment of external bodies and oversight but that some of that has now been pulled back.  I would like a little more detail and to tease out exactly where the witness feels that is happening.  Does he feel when the board is established it will be much less independent than it would have been in the past?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.541" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bob Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021102000002#E00200"><p>I made a point about the existence of the board.  That is not the only issue that concerns the authority and where it saw a shifting back from the position established just over six years ago.  A range of responsibilities returned to the Minister.  We were very pleased to see the setting of the priorities that was going to be with the Minister in the initial draft heads is now going to be with the new authority, as it is with the current authority.  It is a very positive development and we welcomed it.  The setting of those priorities is done in close consultation with the Garda Commissioner, as the law requires, and it always has been.  There has not been an instance, either in the setting of priorities or the approval of the policing plan, where there has been a significant difference between the authority and the Garda Commissioner.</p> <p>  The return to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na family, as it were, which includes the new board and which will adopt the services plan or the policing plan, as it is called, is a step backwards.  The authority has always been strongly of the view that the policing plan must be the Garda Commissioner's plan and he or she must own it.  The entire organisation must own it.  The fact that the authority approves it currently is a really significant element because the authority brings to that process all its engagements across the community, including outreach.  There is very significant evidence, for example, during the past 18 or 20 months of the Covid-19 pandemic and the 15 reports that the authority has submitted to the Minister on the policing of that.  There have been very positive responses from the public to the authority on the quality of that policing service.  That element runs the risk of being absent from the shaping of the new services plan.</p> <p>  As I am on the topic of the services plan, there is a provision in it that merits further serious consideration.  It relates to the final subhead in the part, which indicates the services plan must align with the policy of the Government or of any Minister of the Government and his or her views on policing.  It is difficult to understand that and it has the potential to be problematic for the independence of any Garda Commissioner in setting the policing plan.</p> <p>  To get back to the point, it is proposed the board will adopt that plan but it is not clear what exactly is the difference between "adopt", "approve", "accept" or whatever it may be.  The appointments are a critical matter.  Moving the appointments from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the independent oversight body was not an invasion of the executive management space of the Garda Commissioner because the Garda Commissioner had the capacity, either personally or through a representative, to be involved with every selection process that was undertaken.  The current Garda Commissioner has been involved with the selection of deputy and assistant commissioners, as well as chief superintendents.  That is really positive.</p> <p>  The critical point is that there was a serious reservation within the organisation about the appropriateness of recruitment policies and the independence of recruitment practices.  That was reflected very significantly in the culture.  The response to the authority over the past four or five years in which it has had this responsibility is welcome for the fact this external body was engaged.  There is a virtue in having the authority as opposed to the Public Appointments Service involved.  My comments are not in the slightest sense to cast any aspersions or doubts on the professionalism of that important agency.  The authority, by virtue of its various responsibilities, has access to understanding the information because of its statutory entitlements and powers that would not be readily available to any other agency involved with the appointments process.  That really shifts the balance towards the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an entity.</p> <p>  This is not about any individual Garda Commissioner or officer, and I have no doubt the people in question know that.  This is about the structural relationships between the policing service as an entity and whatever oversight body exists.  We all know there will be an oversight body.  The Garda Commissioner knows this from his previous experience in another jurisdiction of an oversight body with a far more significant capacity that this authority.  The virtue and value of that has been appreciated by the chief constables of the Policing Service of Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

I do not want people to take away from our comments that we do not see this proposed Bill as being very significant and positive in very many respects for the community as a whole.  We might come to that element later.</p> <p>  There are a number of specific matters where problems can be pretty readily addressed, even within the framework the Government appears to want to have in the overall architecture.  Minor adjustments would make significant real, psychological and perceptual differences.  We worry that people will think that this would be seen as moving back from a position that was seen as so very necessary less than six years ago, as I mentioned.</p></speech>

There is a contradictory mess across some of those heads.</p> <p>  I ask Garda Commissioner Harris about prosecution powers.  As somebody whose sergeants and inspectors are front-line management, essentially, spending days in courtrooms managing cases, does he share the views on prosecution powers and the appropriateness of the use of those front-line managers in court?</p></speech>

For the information of everybody, there is a high-level group sitting to address this very matter and deal with the recommendation as set out in the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland report.  That group was established by the Department of Justice, with an independent chair, comprising a cross-section of stakeholders.  There is a considerable amount of work being done with international research and stakeholder engagement.  That work is very much continuing and seeks to address the very recommendation spoken of by the Deputy.</p><p>At the moment we are working our way through it and we will await the outcome of the working group findings.</p></speech>

When we discuss accountability and oversight, one of aspects I am conscious of is something that I am not sure has been taken into account in drafting this Bill.  Some years ago the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform defined accountability in public service as: "The formal obligation to submit to a mechanism designed to achieve external scrutiny in explaining and justifying past conduct or actions with the possibility of consequences arising."  I am interested to hear the Policing Authority's views on that definition, how this proposed Bill matches up to that and how the authority's current work matches up to that definition of external scrutiny explaining and justifying past conduct or actions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.549" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bob Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021102000002#F00300"><p>I made reference in the opening remarks to the homicide review that was undertaken a number of years ago, and to the current work being undertaken in considering the developments with regard to 999 calls, the unwarranted cancellation of some of those, and the way in which they are handled generally.  In some respects that is accounting for past actions, even though they are very recent past actions.  That is a critically important part of the work of a body such as the Policing Authority.  To be perfectly honest, and without disrespect to anybody, I do not believe that in the absence of an external body such as the Policing Authority, that depth of information would ever have become available, or it certainly would not have become available within the timescale that it did, and in the way it has.</p> <p>  The question around the person or the body to whom the Commissioner is individually accountable for his or her actions, could be debated at some considerable length.  It is not the most significant issue, in my book, but it is not without significance.  What is really critical is the continuing possibility of the Commissioner and his or her colleagues having to give public account.  That is in the new Bill, and that will be true for the Policing and Community Safety Authority, PCSA, as it is for the current Policing Authority.  I do not want, in the slightest sense, to diminish the continuity element in these draft heads of the Bill.  This will continue to be a significant part of the public giving of account in relation to the activities of the organisation.  One could spend a lot of time debating precise definitions and I would prefer to root them in individual examples rather than in informal definitions.</p></speech>

Some of those elements are there at the moment and some could be stronger.  Some of those I believe run the risk of being somewhat weakened in the new arrangements. Because of the establishment of a Garda board, the Commissioner is undoubtedly going to have to engage with the board and answer its questions and indeed engage with its issues.  It seems unreasonable that a commissioner would do it twice.  There is a risk therefore that this would diminish the extent to which those engagements would be properly and fully held with the Policing Authority.  There is a risk that Garda board, with its fiduciary responsibilities to the organisation, will want to protect jealously its own area of statutory responsibility, and there may be an emerging reluctance to engage with the kind of increasing openness that has been evident from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with some notable exceptions, over the past five to six years.</p></speech>

In some critical respects, however, I believe that it would be stronger and more effective.  I have identified for example its involvement in the development of the services plan.  This is the Commissioner's plan but at the moment it approves that plan in such a way that it can introduce into that conversation its experience of the public accountability and its experience of the engagement it has with the community, its outreach, and its engagement right across the State throughout the year.  That lived experience of policing is an important element to be introduced into the shaping of the plan. There is a real risk that this will be significantly diminished under the new arrangements.  I am not sure if that was the intention of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  It would be odd if it were.  A view seems to have been developed by the commission that in some way the existence of the Policing Authority impinged upon the managerial and executive independence of the Commissioner.  It was not so and cannot be so.  Nothing can be pointed to indicating that it could ever be so.  Therein I see a risk.</p></speech>

It would appear to someone looking in on this that there seems to be quite a wide range of bodies tasked with overseeing the activity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the Garda Commissioner, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, the Policing Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  I wonder what the is potential to amalgamate some of these organisations.</p> <p>  The starting point of everybody here is robust oversight and accountability.  That is key.  There seems to be a disparity between all contributors.  Everyone wants to reach that destination but there appears to be wide-ranging opinions as to how we get there.  What is the Garda Commissioner's opinion on this?  What is the opinion of representative from the Policing Authority and others who want to comment on the potential to amalgamate some of the existing bodies, and what effect would this have on the organisations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.555" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Drew Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021102000002#F00900"><p>I will take that question first.  There is an issue that head 11 and head 104 are replications of each other.  Head 11 says that the Garda board is said to be responsible for monitoring organisational performance, while head 104 says that the Policing Authority keeps under review the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na functions.  As the chair of the Policing Authority has already suggested, there is a role for a Garda board as a support in terms of internal management governance and expertise to me as the Commissioner and to the senior team in dealing with a very complex organisation.  We have an effective dual employment model with regard to Garda staff and Garda members.  We are the sole policing service for Ireland, and we have a wide range of responsibilities including, almost uniquely, national security responsibilities.  The board would be a valuable addition for our management and organisational effectiveness.  The difficulty is, however, and I believe that the chairman and I are not very divergent in our views here, that when the new authority is assessing the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's functions, is the board assessing my performance or that of the board and the decisions it has made?  Within this, it starts to actually dilute.  If the responsibility does not lie with me then authority seeps away from me in terms of the changes and driving the formal and operational agendas within the organisation.</p><p>Obviously, we too understand that public confidence is wrapped up in our accountability mechanism.  We are supportive of an accountability mechanism.  We are supportive of the public accountability mechanism and we recognise that we are very different from every other public body in the State in having a very regular public accountability exercise with both the authority and Oireachtas committees.  However, I think there is confusion as to who is looking after what here between the board and the authority, and that could be clarified.  As the chair of the authority said, I am not sure that that would be that difficult within even the heads as they are written.</p></speech>

We are at opposite ends of the same Christmas cracker; the question is who will get the hat.  I think some of those issues can be relatively easily resolved within the architecture.  There were two other elements in respect of which the authority felt there was perhaps an imbalance in the way the focus was on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We may come to community safety.  It is a critical part of the Bill and tends to be but should not be overlooked.  This makes very clear arrangements for the way in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be held to account in respect of its engagement with community safety.  As everybody recognises, however, this is a shared responsibility, and it is not altogether clear - perhaps it will be reflected in other legislation - that a similarly focused arrangement will emerge whereby the other relevant public institutions will have the same level of scrutiny or be held to account to the same extent as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is.</p> <p>  The second concern we had - again, lest we not come to it otherwise - is that, while we do not have a huge amount to say about the arrangements for the proposed office of the Garda ombudsman, there is a genuine concern that the issue of incidents of concern and the need to report virtually all of them to the proposed office of the Garda ombudsman may diminish the emerging acceptance of the notion of performance management within the organisation which, undoubtedly, the Commissioner and his senior colleagues wish to see become the norm and widespread.  If everything about which the Commissioner has a concern has to be referred externally, it may give the impression that there is little that can be done internally.  That will not be the case, but perceptions can be very powerful in this respect.  As for the existence of a board, a board could be tremendously powerful and useful to the Commissioner in respect of a whole range of things but I think they could be dealt with relatively simply in order that there is greater clarity for everybody concerned.</p></speech>

One of the ICCL's recommendations is to remove all prosecutorial powers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Does that include the decision whether or not to prosecute and consideration of the evidence in a case?  Does the ICCL mean all the way down to the District Court, that is, that all District Court offences would be prosecuted by, say, somebody from a local State Solicitor's office?</p></speech>

I have heard what he said.  I think it was Mr. Collins who referred to the Commissioner's experience in another jurisdiction, namely, the North.  What can we learn from policing oversight in the Six Counties?  Did Commissioner Harris notice a difference in the culture or in prosecuting?  Does he think the ICCL's suggestion to remove all prosecutorial powers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might be a good idea to free up garda&iacute; for policing work?</p></speech>

I attended some 97 public meetings with the policing board so I am well versed in and well used to both a policing board and an ombudsman and how they work and how sensitive they are to public confidence.  I have learnt that there is always a degree of tension between the executive of a policing organisation and its oversight body, and that is a good thing.  Steel sharpens steel.  We need to have vigorous and rigorous debate about our policing functions, making sure, therefore, that we are doing that which promotes public confidence and that which is seen to be legitimate in the eyes of the public.  All of that is what we seek to achieve by our engagement with the authority.  The authority, as its chair said, is on the other side of that continuum and conversation with us.</p> <p>  I have mixed opinions on the prosecution of offences in the District Court.  I understand entirely the principle that has been set out.  It is probably more achievable in our bigger towns and cities.  At the same time there is something which maintains our skills, including our investigative skills and the quality of our local investigative work.  When people know they have to go along and either they or their immediate supervisor will present the cases they prepare, there is a real connection between the quality of the work and they then see the immediate impact of that in a court appearance.  That is also a good grounding for moving on into more serious crime investigation and being very familiar with court processes.  There is, therefore, a downside and a skills fade when a policing organisation no longer takes on those prosecutions.  I understand the point the commission made and I know that work is being done but, at the same time, a huge resource would be required to conduct that function right across Ireland.</p></speech>

Commissioner Harris mentioned in his opening statement investigations by GSOC going on for years without any obligation to inform Garda employees.  It is kind of similar to some of the debate that has come from the mid-west area recently in that investigations are going along for a long time.  Given some of the recent controversy, does Commissioner Harris think there has been a difference in the culture and in discretion between the North and the South?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.568" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Drew Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021102000002#G01300"><p>I cannot go anywhere near matters from the mid-west because those matters are before the courts and it would be entirely inappropriate for me to comment further on them.  Stepping back, however, the general point about discretion is that it is an element which is taught to our trainee garda&iacute;.  We have issued instruction on the proper exercise of discretion.  Discretion is appropriate whenever garda&iacute; are dealing with members of the public.  There are various stages in respect of that discretion such as dealing with individuals through a juvenile liaison scheme or via a fixed charge penalty notice if appropriate.  There are a variety of disposals for garda&iacute; to action at the side of the road.  It may be just a simple word of advice and a warning.  All of that is appropriate in the circumstances in which garda&iacute; find themselves.</p><p>I will repeat the comments I made on Monday.  Discretion is entirely different from exercising preference and preference has no part in providing a policing service.  Preference is wrong if individuals are treated differently.  That should not be the case.</p></speech>

On the replacement for GSOC and giving it more powers to conduct investigations into Garda personnel, the Garda Commissioner expressed concerns about possible breaches of human rights that could be disproportionate, unconstitutional and unable to withstand a test in the courts.  What is the inspectorate's view on that?</p></speech>

Our comment is around reception of complaints and that a member of Garda staff would be able to receive complaints.  We do not comment on the wider issue of where the Garda staff are employed and by whom.  Our comment was to the effect that a member of Garda staff would be in a position to receive a complaint from a member of the public at the front counter of a station so that a police officer would not have to come back in and deal with that issue.</p> <p>  Along with the ICCL, we are responsible for making a recommendation about moving the prosecutorial function from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We made that recommendation in 2015.  It was very much about separating investigation from prosecution and freeing up Garda members who are fulfilling a role in courts.  Most other jurisdictions have moved away from police officers prosecuting as well as investigating offences.</p></speech>

Can that be dealt with in this legislation and, if so, how?  That is important.  Years ago, we had no oversight but we are now going to have so much oversight that there will be confusion about who is responsible for what, the effect of which is that there may be no oversight at all in the future.  Can the legislation be amended to counter that possibility?</p> <p>  In its submission, the ICCL recommends including a reference to the human rights standards expected of Garda members and staff and their practical application as part of the code of ethics, and ensuring the code of ethics can be enforced by making a breach a disciplinary offence.  Can that be done as part of this legislation?  History has taught us it should be done.  That is vitally important.  There have been problems in recent times with the lack of reporting of human rights issues within the Garda because it is not required.  Can those changes be included in this legislation?  Where would they fit in?</p></speech>

We recommended that when we made our submission to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and we also have made submissions on this legislation.  It is about making human rights standards real and tangible and having the possibility of identifying a human rights breach that may not reach the threshold of criminality but has an effect on an individual nonetheless.  It is not just about identifying such a breach; there must be some kind of accountability and repercussions for it.  That is where our view comes from in terms of including human rights in the code of ethics and making a breach of the code of ethics a disciplinary matter.</p></speech>

There is obviously a degree of confusion about who is answerable to which body.  There is also confusion around the board and the new authority.  There is potential overlap there.  From our perspective, we are not entirely opposed to the creation of a board but is functions should be limited to supporting internal management.  The excellent oversight that has been provided by the Policing Authority in recent years must continue.  That means it must have sufficient powers to engage with the Garda Commissioner and there must be sufficient transparency in the policies and procedures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  We have not spoken much about the new Garda ombudsman today but we view it as positive that its powers are being expanded.  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland identified a lack of resourcing and staffing as hampering the work of the ombudsman, along with the problem of its insufficient powers.  Increased powers for a new ombudsman are something we welcome.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the types of complaints being referred to the new ombudsman.  We think there should be an expansion of complaints that can go to the ombudsman, particularly in respect of human rights violations, but also violations that do not reach the threshold set down in the 2005 Act.  They should then be investigated by the ombudsman.  We believe it is vitally important that the new ombudsman is given greater powers and resources, considering the need has been identified not only by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland but also by international bodies.  The UN Committee against Torture, in its most recent report to Ireland, recommended a strengthening of the powers of the Garda ombudsman.  We foresee distinct roles for the new authority body, the ombudsman and, potentially, a board.  We definitely think it can be worked out.  Of course, this is a good opportunity for people to express their views and come up with solutions.</p></speech>

That provision very closely mirrors the existing Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, section 41 of which provides for pretty much the same thing, including any other matters that, in the Commissioner's opinion, should be brought to the Minister's attention.</p><p>In the past, that has given rise to some political controversy.  The Chair may recall that when the former Deputy, Alan Shatter, was Minister for Justice and Equality, he received information from Commissioner Callinan about Mick Wallace and a road traffic offence at the Five Lamps in Dublin, which was deemed to be pretty close to political policing.  The specific question that I have relates to an incident in August 2020, when the then EU Commissioner, Phil Hogan, was cautioned for using a mobile phone while driving at the time that he was having a bit of a dispute with the Government.  He was not caught with a bag of Kalashnikovs in the boot.  There was no great threat to State security or anything like that.  He was caught with a mobile phone in his hand.  We were subsequently told that the Commissioner brought this to the attention of the Minister for justice.  She brought it to Cabinet and the Cabinet duly used it to get rid of a Commissioner that they were under political pressure to get rid of to save their own hides.  Of course, every offence is potentially serious.  Receiving a caution for using a mobile phone while driving is not the most serious criminal offence and certainly is not the most serious road traffic offence.  On what basis did the Commission form the opinion that this information should be brought to the attention of the Minister for justice?</p></speech>

One of the principles of the section 41 reports to the Minister is that only the Minister can make a decision in terms of the publication of such a report.  That is contained in the current legislation and, in effect, explicitly prevents me from talking about or going into any detail on such reports.  That question is beyond my remit, in these circumstances, to answer.</p></speech>

I am lost as to where it states that the Commissioner cannot answer a question asked at a meeting of a D&aacute;il committee on the submission of reports in that regard.  If the Commissioner cannot point to a particular-----</p></speech>

I think the Commissioner could possibly answer the question in an abstract fashion, if not in a specific fashion.  Indeed, any specific incident would be outside the remit of the deliberations today, but perhaps the question could be resubmitted in a more abstract way.</p></speech>

However, I do not think that is what the Commissioner was referring to.  In any event, does the Commissioner have concerns that this ability to provide information could lead him into very murky water in that there is a very thin line between providing information that could be relevant and engaging in political policing?  Of course, the rule of law is a big issue at the moment.  We, in Ireland, are very critical of Poland for breaches of the rule of law and we are very careful to safeguard the rule of law here.  We like to lecture other states about political policing.  Does the Commissioner think that more detail in the legislation on what should be brought to the Minster's attention might be beneficial ?  Obviously, matters pertaining to the preservation of peace and public order, the protection of life and property and the protection of the security of the State should be brought to the Minister's attention.  I am not saying the Commissioner did, or would do, so, but this omnibus thing would enable future commissioners to basically provide sensitive, private information about somebody that a member of the Government is in a political dispute with.  It is more Zimbabwe than Phoenix Park, but we can never take anything for granted.</p></speech>

In the abstract, this power is used in conjunction with our responsibilities under section 7 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and is connected to our policing functions.  Anything which is provided to the Minister is in respect of our policing and security functions and not, in any form, gossip, tittle-tattle or anything used remotely to gain a political advantage.  I can give the Deputy a full assurance in respect of that.  It is tied closely to our policing function.</p></speech>

So far, two members have indicated that they wish to come in a second time.  First is Senator Ruane, followed by Senator Gallagher.  If other members wish to contribute again, they are welcome to do so.  I will take them in the order in which they indicate they wish to contribute.  This round is shorter.

Obviously, referrals are made in respect of, for example, human rights and disciplinary matters.  We are separating those things in relation to when we decide who investigates what.  So, when it comes to an issue of a more disciplinary nature, it would not make sense for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate itself.  What is actually meant by "performance"?  Are we just talking about performance in the sense of people's personal performance in their job, not in how they carry out that job in terms of the public aspect of the job, but in relation to issues such as turning up late or not having a good attitude?  I am not sure what is meant by "performance".  Is discussion of "performance" different to when we talk about an issue of a disciplinary nature or one that is grounded in equality?  Perhaps the representatives from the ICCL and Chief Inspector Toland could respond to that.</p></speech>

Certainly, it is the latter that should be investigated by the ombudsman.  We consider it very important to ensure that what is covered by the ombudsman includes any allegations of ill treatment, for example, of an individual, where it reaches a threshold of not just serious harm which, essentially, is what the 2005 Act mandates an investigation into currently, but even an excessive use of force which may not end up causing serious harm, because it is still a disproportionate use of force.  For us, it should very much be rooted in everything from what one might call the lower threshold of human rights violation to serious criminality.  When one is talking about performance issues regarding turning up on time, that is not something that we think should be in the remit of an ombudsman.  I would be interested to hear from others on the point.</p></speech>

While he is commenting on that point, he might also address the issue of there appearing to be some resistance to the word "Garda" being in the title of the proposed new Garda ombudsman.  Are there implications for some communities if the word &ldquo;Garda&rdquo; is contained in the title?  If so, should we be calling this body something else so that we can encourage and empower people to engage with it?</p></speech>

I can say that we recently wrote and published a report about trying to prevent internal corruption in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  One of the things we were pleased to see in that context was a clarification concerning what is &ldquo;serious harm&rdquo;.  Those are the types of cases that the Commissioner refers on now.  One of our recommendations was that sexual offences and abuse of power for sexual gain offences are the sorts of notifications that the Commissioner should make.  I cannot comment on the performance issue because that is not within my remit and GSOC will have its own view in that regard.  I am sure the Commissioner will also have a view regarding performance issues and how difficult enforcement might be in that context.</p></speech>

It is an elongated disciplinary process.  We could do better with far faster engagement with individuals regarding their performance.  That could include the aspects mentioned already, but it could also include matters such as poor investigation, the late submission of files or, indeed, being rude or discourteous to a member of the public.  Some of those would be public complaints and we would have to work through with the ombudsman how that office would refer such complaints to us in respect of performance issues being involved.  We must ensure, however, that the ombudsman is dealing with the serious cases and not with matters which can be more relevantly engaged with by local management and dealt with quickly at that level.  That would then leave the ombudsman clear to deal with crime and serious matters.  </p> <p>  We would always say that we regard an infringement of someone&rsquo;s individual human rights as a serious matter.  We take human rights incredibly seriously.  We have built it into our Garda decision-making model and that is a feature of training throughout the organisation.  We have made huge efforts and deployed a great deal of resources into developing a culture of human rights.  Therefore, I do not think there is much pushback from us on this issue.  In fact, we are supportive of it.  At the same time, however, I want to have a performance management system which has some teeth and that allows us, in cases where constant poor performance is demonstrated, to exit those individuals from the organisation because they are incapable of fulfilling their roles.  I hope that provides some clarity in respect of poor performance being dealt with as a management function by managers and supervisors within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as opposed to instances of more serious misconduct and criminal matters.</p></speech>

I do not agree at all that all performance issues should go to the ombudsman in any shape or form.  I want to ensure, though, that anything considered serious will not end up somehow falling under the umbrella of performance.  I just wish to ensure that there are clear definitions of what each of those things are.</p> <p>  I do not know if I have time for one more question.</p></speech>

The term "flagrant breach of [...] human rights", was used.  He also referred to there being no "mechanism for Garda personnel to complain to an independent oversight body", that investigations by the proposed new GSOC would take a long time, "be incredibly stressful" and a lack of communication between the new GSOC and the garda being investigated in that context.  It was stated as well that there would be powers to search premises and offices.  I wonder what the representative from the ICCL would make of those points.</p></speech>

The ICCL fully supports procedural fairness.  If there are issues concerning procedural fairness, then they should certainly be examined.  Our view is that this proposed legislation contains several protections.  The new ombudsman will be accountable to the Oireachtas and, potentially, to the High Court.  We do not, therefore, consider this to be an unaccountable accountability body.  This proposed legislation has accountability built into it.</p> <p>  We also view the proposed legislation as imposing a requirement on the new ombudsman's office to ensure that it executes its functions with fairness in respect of complainants and those being investigated.  Our view, therefore, is that safeguards exist in this proposed legislation.  If there are serious concerns in this regard, however, and if there are ways in which we can strengthen procedural fairness for everyone subject to investigation, then that is absolutely something which should be examined.</p></speech>

He said that "it should be set out in legislation".  He also said that it was important to ensure that all required information and documents be provided in that context and that the conditions do "not appear to be sufficiently strong" in respect of the undertaking of joint investigations.  What would he suggest should be in the proposed legislation and how could it be strengthened in respect of the conditions he would envisage for joint inspections?</p></speech>

Therefore, we welcome the enhancement of those powers.  It will be part of the responsibility of the proposed PCSA.  We feel, however, that this aspect should be legislated for.  The heads of this proposed Bill refer to a memorandum of understanding, MOU.  We see that as something that would then have to be negotiated and agreed, as per the proposed legislation.  What would happen, though, if no agreement could be reached in that regard?</p> <p>  We are happy with the powers it is proposed to provide, but we feel this situation should be more formalised.  Those are the points we were trying to make.  I refer to the legislation being strengthened, rather than just having an MOU governing this aspect.  I refer in particular to trying to agree that MOU.  We felt there was a gap in that regard.  I think the legislation relevant to us refers to a requirement to provide documents but not information.  Head 177 of this proposed Bill is clearer about what will be provided to the new ombudsman's office and we feel that provision should be replicated for the proposed PCSA and the inspection function.  It is made explicit in that context that documents and information must be provided.  I hope that clarifies this issue for the Deputy.</p></speech>

That was because the Policing Authority's sense of the head of the proposed legislation as written is that it does not get in the way of unannounced visits.  If we are wrong in that interpretation, we would certainly want to voice our support for the notion of nothing being in the way of such unannounced visits.  There is no timescale involved in respect of advanced notice being given to the Commissioner.  It would be possible, for example, to tell the Commissioner on a Tuesday that we were proposing to undertake an inspection of X or Y and then to be in those premises unannounced that evening.  If it is felt, however, that greater clarity in that regard is required in the Bill as it emerges, then the Policing Authority will certainly support it, because the capacity to undertake unannounced visits is an important part of the inspection function.</p></speech>

I thank the Commissioner because we have just finished an inspection and we looked at custody.  For the first time, the Commissioner allowed us to do unannounced visits, to have access to people in detention and to talk to Garda members and people who had been brought to the Garda station.</p><p>We felt the legislation would be strong but we are grateful the Commissioner worked with us on a recent inspection to allow us to visit people in a Garda station.</p></speech>

I conduct unannounced visits all the time.  What I find is people properly doing their duties.  I am glad for an inspector to have the same experience as I and my immediate colleagues have had.  It is part of public confidence.  If it gives members of the public confidence in what is going on in a Garda station, that things are well run, all incidents properly dealt with and all is regular, that is a plus for us.  We have no objections to what is proposed in respect of unannounced visits.</p></speech>

How much input will the new board have in respect of that?  It seems from my reading of it that a lot of it is the Commissioner's job to produce the plan.  Heads 53 and 54 state the Minister can direct the Commissioner to amend the plan.  Where is the role for oversight bodies in respect of that?  Perhaps the Commissioner has a view on that.</p></speech>

It is different from the present process, which the chair of the Policing Authority has outlined, by which we work in tandem in respect of the annual plan and are working through the strategic plan as we speak.  It is a different process.  We would be informed by our engagements with the authority, the Minister and the board.  Much of the weight in terms of the timescales involved falls on the organisation and on me to deliver.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.612" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021102000002#L00500"><p>It strikes me that there is an absence of the oversight we would like to see the authority having, particularly the part that says the Minister can direct the Commissioner in regard to amending the plan.  That would raise eyebrows and is a departure from what we expected to see in legislation like this, which is about modernising and moving to a different type of policing from what we had in the past.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.613" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bob Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021102000002#L00600"><p>As I said, the authority would clearly prefer the existing arrangement to continue in relation to the service plan.  That does not diminish in the slightest the engagement the Commissioner would have or, as the authority has always insisted, the ownership the Commissioner would have.  As currently drafted, the proposed legislation provides that the Commissioner invites the policing and community safety authority, PCSA, to express its views on what the service plan should contain.  The risk in that is that it makes it appear that the new authority is an agent of the Commissioner in that respect and can act only on foot of receiving the request from the Commissioner.  That inverts or certainly distorts the relationship of distance and detachment that should exist between the Commissioner and the relevant oversight body.</p> <p>  If the Government persists with this notion and the Oireachtas enacts the provision as it is at the moment, that is to say, that it is not the new authority that develops the policing plan or service plan, then at the very least, it should be provided that the authority's initial intervention in the process is done out of its own statutory capacity, rather than at the invitation of the Commissioner.  That is not just a semantic point, less still is it umbrage or sitting on a high horse.  It is a meaningfully different arrangement if the authority does it from its own statutory power, as opposed to possibly being perceived as acting as an agent of the Commissioner and only on the Commissioner's request, even if that request is statutorily mandated.  That is not an unimportant issue and the same applies to the strategic plan.  In any event, the notion that policy priorities or a policing plan would be developed without engagement with the Commissioner is a nonsense.  The current statute requires that engagement.  It is a clearer statement of the independence and externality of the oversight if it is done in such a way.</p></speech>

I wish to record our appreciation for the opportunity to sit in on this interesting debate.  We look forward to the committee's report.  It continues a process of debate and consultation we have had with everybody on this call which has been productive and will continue as we continue to draft the Bill.</p> <p>  A wide range of issues were raised, some of quite a technical nature.  We have a list of them here.  If it would assist the committee, we would be happy to send a short note, which we will copy to the other participants, picking up on a few of the less technical points about particular sections, such as what accountability means or the point just made about the role of the different bodies in the strategic plan.  That might be of assistance, notwithstanding that we accept there are important policy issues the committee has to consider in its own right.  We would be happy to do that shortly.</p></speech>

In terms of procedure, perhaps he will send those submissions or thoughts to the committee.  We can include them in our deliberations and they can feed into the report.  That is probably the way to do it.  That would be useful to the deliberations.  The committee will produce the report and submit it to the Department and others in the usual way.</p> <p>  I thank everybody for their engagement.  I thank our witnesses, in particular, for their written submissions and questions and answers today.  I thank members for their participation and interest.  Deputy McNamara does not normally attend the committee but came in for this session.  He is welcome to do so, as is any Member who wishes to contribute to one of our sessions.  </p> <p>  I propose we publish the opening statements on the committee website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The committee will meet again on Wednesday, 3 November, when we will meet first at 4 p.m. to discuss housekeeping matters.  It will be a virtual meeting and can be attended remotely, if required.  We will then have a formal meeting at 5.30 p.m. to discuss the important topic of women's shelters and domestic violence refuges.</p></speech>

Is air sin a bh&iacute;omar ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; sa suirbh&eacute; seo.</p> <p>  &Oacute; thaobh riachtanais speisialta de, go bhfios dom, n&iacute;l aon ch&oacute;ras foirme&aacute;lta i bhfeidhm tr&iacute;na bhfaigheann p&aacute;ist&iacute; le riachtanais speisialta c&uacute;ram n&oacute; aon saghas seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; go hoifigi&uacute;il i nGaolainn.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ag tarl&uacute;.  T&aacute; fianaise ann go bhfuil s&eacute; ag tarl&uacute; agus go bhfuil na c&uacute;ram&oacute;ir&iacute; seo n&oacute; na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; ag moladh do thuismitheoir&iacute; a gclanna a th&oacute;g&aacute;il le B&eacute;arla mar go mbeidh s&eacute; n&iacute;os &eacute;asca teacht ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; i mB&eacute;arla.  Baineann s&eacute; seo le Bille na dteangacha oifigi&uacute;la.  Go minic, b&iacute;mid ag cuimhneamh ar dhaoine f&aacute;sta a bheadh ag cur glaoch ar oifig &eacute;igin agus ag iarraidh duine &eacute;igin a labhr&oacute;idh Gaolainn leo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin d&eacute;anta againn ar fad.  T&aacute; muidne ag cuimhneamh ar na daoine &oacute;ga agus ar ph&aacute;iste nach bhfuil imithe ar scoil f&oacute;s.  B&iacute;onn an teagmh&aacute;il is m&oacute; ag na tuismitheoir&iacute; leis na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; sl&aacute;inte ag an staid sin.  B&iacute;onn orthu dul i gcomhair vacsa&iacute;nithe agus leis na t&aacute;st&aacute;lacha forbartha a dh&eacute;anamh agus, an-chuid den am, n&iacute;l aon Bh&eacute;arla ag na p&aacute;ist&iacute; sin.  Tugtar isteach in oifig&iacute;, i gclinic&iacute; agus i seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; docht&uacute;ra agus eile agus n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn aon Ghaolainn ag an docht&uacute;ir.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith simpl&iacute;.  Conas is f&eacute;idir t&aacute;st&aacute;il forbartha a chur ar leana&iacute; nach bhfuil aon Bh&eacute;arla acu mura bhfuil Gaolainn ag an docht&uacute;ir?  Ba mhaith liom a chur ar an taifead nach bhfuil aon locht againn ar na docht&uacute;ir&iacute; n&aacute; ar na daoine at&aacute; ag obair sna seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; seo.  Is daoine iontacha iad.  D&eacute;anann siad a gcuid oibre agus cabhra&iacute;onn siad linne, ach n&iacute;or cuireadh aon choinn&iacute;oll i bhfeidhm agus n&iacute; d&uacute;radh go bhfuil riachtanais orthu Gaolainn a bheith acu.  Is &iacute; sin an fhadhb, seachas na daoine iontacha at&aacute; ag obair sna seirbh&iacute;s&iacute;.</p></speech>

Is &eacute; sin Eachr&eacute;idh na Gaillimhe, &aacute;it a bhfuil f&iacute;orbheag&aacute;n Gaeilge ach m&aacute; bhainim na B&eacute;arl&oacute;ir&iacute; ar fad as - n&iacute;l aon mhaith a bheith ag caint ar Th&iacute;r Amhlaidh, Baile Chl&aacute;ir, Carn M&oacute;r n&oacute; &Aacute;th an Chonnaidh mar Ghaeltachta&iacute; -  agus f&eacute;achaim ar an dream beag Gaeilgeoir&iacute; at&aacute; ann, t&aacute; siadsan ag seachadadh na teanga chomh l&aacute;idir sin leis na pobail l&aacute;idre Gaeltachta.  Ina choinne sin, mar shampla, is fearr Ciarra&iacute; Theas ag 21% n&aacute; Ciarra&iacute; Thiar.  T&aacute;imid ag feice&aacute;il ruda&iacute; at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute; taobh istigh den phobal, &aacute;it a bhfuil dream ag teacht ar an tuiscint, agus n&iacute; sna Gaeltachta&iacute; l&aacute;idre amh&aacute;in at&aacute; siad, go bhfuil acmhainn acu sa Ghaeilge agus gur fi&uacute; &eacute; a sheachadadh.  Is &eacute; sin an ch&eacute;ad chath go gcaithfear a bhuachan anseo.</p><p> Is &eacute; an dara rud a d&eacute;arfainn n&aacute; go bhfuil an Ghaeilge &aacute; sheachadadh &oacute; ghl&uacute;in go gl&uacute;in feicthe agam agus gan aon seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a bheith ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Is cuimhin liom a bheith ag dul go Boston na blianta &oacute; shin agus gur th&aacute;inig an bhean seo amach le linn dom a bheith ag dul ag an gCumann Gaelach agus gur chuir s&iacute; f&aacute;ilte romham.  Bh&iacute; Gaeilge Chonamara agus Chois Fharraige aici agus nuair a d'fhiafraigh m&eacute; di an &oacute; aniar di agus c&eacute;n &aacute;it, d&uacute;irt s&iacute; n&iacute; hea mar gurbh as Boston di.  Cinnte dearfa, ba chainteoir d&uacute;chasach &iacute; a m&aacute;thair, as Cois Fharraige, a th&oacute;g an bhean seo thall go Boston.  Chonaic m&eacute; a leith&eacute;id&iacute; d&eacute;anta ach th&oacute;gfadh s&eacute; an-d&iacute;ograis &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil an-t&aacute;bhacht leis na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; taca&iacute;ochta ar fad a bhfuil &aacute;r n-a&iacute;onna ag caint f&uacute;thu.</p><p> Caithfimid d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar cheisteanna na nd&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute; agus c&eacute;n teanga a labhra&iacute;onn siad.  T&aacute; a fhios agam &oacute; m'&oacute;ige f&eacute;in gur &oacute; 18 mbliana d'aois n&oacute; 19 mbliana d'aois an aois th&aacute;bhachtach.  Chonaic m&eacute; daoine a bh&iacute; ag labhairt B&eacute;arla agus iad ag dul go dt&iacute; an mhe&aacute;nscoil, agus an Ghaeilge a bheith &aacute; labhairt acu agus iad ag dul go dt&iacute; an ollscoil.  T&aacute; a fhios agam maidir le gaolta agus cairde liom f&eacute;in lenar labhair m&eacute; B&eacute;arla le linn m'&oacute;ige agus labhra&iacute;m Gaeilge leo i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in gur th&aacute;inig muid ar a mhalairt teanga ach th&aacute;inig siad ar a mhalairt teanga freisin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach go mbreathn&oacute;imid literally &oacute;n t&uacute;s ar an gceist seo agus a r&aacute; go bhfuil f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhacht ag an aoisghr&uacute;pa 18 mbliana d'aois go 30 bliain d'aois n&oacute; cib&eacute; aois nuair a thosa&iacute;onn daoine ag dul amach le ch&eacute;ile, agus mar sin de, maidir leis an teanga agus an comhth&eacute;acs ina gcasann daoine ar a ch&eacute;ile.  Caithfimid oibri&uacute; tr&iacute;d sin.

Rinneamar obair ar an gceist sin mar go rabhamar ag traen&aacute;il daoine leis an obair sin a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge ach feictear domsa go bhfuil s&eacute; ligthe i l&eacute;ig ar&iacute;s.</p><p> Is &eacute; an rud c&eacute;anna maidir le seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; do ghas&uacute;ir le riachtanais speisialta mar n&iacute;l aon amhras orm go gcuirtear comhairle go minic ar dhaoine ag fiafra&iacute; d&iacute;obh tuige nach bhfuil siad ag labhairt B&eacute;arla mar go mbeadh s&eacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os fusa amhlaidh.  Is ioma&iacute; gas&uacute;r nach bhfuil m&oacute;r&aacute;n faidhbe acu a th&eacute;ann le comhairleoir teiripe cainte agus go minic deirtear leo d&aacute; mbeadh an duine ag labhairt teanga amh&aacute;in, bheadh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; n&iacute;os fearr.  Is droch-chomhairle &iacute; sin.  Caithfimid dul agus acmhainn&iacute; a chur isteach sa sc&eacute;al sin.</p><p> Thiocfainn leis an Uasal N&iacute; Ch&eacute;illeachair maidir le tascfh&oacute;rsa.  Is &iacute; an cheist at&aacute; ann n&aacute; an ceart don Roinn a bheith istigh ann n&oacute; nach ceart.  T&aacute; bunt&aacute;iste le tascfh&oacute;rsa at&aacute; neamhsple&aacute;ch.  Ar l&aacute;mh amh&aacute;in de is f&eacute;idir aon mholadh a dh&eacute;anamh ar mhaith leo ach ag deireadh an lae go minic is &eacute; an Stat an t-aon dream a bhfuil in ann greim a fh&aacute;il ar an gcuid eile den St&aacute;t.  Cib&eacute; seans at&aacute; ag an St&aacute;t n&oacute; ag Roinn St&aacute;it, t&aacute; s&eacute; an-deacair &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh taobh amuigh den ch&oacute;ras sin.  Caithfimid tuilleadh pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an gceist sin.  Is &eacute; sin, an ceart go mbeadh an Roinn Turas&oacute;ireachta, Cult&uacute;ir, Eala&iacute;on, Gaeltachta, Sp&oacute;irt agus Me&aacute;n n&oacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta istigh ann sa mh&eacute;id is m&aacute; t&aacute;thar ag iarraidh ruda&iacute; a eagr&uacute; sa ch&oacute;ras sl&aacute;inte, sa ch&oacute;ras seo n&oacute; si&uacute;d, is leo si&uacute;d at&aacute; an t&aacute;bhacht.  Beifear ag brath go m&oacute;r orthu si&uacute;d agus ar l&aacute;ithreacht si&uacute;d, go m&oacute;r m&oacute;r d&aacute; gcaithf&iacute; dul go Bord an Rialtais, mar go bhfuiltear ag brath ar an Aire ansin.  T&aacute; intinn oscailte agam ar cheist sin faoin m&uacute;nla is fearr.</p><p> N&iacute;l mise gan d&oacute;chas nuair a bhreathna&iacute;m ar na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; ar an gcaoi a rinne m&eacute; &eacute; sin.  M&aacute; th&oacute;gaim, mar shampla an tEachr&eacute;idh, Bearna agus Cnoc na Cathrach, t&aacute; 1,696 ann.  De Ghaeilgeoir&iacute; laeth&uacute;la, &aacute;mh, n&iacute;l ach 660 agus t&aacute; 136 acu sin idir 13 bliana d'aois agus 18 mbliana d'aois agus iad &aacute; dt&oacute;g&aacute;il Gaeilge.  N&iacute; bheife&aacute; ag s&uacute;il go mbeadh an 10,000 duine ann ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il a gclanna le Gaeilge m&aacute; tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute; nach labhra&iacute;onn siad an Ghaeilge aon l&aacute;.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th gur bh&eacute;imnigh m&eacute; an t-am ar fad agus gur bhreathnaigh m&eacute; ar an gcothromas &oacute; thaobh sheachadadh na teanga idir na daoine a labhair an Ghaeilge gach uile l&aacute; agus an m&eacute;id acu si&uacute;d at&aacute; go soil&eacute;ir ag labhairt Gaeilge lena gclanna.  Cothroma&iacute;m na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; ar bhealach at&aacute; thar a bheith sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il agus bheadh s&eacute; sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht anois, is &eacute; sin ar fud na t&iacute;re.  D'fh&eacute;adfaimis a r&aacute; ansin c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad duine, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, at&aacute; ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il a gclanna le Gaeilge agus an m&eacute;id gas&uacute;r at&aacute; idir tr&iacute; bliana d'aois agus 18 mbliana d'aois taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht i gcompar&aacute;id le l&iacute;on na nGaeilgeoir&iacute; at&aacute; taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht at&aacute; &aacute; labhairt.  T&aacute; a fhios againn go bhfuil formh&oacute;r na Gaeilgeoir&iacute; laeth&uacute;la sa t&iacute;r seo taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht go fisici&uacute;il i l&aacute;thair na huaire.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil cuid mhaith d&iacute;obh de bhunadh na Gaeltachta ach t&aacute; siad go fisici&uacute;il taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Is &eacute; an rud a bheadh sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il n&aacute; c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad acu si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag labhairt Gaeilge go soil&eacute;ir lena gclanna, mar mura bhfuil, bheif&iacute; ag s&uacute;il go mbeidh go leor daoine f&aacute;sta ann agus gan aon daoine &oacute;ga ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laeth&uacute;il.</p><p> Molaim an obair at&aacute; ar bun.  Maidir le cro&iacute; na ceiste, n&iacute; fi&uacute; deich gcinn de fhreagra&iacute; mar baineann chuile pholasa&iacute; leis seo, go m&oacute;r m&oacute;r i gcomhth&eacute;acs na Gaeltachta.  D&aacute; gcuirf&iacute; an cheist orm c&eacute;ard iad na ruda&iacute; a rinne an-leas do ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; teanga sa Ghaeltacht, d&eacute;arfainn TG4, b'fh&eacute;idir, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, bun&uacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus na Roinne, an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga agus mar sin de.  Thug siad sin st&aacute;das don Ghaeilge agus deiseanna do dhaoine &oacute;ga breathn&uacute; ar &aacute;iteanna ina bhfuil daoine i bpoist mhaithe ag oibri&uacute; sa Ghaeilge a thug fosta&iacute;ocht d&oacute;ibh, agus mar sin de.  T&aacute; an freagra casta ach is &eacute; an rud is fearr a dh&eacute;anamh n&aacute; d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar ghn&eacute;ithe &eacute;ags&uacute;la den cheist gach uile l&aacute; ach, go m&oacute;r m&oacute;r, d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; do dhaoine &oacute;ga agus ar na himeachta&iacute; taobh amuigh den scoil.</p><p> Maidir leis na feighlithe linbh, is an-smaoineamh &eacute; sin.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; sin ar bun sa chathair seo leathch&eacute;ad bliain &oacute; shin agus bheadh siad si&uacute;d ag daoine agus teaghlaigh &aacute;irithe sa chathair agus bheadh siad ag fost&uacute; daoine le Gaeilge.  T&aacute; s&eacute; in am go mbeadh sc&eacute;im &eacute;igin c&uacute;raim bhaile mar sin agus n&iacute; chosn&oacute;dh s&eacute; m&oacute;r&aacute;n sa comhth&eacute;acs seo.

Before we commence, I remind members participating remotely that they must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.</p> <p>  We are convened to discuss the issue of the roll-out of the national broadband plan, NBP, with particular focus on rural Ireland.  The pandemic and the move to remote working and education has only heightened the awareness of the need for high-speed broadband in every home in Ireland, regardless of its location.  This vital plan for rural Ireland is now months behind schedule and the evidence that has come into the public domain over the past number of weeks does not instil confidence that the project has overcome the challenges behind these delays.  We are told that, on average, 5,000 homes a month have been passed by the end of this year, the first full year of the network build.  That is far short of the original target of 9,500 homes in year one and the evidence we will hear today is that this is primarily a result of the pandemic.  However, the projections in the Government estimate for 2022 show that just 5,800 homes will be connected in an average month, down from the original target of 7,500 homes.  I find it hard to believe that after the country has come out of the Covid pandemic, which has been blamed for this year's delays, only an additional 800 homes can be reached every month next year.  It does not add up.  These delays mean that 75,000 homes that should have access to high-speed broadband at the end of next year under the original targets will not have such access unless there is a practical catch-up plan.</p> <p>  The committee wants to hear a good news story today.  We want to hear about the solutions for catching up on these delays.  It is imperative that the pandemic is not used as an excuse for delays in the roll-out that just wallpaper over fundamental problems that need to be addressed because this infrastructure is needed now more than ever.</p> <p>  I welcome Dr. Stjohn O'Connor, principal officer and Mr. Jake Ryan, assistant principal officer, Department of Rural and Community Development; and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in, assistant secretary, communications division; Mr. Patrick Neary, chief technical officer, communications division; and Mr. Fergal Mulligan, NBP programme director, Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with all such directions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in to make an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.686" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021102000002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to provide an update on the roll-out of the national broadband plan.  I am joined by Mr. Fergal Mulligan, programme director for the NBP, and Mr. Patrick Neary, chief technology officer in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p> <p>  Over the past year and a half, Ireland&rsquo;s broadband infrastructure, both fixed and mobile, has allowed hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country to continue working and learning through lockdown restrictions and social distancing.  The importance of high-speed, quality, reliable broadband is now more evident than ever.  Had the pandemic occurred a decade ago, Ireland&rsquo;s transition to remote working and remote education would not have been possible.  The evidence of the past 18 months has, however, further heightened awareness of the importance of access to a reliable, quality broadband service for so many aspects of our daily lives and has also heightened awareness of the challenges faced by those who do not currently have access to such a broadband service.</p><p>The national broadband plan contract, which was signed in November 2019, will ensure a future-proofed, high-speed broadband network will be deployed by National Broadband Ireland, NBI, to the more than 1.1 million people living and working in the intervention area.  The NBP intervention will ensure that in the future, decisions on where people live and work will no longer be influenced by availability of broadband.  The contract is for at least 25 years and provides that the new network will be built over a seven-year period, reaching every premises in the intervention area.  Over the 25 years of the contract, all new builds in the intervention area will also be connected to the network, ensuring that into the future, nobody is left behind.</p><p> The NBP contract is future proofed and requires NBI to upgrade the infrastructure over the 25 years of the contract to match the level of service available in our cities and major towns.  The manner in which NBI has approached the deployment of the network gives a clear indication of its commitment to deliver on this aspect of the contract.  The procurement process for the NBP contract provided for a minimum service of 30 Mbps download speed, based on EU state aid guidelines, and the tender from NBI and the NBP contract increased this to 150 Mbps.  The NBP network will provide an initial minimum service of a standard of 500 Mbps download speed to all premises in the intervention area, with service of up to 1 Gbps available to businesses and other users on request.</p><p> For people who will be waiting until the later years of the network build for a connection, the Department recognises that today, they are more likely to be concerned about the timeline to get connected to a reliable broadband service than to the very high speeds that will be available over that network and the future-proofed nature of the contract.  Over time, however, the future-proofed nature of the contract will ensure that people living in the intervention area do not, in the future, once again find themselves on the wrong side of a digital divide.</p><p> The year 2020 was the first of the NBP contract and saw a significant level of mobilisation activity by NBI, including recruitment of personnel; procurement of materials and contractors; installation of equipment in exchanges and building IT systems to support the network.  Surveys and designs were progressed to inform the build, resulting in the first homes being connected to the new fibre network in January of this year in County Cork.</p><p> The network deployment which began in late 2020 ramped up in 2021 and is now active throughout the country.  Today, more than 113,000 premises are under construction in 30 deployment areas and more than 27,000 premises can order or preorder a connection in counties Cork, Galway, Limerick, Cavan and Monaghan.  As of 8 October, more than 266,000 premises have been surveyed, with detailed designs completed for more than 226,000 premises.  By the end of this year, National Broadband Ireland has forecast almost 60,000 homes will have been passed and will be able to connect to the network.  There are now more than 270 staff employed directly by NBI, along with more than 900 contractors working throughout the country on the network roll-out every day.</p><p> NBI has installed 382 broadband connection points, BCPs, which are a key element of the NBP and will provide high-speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll-out of the fibre-to-the-home network.  This includes 141 school BCPs and under an acceleration of this aspect of the NBP, a total of 679 primary schools will be connected by the end of next year.  BCPs are live on Inishbofin, Clare Island, Bere Island and Sherkin Island.  Agricultural marts located in the intervention area have also been contacted and are now in line for connection as a BCP.</p><p> The NBP contract was awarded on the basis of a capped subsidy, with National Broadband Ireland carrying the risk for any cost overrun or shortfall in revenue.  When the contract was awarded in November 2019, the total capped subsidy, including contingency and VAT, was &euro;2.9 billion.  As a result of a ruling by the Revenue Commissioners on VAT, the total cost is now capped at &euro;2.7 billion.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications on 15 September last, NBI informed the committee it was confident it could deliver the network build in under seven years and within budget.</p><p> The roll-out of the national broadband plan network has been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  While telecommunications activity was deemed essential work under Covid-19, activities relating to network build generally involve multiple-person crews and the onset of significant Covid-19 case numbers and the implications of close contacts severely impacted NBI&rsquo;s ability to have multiple-person crews operating during certain periods in 2020 and 2021.</p><p> The Department has worked closely with NBI to put a remedial plan in place to address delays experienced to the NBP roll-out.  Under this plan, NBI is implementing a number of measures to help lessen the impact, including increasing the level of throughput in the Eir make ready programme and bringing in additional resources in NBI and its subcontractors.</p><p> In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre-to-the-home network in a rural environment.  These include significant tree trimming to ensure cables can be placed on overhead poles; remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades; the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising day to day and week on week, which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground.  The Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the contract.  This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-bases milestones for 2021.  Work is under way to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond.  This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users.</p><p> Exploring the potential to accelerate the network roll-out is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.  The primary focus must be on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring the National Broadband Ireland build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.</p><p> Publication of Ireland&rsquo;s NBP strategy almost a decade ago has influenced investment in high-capacity broadband infrastructure in Ireland, which is on a steep upward trajectory.  In terms of commercial providers, Eir is upgrading its existing fibre-to-the-cabinet network to a fibre-to-the-home network, for approximately 1.9 million premises.  SIRO has completed the first phase of its fibre deployment, which has now passed more than 400,000 premises with gigabit services.  Virgin Media is offering 250 Mbps as a standard offering with 500 Mbps and 1 Gbps available to many of its customers in the more than 1 million premises it reaches.  Many other network operators and telecommunications service providers throughout the State also continue to invest in their networks.</p><p> Data published by ComReg clearly demonstrate that where high-capacity networks are available, demand will follow.  ComReg&rsquo;s latest quarterly report indicates 46% of broadband subscriptions are for services offering speeds in excess of 100 Mbps download and that there are more than 308,000 fibre subscriptions throughout the country, representing a 54% increase on last year.</p><p> When the national broadband plan procurement process was commenced, the EU digital agenda had an ambition of broadband speeds of 30 Mbps being available universally in the EU.  Today, under the EU digital compass, the ambition is universal access to gigabit broadband by 2030.  With the national broadband plan State intervention, together with the significant ongoing investment by commercial operators, Ireland is well positioned to be the leading EU member state, with gigabit connectivity available on a universal basis in the second half of this decade and well in advance of the 2030 target.  Through the Department's governance and management of the NBP contract, we will work with NBI to ensure the national broadband plan is delivered on time and within budget in order that the opportunities that will flow from a fully connected Ireland can be realised.  We look forward to assisting the committee members with any questions they may have today.</p></speech>

The first thing I notice here is the highly unambitious EU target of 30 Mbps for which we were working for a long time.</p><p>The present committee Chairman received a fair chinwag for this over the years from me where I said it was utter nonsense and that whatever Europe was saying, we should have been going for fibre.  I am delighted that in general, this is what we are going for.</p><p> I have a series of questions, which I will go through together rapidly.  First, will the build-out happen within five years from the time of the signing of the contract or will it be seven years?  We were promised that this work would be done within time.  Second, is there a penalty on NBI for failure to reach targets, which it is doing at the moment?  Is that in the contract?  Third, when will we get accurate forecasts of how many premises will be passed at the end of each year from 2021 to 2025, inclusive?  People want to know and to know accurately by Eircode postcode also. </p><p> Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in mentioned the islands.  As far as I am concerned, it is very bad news for anywhere a broadband connection point, BCP, has gone in, because it is a clear indication that it is way down the list.  Boasting that there are BCPs on islands is a worrying feature for somebody like me, because I know what the demand on the ground is.  There is nobody in rural Ireland that wants anything less than fibre-to the-home, FTTH, or in other words, parity.</p><p> As an aside, one curious thing I noticed was that if one looked for broadband in certain Eircode postcodes on the mainland in Connemara, one will be told that it will be in 2025, 2026 or whenever but that there is a BCP nearby out on Inishbofin.  Whoever organised that had a sense of humour, in that every time one wanted to connect to broadband one would have to travel to the island.  </p><p>Specifically, on the island issue, can the witnesses tell us whether fibre cable will be rolled out to the islands?  If so, has there been consultation with the Department with responsibility for the islands and with, for example, ESB Networks and the local authorities to see whether, when the dredging for the cable goes in, other utilities such as water in certain cases or improved power generation, particularly in view of renewable energy, can be put in at the same time rather than having three boats coming at three different times to provide three different types of delivery?  It is very important that this issue would be dealt with.</p><p> We have been told there has been a 54% increase in FTTH pick-up.  Can the witnesses tell us what percentage of people who have FTTH passing the house have actually got FTTH now?  As far as I am concerned, in most cases the constraint in getting FTTH or fibre to the home or to business is its unavailability outside one&rsquo;s front door.  I am curious to know what percentage of houses that are passed have now taken up the option of FTTH?  Can I ask that it be broken down between urban and rural? </p><p> On the cost, it is very likely that in the next five or six years, 80% to 90% of houses will take the very good quality broadband, in the way they used to have a phone in the old days.  I understand there is a clause in the contract that states the more people that pick it up, the cheaper the broadband is going to cost the State.  What is the current estimate, based on the present and growing demand for FTTH, for the expected cost of the actual roll-out of this NBI project if there is a very high take-up in line with what we seem to be getting on the ground at the moment?  For example, have the witnesses any projections that if we had 80% of premises passed taking it, or 70%, or so on, as to what the actual costs will be and which, if my understanding is right, will prove this to be probably the most effective value investment ever undertaken by the State?  This will also prove that those Jonahs who believed that nobody in rural Ireland would take up these connections did not know anything about rural Ireland.</p></speech>

That is a seven-year contract that we are two years into.  There are five years to the end of that contract.  NBI said before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications in September that it would deliver the full contract, notwithstanding that it is behind today, inside that seven years.  The ambition remains higher than that and we will get deeper into that in respect of some of the questions that the Deputy has asked, particularly around locking down numbers for 2022 and beyond.  Clearly again on that, there is an exercise that is to happen in the coming weeks, which will be around locking numbers down for 2022 and looking further forward.</p> <p>  We will come back later to a wider question around providing the maximum information that can be provided.  NBI provides this information to the public in the intervention areas in order that people have the maximum clarity and yet the challenge of doing that is that as one moves through the build programme, one is never able to give 100% certainty today.  Should I give 98% or 97% certainty today or should I give nothing until I am sure?  I favour giving the person the best I can but telling them that it may change.  We will come back to that point later.</p> <p>  On the roll-out programme, the future projection and the roll-out to islands, perhaps I might ask Mr. Neary to come in on that point in the first instance.  I will deal quickly with the costs issue and then Mr. Mulligan might expand on this on how clawback works and on dealing with the penalties issue.  </p> <p>  The cost of the programme is made up of a base subsidy of &euro;2.1 billion and &euro;480 million of contingency subsidy, plus VAT.  It is very early in the build but the indications are not just that it will come in under subsidy but that our target from the outset would be to keep as close to the &euro;2.1 billion base subsidy as possible.  The potential benefit back to the State of a high take-up flows in two ways.  One is that it means that the project and the business model works and continues to work.  </p> <p>  Mr. Mulligan can then explain to the joint committee how it works where there is a clawback to the State.  There is a different clawback to the State where the project is going well because the capital costs are kept under control and are lower than was in the tender and there is an immediate impact of that.  There is a more long-term impact if it is that the project is a success over the life of the project.  </p> <p>I will ask Mr. Neary to come in first on the network roll-out and Mr. Mulligan can then pick up on clawback and the penalties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.691" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Neary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021102000002#C00300"><p>On the overall roll-out, as Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in has stated there, NBI has indicated that it is very confident that it will deliver the project within the overall timelines and it has a high ambition to exceed those timelines.  We are pressing them very hard to do that.</p> <p>  On the accuracy of information that is being issued to everyone, it is worth stepping through how this information comes out and is published.  NBI is giving out the best information that it has available to it at a point in time.  It is on the website and down to an Eircode postcode as to when broadband will be available to that premises.  For a number of premises, that will be very accurate because it is at the last throw to build the infrastructure out to that premises.  If the premises is further out and NBI have not started the surveys to that area, or the low-level design is not fully completed yet, then there are definitely caveats as to the accuracy of that information.  The further away that premises is in the build, the more the possible estimation of risk is not as accurate.  As Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in has said, it is giving out the best information that is available to it and for the vast majority of premises, it tends to be reasonably accurate.  It gives an indication as to when that build will be available to that premises.</p> <p>  As NBI goes through the surveys - it inspects the infrastructure in the area and looks at the local issues that may disrupt the deployment - the accuracy of that information is improved.  As NBI starts the pre-works and the preparation works with Eir, it further improves and as it gets closer and closer to the actual deployment date, it becomes very precise, down to the point where it is giving out specific dates to industry as to when that individual premises will be available.</p><p>NBI's website gives the best information it has available across the full seven years as it stands today.  That is something NBI implemented this year on the basis of high demand from citizens and public representatives that the information it has on the deployment forecast be made available.</p><p> The solution for the islands is that a local exchange will typically be deployed, with fibre rolled out from that exchange to each individual house.  That is the template for the solution for the islands.  One of the key questions is what the connectivity to that exchange will be.  It is done on a case-by-case basis, looking at the best solution possible for the exchange.  In some cases, subsea cable is appropriate, available and can be used.  In other cases, it is a matter of bringing fibre to the nearest point that is close to the mainland and putting in a small-gigabit wireless connection to the exchange.  That is the template but it really needs to be examined on a case-by-case basis as to what is feasible and possible to do.  It is about bringing the fibre as close as possible to the local exchange on the island.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.693" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021102000002#D00200"><p>I want to get to the nub of this issue.  Electricity was initially generated on the islands, as Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in knows, but it was subsequently considered better to bring in cables.  I am not sure about Inishturk but Tory Island and all the rest are connected by subsea cable because it is better than other options.  Fibre is better than any radio system.  The question then, and it is a valid question, is if there is a cost difference between fibre and radio signal and if the Department of Rural and Community Development is willing to pay the difference, will there be a facility for NBI to go with the proper model and not short-change the islands by putting in something that is not as good as fibre?  If the alternatives were as good as fibre, they would be installed all over the place.  We might not have time to go into the detail of this today but the conversation needs to happen.  There is no reason that the Department, in order to get the best solution, should not fund that extra cost, if there is such a cost, over what might be acceptable to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications but would not be optimal.  As I said, it can be done in a cost-efficient way.  Many of the islands have electric cables but cannot export electricity, whereas they would have opportunities in the renewables field if much more resilient ESB cables went in at the same time and so on.  Doing the undersea work is not that expensive.  I oversaw the installation of undersea cables on a number of lightly populated islands.  It is quite quick and cheap to do if there is a sandy bottom.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.694" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021102000002#D00300"><p>I know the Deputy has long experience and knowledge of infrastructure development in remote areas.  We certainly will consider his comments.  However, the principle of the contract is that the standard of service for people on the islands, and the key performance indicators, KPIs, that would apply in terms of the service, is the same standard that applies on the mainland.  There will be no difference.  The contract requires the same level of service to every premises in the intervention area.  Nevertheless, the Deputy has raised a practical point and we will certainly consider it.</p> <p>  I want to make a quick comment on BCPs.  Nobody should interpret the presence of a BCP close to their location as an indication that broadband is not coming to their area until the last year or two of the roll-out.  The decision that had to be made around BCPs was more about whether, if broadband was coming very imminently, would it better to invest six or 12 months upfront.  All of the locations were chosen by the local authorities, in consultation with the Department of Rural and Community Development, as being very important locations.  The fact there is a BCP should not be read into as meaning that broadband is not coming to that location until the final year of the project.</p></speech>

For a large part of the area I represent, including parts of counties Galway and Mayo, that seems to be the timeframe when one checks it on the computer.  They are also areas in which BCPs are located.  I put uimhir a haon and uimhir a haon together and perhaps I should not have got uimhir a d&oacute;, but that is what I usually get.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.696" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal Mulligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021102000002#D00500"><p>In regard to the commercial model, the Deputy made several points about take-up, clawback, penalties and the financial implications of higher take-up on the project.  As Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in said, the project has a maximum capped subsidy of &euro;2.1 billion in the first instance, as well as a contingency fund, of &euro;480 million, which it is always necessary for projects to have in the event of a rainy day.  That funding is there for 25 years and will ultimately be monitored, week by week, month by month, quarter by quarter and year by year, by our financial experts and engineers to ensure we are getting value for all moneys that are spent.</p> <p>  The clawback kicks in for a number of areas, as we have explained before.  Where NBI spends a lot less money than anticipated on the capital costs of building a network - where, for example, it buys fibre cable or other materials at a much lower than expected cost - that will be clawed back 100% by the State.  Something like 80% of the bill costs, if they come in under budget, are clawed back 100% by the State.  That is the first saving of State money, regardless of take-up, in terms of subsidising the network.  The second major area of clawback, which is very relevant to the commercial model of NBI - which is, after all, a commercial company - relates to the outturn, year on year, for the next 25 years.  There is a clawback of 60% on any excess profits it may make.</p> <p>  That year-on-year model will really only come to pass in the next ten or 12 years, when we see the reality of the take-up and, more important, the reality of what it is costing to run this business.  It is only then that net profit will become apparent, or, indeed, it could be a loss.  Time will tell.  If there is an excess profit, the State will claw back 60%, which will reduce, incrementally and over time, the overall cost of &euro;2.1 billion to the State.  We hope to have recouped a significant amount of profit from the overall project by 2025 such that the &euro;2.1 billion allocation is reduced in aggregate terms.  However, as I indicated, that is not something we will see in the next five years.</p> <p>  On the take-up scenario, there was a wonderful newspaper article a few years ago in which colleagues unearthed an article run by a newspaper in the 1950s or 1960s with a headline indicating that the take-up of ESB networking in rural Ireland was expected to be 10%.  I put a copy of the article up on the wall at home because there were a lot of articles going around at the time about the national broadband plan and whether there would be any take-up of fibre broadband in rural areas.  Articles claiming that there is a 5% or 10% take-up on the NBI network need to be seen in a context where, as we have seen in Cavan, Monaghan and all the places where broadband is now available for order and preorder for 27,000 premises, the take-up rate, in the majority of those areas, is in excess of what we expected in 2019 when the contract was signed.</p> <p>  Obviously, that is very positive news for the business case of NBI.  We expect now, as the project gets into a steady state of roll-out, that there will be at least 1,000 connections per month, which will increase as we go from 27,000 premises to 60,000, 100,000 and 200,000.  The rate of 1,000 connections per month will ramp up on the graph over time.  The business model of this network, like the business model of Eir, SIRO or any other commercial operator, is based on a slow trajectory of take-up in the initial years.  That is the way every commercial business model works in broadband, in Ireland and across every other EU member state.  They work off a base of getting to 5% and thereafter to 10%, 20%, 30% and so on.  We have always said, as we have stated before in this committee, that the expectation is that, over the next eight to ten years, 80% of the addressable market in the intervention area will buy into the private broadband service.  We do not expect anything less because we do not see a reason people would not buy it.  The price will be on a par with that in urban areas and the service will be second to none.  It will be a 24-7, 365-days service, managed by the significant KPIs set out in our contract and at a price point that is similar to that offered in urban areas.  Today, customers will get 500 Mbps; I have no doubt that in a few years' time, NBI will be offering probably a minimum speed of 1 Gbps.</p> <p>  In terms of future-proofing and take-up, we certainly have no concerns on that level.</p><p>One of the indicators so far is that take-up will be in excess of what we predicted in the first place, which is what the Deputy is alluding to.  Covid-19 has proven that and has pushed that demand curve steeper than it might have otherwise been absent of Covid.  That is really it on take-up and clawback.</p><p> At the very end of the project there is also a third clawback mechanism whereby we claw back the value of the business.  If it is a very successful - and we would hope it is - company by the end of the year 2025, we claw back 40% of the terminal value of that company.  In aggregate terms over 25 years, therefore, if we are all sitting here then, I will be telling the committee the exact story on what we will have clawed back and what the ultimate cost to the State will be of this project.  We all have a fairly high expectation that it will come in below budget, we will have significant clawback and take-up will be very positive.</p><p> The penalties on delayed build are in the contract.  There are a number of penalties in the contract, which we have explained before but I will go through them very briefly.  There are three particular penalties on the company of National Broadband Ireland.  The first one, which is not a direct penalty in the contract, is the commercial loss to the company if it is slower building this network than it should have been because it will not get customers onto its network.  Like any business, therefore, if it does not get the doors open quickly, it will not get customers.  That is the first penalty commercially on that company, which will reduce its revenue while its costs are still ramping up.  That puts a fairly significant working capital pressure on the company if it is not getting the revenue in the door.</p><p> The second big problem for the company is that it will not be getting subsidy from us if it is not built.  There are, therefore, many commercial pressures on the company to get this built as fast as possible in order that it gets the subsidy in the door from the State and revenue in from customers.  On top of that, for every day it is late from February next year, there is also a daily penalty in the clause in the contract for every milestone it misses by whatever daily penalty there is in the contract.  Other penalties have been there since day one and continue for 25 years, which are key performance indicators that Mr. Neary and his colleagues would monitor.  If customers make orders, for example, the company is required to process 90% of those orders within ten working days.  If it does not do that over the next 25 years for every order it receives, and it will be receiving thousands of orders every week, it will suffer key performance indicators, KPI, and deductions from subsidy.  If it does not fix the network within a certain period where there is downtime given a storm or whatever might happen in any given time, and people are without a service, it will be suffering penalties for that as well.  Again, that is a critical point because particularly from Monday to Friday but also for businesses at weekends, the network cannot be down.  In this environment with Covid-19, if people cannot make a video call, work from Monday to Friday or do business at weekends, a network that is down for an hour or three or four hours costs everybody a lot of money.  There are, therefore, significant KPIs in the contract to incentivise NBI to have a robust business recovery plan for every time there might be a network outage.</p><p> I will note that many Deputies were invited to NBI's head office and headquarters yesterday and it went through the network operating centre, which showed them clearly the controls and procedures NBI now has in place to monitor and proactively ensure that the network never goes down.  It can, therefore, predict where something might happen.  If, for example, there is an ESB outage because of a storm that will bring the broadband network down, it has the crews ready and waiting to go and fix the network.  Those things are, therefore, all in place to ensure that it does not suffer penalties.  The first thing NBI does is to ensure that it does not suffer a penalty.  It is not in its interest commercially to do so and it also does not want to lose subsidy.  We believe all the incentives are there for it to avoid penalties in the first place.</p></speech>

I will ask a question before Deputy Kerrane comes in and Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in might come back when he has responded to the Deputy.  He said the Department was currently looking at re-baselining the 2022 figures.  He might explain how in the Government Estimate that was published last week, the target was set out for 130,000 homes to be passed by the end of next year, which would mean 70,000 homes will be done next year.  Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in might clarify that when he is answering Deputy Kerrane.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.699" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021102000002#E00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming in this morning and for their time.  First, targets are important, of course, and particularly important where, obviously, in an awful lot of cases, people are very much waiting to access broadband which is, in many cases, badly needed in their homes.  I understand the initial target for the end of this year was 115,000 premises.  According to the opening statement, Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in cited 27,000 premises as being ready for order or preorder and said the Department aims to get to 60,000 by the end of the year.  That is my read on it.  That is, therefore, more than 30,000 in the next two and a half months.  Can Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in confirm that with regard to the target?</p> <p>  Regarding next year's target, can Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in detail what the initial target was and what the target now is for next year?  With regard to any kind of catch-up programme, might Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in be able to tell the committee what is needed with regard to the ability to catch up?  He might perhaps speak to us about staff.  I note in the opening statement that Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in mentioned 270 staff are directly employed.  Had he an initial figure as regards numbers the Department would like to recruit?  I know it has more than 900 employed as contractors but 270 staff does not really seem like a lot to be directly employed.  Could he comment on that?</p> <p>  County Galway was one of a number of counties that Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in referenced.  It was going to be the starter as regards build.  If Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in cannot respond to this today that is fine but he might come back to me with a response  Have there been specific issues regarding County Galway?  In the last couple of weeks, I have been contacted by a number of constituents from Ahascragh, which is a village outside Ballinasloe.  They were of the view that Ahascragh was going to be able to access this broadband now or in the very near future.  It was listed on a number of press releases at the time and the main street there does not seem to be getting any access at all.  Was there any particular challenge with regard to County Galway or have issues come up there?</p> <p>  Eleven marts are to be connected and are in line for a BCP, which is really welcome.  On the best of days, it can be hard to sell cattle in person never mind online.  There have been huge issues.  Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in might be able to tell us where those 11 marts are located.</p> <p>  I believe Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in said there are penalties for milestones missed.  If NBI and the Department meet and milestone targets are being revised downwards, however, and the milestones are being brought down like they were this year and I assume will be for next year, how will that work with regard to penalties?</p> <p>  Finally, this seems to be an issue across my constituency in both counties Roscommon and Galway.  Again, I do not expect Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in to have this detail today but it is just an example because it seems to be happening in many areas.  One of my constituents lives in a village called Castleplunket just outside Castlerea.  One side is the Roscommon side, which is served by NBI, and the other is Castlerea.  He had signed up to the quarterly emails and was told that he could preorder between August and October of this year.  He was delighted.  He then got his next quarterly email and was told that his address was back to survey status and that he would not be able to order or preorder until between January and December 2023.  Therefore, one side of his house - the Roscommon side - is being done at the moment and the Castlerea side is not.  He is caught in the middle.  How many times has it happened that someone was told his or her area was in build stage and that he or she would to be able to order in 2021, and that person then received an email to say it will actually be two years later?  Can Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in roughly speak to that?</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in said 113,000 premises are under construction in the deployment areas and that 27,000 premises can either order or preorder.  In total, how many are under construction?  The figure of 27,000 is not on top of the 113,000 premises.  The figure of 113,000 includes some of those 27,000 premises.  In total, therefore, what numbers are we talking about who have fibre or where work is ongoing at their homes at the moment?</p></speech>

I will speak this way but it is an unusual setting in the room.  We are normally sitting looking across at members.</p> <p>  To start, the revised target for this year is 60,000.  That is contractualised with NBI and I believe that has been in place since May of this year.  NBI appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications a month ago.  It is NBI's role to deliver that target.  It is our role to manage the contract and have oversight of that.  That is something we do hour on hour, day on day and week on week.  We take a very strong governance approach to it.  We also take a collaborative approach in working with NBI in terms of where the Department and the State can be of assistance in trying to remedy issues.</p><p>On the Chairman's question and the figure of 130,000 for next year, that number is based on what National Broadband Ireland has communicated it will deliver in 2022.  It said it would deliver between 70,000 and 84,000 premises next year, which is 130,000 to 144,000.  That is what NBI recently told a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Earlier this year, we agreed a remedial plan for 2021 with National Broadband Ireland.  It has to submit a remedial plan with revised targets for 2022.  We hope to receive that plan shortly.  The target for 2022 agreed through that process will be contractualised.  In terms of the budget and the number, it is based on the number that National Broadband Ireland has communicated it can deliver next year.  It is a number we understand on the basis of the detailed engagement we have had with NBI.  </p><p> In regard to staff, I will ask Mr. Mulligan to speak to what the contract expected at tender stage.  The Deputy mentioned the Ahascragh issue.  I will not provide an answer on that because to do so might be to breach protocol, in that the Minister will provide that answer later today by way reply to a parliamentary question.  We receive hundreds of parliamentary questions per annum in regard to the national broadband plan, which demonstrates the importance of it.  When it comes to responding to questions, I regularly seek detail on the circumstances of the inquiry.  I have looked at Ahascragh.  I am not sure that the response to the parliamentary question is actually a response to the issue there.  It appears the entire village is in the blue area and that the premises which are in the national broadband plan area, which I think are on the road out to Fohanagh, are just outside of the village and, thus, they are in the amber area.  It is potentially the case that the person who contacted the Deputy is in the village and is having a difficulty within the blue area in terms of service provision.  It is a common issue that arises, one that we have to get behind.  In terms of the parliamentary question, if the response provided does not address the issue, the Deputy might contact the Department directly and we can follow up on the matter.</p><p> I will ask Mr. Neary to respond on the question regarding details on the marts.  If he does not have that information, we will forward a written response to the committee.  In terms of the Castleplunket issue, I do not propose to go into the details of the case but I refer the Deputy to the point I raised earlier when answering questions from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, that is, you are in that difficult space where people want the maximum information you can give them today and yet you are in an imperfect world because, as outlined by Mr. Neary, there are people who are further down the line in terms of that seven-year programme where surveys may not have been carried out.  The Deputy mentioned low-level design.  When people have not gone out and walked the roads, worked out where the infrastructure is and figured out how it is proposed to bring broadband to a premises, what might have seemed intuitive at the tender stage changes when you get down to the detailed design.  I will ask Mr. Neary to speak generally as to what he is seeing to date in relation to that issue.  </p></speech>

In regard to a deployment area, the first thing NBI does is survey the infrastructure in the area to uncover the complexities of how to bring broadband to a specific premises in that complete deployment area.  At that point, it will unravel whether the information on which it based its initial high-level design needs to be updated or whether there needs to be optimisation of the design.  In general, 99% of the premises that are within a deployment area remain in that deployment area.  There is movement of certain premises.  NBI will attempt to bring premises into a deployment area if, following a survey, it is determined that the infrastructure is there to bring in extra premises and the technology allows for it.  That happens consistently across the deployment areas.  However, there is a counterbalance to that.  Where the infrastructure is not fit for purpose, there is a particular local issue, an area is designated an area of special conservation or there is some other special circumstance such that for certain premises the infrastructure is not there or feasible to be re-used, those premises are then allocated to a neighbouring deployment area where the infrastructure is serving those homes.  What happens in that case, unfortunately, is the scheduling of those premises follows the adjacent deployment area.  Whereas the existing deployment area may have been scheduled for this year - I am not sure if that is the case in this instance but there is a deployment area in Roscommon scheduled for this year - the adjacent deployment area may be scheduled for 2023.  The premises that move to the adjacent deployment area become part of the deployment area low-level design.  When the low-level design is completed, what is in and what is out of a deployment area is pretty much settled.  It is often the case that only a very small number of premises are moved.  Typically, there are additions rather than removals.  At that point, there is a higher level of accuracy on the deployment timeline, but there is still further work to be done, including pre-works, which is the Eir make ready activity.  This is followed by the build.  The accuracy of timeline increases as you get through those activities, to the point where NBI can give an absolute date for when coverage at a premises will be available.  In the circumstance where a date has moved substantially, it is most likely the case that a premises has been moved to an adjacent deployment area because of what was uncovered during the surveys on the ground.  If the Deputy provides me with the Eircode, I can look into the matter.</p></speech>

The numbers anticipated at bid stage, again, were modelled by the bidder, not the Department.  NBI put forward its best business case.  The numbers provided are not too far off where the numbers are today.  It is important to make the point that National Broadband Ireland was a brand new company in January 2020.  We all know what happened in March 2020.  NBI went from an initial staff of 30 to 40 in early 2020 to 230 today.  This is one of the areas where Covid did wreak a bit of havoc in terms of efficient outcomes for the project.  There were delays in getting from 30 to 40 staff to 230 because of Covid.  The staff complement could be 240 next week because NBI is still engaged in recruitment.  It was a very difficult environment to recruit people.  When recruiting in telecommunications, you are recruiting engineers, accountants, designers and so on, who are very specialist people in a very small pool.  NBI was trying to hire these staff online, with no in-person engagement and when they started their job there was no office to go to.  As is the case with regard to starting an new job in any company or business, new staff feed off being able to work in an environment where people work together in offices, rooms and workshops.  That did present a big challenge for NBI over the past 12 to 14 months.  I visited the NBI offices yesterday.  The car park was full and the office is now fully ramped up.  Everything is in place, with teams working diligently in the office and across the country.  NBI is in a very different place today than it was, say, 12 months.  That is one of the areas where Covid was not kind from a staffing perspective.</p> <p>  On staff numbers, I believe NBI has sufficient numbers.  It certainly has sufficient brain power within the company.  There are some excellent staff at senior management level and right down through the value chain from engineers to accountants to legal and everything else that they need to run this project.</p><p>We are very confident in the business's capacity to run the project.  Whether it might need another ten or 20 staff to make sure the project is delivered is again a matter for the board of the directors, but it is in a very good position staff-wise at the moment.</p></speech>

If the milestones are being revised, as they were this year and will be next year, how will these penalties work?  Will they not just be dodged, although that is not the right word?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.707" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal Mulligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021102000002#G00300"><p>This is a commercial contract between us and a commercial company.  Every contract, including public private partnership contracts, contracts for road or rail projects or this contract, will include two specific clauses.  One is for relief and one is for delay.  A relief clause allows companies to apply to the authority, which is us in this case, to say that something beyond the companies' control happened - which may include force majeure, an act of God, a storm or so on - which means they cannot meet the demands of the contract.  In certain circumstances, which we have to oversee and review, such companies can seek relief from a penalty under the contract.  This relief provision was invoked due to Covid in this particular context.  We look at delay based on milestones rather than on months but National Broadband Ireland, NBI, itself said the project was delayed by six months.  It attributed the majority of that six-month delay to Covid issues.  Throughout the process in March and April of this year, we went through all the reasons it believes it was delayed.  Our independent experts reviewed that and came back to us with the opinion that NBI had objectively demonstrated why Covid-related issues had impacted on the build.  We gave NBI relief for the majority of the period of the delay.  Some of that delay was not related to Covid.  That will come into play next year.  If the company has not then made up for that lost time on the build, penalties will apply from February of next year.  The company is not dodging the penalties.  They were always to kick in from February of next year under the contract.  They will kick in next year if the company has not made up for lost ground relating to the delay for which relief was not given or in the event of the company being delayed even further, which we do not anticipate happening.  The penalties will kick in in those circumstances.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions.  I will try to keep them brief.  Some have been already answered.  First, I support Deputy Kerrane's comments on the Ahascragh area.  I accept that Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in cannot give us clear answers today but, as the Chairman will know, there is a famous hurling team in the area, Ahascragh Fohenagh.  The Chairman and I have relations in that area and we had better look after them.  The people I am talking about are actually not in the village.  Approximately 15 residents living outside the village are affected.  I will get more details for the witnesses.  They have been campaigning for a number of years.  They have absolutely no supply which is a real drawback for them.  I would certainly like to see further clarification on that issue.</p> <p>  To return to the 60,000 homes that will be connected to the network by the end of the year, is it possible to indicate how many of these connections are in rural areas and how many are in urban areas?  The witnesses have been asked about the agricultural marts.  I accept that Mr. Neary will come back to us on where those particular marts are located.  That is important.  The witnesses used the phrase "timeframe changes" a number of times.  Will that affect mainly rural areas?  I am anxious to know that.  Linked to that question, now that we have a number of hotspots set up by Government in parts of the country, will the areas where these are located be less of a priority for NBI than they would have been before?  The hotspots are really good, particularly for business, but do not provide broadband to everybody in the locality.</p> <p>  With regard to the main build works, I recall speaking about the connections to Ballinasloe and Roscommon some years ago, back when the Chair was the Minister.  Is that work almost finished now?  It is something I have meant to check in recent times.  I refer to Ballinasloe and Roscommon town.  </p> <p>  I am no expert on this and do not pretend to be.  I know very little about the technology.  I will not talk as if I know more but I will bring it down to the practicalities.  I have to work my office from home now.  I have an Oireachtas line.  I am told that Eir has brought ducting to either side of my house.  The Chairman knows the area very well.  The ducting comes down 2 km from my house on one side and less than 1 km from it on the other side.  Even with my Oireachtas line, I cannot get into half of my meetings.  Many of my neighbours are in similar situations.  The service is broken down half the week.  It is of no benefit to me and this is a very significant drawback from my perspective.  It means that, on days when I would prefer to be at home, I have to be out, but that is beside the point.  </p> <p>  How long will it be before those dots are joined up?  There are cases like this all over the country.  It is very significant for rural Ireland.  If we do not join up those dots, many people will lack a proper broadband service for a number of years.  In a number of rural areas, there are people with very successful businesses who come to my office every week to tell me their broadband is really bad and that this is a drawback for their businesses.  They could be employing two, four or five people.  They seem to be given very little hope by anybody.  They are in outlying rural areas.  </p> <p>  To be honest, there are huge problems with rural broadband across Europe.  It is not just Ireland.  There is chaos in parts of rural Britain because people cannot get broadband.  It is the same in parts of Germany.  It is not only an Irish problem.  Nobody can pretend it is all going to be fixed over two or three years.  It is not but we must go out of our way to ensure those businesses can continue to operate in today's business world because it will have a bigger effect on rural Ireland.  These people will certainly not be able to continue as is.  How can we improve the lot of those people, of whom there are many in the Roscommon-Galway region, as my colleagues here will know?  I appreciate this is challenging and difficult.  I appreciate that progress can be slow at times but I would appreciate clarification on the questions I have asked.</p></speech>

One of these was asked by Senator Murphy and another by both Senator Murphy and Deputy Kerrane.  On Senator Murphy's own personal situation, he is caught in the Eir rural viable deployment area.  There is fibre broadband on either side of him but he is caught in no man's land in the middle.  The witnesses might address that question and the related question.  I understand there has been engagement between National Broadband Ireland and Eir about dealing with some of those isolated homes in urban areas that are not getting a minimum of 20 Mbps and circumstances like Senator Murphy's.  Will the witnesses clarify whether Senator Murphy's home and similar homes are part of that discussion?</p> <p>  The related issue has regard to Ahascragh.  I raised this issue here on 16 December when the witnesses were last before the committee.  I specifically spoke about the Ballinasloe deployment and the homes that were designated as dark blue but which were not getting a minimum speed of 30 Mbps.  There are people in Ahascragh whose homes are designated as dark blue but who are not getting 30 Mbps.  They are the ones we are talking about here.  In response to me last December when I raised this specific issue, Mr. Neary told us that a team of people were monitoring the maps and making sure those houses we believe are getting speeds of 30 Mbps at home are actually getting them.</p><p>Clearly, the community in Ahascragh feels abandoned because that mapping work did not happen.  I flagged in the committee last December that this was going to cause a significant problem, and I am sure it is being replicated elsewhere.  What is happening in regard to communities such as Ahascragh and elsewhere, where people are not getting the minimum of 30 Mbps and feel they are now being bypassed?  Perhaps Dr. O'Connor will speak on this issue in respect of the broadband officers, because I know the broadband officers have relayed specific concerns at forums in Carrick-on-Shannon and across the country that this was going to cause a problem.  We are now seeing that working out in Ahascragh and hundreds of such places across the country.  I just wish to clarify both issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.717" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021102000002#H00200"><p>Senator Murphy raised a number of issues.  He rightly says that the question of access to high-speed broadband for people in rural areas is not just an Irish problem, but what the national broadband plan will ensure in the future is that it is not a problem in Ireland.  Ireland will be standing out as the leading country in Europe that has addressed the problem.  It is a very difficult one to address.  Across Europe very significant investment is being made in high-speed broadband networks.  They are really reaching out; they are not just in major urban areas.  In the countries we look at and know most about, we are seeing that no country of the scale of Ireland or larger has adopted the level of ambition that Ireland has and said, "We will continue the reach out to get to everyone".  The national broadband plan will ensure that.</p> <p>  The Senator asked how many of the 60,000 are rural and urban.  While there are dots in urban areas, the national broadband plan is almost exclusively a rural project because the commercial operators have built in the cities, towns and villages.  With regard to Ahascragh, we can come back and look at that.  If any Eircode is given to us in respect of a blue area where somebody says he or she cannot get a high-speed broadband service, we investigate it.  We find in many cases that the person can or there is an issue to be resolved.  In some instances we have found that people should be in the national broadband plan because they are not, and will not be, served by a commercial operator.</p></speech>

What the broadband officers have said to both Departments and to me, and what I said to the Department's officials last December, is that there must be a proactive strategy to say to those communities, "This is where the fibre is starting from and if you are inside this area and you are not getting 30 Mbps, something needs to be done".  NBI has put up posters all over the area, and even called some parts of County Roscommon as parts of County Galway.  You made that mistake here this morning as well.  The reality is that something proactive has to be done so we do not have a replication of Ahascragh.  What has to happen immediately is that some proactive information must be provided to the communities in the Ballinasloe deployment area to tell them to make contact if they are not getting the minimum 30 Mbps.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.719" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021102000002#H00400"><p>I accept your comments, Chairman.  We will continue to engage on the mapping exercise, but the most proactive thing that is happening, which will resolve the issue not just for those people who have under 30 Mbps today or are on that borderline and are in a blue area, is that the commercial operators in this country that are currently serving those areas are engaged in a very significant ramp up of a roll-out of fibre to the home.  We are talking today about circumstances where somebody might or might not be above or below the 30 Mbps.  That is not the future, it is not the ambition for the future and it is not where Ireland is going.  If that was 100 Mbps and if the European Commission had settled on 100 Mbps or on a gigabit, those people would be in a different place from the majority of people in urban areas and from all the people in rural areas who are served by the national broadband plan.  That is the most significant thing that is happening.  However, I absolutely accept your comment about the communication to the public on it.</p> <p>  To run quickly through the questions, and we will come back on the list of marts, the 60,000 is almost all rural.  In terms of the question on the BCPs and the broader area, I will have to refer back to the committee.  We will provide the Ballinasloe update.  On the point about where the Senator is living, we are seeing instances of that.  It is replicated throughout the country because of the ribbon nature of the development of the commercial operators' networks.  Typically, they have built out in villages and have come out of the village to a certain degree on the more populated roads and stopped.  Depending on how close that village is to the next village, there will be that middle ground.  National Broadband Ireland will be picking up that right across Ireland.  Its roll-out plan is focused on that.</p> <p>  On the BCP, the question was about whether these were in more isolated locations and therefore they would not be in areas to which National Broadband Ireland would be as invested in rolling out its network.  NBI has no choice.  The contract is a contract to deliver high-speed broadband to 544,000 premises, and that is increasing as new builds take place.  Its deployment plan deliberately does not go after the easiest-to-reach homes first or the largest centres of population first.  It is built out methodically from exchanges and then built out in a ring around that.  It has to get to everybody.  That is what the contract provides for, so there is no question that somebody should be concerned that because he or she is in a more remote and less populated area he or she will not be delivered the connectivity that is going to happen elsewhere in the plan.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Neary have an update on Ballinasloe?</p></speech>

As regards activity across all of Roscommon, 42% of the premises have undergone a survey at this point.  Some 7,700 premises are in pre-build and build work.  There is substantial activity happening across Roscommon in total.  While I have the opportunity I will clarify the numbers I gave earlier and the reason there is a discrepancy.  Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in referred to 113,000 in build.  That was at the date stamp of the end of September.  The number I have of 111,000 is because up to a number of days ago 2,000 have moved into complete.  That is the only difference.  They are the same figures.  I will refer back to the committee on the list of marts.</p></speech>

I gave my situation as an example.  The witness is correct that they are all over the country.  When can we realistically expect to see progress on that front, where areas are just left out and the cable is not down?  Obviously, it is an issue between the witnesses and Eir, but when can we expect progress?</p></speech>

Anybody in those areas can use the NBI website to get the up-to-date information for his or her Eircode.  However, all the build programme in every deployment that is being built at present is meeting premises like the Senator just described.</p> <p>  Chairman, you asked a question about isolated premises and engagement with commercial operators.  The NBI has gone to a public tender in that regard to seek expressions of interest.  I understand it has communicated that it has received five expressions of interest to date in that regard and it is moving to the next stage of that process, so it is looking to see where it can use other operators to better reach premises in a more effective and faster way than through the roll-out of the deployment plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.723" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stjohn O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021102000002#H00800"><p>I wish to come back in on two points.  You are absolutely correct, Chairman, in your point about the broadband officers.  The broadband officers have been identifying premises.  One of the core functions of a broadband officer is to identify locations that may not be getting the commercial speeds that are advertised and to report that back to the Department.  That process has been ongoing and has been quite successful.  There is good communication between the two Departments.</p><p>The process is very well understood.  In fairness to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, it came in and presented to a number of telecommunication action groups, TAGs, as to how to do that, how to understand where premises were and what type of premises they were.  That process is well understood and continues to this day.</p><p> The other point I would make is around the broadband connection points to which there have been a couple of references.  It is probably worth clarifying again.  As Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in said at the outset, broadband connection points were identified for the most rural locations.  Rather than those communities not having access to any high-speed broadband for the duration of the roll-out, the decision was taken to put access into those communities.  I have to say the response to date has been hugely positive.  We have close to 220 of those public access BCPs; there are different types but 220 of those are already live at this point in time.  Mr. Ryan and I were down on Clare Island on Friday and we heard brilliant stories coming out of that BCP.  For example, we heard of somebody who defended their dissertation via the BCP, we had a husband and wife team who have their own company and were working remotely from the centre in Clare Island throughout the process and we also heard from a number of students who were using the remote working centres throughout the period of Covid because that connectivity was there.  That is being replicated all across the country.  Without fail, it is a positive, good news story and the communities are delighted.</p><p> The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, launched the connected hubs call earlier this year.  We spent about &euro;10 million building up this national network of remote working hubs and BCPs and a good 40% to 50% of the money we have supported has been to upgrade BCPs.  We now have our portal and we are delivering activities across e-health, remote working and arts and culture.  For example, we have a film night coming up in December that is going to be run through the BCPs, we have taught people painting online using the BCPs and we have had uileann pipe training.  These are the kinds of activities that build communities.  Yes, we might only get one BCP in one county but, across the country, we are bringing a network together.</p><p> What we see very much for next year, as the deployment finishes on those public access BCPs, is that we are going to move into the next phase, which is very much about driving activity, in particular community activity.  I sat here last September and I said exactly the same thing, namely, the BCP is whatever the community needs that BCP to be.  For some, that will be remote working, and we will be doing training with Ludgate quite soon for all of those BCPs that want to pursue that, and for others it will be about social activities.  Even down on Clare Island, they have a festival every year and there is no reason they cannot broadcast that festival through the BCP to other BCPs.  Again, we are bringing new things and different things to these communities that would not otherwise be available.  It is a very positive story and all of the reports that are coming out are very positive.</p></speech>

I do not envy them, especially on the back of a lockdown, where people will say it is all their fault.  It is not.  This has caused huge delays.</p> <p>  I have to say the BCPs have been brilliant.  We have ten in Clare and we are getting one in my own village of Inagh, which is brilliant.  There are a few questions I want to ask.  How is the Department getting on with Eir and what is the relationship like?  Is it a co-operative relationship?  Is it slowing things down or is it progressive?  We have had issues where Eir has brought in fixed-line broadband very close to houses but they are not allowed to connect to it.  In my own case, I am 5 km from Eir fixed broadband and the NBI website tells me I will get it at Christmas 2023, which is not too bad.  When I talk to people in Ballyvaughan who are only 2 km from broadband, they have been told they will be waiting until the period between January 2025 and December 2026.  Are the logistics being done around trying to get as many done as possible for those who need it most?  I work from home and I have good broadband although, of course, I would love to have fibre broadband.  However, there are businesses like Gregans Castle Hotel in Ballyvaughan that have to pay &euro;450 per month, and they cannot go to a BCP to do their work as they have to have it in-house.  It seems an awfully long time to wait.  How does it take that long?</p> <p>  There are people who come together on the ground in communities.  In my own townland of Ballyea, we have 121 houses and we have surveyed them all.  They are all ready to go and we have fibre broadband very close to us.  Maybe it is much more complicated than I realise but it seems it is not very far away physically, so I do not understand what the big delay is, apart from Covid, which has definitely set things back.</p></speech>

Within the Department, we measure in terms of &ldquo;premises&rdquo;, and that is the word we use, but if we look down through the narrative, it repeatedly refers to &ldquo;households&rdquo;, &ldquo;businesses&rdquo; and &ldquo;schools&rdquo;.  The committee members are public representatives, so they are out there all of the time, meeting a very wide range of people and not just within their constituencies, so they cannot help but get it.  The two men in the room with me from the Department have been working on this for almost a decade and I am almost four years working on it.  As public servants working on a project like this, we cannot help but get the human impact of the absence of broadband.  It varies.  It could be educational, it could be that people are in the kind of household that uses the Internet just in their daily and social lives, it could be they are trying to run a business or it could be they cannot work where they want to work from and the opportunities are not there.  We get it.</p> <p>  The approach that has been taken to the national broadband plan is that nobody gets left behind.  We did not try to rank people on the basis of &ldquo;living more remotely&rdquo;, or &ldquo;further from&rdquo; or &ldquo;the cost of&rdquo;.  When we get to the most difficult to reach premises, there has to be a check in terms of the cost and an alternative strategy might be found.  However, the philosophy of the broadband plan is that it has to get to everybody and we treat everybody equally.</p> <p>  In terms of the deployment, if we had attempted to take an approach that said we will identify premises or locations that are deemed a higher priority, we would not be looking at a seven-year roll-out plan and I think we would be looking at a 15-year roll-out plan to get to the people at the end of it.  We might get to that 70% or 80% within the seven years but the last 30% would be awfully slow.  The approach that has been taken is not that far removed from the approach that was taken with the vaccine roll-out, when we went away from the very elderly people in nursing homes or health workers and it was done on an age basis.  The roll-out of the broadband plan is on a logical basis for rolling out a telecommunications network to the total of the deployment area that it has to reach.  It comes out of the exchanges it is building from and it then connects, basically, in a ring around where it has come out from.  Unfortunately, that means the reality is that in each deployment area we reach, there is a mix of people in terms of the value they will get from that broadband on day one, and in each deployment area that is at the end of the roll-out, there is a mix of people in terms of the value they will get from it.  There are a very significant of number of people in every deployment area whose day-to-day lives are negatively impacted on the basis of not being able to access a reliable service.</p> <p>  All I can say to the Senator is that in terms of the Department and the governance of the contract, we are very clear on what came out of the tendering process and the contract in terms of a seven-year build.  We are at a place today where there is a variety of circumstances, principally related to Covid and things we would expect to find in any mobilisation, that means National Broadband Ireland is about six months behind in that delivery.  For all of the engagement we have had with NBI, and NBI can speak for itself, it has said it believes it will deliver this inside seven years.  The Department will continue to work with it and to lean on it in terms of meeting that target but being ambitious in getting well short of that.  We do get it in terms of how important this is to people.  We will do our utmost to ensure the programme that has been committed to by National Broadband Ireland is delivered, and delivered on time.</p></speech>

We have a strong relationship with the major telecommunications operators in Ireland and engage with them on a range of issues.  I am clear that Eir is committed to seeing the national broadband plan delivered and to delivering its aspect of it.  I ask Mr. Neary to come in on the day-to-day engagement and talk about some of the complexities being faced.</p></speech>

One of the first steps of building that network is to indicate to Eir where it intends to reuse that infrastructure.  Eir then goes off and remediates and makes sure the poles and ducts are available and can be used for NBI's fibre.  An intensive exercise is happening between NBI and Eir on that basis.  There is a huge complexity to unblocking those ducts that have been there for many years and ensuring the poles are fit for purpose, a number of which would need to be replaced.  Eir has undertaken and committed to that huge exercise as part of NBI's delivery.  Ensuring that happens efficiently and well is a high focus for the whole project.  The NBI interface into Eir is a positive one.  They work through much of that detailed, high-volume and high-capacity complexity and are doing that day to day and week on week.  The output from that is, ultimately, the premises are passed with fibre.  NBI and Eir are working closely on that huge exercise.  The Senator asked why fibre is so close to her and she cannot get access.  I am assuming that is Eir's network and the question is why Eir cannot extend further.  Why it does not go any further than it has is a matter for Eir.  It has announced it is focusing on the urban suburban areas and will deploy a fibre network to that footprint.  That seems to be the priority for Eir at present.</p></speech>

One of the features of the BCP process, as everybody has spoken about, has been Covid.  The solution we have had to put in place changed completely due to the demand for remote working.  All of the BCPs connected these days are enabled for remote working facilities, including splitting it out to facilitate dedicated networks for individual companies.  We also quite deliberately supported those BCPs and remote working hubs through the connected hubs call.  If there is a demand for a specific solution, that can be accommodated within the BCP network.  I encourage contact with us.  We are more than happy to talk to the site managers.  One can talk to a local broadband officer because, we have accommodated that.  If there are people who do not have access to what they need, we can accommodate that through the BCP network.  There are some restrictions on the base offering.  It is sitting on a Government network, but we have accommodated specific offerings for individual companies.</p></speech>

Senator Garvey has mentioned much of what I wanted to speak about, which is businesses, especially rural business.  I have a number of problems with businesses within 500 m of fibre broadband but that cannot connect.  There is no doubt it is affecting their business and quality of life.  I appreciate the answer given to Senator Garvey that one cannot change the broadband schedule for that but it is affecting rural Ireland.  In Mullamast, just outside Athy, four businesses are on a road less than 500 m away from fibre broadband and they cannot connect or there is no possibility of them connecting.  Those businesses are being affected.  They cannot grow or provide rural employment.  Surely, there must be some way of looking at a case such as that in which important rural employment can be provided if fibre broadband was brought to those businesses.</p> <p>  There is great excitement in all areas when people see the signs going up that a survey is happening in their area, only to be told they are three, four or five years' away.  I appreciate an answer has been given to this question already but is there a way we can develop what is involved in a survey and a timeframe in order that such anticipation is dealt with?  It comes back on us as public representatives, in that when people see the signs going up, they believe they are within a short timeframe of receiving fibre broadband.  It is causing significant frustration in rural Ireland.  A local newsletter or leaflet drop in the area to explain exactly what is going on would help the situation.</p> <p>  I compliment the broadband officers in County Kildare, who I have dealt with on a regular basis.  How much availability is there for broadband connection points in rural areas?  I know community groups that are discussing this at the moment.  What help is there?  Is it true the broadband officer in the county should be the first point of call?  A number of local communities would benefit from a broadband connection point.  I have mentioned Kilkea and Castledermot before, a number of miles outside Athy, where even phone reception is poor, never mind broadband reception.  What can be done in developing and helping community groups?</p></speech>

What is the technical possibility of getting a point-to-point wireless connection from the neighbour?  What is the legal situation in that regard?  I ask Dr. O'Connor to respond to the last issue the Senator raised on mobile phone coverage and give us an update on what in God's name has happened to the mobile phone and broadband task force, which was supposed to be dealing with these issues.  Who wants to take the first question?</p></speech>

The first question was about the 500 m and the technical solutions.  We can give you an answer in terms of the potential technical solution, rather than saying that is a solution that can be applied to a set of circumstances in the national broadband plan.  The Senator makes a good comment on the communications on surveys.  We want to see areas being surveyed early and designs being developed because that gives us the confidence that when National Broadband Ireland is ready to move to the next stage, which involves making the network ready; tree trimming; unblocking ducts; putting up new poles and laying fibre, all of that preparatory work is done.  It is the case because of the volume of surveys which have been carried out to date that surveys have been carried out for premises that will not be connected for a couple of years.  The communications around that is certainly something we can take away and look at.</p> <p>  At a general level in terms of those areas which are 500 m from fibre broadband, if one brings it back from 500 m, some areas which are adjacent to commercial premises will fall into the category of being part of the NBI build.  It is where the two networks will meet, but some of them will likely be a part of what National Broadband Ireland is considering.  It has to deliver the full solution to the contract.  It has gone to a tender and engaged with commercial operators on where they could potentially help.  Some of that might come into that conversation.  As for the task force, we can all speak on that issue and I may come back to it later in any event.</p><p>Dr. O'Connor will deal with the general point on BCPs.  Mr. Neary will speak about the more technical solution. </p></speech>

When the NBI defines an area it is going to, the next premises down the road will see fibres come within a certain distance of it that will not go any further.  The main strategy is to make sure that NBI can deliver this as quickly as possible to all premises.</p> <p>  NBI has looked at whether commercial fibre can be extended out so that those premises are served.  Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in alluded to the fact that NBI went to the market to see what solutions are available.  There was a high level of interest from the market that was shortlisted down to five providers.  NBI is hopeful it can run pilots next year whereby it can extend commercial fibre to premises that are very adjacent to those who already have it.  That is certainly something that is on the cards that it is trying to investigate.  It includes not just the extension of existing commercial fibre but alternative technology as well, such as, potentially, wireless and other technologies.  A body of work is definitely being conducted by the NBI to investigate that.</p> <p>  From the point-to-point perspective, there are providers in the market today that provide point-to-point wireless connections.  A number of these businesses might rely on that at present or, if they do not, are certainly investigating it, if they see the NBI roll-out is a number of years away.</p></speech>

This person is on the fibre network and a commercial business that requires broadband is within 400 m of him or her, by line of sight.  It is technically possible to put a point-to-point connection from the back door of that older person's house to the front door of the commercial premises.  Is it possible for that older person to buy a 500 Mbps contract with Eir or some other provider and then provide a wireless connection to his or her premises?</p></speech>

Kildare is probably one of the counties with the fewest BCPs.  It only has three BCPs, all of which are connected and live at this point.  Our focus is on closing off the BCP discovery process because we have been through at least two, if not three, iterations of BCP discovery with the local authorities.  Our intention is to, hopefully, close out that build phase by the end of the year.  That is what we are all collectively working towards.</p> <p>  We see that we have the connected hubs call, which comes in behind all of these facilities.  One of the things we are looking at in the context of next year is opening up the BCP network to new BCPs.  We will not necessarily provide people with connectivity, but we will give them a means of getting it.  They can take the benefit of being part of the BCP network and can have access to all those services we will run through it, but they will be also able to draw down funding via the connected hubs call.  In the first instance, therefore, if communities are interested in joining the BCP network they should approach the broadband officer.  That is the mechanism by which we would see them coming into the network next year. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.746" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021102000002#L00700"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v wants to come back in and there may be other members who also want to.  I will ask a couple of questions because I am going to the House later and would not like the officials to miss out on them.  Will somebody give us an update on what is happening at EU level?  The basic high-speed broadband definition at EU level at the moment is 30 Mbps per second.  None of us believes that is high-speed broadband.  When I was Minister, I pushed hard to get that definition increased to 100 Mbps per second.  I understand there is ongoing engagement between the Commission and member states on this, so I ask for an update on it.</p> <p>  On a positive aspect, last December, when the officials were before the committee, I raised the issue of broadband connections to marts around the country, explained the difficulties marts were having and gave a list of those I identified where there were specific problems.  In fairness, the officials came up trumps with 11 of them, including the mart in Castlerea where there was very poor broadband service, which is a very positive development.</p> <p>  Mr. h&Oacute;b&aacute;in referenced on a number of occasions that the Covid-19 pandemic has been a big part of the problem in the failure to deliver this year.  As I said in my opening remarks, the planned build next year is just 800 homes more per month than this year, despite the projection that we will not have the issues related to Covid-19 next year.  It just does not add up that there is big problem with Covid-19 this year and yet we are only able to deliver 800 homes more next year when we do not expect a problem with Covid.  I have gone through the transcripts from the Committee of Public Accounts and the Department of the Environment, Transport and Communications, in addition to the evidence we have heard this morning, and Eir does not seem to have a problem with Covid-19.  It has achieved its make-ready target and gone beyond it for this year.  How is it that one telecommunications company has been able to achieve its targets for delivery of the national broadband plan on the make-ready target despite Covid, yet the reason NBI has given for not meeting its targets is the issue of Covid?  If Covid has been such a problem in terms of teams on the ground, was this ever communicated to the HSE?  The HSE specifically established teams to look at serious infection rates in meat plants.  I scrutinised this in a lot of detail in relation to various outbreaks and not once did I hear of any of the public health teams throughout the country talking about a problem with telecommunications companies.  Will the officials clarify that for me? </p> <p>  I received a tweet from an individual this morning, to which Mr. Neary might respond.  It states that this individual is just finding out that he or she cannot have NBI fibre and a landline telephone.  Apparently, NBI connections do not support the two.  The mobile phone reception for this person is not good at home and he or she really relies on a landline.  Will Mr. Neary provide an answer to that?</p> <p>  On the issue of communications, Mr. Neary spoke about the example in Castleplunket and said that NBI works on the best information it has available to it.  Last week, I furnished details of a case of a constituent of mine to Mr. Neary, who this summer received correspondence from NBI stating that he or she would be connected to the high-speed fibre network by this autumn.  This person has now received a further communication stating that it will be a further five years, 2026, before he or she will get it.  In this instance, the surveys and the design were completed.  The design was completed months before my constituent got this particular correspondence.  The best information available to the company was not reflected in the communication to this individual.  This is just one example.  I can bring Mr. Neary to communities in south Roscommon, east Galway and mid-Roscommon that have received similar correspondence from NBI.  What exactly is going on with the communications strategy?</p> <p>  Mr. Neary said that the contractor will go as far as it can where it is technically possible to do so.  What is the limit of that technical possibility?</p><p>SACs and so forth have been mentioned but what is the technical limit of the build-out?<br/><br/>The core of the problem is that Covid-19 is not the single biggest factor causing the problems and delays.  All we have to do is look at what the T&aacute;naiste said to me in the House last week, and said in the House two weeks before that.  He flagged there was a problem in getting permission to erect poles.  That is a problem from local authorities across the country.<br/><br/>I received a reply on 14 October to a parliamentary question regarding the mobile phone and broadband task force, which was established to deal with these problems where there was a lack of connection between telecommunications companies, local authorities and other State and semi-State agencies.  Bizarrely, that task force sat for the last time the month before the contract was signed.  In the reply of 14 October, we were told a joint utilities local authority user forum was being used to address the problems between local authorities and the contractor.  Why were guidelines issued by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage in August and why did the Minister bring the planning officers together last May if this forum was already working?  My understanding, and Dr. O'Connor can correct me if I am wrong, is that the County and City Management Association, CCMA, has written to the Department asking that the task force be re-established.  That association obviously believes there is a problem, if it is seeking the re-establishment of a task force that has not sat in the last two years.  <br/><br/>The Secretary General of the Department in evidence before the Committee of Public Accounts last week said one of the three original contractors, the UK-based Kelly Group, decided not to do work here and that left us high and dry with the delivery of 140,000 km of cable.  How big a factor has the Kelly Group's decision not to take up that contract been?  What action is being taken to recoup some of the costs resulting from that?<br/><br/>The task force was abandoned in October 2019.  The contract was signed in November 2019.  The programme for Government was published in June 2020 and promised to fast-track the national broadband plan.  The Government's remote working strategy stating it wanted to prioritise the delivery of the broadband plan was published in January 2021.  The guidelines issued by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage happened 21 months after the contract was signed, 14 months after the commitment was given in the programme for Government and eight months after the remote working strategy was published.  I understand there is a new agreement between National Broadband Ireland and Eir on fast-tracking the make ready programme.  Why has it taken 23 months since the signing of the original contract for this review to take place, given that 16 months ago, a clear commitment was given in the programme for Government to look at fast-tracking it and the remote working strategy was published ten months ago?<br/><br/>I know there has been a problem with Irish Rail.  Fibre cable has gone as far as Irish Rail and will not go under or over the rail line.  I understand there is now an agreement in place with CI&Eacute;, 23 months after the contract was signed, 16 months after the commitment to fast-track this in the programme for Government and ten months after the remote working strategy was published.  We have, in terms of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, a trial taking place in Blessington concerning anomalies there in accessing the licensing and infrastructure.  That is 22 months after the contract was signed, 15 months after the commitment in the programme for Government and nine months after the remote working strategy.  There is clearly a lack of joined-up thinking between Government, State agencies, semi-State bodies and local authorities.  One mechanism that could have dealt with much of this was the task force that was established specifically to do that and was stood down the month before the contract was signed.  It is not just me coming up with this interpretation.  The CCMA believes the same thing or it would not have requested that this be re-established.  The Chairman of the communications committee, Deputy O'Donnell, said last month:</p><blockquote>	...it would appear that one of the areas that probably requires a bit of tightening up is ... to get [the] road opening [and] planning licences [streamlined] through the local authorities.  </blockquote><p>The answer from National Broadband Ireland is that if &quot;dedicated resources within each local authority [could be put in place to] handle our licence applications and [processes] in a timely fashion, it would be of great benefit to us in attempting to complete this plan in less than ... seven years&quot;.  The witnesses have been aware of the problems for two years.  Why has the task force not been re-established?  Why have these issues been left to drag on?  As a result of that, 75,000 homes must wait for longer.  If the witnesses could address those issues, I would appreciate it.  They are the issues to which the public wants answers.  Members of the public want to know there is joined-up thinking across Departments, Government agencies and bodies to deliver this because it is a basic piece of infrastructure that every citizen wants and should have the right to receive as quickly as is humanly possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.748" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021102000002#M00300"><p>The Chair has given views on a range of points and asked a number of questions.  I will focus on the questions.  I will start from the bottom up with two points.  In his opening remark, the Chair referenced Covid and said it was being blamed and used as an excuse.  He also questioned whether Covid was a reason for the delays.  I have to deal with that upfront.  Covid was the most significant reason and has had the greatest impact on the national broadband plan being six months behind.  That is not an excuse; it is just a reality.  We have lived through a pandemic and it has impacted every business in the State and how it operates.</p> <p>  The Chair is correct that telecommunications was a service that was allowed to continue through Covid but Mr. Mulligan already has outlined some of the issues and challenges around recruitment, mobilisation of key contractors, supply chain and logistic delays.  The Chair mentioned the Kelly contractor.  It has been replaced but there is an immediate impact of not having one of the key contractors there.  There were travel restrictions in Ireland.  These people have to be on the road building networks and surveying. They would normally be staying in hotels and bed and breakfasts.  They could not, so journey times are longer.  The recruitment process took longer.  Can the Chair imagine if a group of us here today tried to do a redesign of something we were involved in, like NBI was trying to do in designing a network, and having to do that over Zoom as opposed to at a whiteboard?  It was a difficult time.  It is not an excuse or a question of blame.  It is stating a reason.  It is a matter of fact that Covid has impacted.</p> <p>  Looking to the year ahead, the impact continues because things that did not happen in that first period impact on timelines for the next period.  As for the number that is there for next year, NBI has stated it is 130,000 to 144,000.  The Department will challenge every aspect of what NBI submits to it in the coming weeks in relation to what it can deliver next year.  As Mr. Mulligan has outlined, where relief is granted it can be granted, but delays are delays.</p><p>I am not going to prejudge what will come to us or what the outcome of the Department's assessment of that will be but the assessment will be the same as it was in 2021, namely, an intensive scrutiny of what NBI put forward as being the reality of the world it faced and the challenge that it faced.  The Chairman has offered a view but I must defend and assert that the team of people from the Department who looked at the issue did their job and did it well.  They had external advisers to assist them where the technical, financial or commercial expertise was not available in-house and we used people in-house as well.  I must stand over the job that was done and say that they came up with the right decision on that.  They were hard in their engagement and scrutiny of what was before them and will continue to be so.</p><p> The Chairman referenced the task force.  He obviously feels quite strongly about it.  I am aware that he has a history in relation to its establishment.  Reflecting back on what the task force was established for, it was very much in advance of the National Broadband Plan, NBP.  It was when Ireland was in a procurement process for a national broadband plan and there was not a company there to deliver that plan that could engage for itself in terms of what it was going to need to do.  The task force was very effective and delivered over 70 actions over three years.  It had a much longer life in that period than had been anticipated because the procurement took longer than any of us wanted.  </p><p> The Chairman is correct to state that the task force last meet in October 2019.  There might be a perception out there that people have done nothing since and the work has not continued; it absolutely has.  One of the core issues that the task force focused on was access to infrastructure, the licensing regime with local authorities and developing contributions, and it took actions that were successful.  However, after the international broadband contract was signed, the world had moved to a new place, where we were not talking about doing things in advance of a potential contract that the Government might agree to; we were talking about the implementation of a contract that the Government had signed.  If the Chairman is looking for evidence of action, the contract was signed on 19 November 2019.  One day later, the CCMA had its regular quarterly meeting with the Department.  At those meetings, those at CEO level of local authorities meet the Secretary General of the Department and the assistant secretaries general responsible for specific areas.  There is a four- or five-item agenda.  One day after the contract was signed, the national broadband plan was on the agenda for that meeting.  It has been on the agenda for every meeting the Department has had with the CCMA since.</p><p> Colleagues in the Department of Rural and Community Development managed the telecoms advisory group.  That group met on 13 December 2019.  It met nine times in 2020, has met seven times in 2021, and I believe it is meeting tomorrow.  Our Departments work together through that group.  As the committee has already heard today, National Broadband Ireland uses that group as a conduit for the transfer of information back and forth with the local authorities.  Every local authority is represented by the broadband officers.</p><p> The section 254 licences were recognised as being a critical issue, which has been raised by National Broadband Ireland.  In the early days of the engagement, we pressed National Broadband Ireland as hard as they might be pressing the State today in terms of its level of performance, in that we were pressing them to ensure they had the team in place with the right skill sets and the right bandwidth to deal with every local authority in Ireland, which have a range of other projects coming at them as well.  I believe that today, National Broadband Ireland has that team in place.  Guidance was developed by the Departments, working in conjunction with the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, the CCMA, the Roads Management Office, RMO, and the broadband officers.  The two Departments that are represented here today and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage were involved in bilateral meetings.  There was extensive engagement there.  That culminated in new guidance being delivered to all local authorities and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, addressing a conference with senior representatives of every local authority in May of last year, just when the build programme was taking off and at the time when section 254 applications were going to become live.  The number of such applications received to date are not as high as they will be in the next year, so that guidance is critical.</p><p> Since the guidance was put in place, a steering group was established, which involves our Department, National Broadband Ireland, the CCMA and the RMO.  Effectively, it is a troubleshooting house to deal with issues that arise, because we know that when you get down to individual areas there will always be unforeseen issues that will crop up.</p><p> I must push back very hard against any contention that the work of the task force has not continued.  Even when you step outside of the actual broadband space, from May 2020, the power of the work of the task force was that it brought national Departments, State bodies, local authorities, telecommunications companies and regulators together.  That has continued.  When we found ourselves in a pandemic where people without good broadband were going to have to rely on mobile broadband and when there was an immediate spike of more than 40% in voice traffic and 20% in data traffic and networks could potentially be challenged, actions were taken there.  Our Department worked with the telecommunications companies and with ComReg.  It also worked with the Department of Education on issues in that space.  The work that the task force began has been powerful.  The relationship and the collaboration, which it has instilled as a way of working in Ireland, has continued.</p><p> In terms of the actual forum itself, the two Departments are at a very advanced stage of developing a work programme to put to the Ministers to agree for the next phase of the work of the task force.  However, the fundamental point I wish to make is that in terms of the NBP and its roll-out, there is nothing that would have been achieved with a task force meeting.  In fact, the energy that was invested in what I have just described and in new engagements, which were more appropriate to circumstances where there was a contract in place rather than a potential for a broadband plan, has actually been a powerful tool in ensuring that we are as far advanced as we are with the plan today.</p><p> I am conscious that the Chairman raised a number of other questions, which we should go back over.  I will deal with one of them.  He referenced the EU definition of state aid.  We are interested in that from the perspective that we may find ourselves having completed the commercial roll-out of the NBP plan that I have described, and with an ambition of gigabit broadband in Ireland.  There may be dots around our country and we may need to consider how we might deal with them.  We are interested in that.  Principally, the issue for Ireland is more the digital compass, which is that gigabit ambition, which is where we are going.</p><p> I welcome the Chairman's positive commentary around the marts.  Perhaps Mr. Neary might respond on the landline issue and Mr. Mulligan might speak to the communications strategy.  I believe I have covered most of the Chair's points, but if we have missed any of them, he can come back to us.  I am aware that he is due in the Chamber.</p></speech>

That can be used by a service provider to provide, say, a voice over Internet protocol service, but primarily, it is a broadband connection.

ComReg looked after the all the porting of numbers to mobile and fixed-line services. As I understand it, the landline service is the same as the mobile service.  For example, if you were to change from Vodafone to Three, you would keep your number; the same applies for landlines.</p><p>What Mr. Neary can confirm is that National Broadband Ireland offers under the contract a voice service as well as a broadband service.  Obviously, it has to put in the fibre cable first but once it is in, you can buy a landline service if your retail provider offers it.  What I would question in respect of the person who queried that is from whom he or she asked to buy the landline service.  The retailer may not have offered that service, but there are now 23 retailers selling over NBI's network and the majority of them offer a landline service and will send customers out their own handsets.  National Broadband Ireland does an in-house service not only for Wi-Fi but also for voice.  It is all available and will be the equivalent to what people got over copper, although it will be a lot cheaper.  With the landline, when you got only a voice service you paid a rental fee of maybe &euro;30 or &euro;40 a month for just the voice service.  Now you will pay &euro;30, &euro;40 or &euro;50 a month for broadband and voice, so it will be a much cheaper solution for voice and broadband.</p><p> I will take up the point about the communications strategy.  It is difficult when you are dealing with 540,000 premises.  The issue National Broadband Ireland faced on the communications front was that, with the best will in the world, as Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in said, 99% or probably more of premises are staying in their deployment areas.  You can send them out feet on the street, that is, people to tell them when the service is expected.  You can give them leaflets saying a survey is happening there.  NBI is very clear that if a survey is happening in your area, you are probably at least 12 months away from getting a fibre broadband connection.  NBI can do all that but there are anomalies whereby the infrastructure is not there in that deployment area or it makes sense to move those few premises into the next deployment area.  Then, in fairness to the communications people in National Broadband Ireland, they pull their hair out because they have just told Johnny Murphy he will get the service next year but he will now not get it until two years' time.  It is a problem, but I think Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in made the point that you cannot really bring everything down to the lowest common denominator whereby if there is one problem, no one will be communicated with as to when they will get the service.  We could have decided last year that nobody should be told anything about when they will get connected.  We all agree that that is not the best outcome.  There will be 1%, maybe, of people who will be very frustrated, like the examples the Chairman has given us, and that will continue because, unfortunately, the only way to solve that problem is not to tell anybody anything, and that is not a good outcome.  I will bring the matter back to NBI and it will work on it.  The question is how we fix that anomaly in order to defuse that frustration a small number of people feel while not preventing us from telling the mass market what is happening.  It is a problem every utility provider faces.  This is done by Eircode postcode.  There are 2.3 million of them in the State.  It is hard to get every one of them right, and we will just have to work around that.</p></speech>

It comes back to the question I asked earlier about the physical limits on the build.  This family is less than 500 m down the road from where the current build completes.</p></speech>

When NBI did the surveys it found that the infrastructure is being fed from an exchange in the opposite direction from those homes.  It has nothing to do with the technical reach of the technology or anything like that.  It is that the pole and duct infrastructure feeding that area is coming from a different location.  When NBI did the high-level design it assumed it was coming, say, from east to west; when it did the survey it found that the infrastructure it anticipated to be there was actually not and was coming from west to east.  We have looked at a lot of these cases.  Typically, a very small number are moved in a deployment area but, unfortunately, the solution, if you want to be more accurate, is to wait until that analysis is concluded, but you are then very close to the start of the deployment.  For 99% of people it will not have an impact, but there is that 1% that will be impacted.</p></speech>

I know that Covid-19 was a difficulty.  I do dispute, however, what he says about the re-establishment of the task force.  I think it would have made a difference.  The key difference it would have made is that there would have been a Minister leading that task force, which was the case in the past.  As anyone who has been involved in the task force knows, it made a significant difference in moving issues along.  That is not an issue for Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in and is above his remit but I just wanted to put that on the record.</p></speech>

In this case NBI advises that the connection date is January 2025.  The person concerned then went to Eir.  What they are getting at the moment is a service of between 0 Mbps and 8 Mbps and it is costing &euro;69 a month.  The Eir engineers have confirmed that there is a fibre broadband pole only 125 m away from the premises.  The person has given me the number of the pole, which I will not read out because it might identify where they are or who they are.  A neighbouring house - I have the Eircode postcodes of the premises - is connected to fibre broadband.</p> <p>  These are my questions.  Can NBI ask Eir to deal with this case and cases like it, rather than waiting for the big NBI build-out?  Second, unless NBI does ask Eir, is Eir precluded from encroaching on the NBI area?  My understanding was that it cannot encroach since it got a last chance saloon to say what it would cover commercially and then it was not allowed to cherry-pick after that.  Is it the case that NBI could ask Eir but that Eir cannot just unilaterally walk in and say it has changed its mind, there is bigger pick-up and it will cover the area?  I have two other points on that.  The point-to-point solution would seem to be a possibility in such cases, going to the nearest house and asking whether point-to-point will be allowed.  Can the witnesses confirm that?</p> <p>  I have one final question.  I have dealt with cases - and the Department has been helpful, in fairness - in which areas that were included in the Eir or in the commercial roll-out were, as Mr. Neary said, subsequently found not to be getting a 30 Mbps service and were transferred to NBI.  If NBI is taking those extra houses on board, is there any chance it could offload a similar number of houses adjacent to Eir areas back to Eir and get them done by Eir in order that NBI and the State would not wind up with an extra load and that what the Department was told would be covered would be covered by a swap basis?</p> <p>  There are basically three questions there.  I look forward to getting the list of the marts and the criteria by which they were selected.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Neary to come in on point-to-point if he wishes to expand further on what I say about this.  I will take the second question first.  It was about preclusion from encroachment.  There is no prohibition on any commercial operator building anywhere in Ireland.  What the mapping exercise sought to do was to understand where commercial operators had high-speed broadband and where they intended to go in order that the State would go only to the remaining areas.  That concluded just before the contract was signed in 2019.  There is a risk and a reward.  If a commercial operator decides to build out in the intervention area, those homes will be connected more quickly to high-speed broadband, potentially, and there will be a risk to the commercial case for the national broadband plan if those homes would cost less to get to but give revenues.  However, there is no prohibition.</p> <p>  As to whether NBI could engage with Eir to deal with specific premises, it is in a process at the moment.  It could do so only by an open procurement methodology.</p><p>It has gone to the market, identified the types of issue where it could seek the assistance of commercial operators, and sought expressions of interest.  It is halfway through that process.  It has received the expressions of interest at the first phase and is working its way through the process.  I cannot say whether the scenario the Deputy outlined will be one of those that NBI could-----</p></speech>

That is as much as I want to cover, though.</p> <p>  There is no prohibition on encroachment.  There is a process.  Mr. Neary might speak about the details of that process and then point-to-point.</p></speech>

One of the scenarios is exactly what the Deputy represented, that being, if Eir or another commercial operator's fibre is going past a particular home, can NBI extend it to address that home?  Five companies have been shortlisted as part of the process.  NBI is anticipating that it will start piloting the implementation of solutions for scenarios like that early next year.  If the pilot is successful, it could be rolled out to a greater number.  It could potentially include point-to-point solutions from wireless solutions.  Where the best and most feasible solution to a scenario in the shorter term is point-to-point from a wireless provider and if there is an opportunity to do so, then that will be on the table through the process in question.</p></speech>

To be clear on the figures, fewer than 17,000 premises have been fully passed and the target for the end of the year is 60,000.  Is that 60,000 premises where order or pre-order is available or 60,000 that have been fully passed?  What is the target for fully passed premises by the end of the year?  Did the initial target of 115,000 have to do with being fully passed or just ready for pre-order?</p> <p>  People have received emails telling them they can pre-order for the autumn but have since found out that they cannot get access until 2023.  I used Castleplunket as an example, as did the Chairman.  Castleplunket is a small village and people there have been given a date of 2026 whereas the resident to whom I spoke was told 2023, so I am not sure how that works.  Infrastructural issues and other issues can come about - that is acceptable - but surely they will have been identified during the survey or build stage or, preferably, before people are told they can pre-order or order between August and October of 2021.  The issues should be identified before the email offers go out.</p> <p>  I was contacted by one business person and two residents in Ahascragh whose speeds were approximately 12 Mbps to 15 Mbps even though, when they put in their Eircode postcodes, they are told they are in a 30 Mbps area and are not included in the roll-out.  They have sent me screenshots of upload speeds of 2.8 Mbps and download speeds of 14.3 Mbps.  There is clearly a major issue and I doubt that Ahascragh is the only area affected.  I can provide the witnesses with the Eircode postcodes.  Will they undertake to examine the matter?</p></speech>

Does Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in wish to answer her questions?</p></speech>

We will take away the Eircode matter with us.  I am happy to look at it.</p> <p>  Regarding this year's target, it is 60,000 homes passed.  That means available to order.  The order and pre-order emails are tools used to give people an indication that broadband will be coming to them in a couple of months' time.  They allow people to make plans and to consider which retailers to buy from.</p></speech>

That will be 2025 or 2026.  I have not examined the case of Castleplunket specifically, but I expect it is the same scenario.  When someone goes to NBI's website and signs up for regular updates, he or she is given an initial indication of the time that he or she will be able to pre-order or order.  At the start of the summer, NBI gave people a view of that process over the seven-year build period.  Up to June of this year, if people were not in the immediate 18-month timeline, they were told they were in a later stage of the deployment.  In June, they were given a further indication of whether the date would be 2024, 2025 or 2026.  I expect someone got an initial email based on the information that was available at the time.  When NBI completed the low-level designs and sequencing of deployment in respect of that premises, it triggered an updated letter to the individual to the effect that the deployment schedule was now 2023.</p> <p>  I would appreciate it if the Deputy gave us the Ahascragh Eircodes.  We will happily undertake an investigation.  Quite a number of people come to us with queries on the availability of broadband in their areas.  We successfully address the majority of those queries with the commercial operators in question.</p></speech>

Today is an engagement with the chairperson-designate of the DAA and a discussion of his strategic priorities for the role, as well as his views on the challenges facing the organisation.  On behalf of the committee I welcome the chairperson designate, Mr. Basil Geoghegan, and the chief communications officer of the DAA, Mr. Kevin Cullinane.  They are both very welcome.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if a statement is potentially inflammatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus.  They may not benefit from the same level of immunity to legal proceedings that a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be also mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting, members and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee or to join the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member partaking via Microsoft Teams, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If attending in the committee room, you are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect yourself and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  I strongly advise the practice of good hand hygiene and to leave at least one vacant seat between you and others attending.  One should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  </p></speech>

I will take this opportunity to bring members up to date on DAA.</p> <p>  Since I was first appointed, we have had two very different 18-month periods.  The first was one of continued growth, breaking ground on the new runway and planning for the future.  The second half saw the impact of Covid-19 and was completely different in an unprecedented and challenging way.  We saw a thriving global business shrink back to levels last seen more than 30 years ago and incur substantial financial losses of &euro;284 million in 2020 alone.  Many difficult decisions and extensive cost-saving measures had to be implemented.  I have been immensely proud of our people and the resilience and support they have shown for each other.  They have kept our airports operational throughout the pandemic and facilitated our customers and passengers throughout the varying lockdowns and restrictions of the past 18 months.  In the early period of Covid-19, they ensured delivery of personal protective equipment and other critical supplies.  Globally, they helped our international travel retail business, Aer Rianta International, and our advisory and airport management consultancy services business, DAA International, both of which have exceptional reputations in their respective sectors.</p> <p>  After a very long period of travel restrictions, DAA is now firmly focused on catching up with other countries.  We are working with the airlines and tourism authorities to reconnect Ireland to the world.  We also welcome the help of the Government&rsquo;s aviation package as announced in last week's budget.  As we look to rebuild our business, we are keenly aware and hugely supportive of the Government&rsquo;s climate action ambitions.  We already have a strong track record and Dublin and Cork airports both outperformed the public sector energy efficiency target in 2020, achieving an estimated 55% reduction in Dublin and 52% in Cork.  Dublin Airport is the first airport in Ireland to achieve carbon-neutral status following an extensive programme of activities to reduce and offset its carbon emissions in recent years.  Our priority is to become a European airport leader in sustainability by 2030 and to achieve net zero emissions at our airports by 2050.</p> <p>  We have a commercial mandate funded from a combination of own resources and through borrowings in international financial markets.  Between 2016 and 2019, the group delivered a return of &euro;125 million in dividends to the Exchequer.  We are keen to ensure that we can continue to pay our own way.  To achieve this, Dublin Airport, as the group's largest revenue engine, urgently requires a regulatory decision that properly reflects the reality of our present circumstances and addresses the unsustainably low level of airport charges that currently pertain.</p> <p>  Given the scale and severity of the crisis, it was clear from the earliest stages that the Commission for Aviation Regulation&rsquo;s 2019 price determination for Dublin Airport, which set the airport's pricing out to 2024 based on record levels of traffic and had stipulated a significant 18.5% reduction in airport charges for 2020, had effectively been rendered void.  As a result, Dublin Airport found itself facing into the crisis with a fundamentally flawed pricing structure, resulting in airport charges that were disproportionately low when compared with its European peers.</p> <p>  What started pre-Covid as an unfortunate mispricing, transferring value from the Irish taxpayer to airlines, became a fundamental issue for the future provision of airport infrastructure.  It is incomprehensible to me that following the greatest and most prolonged plunge in air travel in history, of a magnitude many multiples of that seen post 11 September, 2001, that our already reduced charges per passenger are still based on air traffic forecasts from 2019 when Dublin Airport welcomed 32.9 million passengers.  Despite repeated requests, the now departing regulator has not taken any decisive action whatsoever to address the position.  This is a grossly unsustainable position given our financial circumstances.  It puts at risk our ability to deliver the high-quality day-to-day service expected at our airports.  It puts at risk our ability to deliver critical airport infrastructure to support connectivity and it makes it almost impossible to deliver our sustainability ambitions and meet Government targets for our sector.</p> <p>  Airlines and airports have moved decisively and at speed in response to the pandemic-induced crisis, yet almost 20 months after this crisis began there has been no change to charges that were predicated on five times the passenger volumes delivered to date this year.  Under new legislation, the responsibilities of the Commission for Aviation Regulation will imminently be subsumed within a newly constituted Irish Aviation Authority.  It is critical that the new regime immediately establishes a fit for purpose price cap for 2022 that reflects current market conditions.  Our business simply cannot countenance a third year of enforced below-cost prices and regulatory inaction.</p> <p>  We also need a full and considered regulatory review process for subsequent years because if the past two decades have taught us anything, it is that aviation is enormously exposed to peaks and troughs, cycles and shocks.</p><p>Investment in such an environment is critically reliant on regulatory certainty and agility facilitating very long-term decision-making.  This is not simply a matter concerning Dublin Airport.  It must be linked to Government policy and the needs of Ireland as an economy and place to live.  In this context, we welcome the addition of a statutory requirement for the regulator to take account of Government policies on aviation, climate change and sustainable development as part of its determinations for the future.  It will be key that this facilitates decisions that enable us to meet the sustainability challenge. </p><p> Taking a long-term view and ensuring the delivery of critical strategic infrastructure is at the core of our mandate.  In this context, the new north runway, which will come into operation next year, will facilitate connectivity for decades to come.  We are fully engaged in the process to amend two problematic planning conditions attached to the runway&rsquo;s planning permission.  It is now important that the statutory process reaches a speedy conclusion and that we do not see unintended curtailment of operations at Dublin Airport as a result of procedural delays, even as we seek to rebuild connectivity post Covid.  I am also pleased to report that the team is making great progress on the runway reconstruction works at Cork Airport, which will reopen at the end of the month.  I acknowledge the capital support from Government for this project. </p><p> Regarding complementary infrastructure by other parties, it is concerning that progress on projects such as MetroLink seems to be stalling.  In my view, the delivery of MetroLink is essential for sustainable public transport to and from Dublin Airport and it should be prioritised. </p><p> In summary, if Ireland wants a full-service, passenger focused and fully sustainable capital city airport that complies with Government targets, the regulatory regime needs to adapt immediately.  The procrastination needs to stop now, so that Dublin Airport can continue to be a sustainable and passenger focused international gateway for Ireland&rsquo;s foreign direct investment, tourism and trade. </p><p> Let me conclude by assuring the committee that I view this opportunity to be re-appointed as chairman and to work with the shareholders, fellow board members, the executive team and staff of DAA at this critical time as both a great challenge and a great honour.  I thank the committee for the invitation to appear today.  I am happy to address any questions members may have. </p></speech>

I congratulate Mr. Cullinane on his appointment as group head of communications and I wish him well.  He served the DAA and Cork Airport with distinction during his tenure in Cork.  In filling the shoes of Paul O'Kane, who we thank for his service, Mr. Geoghegan has appointed a very good person.</p> <p>  The Chairman will not be surprised if I wear a parochial hat for a while.  Notwithstanding the very refreshing opening statement by Mr. Geoghegan, which recognised that Dublin is the largest revenue engine for the DAA, it is important that arising from today's meeting we have a full debate on aviation policy with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton.  I found Mr. Geoghegan's opening statement brilliant.  Let me add that I woke up this morning to what he said on "Morning Ireland", which was challenging, but we will come back to that.  I have every confidence in Mr. Geoghegan.  I have watched him in his role and he is doing a good job.  He has steered the DAA through the crisis and will now steer it, hopefully, on to recovery.  As chair of the board, he is very committed, along with the board, to the regrowth of aviation as evidenced by his opening statement and his actions. </p> <p>  From a Cork perspective, and Mr. Geoghegan alluded to it in his opening statement, I thank the DAA for its investment of more than &euro;40 million in Cork, including the runway, electrical substation, hold baggage screening and capital projects.  Unlike what was said on "Prime Time" last week, it is not a maintenance job but a &euro;40 million project that will need significant investment in the future.  In the context of the appointment of Mr. Cullinane as the group head of communications at the DAA, I ask that the board fills the vacancy in Cork immediately.  We need a communications manager in Cork Airport to sell and promote it.  I hope this role will not be subsumed into part of the DAA because Mr. Cullinane did a tremendous job in Cork and we need that job filled as soon as possible. </p> <p>  I was a reluctant participant in Cork staying within the DAA, but I am now glad it is there.  I say that as someone who pushed for Cork's separation from it.  We are better placed within the DAA.  We have become the fastest growing, and the second largest, airport in the country with 1 million more passengers than Shannon, but that is not what today is about.  The Cork Airport Development Council has played a pivotal role in our airport.  I am disappointed that the DAA has nobody from Cork on its board with the exception of one worker-director, Eric Nolan, who is doing a tremendous job.  It is imperative that a representative from the region of Cork is on the board of the DAA.  Mr. Geoghegan knows the numbers who are on the board.  We have been well served in the past by P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, Ann-Marie O'Sullivan and, in recent times, Gerry Walsh.  They are people of calibre and stature.  It is incredible there is no one from Cork on the board.  I know it is not Mr. Geoghegan's fault, but I ask that he supports my call that there would be personnel and people of suitable eminence from Cork on the board.</p> <p>  I will make two final points and come back at the end.  Transatlantic routes worked with Norwegian Air.  I hope that under European tenders we will see the return of transatlantic routes to Cork Airport.  In the context of connectivity, we have had a major debate on public service obligation, PSO, levies in recent times.  Under the cross-border aviation PSO in the Stormont Agreement, we should develop a Cork-Belfast route with a PSO attached.  I ask for Mr. Geoghegan's support, and that of the board, in pursuit of that.  If we are talking about connectivity on our island, then Cork-Belfast straddles both ends of the country and a Cork-Belfast route would be a tremendous asset to our airport.  Will Mr. Geoghegan expand a little more on his comments on the issue of pricing and his remarks on the need for the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, to make a regulatory decision? </p></speech>

I noted certain points he made regarding the communications manager etc. at Cork.  I will pick up on the main thrust of his question.  I noted, and I am sure it was a slip of the tongue, that he referred to the Dublin Airport Authority.  I remind everyone that we are the DAA and we have a broader mandate.  Indeed, pre-Covid, I was lucky enough to get down to Cork, where we had a board meeting and I met many members of the advisory council, which was great.</p> <p>  I completely take on board the Senator's point about representation on the board.  I will make a couple of points.  Clearly, we are a unitary board and everybody who comes in the door to the board sheds their baggage, so to speak, and acts to the benefit of the company as a whole so we are not representing different communities etc.  However, diversity on the board across all sorts of measures, including geographic background, is important.  The Senator is correct in stating that we had Gerry Walsh, who retired, and that one of our worker-directors from Cork is not seeking re-election.  I understand the Public Appointments Service, PAS, will shortly advertise for a new director of the DAA.  It would be particularly helpful for us if the Senator uses his good offices to persuade good people to come forward, which makes it easier for the PAS to put good people in front of the Minister. </p></speech>

I totally get that.</p> <p>  On transatlantic and north-south routes, it would be good if we could improve north-south and east-west connectivity.  It makes it easier when there is a PSO obligation because there are then operators we can at least be sure of in terms of revenue.</p><p>Indeed, as the Senator is aware, there are some new operators who are starting in that regard.</p><p> The transatlantic offering is probably a bit more difficult because that was really down to Norwegian Air, and in that format, it is no more.  However, there are new transatlantic airlines starting again.  We do everything we can.  One of the things which I think benefits both Dublin and Cork, as members of the group, is to be out there marketing with airlines all over the world and trying to understand their needs.  Sometimes, their needs can be fulfilled from both airports, and sometimes, from one or the other.  That is what we are pushing to do.  I hope I have answered the Senator's questions.</p><p> In relation to the regulatory system, I will step back a little and say that ultimately, it is a matter of Government policy.  Frankly, it is a matter of what the Irish people want to get from all of their airports.  We are responsible for two of them.  That is a decision that we have input into, but it is their decision.  The system must ensure that all of the pillars of the State, whether it is DAA, any other airports, the regulator, the IAA, are supporting achieving that policy.  We will then take as our mandate to deliver whatever that is.  The important thing is that there are not clashes within the policy.  For example, we have a mandate to retain an investment grade credit rating.  If we are going to retain that investment grade credit rating, it means we can only have a certain amount of debt and we need a certain amount of profitability.  At the same time, we have a mandate to pay a dividend to the Exchequer.  If we are to balance both of those mandates with investing for the future, we need to effectively cut our cloth in a way that we can afford.  Part of that is driven by our main source of revenue, which is airport charges.  I know for a fact that our airport charges are incredibly low compared to other European airports.  We had a very good plan under the capital investment programme, on which we received broad support from the airlines.  I realise that if an airline has an opportunity to introduce cheaper passenger charges, of course, it will be in favour of that, because as an airline, the focus is on profitability, and near-term profitability in particular, whereas we are thinking about how we can build something that will be there for the next 20 years or 30 years.  I have no problem with airlines pushing for charges to be lower; we just have to strike the right balance.</p><p> Once we know what the goal is, we can all push towards it.  However, we need to be clear about that goal.  That is why we welcome the addition of sustainability as one of the building blocks in the regulatory system.  The overall aviation policy and what we want from all our airports must be the starting point, then the numbers can deliver that.  Clearly, we are not in a situation like Heathrow Airport.  Airport charges at Heathrow were already &pound;20 and were increased yesterday.  To put that into context, our charges are &euro;7.75.  We do not have the economies of scale of Heathrow.  Equally, it is not the case, as at Heathrow, that money is flowing out to private shareholders.  In our case, the shareholder is the Government, so the money goes back to the people of Ireland.  It is a closed system in terms of finances.  We need to do whatever we think is the right thing.  It is not that money is being leaked to one constituency or another, other than if we simply say that we are going to reduce our charges and transfer value to the airlines.  To me, that is something that we need to look at on a heads-up basis.  Then we will be fine.  Apologies; that is probably a slightly long elaboration.  It is our fundamental principle behind how we approach this.  It is not about complaining about charges; it is about what we want and how we finance it.  </p></speech>

I am cognisant of time and I am aware other members wish to contribute.  What would be the import of a decision to increase charges?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.794" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Basil Geoghegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021102000002#D00300"><p>The ability to increase charges would allow us to be more profitable, which would improve our debt to profitability ratios, which would maintain our credit rating.  It would also allow us to decide to build for the future, out to 2040 or 2050, in whatever is needed, and to do it in a way that is sustainable.  We do not necessarily want to do it in the cheapest possible way.  We need to do it in a way that also meets our climate action goals.  Pre-Covid, airlines wanted to have a better transfer centre at Dublin Airport because it is a very good way of bringing traffic in and out and bringing it transatlantic.  In the context of where climate change is going, a far more carbon-efficient way of flying from secondary cities in Europe is to fly in a narrow body aircraft to Dublin and in a narrow body aircraft across the Atlantic, as opposed to flying from, let us say, Barcelona to Frankfurt and getting into a Boeing 747.  That is important.</p> <p>  We want to be able to build those facilities.  Many of the members may have questioned at points why they have to end up at the south terminal and get on a bus to go back to the terminal.  Perhaps they would prefer to see hard stands.  So would we, but we must invest.  There were plans to build more stands with appropriate piers at the north end of the airport, which is where more of the Ryanair flights take off from, so that the airline could continue to build.  The increase in charges would facilitate that investment.  I acknowledge that the people who were on the board of Dublin Airport, as it was in the 1960s, made the decision to take the land that we now have for the north runway.  That was before I was born.  That is the length of decisions that we have to take.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the fact that the delay in Mr. Geoghegan coming to this meeting has not impaired his role as chairman designate.  He has been equally effective as chairman and chairman designate.</p> <p>  I follow the Dublin Airport twitter feed, which is quite an entertaining one.  I note that there are discussions with Ballygawley Roundabout and other users about various things.  The Dublin Airport twitter feed states that t is not an airport for Dublin; it is a national airport that is based in Dublin.  I am not sure that I would ever see that on the Shannon Airport feed or the Cork Airport feed. I happen to be one of the few Dublin-based members of this committee.  It is important that people watching this are aware that Dublin Airport is a national asset.  It is based in Dublin, and obviously, the largest population catchment is close to Dublin, but it is an airport that performs and delivers for the country as a whole.  I recall being a member of the Dublin Regional Authority back in 2006.  Members had to go off to a meeting in Fingal to talk about the approval of the development of the third runway, as it was known.  Here we are, almost 16 years later, and finally that runway is being delivered.  I am sure it was discussed in the 1960s in terms of keeping the land, and fair play to those who were doing that.  The airport is very much a national asset.  I remember going there as a child and looking at pier A, which was effectively dormant for nine or ten months of the year and was wheeled out for a few package holidays in the summer.</p><p>Certainly, therefore, it is an enormous asset to the country and I wish the DAA well with it.  I have a couple of concerns and a few questions, which I will put to Mr. Geoghegan together and then he can answer.<br/><br/>What were the passenger numbers for last year<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the peak?  I do not think that information was in his opening statement.  Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh appeared before the committee a couple of weeks ago and I made the point that Shannon Airport did approximately 400,000 passengers hopefully this year.  That was the equivalent of four days of passenger traffic in Dublin Airport pre-Covid pandemic.  I believe Dublin Airport was doing approximately 100,000 passengers per day at that point.  It would not, therefore, be a huge disaster if Shannon Airport was doing better.  It will not be the end of Dublin Airport or anything like it.<br/><br/>I would be concerned about what Aer Lingus is doing in Manchester.  I appreciate that Aer Lingus is part of the larger International Airlines Group, IAG, at this stage and is entitled to go and locate aircraft wherever it thinks there is business.  It is rather that we used to fly them all into Dublin, get pre-clearance and then fly them to America.  Now it seems to be the other way around.  We will be flying to Manchester and not availing of pre-clearance to go to certain routes perhaps in the US.  I know there are other routes to Canada and Barbados, which would not get the pre-clearance.  Perhaps we could get Mr. Geoghegan's thoughts on that.<br/><br/>I have not flown since January of last year, obviously, because of the pandemic.  Mr. Geoghegan made the point about the south terminal.  I recall when one would be on an Aer Lingus aeroplane that would turn right for the south terminal at 10 o'clock on a Sunday night or something when one was coming back.  Obviously, that terminal may not be as busy in the future as it was in the past.<br/><br/>I read somewhere that all of the DAA's income comes from passenger charges but presumably there is quite a bit of income coming from car parking, concessions from shops, restaurant concessions and so on.  Could perhaps elaborate a little bit on that without giving away any commercial sensitivity that he does not want to give away.  He has given us the passenger charges figure.  How does that compare with most other capital cities?  He mentioned Heathrow Airport but obviously Heathrow is a huge beast of an airport compared to almost any other European airport.  He welcomed the Government package and that is positive.  When does Mr. Geoghegan see us getting back to pre-Covid figures.  I think it was 31 million or 32 million passengers in 2019.  What is the figure for 2021?  What does he hope the figure to be in 2022?  When does he hope to be back to the figure of close to where it was pre-pandemic?  I will leave it at that for now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.812" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Basil Geoghegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021102000002#E00200"><p>That is great; I thank the Senator very much.  To answer some of his questions on the numbers, between Cork and Dublin airports, before Covid-19 we were just between 35 million and 36 million passengers.  It was 32.9 million passengers at Dublin Airport.  That dropped to 7.9 million for last year.  To put it in context, a busy day at Dublin Airport pre-Covid would have had 100,000 passengers going through the airport.  We were running many days at 2,000, and 3,000 or those kinds of numbers during the longer lockdown periods.  There were flights coming in from the US with four people on them and that kind of thing.  It was, therefore, kind of a ghost town.  That is where it has fallen to.  The Senator did not ask the question but we are now back at somewhere just below 50% on some days, such as this weekend.  Next weekend, it will be higher but we are kind of back at 50%.</p> <p>  Europe is back at higher levels but, again, Europe opened earlier so there is a little bit of a competitive challenge we have there because other people were able to get out of the gate earlier.  That really goes partly towards the Senator's question around Aer Lingus moving aircraft to Manchester.  I still believe that the proposition at Dublin and Cork airports is as strong as it ever was and that we will get back to those levels and beyond in due course.  Even if I look at the number of airlines at Cork Airport, for example, we are going to be back next year at a higher number of airlines than we were before.  Destinations may not be quite the same but we are driving back there.  It is a combination between the different airports of what one can offer and whether it is a lot of people travelling for business.  Are those people actually travelling from Ireland and back or coming from abroad?  It is, therefore, where they come from.  Again, in Dublin Airport, a lot will be around transit.  The US reopening is very important for Dublin Airport because that is much of that proposition.  It is interesting to see.</p> <p>  Our airline customers are incredibly mobile with their aircraft.  We saw Aer Lingus moving to Manchester because it believed it could fly full planes out of there.  If we look at the airports in the North in Belfast, they picked up far more flights and destinations during Covid-19 because people could not fly out of Dublin, Cork or Shannon airports or anywhere here.  Many of those have actually now been reversed and we are seeing them coming back.  We think, therefore, that we will be as competitive as we ever were.</p> <p>  That then kind of takes us on to the question around charges.  I have not got the exact details of where we are, which I am very happy to share with the Senator, against say the Copenhagen or Manchester airports of the world as opposed to London, Frankfurt and Schiphol.  We are incredibly competitive on a comparative basis and we have to be.  We know that European airlines are thinking about where they are going.  They know they have enough time to fly to somewhere in Europe and back during the day.  We compete with Copenhagen, for example, for that aeroplane.  That is the way competition works between airports.  That is, therefore, the way we must position ourselves.  I think we are confident on that piece.  Even if we were back at the level we were at before, which was &euro;9.50, we would be in a good position with regard to investing.  Equally, I think our passenger charges would still be very low.  We have not really seen evidence that if one reduces passenger charges at least by that amount, one immediately boosts airline activity.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct in his question around our revenue.  Passenger and landing charges are by far our biggest revenue raisers.  The important thing, however, is that anything around concessions, car parks, etc., is still regulated.  It is still within the regulatory till from the regulators perspective, therefore, it still counts to what we are allowed to earn to meet our needs.  We have relatively little unregulated income at the airport.  That is one of the reasons why, albeit small, our Aer Rianta International, ARI, and DAA International, DAAI, business are also important.  They generate unregulated income and give us an opportunity to grow staff and other opportunities.</p> <p>  The Senator asked when it is going to come back.  I spent a huge amount of my time with airlines, airports and operators around the world and the question is when do we get back to these levels?  The optimists thought it was 2023.  I think 2025 is probably the time to think about.  We have taken the steps through taking out cost so that we are confident we can get to a level of being kind of close to break-even or around break-even, depending on the exact number of passengers.  We really need to be back in the high twenties in order to have a proper positive profit contribution.</p></speech>

It is very good news.</p> <p>  If the demand for passports in our offices is any indication of a return to health, I think it could happen relatively soon.  I am probably being a bit glib there.  There is no doubt that the aviation industry has taken a huge hit.  Mr. Geoghegan referenced in his statement how vulnerable it is and also the peaks and troughs of the economy.  We have never seen that as visibly as we have over the last 18 months.</p> <p>  When is the DAA expecting a decision on the north runway and the two conditions on planning?  I know it is a statutory process and Mr. Geoghegan may not have visibility on it.  I am just interested to see if he has a view or an expectation.</p> <p>  Whenever recovery happens, and we would be confident that it will happen, and given that Dublin Airport is a very successful airport overall when things are going well and we do not have global pandemics or ash clouds to deal with, the north runway is going to bring in millions more passengers every year.  That is the reason for it.  We still do not have a light rail system to the airport and we desperately need it.  We needed it without the north runway and we will desperately need it with the north runway.  What is the DAA's strategy of engagement with the Government and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, with regard to MetroLink?</p><p>I know the DAA supports it and needs it, but the DAA is one of the big beasts along with DCU and the hospital group.  A town the size of Swords does not act in a uniform manner on it, but should be seen as one, given the population size.  What is the strategy for engagement on MetroLink?</p><p> How can an airport be carbon neutral?  How has the airport become carbon neutral when there is still not a carbon-friendly way of getting to or from the airport if one wants to travel?  I imagine the number of people who cycle to the airport for travel is negligible, as is the number who walk.  The smell of aviation fumes gets into one's nostrils as soon as one enters the general area.  There does not seem to be any retrofitting done of the major buildings that is visible to the eye.  I am asking this not to be glib, but aviation is in the crosshairs of climate action.  The industry will have to be seen to be making huge changes.  What are those changes?  What do they look like?  Mr. Geoghegan mentioned  Dublin Airport is now the first carbon neutral airport but what has been done to achieve that?  What are the offsets?  I mean this in the most serious way, because I would like to be able to pass on with confidence that the airport in my constituency is leading the charge on reducing carbon emissions and being genuinely carbon neutral.  I would like information on that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.828" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Basil Geoghegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021102000002#F00800"><p>We will look at it as an unregulated income opportunity.  With regard to the conditions on the north runway, the Aircraft Noise Competent Authority, ANCA, which is the noise regulator and the more modern European way of regulating what happens around an airport, will publish its decisions soon.  I do not know exactly when, but it will be soon.  We expect that will focus us, not on the number of flights, but on the noise of the flights.  That means Dublin Airport will be an exciting place for carriers who are using new technology.  New technology is quieter, such as the A320neo and 737 MAX, used by Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  They are also lower carbon aircraft and that will drive that.  We expect there will be an appeal.  It could be us appealing it if the decision is wrong or others appealing it and it will go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We have a concern about whether An Bord Plean&aacute;la is ready for that appeal.  We think the appeal is coming and we would like it to be ready and not have to staff up and take longer to make a decision.  That being said, we will work with whatever is the decision.</p> <p>  It is not so much about millions more passengers.  It will facilitate our growth for quite a long period of time and make the airport safer because there was real congestion at the airport early in the morning pre-Covid.  Under the great and watchful eye of the Irish Aviation Authority, aeroplanes do what is called shooting the gap with one taking off and one cross-runway.  It is more dangerous than two people being on runways which are kilometres apart.  We welcome the runway.  It would also allow us to do maintenance on other runways in an easier fashion.  When it comes to access to the airport, the positive piece is we are the biggest bus depot in Ireland.  We have got over our disappointment in MetroLink being delayed.  We continue to make our views known to any part of Government that this is very important infrastructure.</p> <p>  This leads me to the Deputy's question on carbon neutrality.  We did not make up the rules.  The rules are made up in a way that focuses on the airport as opposed to the activities third parties are carrying out at the airport.  Of course, when one takes into account aeroplanes landing and taking off and people coming back and forth, one is at a completely different proposition.  While we are happy to have achieved carbon neutrality, and that may have been through using low emission vehicles, solar plants, reducing our energy requirements and the kind of normal things one does in that regard, we want to push on into being a sustainable airport.</p> <p>  People need to fly, especially if they are on an island, but we have to make sure it can be done in the most sustainable fashion.  We will not cover it here, but that is sustainable aircraft fuel for now and then it is how we facilitate electric aircraft.  What do we do with the grid if we need to use electric aircraft?  When we reach the 2040s and beyond, it is a question of how we use hydrogen as a fuel.  There is significant investment in that and some experimental things also have to happen.  We have a stake in D&uuml;sseldorf Airport which is partnered with Lilium, a German electric jet aircraft manufacturer, which currently has a four seater flying.  It will have a larger aircraft flying.  That is to work with Cologne and D&uuml;sseldorf to bring people to the airport from outlying vertiports in a better fashion.</p> <p>  It is exciting and interesting.  It will take money to invest in this and not everyone will be happy initially because people will have to bear the costs involved.  I hope I have answered the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

There is an extra responsibility on the aviation industry, be it the airport buildings or the airlines, in terms of their communication and messaging regarding climate action because of the position and how people view it.  We can walk around with everyday products saying they are carbon neutral, for example, this chocolate bar is carbon neutral or this, that and the other is carbon neutral, but it is very different with an airport.  It is great to hear that work is being done in that regard.  I know that from being in the constituency, but measuring and being able to communicate that measurement to people to say the airport is making tangible efforts to reduce its carbon is very important.  We all have a responsibility.  Of course, having such a big bus service from the airport is important for the climate as well.</p></speech>

Covid measures are in place.  We have the digital Covid certificate in place for some months now.  Do the witnesses see it as a success and a tool that will be useful going forward?  What does the shoulder period between now and next season look like?  Could or should anything be implemented to improve on where things are?  Mr. Geoghegan mentioned a number of points which are important to attract routes, such as competitiveness in pricing, but what else can be done?  What else has Dublin and Cork to offer that could improve on that competitive arena?</p> <p>  Mr. Geoghegan said the DAA needs to invest heavily in capacity enhancing projects to support the long-term growth of the airports.  What does he mean by that?  Is it just the runway?</p><p>We are all hearing clearly about pricing but Mr. Geoghegan also mentioned that the regulatory model is not agile and now might be a time to review it.  Is that just the pricing piece or what else does he mean?  He said there were 4,100 jobs and that was reduced by 1,000 and 1,000, or 2,000 overall.  What does the future look like in that regard?  Is that the floor?  Would the DAA be looking to take on staff in the near term or how will that hold up?  Many of us have been contacted by technicians and tradespeople about some ongoing industrial relations issues.  Can I get an update on that?  I have heard criticism about the prospect of outsourcing.  That is something that should be resisted.  Can I get an update on where the DAA is at with those matters?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.832" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Basil Geoghegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021102000002#G00200"><p>The Deputy asked about four or five issues there so I will try address them all.  On the Covid measures and the Covid certificate, that is all working quite well now.  There was pretty good co-operation among all the various State agencies to get that up and running in such a way that when it came in we did not have big delays for people coming in through passport control and so on.  That is working reasonably well.  The one thing that probably made a difference was that people started coming to the airport a lot earlier because they were aware of all this.  That was an issue because we ended up with queues at the wrong times, which the predictive models did not show, but we have tried to get on top of that.  We had an issue in August for which we put our hand up.</p> <p>  On attracting more airlines to the airport, one of the things that is very important is the flexibility of the airport in that regard.  Different airlines have different requirements about check-in and what facilities they have.  Some use third parties, some use their own staff and some are more focused on different types of customers or transferring.  We try to make sure we can be as flexible as possible to meet their needs.  One example, which we may not be getting back to quickly, was when we had Chinese airlines flying into Dublin.  The availability of hot water to passengers was very important to them.  We made sure we had that available but at the same time, many of our concessionaires were selling cups of tea and did not want resourceful Irish people bringing their own tea bags and making their own cups of tea.  It is about trying to work through some of these things to make sure everybody can be happy.  Then there is a virtuous circle because the more flights an airport has and the more opportunities for connectivity, the better it becomes as a destination for concessionaires.  We need to make sure we get that up and running again.  It is about the speed we can get into it in order to get back to where we were before.  We have to look at the other airports around Europe and make sure that, just because they started earlier, they are not eating our lunch before we even get to lunch.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.833" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021102000002#G00300"><p>Does the same principle apply in Cork or is it a different proposition or a slightly different target?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.834" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Basil Geoghegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021102000002#G00400"><p>In Cork, it is slightly different because Cork Airport does not have connecting flights.  It is all point to point.  It is about trying to make sure that when people use Cork Airport and realise there is very good connectivity in Europe they will use it again.  It is then a lot easier to sell to another airline, to say, for example, that the Zurich route has been very positive so maybe it should put on a route from Milan, etc.  The other thing that is important is where Cork Airport connects to hubs, such as Schipol or Heathrow.  There needs to be a number of flights a day to make it work as a hub and spoke network.  Cork Airport will operate in different ways in that regard.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about capital expenditure.  I would invite any member of the committee to come out and look at the new runway, either together or separately.  You do not have to be a construction nerd to find it interesting, such are some of the hidden things there and the groundwater tanks that have been created.  It is great to see that it has been done.  Once the runway is sorted, the next place we are going to have capacity constraints is at gates or stands.  In some cases it is a connected gate and in others it is a stand.  That was the pinch point in 2019 before Covid hit and that is what we had planned to address next.  That is based on pure capacity.  I am not talking about sustainability because there are slightly different expenses with sustainability.</p> <p>  On the regulatory model, it is not all about pricing.  If the objective is to have a well-developed airport, we need to think about the future now.  When terminal 2 was built, lots of people said it was a white elephant and so on.  We could not get Aer Lingus to move into it.  Now it is full.  If the result of the regulatory building blocks is to reduce charges and keep them reduced all through a period like this, something is not working because it is not delivering the policy.  That is why it has to be joined-up thinking and then we can work out what we value and what we do not.  That is what we would like to see in the system as opposed to anything else, particularly as the shareholder of the airport is not a private enterprise.  It is the State so it is all together.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about jobs.  As regards the number of jobs, we will be taking more staff on as the business grows.  Members have probably seen that there are now some shortages in staff in every industry.  There is quite a lot of poaching going on so we are out looking for staff and will continue to do that.  Those staff may work in Dublin, Cork or overseas where there are some exciting opportunities we hope to win. </p> <p>  With regard to the reductions and the new ways of working, let me start by saying the staff were amazing during this crisis.  We felt, as a board and as a company, that this was visited upon us.  We cut back people to 80% of their working hours, which for most of the staff was 80% of pay.  For some it was more because we took any performance-related pay off the table and there were some people who continued to work at 100% because that is what their job required.  People pulled together well and our board pulled together well.  We got the voluntary early retirement, VER, and voluntary redundancy scheme, VRS, programmes out to give people the opportunity to leave if they wanted to take early retirement.  A lot of people felt Covid was a time to reset.  Some 93% of staff who stayed said they were prepared to go to new ways of working.  There are two cohorts that are not quite there.  I would say they are not quite there yet because we have no particular desire to outsource or to have any type of unrest.  I would prefer if they also came along.  I do not think it is fair to the other 93% to say we will make it different for this 7%.</p> <p>  The new ways of working are not fundamental changes.  We are asking people to work across terminals, so if someone works on a particular job in terminal 2, they should be also happy to work on the same job in terminal 1 and we can align rosters to do so.  It is about following the work, so if we are very busy in one part of the airport in the morning but less busy in the afternoon we want to move people to where the work is.  We want people to use company email for company communications.  Some people would not use company email for that.  Again, I do not think that is a big ask.  We wanted people, particualrly those who are mobile around the airfield, to use iPads to take their work orders and fulfil work orders as opposed to coming back to a depot and doing everything in writing.  In the end, I hope that is where we get to because there is no reason anyone should leave the fold. </p></speech>

It is good to be tested every now and then.  I was a teacher before becoming a Deputy and I used to enjoy springing a question on a child to see whether he or she was listening in class.  I am caught out myself today.</p> <p>  Aviation is a very seasonal sector.  We all, including those of us in this committee, wait with bated breath each autumn to see what schedules airlines are offering for the following spring.  The airlines, in turn, hope the consumer will react positively by booking seats and that there will be a surge season.  Given that the sector is so seasonal and the floor fell out of it in the space of one year, why would its recovery take four to five years?  We are now in a good situation in respect of Covid, with things improving day by day.  Almost 93% of the population is vaccinated and digital Covid certificates are in operation.  People are starting to travel again, albeit slowly.  Why will recovery take four or five years when, by its very nature, the industry is so seasonal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.843" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Basil Geoghegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021102000002#H00500"><p>That is a good question.  Forecasting the future is always difficult.  In making our assessment, we have focused on the actions of airlines.  I am not sure I can understand all of those actions but I have looked at them.  Some airlines are very much on the front foot because they have very low cost levels.  They are pushing to put flights on and can fly at lower load factors.  We are certainly seeing that.  We see it in Dublin with Ryanair and in Europe with Wizz Air.  In the case of other airlines, there has been more of a delay, partly, as I understand, because they have higher cost structures and cannot just put on more aircraft.  In some cases, they have been waiting to see whether state supports will be provided.  There has been a lot of state support given around Europe throughout the Covid crisis but some airlines are waiting to see how that will work into the future.  These are some of the actions by the airlines on which we are basing our forecast.</p> <p>  We have also seen that while there is a propensity from the public to want to travel again, many airlines do not exist in the way they did before.  Norwegian does not exist at all and a number of airlines are in the chapter 11 process.  I spend a lot of my time working with airlines and, in many cases, their level of debt is far greater than ever before.  They also have much less flexibility.  It has been said to me by airline executives that the recovery will be demand-led, not supply-led.  We will see the proof of the pudding in that regard in the coming years.  They are not just going to put on flights and see whether people avail of them; they will wait to see whether the demand is there.  That approach, by its very nature, means a return to greater flight numbers will take longer.</p> <p> Another factor is one I see in my own business.  Other than in the past 18 months, I usually travel every week as part of my work.  The various technologies like Zoom and Microsoft Teams make it easier not to travel.  They will not wipe out travel but their availability means that some journeys will not happen.  For many companies that are focused on cost, they will at least cut their travel budgets in the next few years because they feel they can get their business done through alternative means of communication.  This was a worry I had for Irish companies, in particular, during the period when we were incredibly cut off from the world.  Some of it depends on what others are doing.  If a company's competitor starts visiting customers, that company probably will start doing the same.  Until the competitor begins those visits, the company likewise does not need to do so.  That type of human interaction will take a little time to rebuild.</p></speech>

It is a valid point about how people travelled in the past versus the global connectivity we have now through Zoom and Microsoft Teams.  I am thinking about my own neck of the woods, where the early-morning flight from Shannon Airport to Heathrow used to be full of business people going to London to do business before returning home in the evening.  Many of those people are already telling me their colleagues in Britain and globally are aware that probably 90% of that business can now be done online.  That worries me for the long term.</p> <p>  Mr. Geoghegan's opposite numbers in the Shannon Group, Ms Mary Considine and Mr. &Oacute; P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, who recently appeared before the committee, are making the argument that for real recovery to happen in aviation, charges should be scrapped entirely and there must be a significant form of subvention.  In some ways, that is at odds with how Mr. Geoghegan sees the recovery from the perspective of the DAA in terms of engagement with the regulator and charges at the airport.  Will he comment on what I perceive to be an incongruity between the two positions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.845" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Basil Geoghegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021102000002#H00700"><p>On the Deputy's point about the early-morning Heathrow flight, another factor to consider is that fares have gone up and are now really high.  Michael O'Leary is on record as saying they will continue to rise.  This is another reason for the slow return to flying; people cannot afford to travel as much as they would like to.</p> <p>  On the second point, it is, in a way, a case of different strokes for different folks and there are different things that can happen.  The DAA would use rebates or low charges in Cork Airport as a way to entice business there, because it is needed.  We would not want to do so forever but the aim is to help people to grow their businesses.  It can take several seasons to grow a route and make it profitable.  I can understand Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh making that point in the context of what he is doing at Shannon.  In the case of an airport like Dublin, where there are different types of passengers, it is possible to flex it in a slightly different way.  I do not believe we, as an organisation, ever want to do anything other than carry our own water.  We are not looking for subvention.  We do not think it necessarily drives the right ethos through any organisation, regardless of who owns it.  I completely take the point, however, that in the case of an airport like Shannon, where there is not a large number of flights but there is a large amount of infrastructure, it is understandable why Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is looking at things from the perspective to which the Deputy referred.</p></speech>

We want to the see aviation recover nationally.  We have all taken parochial positions over the years when it came to our local airports because a huge loyalty to them has built up over the years.  I have said in the past that there was a kind of predatorial relationship as between the DAA versus the Shannon Airport Authority.  That was there coming into the Covid period.  It probably was most clearly spelt out in a tweet from the DAA about the Ryder Cup coming to Adare Manor in Limerick in 2026, in which it positioned Dublin as the gateway airport.  I take it from Mr. Geoghegan's smile that the tweet was written with tongue in cheek, which is how most of us took it.</p> <p>  That was the past.  Since then, we have had the Covid pandemic and a collapse in aviation.  There have been many interesting and meaningful debates in this forum about how we would like to see aviation in Ireland move forward over the next two or three years to recovery and beyond that across the next decade.  Most of us have declared a position whereby we would like to see a return to a single national airports authority.  We are a small island.  The motorway on which I travelled this morning puts County Clare just two hours from Dublin.  Motorways work both ways in terms of connectivity.  There could come a time in the future, based on the charging model to which Mr. Geoghegan is referring and to which Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh referred last week, when there is some kind of charging trade-off or competition.  Some would say that is healthy but the question is whether it would serve aviation well overall.  The point I really want to make is that the DAA and the Shannon Airport Authority need to look at themselves as partners in Irish aviation and try to work together.  We may not see a national aviation policy involving one airport authority, or it may be some time off, but that type of operational co-operation certainly needs to happen.</p> <p>  I ask for the Chairman's forbearance for a further 40 seconds in which I will digress slightly.  This committee has championed antigen testing for the past year.  Sometimes it felt like we were hitting our heads against a brick wall.  Finally, antigen testing has been embraced and we hope it will soon become operational.  Much of what has happened over the past 48 hours makes a lot of sense.  Covid infections are rising and I very much believe there is still a high risk level attached to the virus.  At the same time, we are making huge inroads in tackling it.  Many people can live with restrictions going on for another while, but others are absolutely despairing.  We should not be seeing teenagers coming under the net of the digital Covid certificates system.  In County Clare, there is a famous underage disco in the Queens Hotel nightclub in Ennis.</p></speech>

Teenagers in County Clare, as I am sure is the case in Limerick and throughout the country, have been craving social outlets for the past two years.  Now they are being told that, although they might have their ticket, their appointment to get their hair done and their new dress or shirt, they cannot go into the disco because they are not vaccinated.  The digital Covid certificate, as an enabler for people to live normal lives, is a very good thing.  However, 14,15 and 16 year olds should not come under the net of the system.</p><p>That is not for anyone here to respond to, it is that we have been the driving force, I would say, in championing this and I wanted to recognise that in committee time.</p></speech>

That came about because we as a committee put antigen testing front and centre.  We have had various airlines before us.  It is something we believe should have been front and centre a long time ago.  We first referenced it in a report we did on aviation back in December of last year.  We want to see Professor Horgan's report published.  We have requested a copy of that report.  We will review it.  The time for, dare I say it, prevaricating on antigen testing becoming part of the major toolkit is over and it now needs to be brought forward.  Deputy Cathal Crowe has made reference to where it may have a central role.  Turning to Mr. Geoghegan, was antigen testing something about which the DAA was conscious?  Is it something it supports?  Various airlines were very keen on it.  What is the agency's view on antigen testing?</p></speech>

Before I go, I want to say in conclusion that a 14-year-old does not need to have a digital Covid certificate to go to school, attend hurling training, play a match or go to the cinema and suddenly he or she needs it now to socialise at weekends.  I believe in vaccination.  I believe in the risks of Covid.  I believe in the merits of digital Covid certification.  However, we should not be putting a ball and chain around the necks of persons aged 14 years or 15 years.  Let them live their lives as young people.  It is has been denied to them for the past two years.  I thank the witnesses.  Forgive me for leaving.</p></speech>

We were there.  We found it quite difficult but ultimately we were able to get testing at the airport, at least for people who wanted to be tested.  We were very clear it would not take away from the State's efforts.  Others said it might but it did not.  It was commercial.  We have been supportive right along of antigen testing as well and we continue to be.  We have seen it operate very efficiently in airports around Europe.  I took a home antigen test myself yesterday before coming to the committee to make sure I was healthy.  I believe in the antigen test's efficacy.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming in.  As a County Cork TD, I congratulate Mr. Cullinane on his new position.  He did wonderful work at Cork Airport and I wish him will in his new position within the DAA.</p> <p>  I want to start on a positive note.  As someone who has been on an aircraft a few times over the past month, it has been a wonderful experience flying through airports within the remit of the DAA, especially Dublin which at the moment is our only airport that is operational.  I very much look forward to utilising Cork Airport once it is back up and running.  I thank the DAA for its investment in that airport.  Wearing my County Cork hat, I wish to stress some of the points my colleague Senator Buttimer was making earlier on continuing to see the DAA giving Cork Airport the focus it deserves.  At a board level within the DAA, it is important there would be a particular focus given to giving some balance, in terms of representation, on the authority's board to the County Cork area.  That is imperative for the strategic nature of that airport and its future growth.  Overall, I am complimentary of the work the authority has done there, such as the investment being put into our new runway and the new facilities on the ground.  It is exciting to see the pace of development and I compliment all the staff and management of the airport for the work they are doing.  It has been a remarkably difficult time for everybody working in aviation, whether they are involved with our airlines or our airports, at all levels from management right down to people working on the ground and indeed in the air.  I compliment how Government and the aviation sector have worked hand in hand to try to get through this crisis.  I firmly believe we are turning a corner.  We know that with aviation, things take time but hopefully over the next few years we will get back to the levels prior to Covid.  It is looking positive at the moment.</p> <p>  I must switch to a topic of concern.  The airports have a critical role in the recovery of the Irish economy.  Aviation in Ireland, as we all know, supports more than 140,000 within the economy here.  I have a question for Mr. Geoghegan.  We have seen recent news, and indeed the authority's own statement yesterday - or that which was reported in the media yesterday - around an increase in airport charges.  What direction are we heading in, in terms of what the authority wants?  We saw with Heathrow that there was an outrageous proposed increase of up to 50% in airport charges.  Are we looking at something like that in the Republic of Ireland?  My point of concern is really the health of our own airlines and especially our connectivity.  I am concerned about Aer Lingus relocating aircraft to the UK and ensuring our airports here are competitive.  My first question is on that.  I apologise because I will be interrupting the itnesses as I have quite a few questions to get through.</p></speech>

I already responded to Senator Buttimer so I totally get that.  We are looking forward to reopening the airport next month.</p> <p>  On airport charges, just to put a sense of scale on it, we had airport charges around the &euro;9.50 mark at Dublin Airport which was something that worked, we believed, for everybody involved and allowed investment.</p></speech>

That has been reduced, to do the like-for-like, to somewhere around &euro;7.75.  That is nearly &euro;2 per passenger and when one considers the more than 30 million passengers per annum going through the airport, that amounts to millions of euro which is effectively a value transfer from the taxpayer of Ireland to the airlines, because unless the airlines reduce their fares by the equivalent amount, that is where it goes.  I do not blame them, by the way, because they are commercial organisations.  However, we would like to see charges calculated on the basis of the current reality as opposed to a very optimistic outlook in 2019.</p></speech>

We felt it would inhibit further investment.  Given we have a closed system, that is, we do not have external shareholders, it was a case of the taxpayer having many pockets and moving money from one pocket to another.  Ultimately, if the DAA as an organisation makes a profit, it pays that money to the Exchequer in the form of a dividend.  We would like to see the right level so we can finance future investment.</p></speech>

Mr. Geoghegan said this recovery will be demand-led.  I commend the hard work of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, who has done fabulous work in getting &euro;90 million in supports for the aviation sector.  Route supports were very much part of what the Government was hoping to do, in conjunction with permission hopefully being granted by the EU Commission.  Would it not be better to keep charges as low as possible, unlike what is happening in airports in the UK, in order to stimulate demand over the course of the next two or three years to get us back to a healthier position where connectivity is protected?  I am not trying to undermine the DAA's argument.  I know it has extraordinary costs.  I can only speak on behalf of myself and my colleagues but we will support the authority in any way we can.  Would it not be counter-intuitive to increase the airport charges by a drastic amount in an era when, as Mr. Geoghegan said, we are expecting the airlines to pursue a demand-led recovery?</p></speech>

We welcome the package that has been put forward by the Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, which is aid for the airlines to grow that business.  There are some other parts to the package too.  We already had a system in place at the DAA to incentivise airlines to get their flights and passengers levels back to where they were pre-Covid.  We agree that in specific places you will incentivise some to do something by making it more economically effective for them to do it.  However, that something which is relatively short term and very targeted is needed more on some routes than on others because some routes naturally have passengers and some airlines are naturally in an almost monopoly position on those routes.  That is the way that we would like to go about it.  The setting of a charge where the thinking is around building something over the next 25 years has to be at a level which is above cost and allows you to finance it.</p></speech>

We are seeing huge growth in the eastern economies of the world.  It was very noticeable from the levels of traffic at Dublin Airport prior to the arrival of the pandemic that it is a seriously strong base for transatlantic travel but there was an absence of eastern connections, with the exception of the Middle East and the carriers operating to that region.  What is Mr. Geoghegan's plan to strengthen that connectivity?</p> <p>  I have the foresight here to try to predict the future, but it is quite evident that at some stage over the next three or four years traffic numbers will yet again exceed 30 million per annum.  Dublin Airport was reaching a point where potentially a new terminal would be needed.  Are there plans in place for, perhaps, a midfield terminal?  What are the strategic growth plans in terms of developing capacity?  Prior to Covid, Dublin Airport numbers were reaching a level such that it was at capacity.  It is quite plausible that it will be back at that point within three or four years.  What are the plans in that regard and in regard to boosting the connections with China, Japan, South Korea and many of the eastern economies that are growing at such a fast pace?  It is important that we would bolster those connections in the interests of the State and the Irish economy.  I would welcome Mr. Geoghegan's insight on those two issues.</p></speech>

I will deal with the last one first.  Without being too aviation-geeky about it, we need new piers and gates as opposed to a new terminal.  The terminal being the entrance to the airport, we do not need a new one.  We can use what we have to build what we need for, probably, the next ten years.  There was some work done under the previous Government on the necessity of a third terminal.  We believe that additional piers and gates will address the issue.  It was absolutely within our capital investment plan to do that.  It was going to be tough to do based on the passenger charge when we were at 33 million passengers, growing to 40 million, but when we are back at a run-rate of 15 million passengers it is impossible to do.  That is one of the reasons we want to get back to this.  We need to have the funds so that we can invest.  The Deputy is correct.  I do not know whether it will be in five years or ten years, but it will be needed and we cannot just take a decision then.</p> <p>  On the eastern access, we had done a reasonably good job in terms of having both Cathay Pacific and Hainan Airlines.  The Middle East carriers continue to be a very good point of access for Irish people to the rest of the world because they offer a huge variety of options.  Hainan Airlines is owned by HNA Group, which is currently being nationalised by the Chinese Government.  I am not sure what will happen in that regard.  Hong Kong Airlines has also had its difficulties.  The Chinese State has taken the view that there is huge economic benefits to not facilitating Chinese people to go shopping around the world and that it is better to have them shopping at home.  I am not sure how keen they will be to do it.  We are out there all of the time looking at these areas, including in places that are east but not that far east, such as Tel Aviv.  </p></speech>

There appears to be a rebalancing internationally of the world economy.  For Ireland, it is important that within the DAA, as the agency tasked with responsibility for Dublin Airport, there would be a strong focus on growing these connections.  At a political level, we must do all we can to grow that business.  That is important.  I was anxious to make that point today.  I thank Mr. Geoghegan for his interesting feedback and his time.</p></speech>

I am based in Limerick city.  Shannon Airport is an international airport.  I congratulate Mr. Cullinane on his appointment.  I understand he is <i>in situ</i>.  Well done.</p><p>The committee met previously with Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  As I said, we are a small island.  Dublin Airport operates at capacity.  We also have an international airport in Shannon Airport.  Cork Airport comes under the remit of the DAA as well.  What interconnection can take place that benefits Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport, rather than them being competitors?  In many European destinations people will commute up to an hour or two to an airport.  We do not do that here.  My apologies, that is incorrect because it is being done from Dublin.  It is more that it has not come to the fore in terms of aviation thinking and overall policy.  I would welcome Mr. Geoghegan's views on the relationship between Shannon Airport and the DAA into the future.  Shannon Airport is operating at a fraction of its operations pre-Covid.  This airport can cater for up to 4.5 million passengers, but it is currently operating at nowhere near that figure.  I ask Mr. Geoghegan to put that in context.  I know that is an unusual question, but I think it is a very relevant one.  </p></speech>

When we look at the business so to speak, there are two big drivers, that is, what passengers want and what the airlines want.  In a way the connectivity by motorways has meant that for Cork Airport and Shannon Airport Dublin Airport has become more of a competitor.  By the way, it is the same for the airports in the North.  It is also clear to me that we are set up to compete with Shannon Airport.  If that were not the case, we would have an anti-trust regulator who would be questioning what we are doing.  The biggest competition for Shannon Airport is Cork Airport.  It may be a positive that the motorway between Shannon and Cork has not been finished.  I am not sure, but that-----</p></speech>

Mr. Geoghegan spoke about investment.  In terms of my question, his answer was that Dublin Airport is set up to compete with Shannon Airport.  The point I am trying to make is in regard to the experience overall of aviation policy.  Mr. Geoghegan gave me the direct answer that as far he is concerned Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport are competitors.  With regard to his point regarding the motorways, I am not sure that is part of it.  All of the airlines are competing.  At this point in time, has there been a return to 50% in terms of passenger numbers flying out of the airport?</p></speech>

If passenger numbers are back to 50% and the airlines are back, why will it take to 2025, which is a further four years, to get back to 100%?  Dublin Airport can be an unpleasant experience because of the sheer volume of people going through it.  In light of such large passenger numbers, would the DAA and Shannon Airport consider having more flights going through Shannon so as to reduce that difficulty?  It could be a reciprocal arrangement.

We are competing with Dublin - there is no point in saying we are not - and the western seaboard is competing with the eastern seaboard.  Mr. Geoghegan is giving me answers, but there is clearly a need to re-examine national aviation policy.  We cannot have a situation where Dublin Airport is bursting at the seams when another State asset that is not that far away has significant excess capacity.  This could include Cork as well.  Does Ms. Geoghegan see the DAA's role as just having Dublin Airport compete against all the other airports in Ireland for international business?</p></speech>

Kerry does not.  Kerry is a different model, as is Knock.  Mr. Geoghegan is refreshing in his honesty, which I appreciate because it tells me where Shannon Airport stands.  There is an element of David versus Goliath.</p> <p>  Why will it take a further four years to return to 2019's passenger levels when the number is already at 50% and the bulk of airlines are flying?  My next question picks up on Deputy O'Connor's point.  Under the regulations, Dublin Airport has a charge of &euro;7.75 per passenger.  Heathrow is moving to between &pound;24.50 and &pound;34.40.  What rate does Dublin Airport's charge need to be at to have a sustainable model that allows for reinvestment?  The DAA views the model as needing to be self-sustaining.  Why is the return taking so long, given the current metrics, and what rate should the airport charge be at?</p> <p>  There appears to be a contradiction on which I would like Mr. Geoghegan to elaborate.  The DAA, in particular Dublin Airport, wants to be competitive internationally.  I would have thought it was also competing with climate change.  Instead of taking the direct transatlantic or UK routes, could people be willing to travel to Dublin and then fly out?  Maybe they would be willing to come to Shannon and then fly onwards.  Would that make us uncompetitive?  Surely the DAA's competitors should be the major international airports, for example, Heathrow, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris Charles de Gaulle.</p></speech>

I have just noticed that most of the forecasts that were made in the middle of Covid by the International Air Transport Association, IATA, and others have been pushed out a little in terms of when capacity will return.  That is partly because the airlines are so indebted that they are finding it difficult to operate.  Some - those with lower cost structures - will grow faster.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Geoghegan believe the low-cost model of flying will come back?  I have examined the cost of flights and the fees are very high.  Is the low-cost model, in which people can book flights for &euro;20 or &euro;30, returning?</p></speech>

They charge as high a fare as they can, and they can at the moment.  We are seeing that because there is not a great deal of capacity being provided by others.  Hub airports will probably recover faster than others because it is easier for them to get traffic in and out.  We will see a little of that.</p> <p>  I hope that numbers return more quickly.  If it is 2024, that will be great, but my crystal ball is not clear.</p> <p>  To give the committee a sense of it from the DAA's perspective, the Chairman's point on competition is absolutely right-----</p></speech>

When we think about charges, we believe that the overall package of the price and service we are offering needs to be at least as good, if not better, than theirs.  That is why we were relatively comfortable in the prior regulatory period when charges were approximately &euro;9.50 or &euro;10.  I cannot give the committee a prediction of how that would fall through the right regulatory model now, but it was certainly different from &euro;7.75.  Overall, that is how we view competition, and when people say they want to fly to Ireland, we hope they will fly to one of our airports and not one of the others.</p></speech>

We could show people that, by flying into that airport and onwards, they would have a lower carbon charge than if they flew from Barcelona to Frankfurt.  Services like Skyscanner and Google Flights tell people how much carbon they are using.  Perhaps there could even be a carbon allowance in future.  It is important to think about the future.  Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is capable of doing that on his own and without my advice.  Having smaller electric jets or electric props, potentially with vertical take-off capability - large lessors like Avolon are investing in such aircraft - will change the neural network, as it were.  One of the manufacturers of these new jets told me that he viewed this as the decentralisation of aviation because it did not all have to be at one large airport.  Smaller airports could be used.</p></speech>

To return to something Mr. Geoghegan dealt with in response to Deputy O'Rourke earlier, multiple people have contacted us about those HR issues.  Without getting into the ins and outs of them, I welcome the fact that negotiations are ongoing and that Mr. Geoghegan has stated that it is not the DAA's wish not to have those issues resolved and, beyond that, not its wish to outsource.  I think at one stage earlier he was going to explain the position on outsourcing at this point.  Could he give me a little detail in that regard?</p></speech>

The question was whether negotiations are ongoing.  I think information was provided to the relevant unions at the end of July to the effect that a decision on outsourcing would be taken.  That was as a result of negotiations having broken down or ended.  Not having the detail of what has gone on between now and then, I will just observe, as a human being, that nothing is over until it is over.  That is my observation.</p></speech>

He says the DAA will wash its own face when we get to passenger numbers in the high 20 millions per year.

We are going through a strategy at the moment and we will set out a new five-year forecast in January, when we probably will be in a better position to answer the Deputy's question.  The reason I am hesitant is that a year ago everyone said vaccines were coming out, aviation would be back and the summer would be back.  The summer was pretty much a disappointment for air travel.  We then thought the US was all vaccinated but, actually, it is not vaccinated.  No one thought about the Delta variant.  No one thought Joe Biden would keep things closed until November.

We do think, however, that there is a propensity to travel, that the airlines want to get back and that we have at least some element of normality, even though it is a very different way of travelling.  That is why we are confident the sector will be back; it is just that telling the end date is tougher.</p></speech>

There are those issues that are specific to the DAA, but Mr. Geoghegan should feel free to go beyond the authority's slipstream.  Where does he foresee the industry's wants and needs will be?  Supports have been given.  Where does he believe the DAA will not need them?  What will the DAA require into the future?  Does it have a general ask?  If what Mr. Geoghegan believes the DAA requires could be delivered along with those other factors with which it interacts in respect of the industry, what would be the DAA's asks from the Government?</p></speech>

If we had that, it would be fantastic for the country, never mind for the DAA.  We would show real agility and efficiency.  The recently announced help the Government is giving from a tourism and airline perspective is very positive.  A close eye will have to be kept on that as to for how long it needs to go on and to see what are the cause and effect.  I hope the market will respond quickly to that.  As for airports other than Dublin, whether Cork, Shannon or the others, the Government's investment on a regional basis is very important.  That goes to the help we got in respect of Cork Airport on the runway.  All those points are important.  That is probably ongoing.  I do not think it is necessarily Covid-related.  It is just a sensible economic investment to make.</p></speech>

Then there are things which are outside our immediate purview but which are really important, such as MetroLink.  I know the committee discussed with the chairman of Shannon Airport the fact that none of our airports is connected by rail.  It is not acceptable as a country that that is the case.  Rail connection would be a big step forward and, clearly, we would like to see it at Dublin, but anything happening at other airports would be a good thing as well.  We at the DAA are committed to running an organisation which can effectively carry its own water with a fair regulatory regime.  We know we can compete well because we go and compete against other airports in providing services outside Ireland.  We run terminal 5 in Riyadh.  We are competing to run another terminal in that part of the world.  We are up against the biggest people in the world in doing that.  It is great when we get Government support, and I know Ministers and others have helped us in that regard.  We know we can compete globally; we just want to deliver that really good service back here in Dublin and Cork too.  Still, we are very happy that is what is within the purview of our mandate.</p></speech>

In that case they are really contracts to operate terminals.  Sometimes they are to help in their design etc.  They can involve anything related to aviation services at an airport that we can operate.  In addition, we have run, for example, the platinum services model we have at Dublin Airport, which is effectively a private transfer for commercial passengers.  We have done that sometimes outside Ireland.  We did a pop-up service in Riyadh when the Formula E was on there.  Ireland has been a good test bed of-----</p></speech>

No, that is absolutely fine.</p> <p>  I have just a final question.  Mr. Geoghegan himself made some reference to this and it is something P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has spoken about.  I refer to a proper conversation, narrative and forum from the point of view of ensuring regional development and, beyond that, ensuring we have the best system in the State and, even beyond that, in the country from the point of view of delivering what we need to deliver in respect of aviation.  What does Mr. Geoghegan foresee in that regard into the future, and what role will the DAA play?  I realise I am seeking detailed plans in the minute and a half I have left.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-20a.933" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Basil Geoghegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021102000002#M02000"><p>I am not sure what I foresee but what I aspire for us to do is to acknowledge how important aviation is to Ireland.  That is broad, from lessors to, it seems to me, our supplying of airline CEOs around the world.  We have a number of really successful airlines.  If we acknowledge that and then understand what we need as an island with our connectivity, particularly because, while geographically we have not moved, Brexit has made us more exposed from a European perspective, I think we could then have a very open conversation about what matters and what does not matter.  Going back to the Chairman's point about how the Government and the country look at developing Shannon versus Cork versus Dublin, this could be done in an open and honest fashion.  Then I would like to see what we sometimes refer to as the treacle removed.  We would like to see fast and straightforward decision-making.  Sometimes a quick decision is fine, even if it is a negative one, because you know it quickly.  That is what we would like to see.  It only matters to some of our business some of the time, but Dublin Airport is not under the planning regime considered strategic infrastructure right now.  That is not a good thing.  It is not good if there is a delay between the Aircraft Noise Competent Authority, ANCA, process and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>I am not asking for a decision in our favour, although clearly I would prefer that.  I would just like it to be fast and efficient.  That is what we should be able to do.  As I have said, it is a closed system.  We are all together in this.  If I had a plea, that is what I would like to see because I believe that could deliver better transportation in aviation right throughout the island.</p></speech>

It is a very interesting discussion.  I thank Mr Cullinane and Mr. Geoghegan for being here today.  I am deputising today for my colleague Deputy Michael Lowry.  One might ask, why is a guy from Galway coming in here to talk about the airport in Dublin.  When we talk about connectivity and aviation policy, it affects everybody on this island.  From where I live in Tuam I can get to Dublin Airport within two hours, I can get to Shannon Airport within one hour, and I can get to the Ireland West Airport in Knock in 45 minutes, all within the set speed limits.  The only thing is, when I come to Dublin I dread coming near the M50 because if there is traffic congestion one cannot judge what time one will get to Dublin Airport.  The witness referred to MetroLink and so on.  I accept that, as the major airport in the country, Dublin Airport must be developed properly and that we have to make sure we are developing it in a way that is best for the country, best for industry and best for the economy. There is a lot to an airport, from the connectivity to the hubs, to get international and global travel.  I was on a trade mission in China and at that time we were trying to convince people to have direct flights from China to Ireland, and they have come.  This takes an Ireland Inc. approach to getting that done.</p> <p>  While I was listening to everything being said here, I noted that there is a parochialism around aviation in Ireland because there is Dublin, Cork and Shannon, and no mention - or only once - of Knock, which is also an international airport.  We have these assets within the Republic of our country and we must develop them.  We need to develop them with a national policy and not with competing policies.  I believe there is enough for everybody.  </p> <p>   I will say two things about aviation.  Mr. Geoghegan hit on it when he mentioned being best in class and best at international aviation services whereby we can go any place in the world and deliver them.  That is fantastic but we must sell that more and more so that Shannon, Cork and Knock airports can do that.  We have the expertise and we need to be able to build our business abroad. Aviation is an enabler to allow Ireland, on the periphery of Europe, to become the stopping-off point to get to Europe and beyond from America.  We have the assets but I believe there is a frustration.  I hear it also from some of the members of the committee here.  The frustration is that we may not all be playing on the same team at times.  It is difficult to play on the same team when there is no remit for Shannon Airport but there is a remit for Cork and Dublin airports, so Shannon is not part of the team.  At the same time, we should not see them as Galway and Mayo playing at football: they are not arch enemies.  There must be recognition for the fact that we have to work together.  The appointment of Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh to the Shannon Group is a major step forward for the airport, for the west of Ireland and for regional development.  Listening to Mr. Geoghegan today, there is no doubt there is a lot of commonality in the thought processes of Mr. Geoghegan and Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  There is more in common than there is in difference among us here.</p> <p>  We are a very small nation.  Geographically we are very small but we are an island and we work way beyond what size should dictate.  Aviation in Dublin Airport has shown that consistently, and I congratulate Mr. Geoghegan on that.  We have some work to do to make sure that when we are talking about aviation and Ireland Inc. that we are not just talking about DAA.  It is also Shannon, Knock or Kerry.  It is one industry.  We are too small a country to divide it up.  If we are to continue to compete with other international hubs around the world we need to be doing it as one hub with three or four locations.  That is the way we should be doing it.  Policy change has to happen in this regard.  I do not have many questions because the witnesses have been already asked a lot of questions.  Reference was made to the charge being brought from &euro;7.75 to &euro;9.50, which is a 35% increase.  If that is the case, is there a tipping point where that would become a negative in promoting the airport?  </p></speech>

I will make one comment and then I will answer the Deputy's question directly.  On the brainpower and the willpower that exists around aviation, I believe it is multifaceted.  If there is to be a debate about national aviation policy, it is important that people have the confidence that it will end up in something.  I know, and the members will be aware, that there was frustration around the aviation task force at various times during Covid because people gave a lot of time and worked with their closest competitors, but felt they did not get much bang for their buck.  That is the Government's prerogative, but I am aware it was an issue.</p></speech>

That is where it was under the last regulatory period.  I absolutely agree that one cannot increase these charges too much.  In the context of any of these discussions, it is not the case that a number just appears; there are conversations with customers, with passenger groups and so on.  There was a real opportunity at the last determination for the right price to come out but it did not because of the building blocks that the regulator uses, and which the regulator would say it is forced to use. This not a question about the regulators doing the wrong thing, it is about the rules of the game needing to be changed somewhat.  Absolutely it must be balanced.  It is absolutely right that we at the DAA are told that we need to focus on our costs.  We are not looking for blank cheques.  We simply want to be able to deliver what passengers, the taxpayers and everybody else would like us to deliver.  That is what we want to do and we will do it to the best of our ability.

It comes back to the national aviation policy.  Dublin has continued to grow at a rapid rate and take an increasingly high percentage of the overall traffic.  As Deputy Canney put it, we are a small island and it is the missing link.  With climate change targets coming and having to be met, this provides an opportunity, under the national aviation policy, for a rising tide to lift all boats.  This is the point.  I have no doubt that if Dublin Airport had the runways that are at the disposal of Shannon Airport, for example, we would not be building the third runway at Dublin Airport.  The DAA would be using that under capacity.  It just so happens that it is 150 miles down the road.</p><p>It is about making the maximum use of the national assets.  Mr. Geoghegan's big thing is that, if there is a change in aviation policy, it must be a working document rather than an aspirational one.  Is that a fair comment? </p></speech>

The DAA is in State ownership.  It should be investment grade and should be put at risk in that context.  It should be in a position to pay a dividend to the State.  The DAA should provide best quality, secure and efficient airports within its remit both in Cork and Dublin.  Therefore, the regulatory model, which works out how much we can charge, needs to be able to deliver to an efficient DAA - and I am not looking for us to be inefficient - the cash flow that would enable us to make those investments and to take a decision in year 1 regarding something that will be still operating in year 30.</p></speech>

I recognise that Dublin is the engine for the DAA.  We are all wearing the green jersey.  As I said at the beginning, I found Mr. Geoghegan's contribution refreshing because there is a challenge for us as the line committee but, more importantly, if you look at the PwC report on the future of aviation - Deputy O'Connor alluded to the whole issue of the east - you will see that the Chinese market has the potential to be bigger than the US market in a few years' time.  I apologise for not knowing the answer to this but the aviation leasing sector is very important and I am not sure what is the DAA's role in that.  Under our remit, we have to come back to aviation policy.</p> <p>  I was struck by Mr. Geoghegan's response to a question - I cannot remember whose it was - that the &euro;90 million was for the airlines.  I am probably paraphrasing him incorrectly but I believe he mentioned that &euro;90 million for the airlines elsewhere as well.  I hope the subdivision of that &euro;90 million will not see everything funnelled through Dublin.  I take the point regarding the hub concept, which has worked extraordinarily well for Dublin.  I have been in Dublin Airport recently and I compliment Dalton Philips, the chief executive, and all of the staff.  It was a pleasurable experience and I have to give credit to the DAA staff and thank them for that.</p> <p>  Cork Chamber of Commerce has a newsletter on economic trends.  It has asked a series of questions about when people anticipate returning to flying for business and the level of air travel for business they anticipate in 2022 compared with 2019.  The figures are interesting.  We need to combine forces to ensure we get people back to flying safely.  Connectivity is also important.  In saying that, I am still struck by Mr. Geoghegan's remarks to the committee regarding the role of the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, being transferred to the Irish Aviation Authority and the whole regulatory process.  I cannot get out of my head what he said about a fit-for-purpose price cap.  That is something I am worried about.  Will airlines play football with all of us in terms of negotiating with the DAA or the airports at Dublin, Cork and Shannon?  </p> <p>  May I be controversial?  Shannon Airport is charging little or nothing for landing slots, yet a cost is being incurred.  That is a debate we need to have again.  Deputy Canney speaks about a level playing field, yet Mr. Geoghegan's remarks today have an import.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, for the &euro;90 million but we should have her and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, before the committee again to discuss what Mr. Geoghegan has spoken about, the Irish Aviation Authority.  The Bill is going through the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  I do not want us to sleepwalk into anything.  That is for a different debate.  Today is about Mr. Geoghegan's appointment.  I have full confidence in him and I support his reappointment.  That is a different debate for us but I thank him for his remarks.</p> <p>  I will be parochial and thank Niall MacCarthy and the team in Cork Airport.  They have done an extraordinary job.  Mr. Geoghegan spoke about less pay and fewer hours.  The staff took a great hit but they had huge pride in their airport and in themselves as entities both in Dublin and Cork.  I thank them.  I also thank Niall MacCarthy and Dalton Philips for their leadership in Dublin and Cork.  We could spend every week here talking about aviation because it is so important.  I have rambled on.  I found Mr. Geoghegan brilliant today.  It was a breath of fresh air for me.</p> <p>  I apologise but I have another last point.  I believe Mr. Geoghegan issued an invitation to us to visit Dublin Airport.  I hope he will expand that invitation to include Cork Airport because we should go out and visit the two airports and meet with the staff and with the board.</p></speech>

It was very good.  I found it entertaining and useful.  I thank Mr. Geoghegan for being here.  It really was not the two and a half or three hours of interrogation he might have expected as a chairman-designate coming before an Oireachtas committee.  We have not really discussed anything related to that, but we have still had a very useful conversation about Dublin Airport, the DAA and Irish aviation generally.  Going back to Mr. Geoghegan's Twitter feed, I saw a picture of Concorde there in 1984.  I think I was out there that day on what was the old Pier A.  Once a year, the balcony was opened and people were allowed to go out there.  It is something I would be very interested in, even if I was not on this committee, although I am delighted to be on it.  I picked up on a point to which Senator Buttimer alluded.  We suggested to P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh that we would visit Shannon Airport.  I have visited the airport but have never flown in or out of it and I do not know an awful lot about it.  Back in 2014, as a member of the old Dublin Regional Authority, I got a tour of Terminal 2.  We saw all the bomb-sniffing equipment, the baggage inspection stuff and the X-ray machines.  It was really interesting.  The committee would benefit from a trip to Dublin Airport, particularly to look at the north runway and all of the work that is going on there.  Whether we were to do it collectively or individually, I would certainly be very interested in that.  Perhaps someone could contact me about the logistics of that at a later stage.</p> <p>  I will make a point I made to P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  Every Minister for Transport has been Dublin-based.  The last one who was not was Noel Dempsey who got absolutely lambasted over the cost of Pier D.  People said it was miles away and totally unnecessary and redundant.  They said the same thing about Terminal 2.  The figures from 2019 proved all of those critics wrong.  I do not believe there is a capital city airport in Europe or in the world that has as greater ratio of passengers transiting to the population of the country as Dublin Airport.  That might be something to explore.  Heathrow is huge but six times the population of the UK, or even England, does not transit through it every year.  As a country, we are enormously indebted to aviation.  I made this point to P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  Duty-free shopping was invented at Shannon Airport, as was Irish coffee.  It was the last point one reached in Europe.  It had a very interesting deal with the Soviet Union and Aeroflot with regard to refuelling at one point.</p><p>Shannon has to reinvent itself.  Dublin is constantly reinventing itself.  Thirty years ago, nobody knew where Dubai and Abu Dhabi were in terms of transit points.  Dublin was becoming a mini Dubai in terms of pre-clearance going west.  Dublin was used by people coming in from the UK, particularly, avoiding Heathrow, coming into Dublin and going west.  I live in Dublin and Dublin Airport is my airport but it is more than that.  It is the nation's main airport.</p><p> The DAA has a commercial mandate, I assume, whereby it must compete with Shannon.  The witnesses would be accused of all kinds of anticompetitive, monopolistic or cartel-like behaviour if it did not.  Equally, I would have thought, though the witnesses can disagree, that the competitors include Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Barcelona and all those airports which are not monster airports but are secondary in terms of passenger numbers.  They are the 30 million or 40 million passenger airports, rather than the 120 million or 200 million in Istanbul or wherever.  Geography plays a part.</p><p> Aviation is critical to Ireland's recovery and success.  It is a huge employer with aircraft leasing and everything else.  I suppose the ask for us as policymakers, politicians and legislators is that we explore the issue of the Commission for Aviation Regulation versus the IAA.  We have a briefing about the air navigation Bill in the next hour.  The issue is as to the reason for "the treacle", which is not a phrase I have heard used before but is apt to describe the slowing down of things through bureaucracy.  Other than that, what asks do the witnesses have of us as politicians?  </p><p> The DAA is an enormous contributor to Fingal's rates bill and Fingal benefits enormously from its existence.  Where do witnesses see the growth?  Is it the US, Europe or the Middle East and the east?  What airlines is it?  Is it Aer Lingus, Ryanair or lots of other airlines?  I knew they have to be commercially sensitive but what competitor airports are the witnesses most worried about?  I mentioned Manchester.  I would be concerned about the Aer Lingus deal.  Planes that would have flown out of Dublin to the US are now flying out of Manchester.  Are there other concerns about what is coming along and trying to steal our business?</p><p> Many airlines have downsized and parked aircrafts in deserts.  Some of them will never come back out of deserts.  Are the witnesses concerned that some airlines that flew into Dublin have smaller fleets and Dublin might be towards the bottom of the queue?  How do we get back up the queue in terms of airlines' reallocation of aircraft?</p></speech>

I note Senator Buttimer's complimenting of the team in Cork and of Dalton Philips and the team in the DAA.  I agree that a great job has been done and it has flown right through the organisation.

If I am an airline running on a positive route, for example, Dublin to London Heathrow, I have a different profit structure than someone struggling to put on a new route from Shannon to Z&uuml;rich.  Subsidy is a public good and has to be directed to the right place.  Having a laser focus on that is important.  Some of that is also to help the airports.  Hub airports may recover a bit faster but it is to help an airport make the investment it needs so it can attract that airline.  So a bit is needed on both sides.</p> <p>  On the question of where we will get more growth, the answer is everywhere.  It is not just new places but also density to places.  If I am going to Vienna for a business meeting, I want to know I can get on a flight to Vienna at 7 a.m. and leave Vienna at 6 p.m. to come back.  Double daily flights are important.  I hope we will have much more long haul out of Dublin.  Therefore, it is about making sure we have enough flights coming in to connect with those because connecting traffic is important.  It is everything and we----</p></speech>

Equally, I know that if I am in Helsinki I have a much better proposition for European airlines who want to go to China.  They can fly over the top and it is lower cost, faster and lower carbon.  We need to acknowledge we need thick routes with many passengers when we do something to that far away.</p> <p>  On concerns, we are lucky that we have pretty vibrant airlines at Dublin Airport.  We are part of the fact they are so vibrant.  It is great and I compliment all of them, both the large ones and some of the smaller ones who are also vibrant.  The other concern I have, and it is not a worry but it is at the forefront of our minds, is that as we take these steps we cannot be short-sighted.  We need to be long-sighted and think about the sustainability of what we are doing.  I want to attract airlines who use new equipment.  If we have an airline using new equipment and sustainable aviation fuel, that is terrific and we have to make sure they can fuel up on sustainable fuel.  That is the same if it is electricity in five or ten years' time.  On the point about Noel Dempsey, one will not get applause for it right now but it does not matter, one can rest easy in future years knowing one did the right thing and that is our North Star on this.</p> <p>  I think that answers the direct questions.</p></speech>

It is done continuously to go through everything from operational decisions to having a review on a regular basis, I think it is weekly or monthly, of operations, how we can do better, how Members can help us and we can help them.  With the capital infrastructure plan, CIP, we spent lots of time with the airlines going through what they wanted from the airport.  Aer Lingus would like to see a good transfer hub.  Ryanair wanted more stands.  It does not want stands with air bridges.  We had a debate and, to a certain extant, a laugh with Michael O'Leary as to whether we should have a bridge from one pier to another or put people in buses.  That is fine.  We will always have some differences.  The broad parameters of the CIP were supported by all of the airlines.  It then comes down to the right cost.  For an airline, it is natural to say the cost needs to be lower.  I have no problem with that; that is their job.  Our job is to have manners put us so we are not inefficient but also give us the facility to invest for the long term.</p></speech>

I compliment him and the staff of Dublin Airport in addition to the staff and management of Cork Airport.</p> <p>  The concluding point I wish to make relates to the trends when crises have happened in aviation back through the decades.  Nothing has hit aviation quite like this pandemic, but looking at the aftermath of 11 September 2000 and the global recession, the trend is always the same.  There is a return to a situation of rapid growth and recovery in the sector.  I have no doubt that aviation will very much benefit from that.  It is unclear how quickly that will occur.  It is purely based on the situation with Covid because we do not know where it is going.  However, if we work under the assumption that we will emerge from the Covid pandemic in the course of the next 18 months and, hopefully, herd immunity will have been reached internationally, we can only assume that Dublin Airport will be heading for potentially 40 million passengers over the next ten years.</p> <p>  I want to look to the future rather than talk about the past.  It is very important for Mr. Geoghegan to seize the opportunity in the climate we are in now politically, where there is such a focus on getting things done rapidly.  We have learned a great deal from Covid and that we can get through some of the traditional barriers that may have slowed down the development of key infrastructure.  With regard to the future growth of Dublin Airport in terms of the provision of new terminal facilities, the airport utilises piers and I accept that.  Perhaps there is no need for a new arrival or departure facility at Dublin Airport. However, in terms of the pier capacity to allow the airport to expand the number of routes it operates and the capacity of those routes, I wish to see growth and development in that area, particularly while there is a Government in place that wants to back development.  Providing the additional capacity is quite exciting.  There is the new runway, and Mr. Geoghegan has spoken extensively about that.  I want him to focus on the provision of new piers at the airport.  What is his plan?  What does he intend to do?  Will he be building new piers or a new mid-field facility or is he looking at renovating existing facilities or demolishing older facilities and replacing them with more modern facilities?  I want to focus him on that, if he does not mind.  Will he give some insight into what the airport is planning over the course of the next ten years?  That is in the context of a desire now just to move on and to start planning for the future, particularly from my point of view as the transport spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il.  That is my frame of thought.</p></speech>

We have a virtual model and we had a scaled model of what we are doing at the airport.  It is easier to see it.  It is big; it sits in the middle of a table and can be seen.  We have to re-examine that, given where we are now and given a fact that I did not mention previously, which is all those losses we had.  We financed that because we were able to take cost out, go to the bond markets and raise cash, but it is debt that we now have on our balance sheet and it will not just disappear.  We have to cut our cloth a little.  The broad plan was, on the south side of the airport, to develop further around Terminal 2 and have a transfer centre in that part of the airport.  On the north side of the airport the plan was to deliver another pier further over from the current most northern pier and there is going to be another pier down where the hangars are currently.</p></speech>

This refers back to my point about expanding out to the east.  The airport will need the capacity for aircraft such as Boeing 777s, the Airbus A350s and the Boeing 787 Dreamliners.  Is that capacity going to be extended in Dublin?</p></speech>

It was to have additional stands there so we would be able to meet what we need to do in respect of wide-bodies and also in respect of narrow-bodies.  If the Deputy thinks about it, they might not fly to China but a lot of the routes to the US are flown on narrow-bodies.  That is the way we think it will go because, again, it gives more point-to-point activity in the US.  The A-380 is perhaps the aeroplane of the past, but the others absolutely-----</p></speech>

If one looks at the hub airlines, such as Emirates, Turkish Airlines, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways, they seem to be operating and will continue operating wide-body aircraft, and I doubt that we will ever see Aer Lingus doing eastern flights given its current trajectory.  Is there a plan to expand the capacity in Dublin Airport to service that type of growth, where there could be three or four daily services serving the Middle East?  Essentially, it is going back to what we had pre-2019 and growing from there over the course of the next ten years.  I am sorry that it is a very technical question, but it is an important one.</p></speech>

We are finishing our strategy work in the next couple of months.

We have a five-year plan which we submitted to the Department during last year.  The Department needed to see a plan.  It was very difficult to do because of Covid.  We are doing that work at present and will have one at the end of this year.  We are working with some external parties as well on it.  In a way, we just need to get the ball on the green, so to speak, regarding when we need that infrastructure.  Whether the infrastructure is in full use in 2035 or 2040 matters less.  It just has to be there.</p></speech>
