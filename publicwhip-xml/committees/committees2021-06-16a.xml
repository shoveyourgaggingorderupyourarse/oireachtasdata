I remind everyone that apart from members of the committee secretariat and me, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely or from within the Leinster House complex only.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Stanton.</p> <p>  Today, we will give consideration to the reactivation of enterprise, trade and employment following the pandemic restrictions.  We will be assisted by representatives of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  Next week, we will continue our consideration of this matter when we hear from the County and City Management Association.  I am pleased to welcome Dr. Laura Bambrick and Mr. Liam Berney from ICTU and Mr. Neil McDonnell from ISME.</p> <p>  Before we start, I will talk about parliamentary privilege.  I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege in the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in any way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite Dr. Bambrick to make an opening statement on behalf of ICTU.  I ask her to limit her contribution to seven minutes, if possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061600002#B00100"><p>On behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I thank members of the committee for their invitation to share the trade union perspective on issues relating to the reactivation of enterprise, trade and employment following the pandemic restrictions.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Liam Berney, industrial relations officer and the ICTU representative on the aviation subgroup of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, which was formed to examine the catastrophic impact of Covid-19 on Irish aviation and the challenges facing the industry, employers and workers as the economy opens up.<br/><br/>Prior to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, there were 2.5 million people in the workforce and we were close to full employment.  The essential public health measures to help slow the spread of the virus resulted in job losses on an unprecedented scale.  At its peak, in May 2020, more than 1 million workers were reliant on the State for a weekly unemployment payment or to subsidise their wage.  We welcome the progress made in reopening parts of the economy over recent months.  Congress is, however, mindful that not all jobs, firms and sectors will recover at the same pace and to the same extent following the lifting of restrictions.  As a member of the Labour Market Advisory Council, congress set out in detail our position on actions to tackle the labour market challenges arising as a result of the pandemic in our minority report to the policy paper Preparing for Economic Recovery, a copy of which we have provided to the committee.<br/><br/>In the brief time I have available for my opening comments, I will focus on the role of wage and income supports in reactivating workers and business.  The introduction of the wage subsidy scheme in response to Covid-19, as originally proposed by congress, has and continues to be critical in keeping workers connected to their jobs and businesses to their staff.  However, without a top-up from an employer, which is, unusually, not a qualification condition of the scheme, the subsidy provides inadequate income protection for many workers.  The short-time work support has helped mitigate the extent of income loss.  Combined, they provide a minimum level of net weekly income of around &euro;450.  Access to the short-time work support is, however, limited to 230 consecutive days.  Without this supplement, workers face further falls in income and normal living standards.  The recent decision to extend the wage subsidy is welcome.  However, the Government must act to keep the time-limited criteria on the short-time work support in step to reduce the risk of a skill and brain drain and long-term scarring in sectors vital to the functioning of the economy.<br/><br/>It is the view of congress, in the medium term, that the wage subsidy should be transformed into a genuine short-time work scheme modelled on the most effective schemes in place in other European countries, particularly in Germany and the Nordic countries.  The programme for Government, now a year old, commits to setting out a pathway for the future implementation of the wage subsidy, a commitment echoed in the July stimulus.  Congress is disappointed that little appears to have happen in the meantime.<br/><br/>The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, has proved integral to maintaining workers&rsquo; income and, hence, consumer demand and social solidarity throughout the public health emergency.  When and how the PUP is withdrawn must be based on concrete evidence and not influenced by the claims of a handful of employers and their representatives, amplified by the media, that workers do not want to return to their jobs because of the PUP.  The data showed that when the economy partially reopened last summer, we witnessed 400,000 workers willingly close their PUP claim and return to work.  Again, the Government&rsquo;s own target of 100,000 workers going back to work last month was easily reached.  If we look beyond Ireland, Germany, Norway, Australia, the UK and US are experiencing recruitment difficulties in hospitality and other low-paying, precarious employment, as businesses reopen following the lockdown.  What they have found is that workers have left the country, left the sectors and left the workforce.  Furthermore, our <i>per capita</i>sectoral unemployment is on a par with other countries that do not have a PUP equivalent payment.  Congress cannot and will not stand over cuts to the income supports for laid-off workers while they are locked out of their normal employment under public health restrictions.<br/><br/>Before concluding, we note recent media reports of comments by both the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste relating to a possible earlier return to the office, which took congress by surprise.  Congress is currently engaged in a consultation process with the Department of the Taoiseach on the safe return to the workplace of hundreds of thousands of office workers.  Since our early discussions, this subject had been raised by us, but was set aside for further consultations in order to fully consider the safety implications.  The dates for beginning the return to the office must continue to be guided by public health advice, and not unduly influenced by city centre businesses in want of office workers&rsquo; footfall.<br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s labour market was facing major weaknesses and challenges before the pandemic.  The pandemic has widely exposed and made worse some of these big failings, in particular, the prevalence of low-pay jobs, with few benefits and insecure hours.  Many of these workers are essential front-line workers who, during the pandemic, kept us safe, kept food on the supermarket shelves, kept home deliveries arriving, kept our bins emptied and so on.  It is the firm view of congress that the so-called &quot;pandemic dividend&quot; for workers can best and, in fact, only be achieved through collective bargaining.  We will work to ensure the Government delivers on the commitment it made when launching the economic recovery plan last week - to build back better.  I thank members for their attention and am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil McDonnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061600002#B00300"><p>I wish to express our gratitude for the opportunity to address the committee.  As our economy progressively reopens post-pandemic, small and medium enterprises, SMEs, are faced with acute financial, labour, operational, health and safety, and political engagement issues.  Despite the presence of so many large multinationals in Ireland, almost 68% of Irish workers are employed by SMEs.  Almost half that number work in a business with fewer than 50 employees.  SMEs are the bedrock of the Irish economy, and the survival of the greatest possible number of them must be a priority for the House.<br/><br/>Almost one third of the businesses in <i>The Irish Times</i>top 1,000 companies list that was published last Friday meet the EUROSTAT definition for an SME.  That is one third of the top 1,000 companies.  By the time one finds the last company in <i>The Irish Times</i>list, one will find a business turning over &euro;16 million per annum, with 45 employees.  Ireland is an economy and a society of small businesses.  We have seen remarkably few insolvencies to date, but this number is set to rise quickly.  It is imperative that members do all they can to enact the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, before that happens.<br/><br/>While grant supports have been enthusiastically used by SMEs during the pandemic, debt supports have not.  The employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, remains absolutely essential in those parts of the economy that have yet to fully reopen.  Irish people do not benefit from being citizens of the second most expensive economy in the EU.  Therefore, the 9% VAT rate should be maintained indefinitely, and the higher rate should permanently revert to its historical rate of 21%.  Redundancy costs are likely to be a significant burden for many employers in the medium term.  The statutory redundancy rebate for employers should not have been removed nine years ago.  It should be reinstated in full now, or the 0.5% levy on employers&rsquo; PRSI, which financed the rebate since 1979, should be removed from PRSI.<br/><br/>The PUP is, unfortunately, acting as a significant brake on return to work in many areas of the economy such as agriculture, hospitality, grooming and accommodation, and should be tapered more rapidly than the current plan suggests.</p><p>While we do not oppose improvements in employees' entitlements in principle, we believe the financial implications of many of them are not understood by legislators.  The social fund must be used as the backstop for increased levels of employee support, as it is on the Continent.  This will require higher levels of employee contribution.  Significant disincentives persist against employees returning to the workforce in the &euro;18,000 to &euro;30,000 per annum income bands.  We ask legislators to look at the four key proposals in our Jobs Kill Zone report in this regard.  That has been circulated to all Members of the Houses.</p><p> There is a disgraceful lack of clarity on the rights of employers and employees to know the vaccination status of co-workers returning to the workplace.  This places employers in the invidious position of being "damned if they do and damned if they don't".  This is unacceptable and must be addressed before a minority of cynical members of the legal profession attempt to exploit it.  GDPR is not an impediment to ascertaining the vaccination status of a returning employee.</p><p> There is a continued failure on the part of the Government to engage with SME employers.  The only standing liaison body between the Government, employers and employee representatives is the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, and it excludes SME representatives.  This is unsustainable.  The failure to engage with small enterprise employers is having a serious impact on the development and update of the Work Safely Protocol since its focus is on large enterprises and excludes consideration of 99% of Ireland's employers.</p><p> The detail behind this summary follows in the submission.  I am happy to take questions now.</p></speech>

I invite members to discuss this issue with the witnesses.  I remind them to use the "raise hand" function on Teams and, importantly, when they are finished speaking to take it down.  The first person who has indicated to speak - we will go with the roster we have in place - is Deputy Louise O'Reilly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061600002#C00300"><p>I thank our witnesses for giving their time and making their submissions to us.  I have a couple of questions and I hope to get in on the second round to divert slightly from this topic and to have a quick chat with Mr. Berney about the aviation sector, but I will stick to the kernel of the submissions for the moment.</p><p>I will address Mr. McDonnell in the first instance.  He gives links or provides what he says is evidence - anecdotal evidence - relating to people not returning to work.  As Dr. Bambrick demonstrated last year, however, 400,000 people voluntarily gave up their PUP claims and returned to work, so all the evidence suggests that the opposite is the case.  I refer Mr. McDonnell to a tweet from Mr. Pat Phelan of the SISU clinic.  This is backed by Michael Harty of Home Care Direct.  Mr. Phelan tweeted:</p> <blockquote> 	Sick to my back teeth of hearing it's hard to get staff<br /><br />It's absolutely not<br /><br />It's hard to get cheap staff<br /><br />Hired 10 people in last 10 weeks not a problem.<br /><br />Free private Healthcare, free contributory pension<br /><br />Zero issues<br /><br />Pay your teams </blockquote> <p>I will not continue reading out the tweet, but Mr. Phelan basically said that decent pay and good, fair conditions mean that it is actually not a problem to hire staff.  Would Mr. McDonnell have any comment to make on that?  As I said, all the available evidence presented by Dr. Bambrick this morning and by business people suggests that there is not an issue.  The Department of Social Protection does not have a huge number of people complaining about it.  To me it seems very simple: you pay your workers well and treat them decently and you will not have the problem that Mr. McDonnell claims is there but for which the only evidence is anecdotal at this stage.  Mr. McDonnell might care to respond to what Mr. Phelan said about the treatment of workers.</p></speech>

What I will say is that we have been very specific.  I have not said the problem is across the board.  I referred to four sectors.  This is no more anecdotal than the tweet the Deputy has just read out to me.  It is a matter of fact in the agriculture sector, in catering and in hospitality.  It is a particular issue, let us be honest, in those areas where it is not full-time work that is on offer but, typically, part-time work of the order of 20 hours per week.  There is no point in saying to a pub, a hotel or a restaurant - the pubs are not open yet but the restaurants will open next month - "If you employ everyone on a 39-hour week, the problem will go away", or "If you increase your rates of pay, the problem will go away".  It will not go away unless we start charging people through the nose.  The-----</p></speech>

He has not provided any evidence and is referring specifically to sectors that are not yet fully open, so I do not think we have a full picture.  The evidence we have is the fact that 400,000 people last year voluntarily gave up their social welfare claims and went back to work.</p></speech>

Nobody is disputing that.  Those people voluntarily gave up their claims and went back to work when their sectors reopened.  Mr. McDonnell is referring specifically to sectors that are not yet fully open.  He is talking about part-time work.  Whether he has heard of Mr. Pat Phelan or not is entirely immaterial.  If we are just trading anecdotes at this stage - and, let us be frank, that is all we are doing because Mr. McDonnell has not provided any hard evidence - all the available evidence suggests that people will go back to work when the work is offered and that the best incentive to go back to work is decent pay and fair conditions.  I do not see that there is anything to disagree with in that.</p></speech>

What I am providing for him is information from another person in the business field who says the best way to attract workers is to pay them well and to give them decent conditions.  I do not want to be diverted down a road on this, but it is a fact that Mr. McDonnell has presented no evidence to us this morning other than a reference to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, and that is just not scientific.</p></speech>

I have heard from a shopkeeper from Sligo who advertised for a deli position for 20 hours per week.  He said he normally gets a mix of applicants and that the position suits third level students and stay-at-home parents.  He got 23 applicants.  Two were from India and the rest were all leaving certificate students looking for their first jobs.  No one on the PUP applied.  By all means, the Deputy can say that that is anecdotal rather than evidence, but we are hearing that across the board.  I remind her that the picking season is for the next three months.  That will not be diverted by anything Deputies decide in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.

What we are calling into question is both the baseless claim that this is caused by the PUP and the way in which the unusual is being presented as representative.  If the PUP is not causing these struggles to find new staff, what is?  As was mentioned, there is an evidence base of how workers have responded because, unfortunately, this is not our first reopening.</p> <p>  Ours is a rich economy, and if we look at what is happening in other rich economies farther down the road in reopening, there is evidence that they too are struggling to get workers in hospitality, the beauty services and agriculture.  Because they are further down the line, they have an evidence base and they are asking what is causing this.  In many instances, those countries do not have a PUP-equivalent payment.  They have found that these sectors are disproportionately reliant on cheap migrant labour.  Many such workers over the past 15 months have returned to their home countries.  We do not have the same inflow of migrant labour at the pace we normally would to pick fruit or to work in the hospitality sector because they are not coming and people are fearful that we might go into a new lockdown.</p> <p>  Businesses are also finding that those workers who are resident here in the long term or are native to the country have changed sectors.  In many cases, they have moved into retail, which does not have significantly better conditions but can provide regular hours and regular pay.  They will, therefore, have changed employers or sectors and, in some instances, left employment.  This is typical for a second earner in the household   People have woken up and asked why they are killing themselves working for those 15 hours at the cost of their quality of life and family life.  They may have decided to cut their spending to suit and gone for time over money.</p> <p>  As the Deputy noted, only 75 employers contacted the Department of Social Protection during May.  It is not the most robust measure, given that not all employers will pick up the phone and complain, but when those employers complain to the Department, it will take the information of the 75 people who have refused their jobs, it will have those cases investigated and tell the employers how many of their former employees are no longer in the country and not claiming the PUP, how many have changed employer and how many are under further investigation.  The numbers under further investigation would not get even a footnote in the newspaper, never mind the front page.  There is a need for follow-up questioning by journalists who are willing to take individual experience and generalise it as if this is widespread.</p> <p>  I would like to address the suggestion that part-time workers do not want to return to work.  The majority of exits from the PUP in recent weeks have been from the under-25s, who are disproportionately the lowest-paid workers and are mainly from the hospitality sector.  As sectors are reopening, and hospitality has not fully reopened, we are seeing movement.  There are some difficulties with rehiring - Ireland is not unusual in that - but this is being misdiagnosed as a problem with the PUP.  A recent report published by the IMF, not a natural bedfellow of the trade union movement, showed that during pandemics, when fiscal supports to both business and workers are removed too soon, it has a devastating impact.</p> <p>  As a word of warning, businesses should be careful what they wish for.  Otherwise, there will be a negative impact for them because much of the PUP went into their cash registers.</p></speech>

SMEs have warehoused about &euro;1 billion in debt, a very scary figure, although much of it relates to the advance credit for trading expenses and so on.  My fear, and I am interested in hearing Mr. McDonnell's view on this, is that much of the debt relates to rent.  There are viable, good, decent businesses that could restart, but the issue with them relates not so much to the debt but rather to the back rent that will impede them.  Does Mr. McDonnell have any information on the numbers in that regard or what the potential impact of that will be?  For some businesses, we cannot know because they are not yet open, although we will when they pull up the shutters and the bills start to arrive.  My fear is that the shutters will go up, there will be six weeks of trading and they will be forced to go, and rent makes up a considerable part of that.  I cannot count the number of occasions on which I have raised this with the T&aacute;naiste.  There does not seem to be any movement on that but I would be interested in hearing Mr. McDonnell's comments.</p></speech>

During the previous recession, the banks effectively foreclosed on people and businesses.  This time it is different, and the banks are now substantially behind the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, legislation coming out of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p> <p>  I have recently been coming to town only once a month, to process the payroll.  I walk up Grafton Street and I am still getting my head around the changes in some of the shop windows.  There is 30% non-occupancy already in Henry Street and Mary Street, and that is in Dublin, so one can imagine the effect there will be on main streets down the country.  One reason we have asked Members of the Oireachtas to be firm on this is that we know they will be lobbied hard to remove lease provisions from the SCARP legislation when it comes before the Houses.  What we say to landlords is that there will be a pretty fundamental reset for businesses, and especially for bricks-and-mortar retail.  They will just have to get their heads around the fact that lease values will fall post Covid for all sorts of reasons, such as working from home.</p></speech>

I will focus on solutions and issues we need to consider now, following the Government set of decisions that have been published.  Many people would like to see big changes, but the Government has been supporting the economy at a cost of &euro;2 billion per month and there is a need to draw back from that.  Very large suggestions, of either new tax cuts or new spending programmes, will be challenging in that atmosphere.</p> <p>  What changes in viability supports are needed?  What changes are needed in regard to transition measures for people who have been impacted or who are going to find it a difficult number of months?  Finally, what are our guests' views on the longer-term structural issues?</p> <p>  As for the transition, will our guests from ICTU give an idea of how the short-time work scheme might work?  Could it be piloted in a sector that has particular difficulties with a start date and an end date in order that there could be a cost-benefit analysis to see how far it might get us?  I would be interested to hear ICTU's reaction to various active labour market measures, as they used to be called; I think they have a new name.  I refer to measures such as work experience, the new training programmes and the evolving apprenticeship programme.</p><p>I would be specifically interested in the comment on childcare or the transition changes in childcare that we need to be thinking about.</p><p> I would like to congratulate ISME for having pioneered the examinership-lite that is now hitting the Statute Book and is a very important measure.  We now have rates relief, extended EWSS, SCARP, a number of business supports, online supports, access to credit and so on.  Where is the shoe pinching in terms of that array of measures?  Where are the gaps that the Government could start to look at in a targeted way?</p><p> Mr. McDonnell threw out the issue that the vaccination status of co-workers could be exploited by lawyers.  Perhaps he would elaborate on that.</p><p> Clearly, we have long-term structural changes.  Some of those relate to sick pay, the living wage and so on, and some are more around big things like how we adapt to a circular economy and the climate challenges.  In terms of direction as we exit to build back better, as they say, do the witnesses have advice on how we build back better?</p></speech>

On the viability supports, I appreciate this is a very difficult issue and it is sectoral.  Let us understand that some sectors have actually done better during this period.  For example, the pharmaceutical and medical sectors and quite a lot of our multinational sector have done better.  Getting visibility on this is going to be difficult.  One thing that might be possible is perhaps, in some of those troubled areas, to look at the equivalent of the paycheck protection program, PPP, that was tried in the United States, so that there might be an element of debt forgiveness for some businesses that maintained their workforces, for example.  That was quite popular in the United States.</p> <p>  We acknowledge that the supports have to taper.  I hope there would not be a difference between us and, say, ICTU in terms of tapering the PUP.  For example, one thing that could be done in order not to discourage people from going back to work is to apply the earnings allowance that applies to the self-employed.  Perhaps we could look at giving that to people so they would not be discouraged from going back to work and they could make some earnings without disqualifying themselves from the PUP.</p> <p>  On the vaccination issue, I have to be very careful because a complaint has gone to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, LSRA, in regard to a particular blog or advertisement from a solicitor.  What I will say is that, in particular sectors where social distancing is very difficult to maintain, such as grooming and retail, on the one hand, a minority of staff are saying, &ldquo;I am not getting vaccinated for reason X&rdquo;, whatever it is, and other members of staff are saying, &ldquo;I am not going to work with an unvaccinated colleague.&rdquo;  The employers, unfortunately, have been left high and dry on this.  On the one hand, they are at risk from the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, or from a complaint going in to the workplace surveillance unit in Kilkenny if they do not act on this.  On the other hand, they are dealing with the possibility that if they attempt to intervene in this area, a worker complaint could go in to the Workplace Relations Commission.  In addition, committee members do not need me to tell them there are a number of solicitors who are very active in this area.  Employers, unfortunately, feel they have been left to manage this issue in a complete grey area, and they are asking for some degree of certainty on this.</p></speech>

To clarify, Congress acknowledges that the income and wage supports are temporary and are intended to be a temporary measure.  We are not looking for them to be made permanent.  However, we want them to remain in place until the economy fully recovers.  It is not possible to take a sectoral approach to the PUP.  The Department of Social Protection does not collect information in that way and many people have jobs that are indirectly related to business coming from different sectors.  There are all types of problems.  That was really at the root of continuing with the PUP as it stands until September, which was to give us that opportunity to reopen and see where we are before we taper.  When we say we are not standing over it, we mean that tapering will start if parts of the economy are still not fully reopened but that should be done in tandem with the myriad supports that are there for businesses as well.  We cannot remove it from workers and, at the same time, say it is needed for business.  We cannot say "There is a job there for everyone who wants it&rdquo; to the 270,000 people who are still on the PUP, but at the same time-----</p></speech>

At the same time, we recognise that not all previous jobs will return and that the impact of the pandemic on the labour force has been uneven.  It has impacted younger workers, unskilled workers, migrant workers and part-time workers, and if we cannot deliver their jobs back, we are going to have to deliver them the skills.  Unfortunately, we have not had the new pathways to work strategy and the new youth employment charter, so we cannot comment on that.  My colleague might want to comment on the other issues.</p></speech>

I believe the whole situation is much more nuanced than some people might like to categorise it.  From my own experience of listening to small businesses, we must remember that small business owners are workers as well, so it is not a simple black-and-white case of the poor workers and the mean employers.  We have 250,000 small businesses in Ireland which, for the most part, treat their staff excellently and pay them well, and that is why they have survived and why many of them have managed to stay alive despite Covid.  It is very important that we value and appreciate that.  It is nuanced and we have to be careful how we oversimplify the challenges for both workers and employers, who are often workers themselves.</p> <p>  Probably the hardest work is in small companies.  Both of my sisters are small employers and they both have about ten staff.  They probably work 80 hours a week, probably harder and longer than any of their staff, who are absolutely brilliant and who they value a lot.  It is very important that we make it clear that many small business owners treat their staff really well.  That is why I want to hear how we can further support small businesses, and when I say that, I do not just mean the owners but their staff as well.  I would like to hear more on what else we can do to support them and help them to survive, because it is such a huge area.</p> <p>  A previous speaker said that the sectors are not fully open.  However, the agriculture sector is fully open, from my point of view down in Clare, although I do not know about Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s area.  As far as I am concerned, they are working 15-hour days when they get a chance to cut silage and so on.  Many food growers have contacted me to say they cannot get the staff.  Dr. Bambrick made the interesting point that they have been dependent on people from overseas but they are paying the minimum wage.</p><p>How will we solve this problem?  People who cannot get staff are willing to pay any amount to get the job done.  They need the food harvested because it is seasonal.  They cannot wait until people come back from other countries.  They are not trying to take shortcuts and not pay them properly.  They will pay any amount at this stage to get people to help them with the harvest.  How will we do that?  There are some cases - do not shoot me down for saying it - of people staying on PUP when there are jobs available.</p><p> I have spoken to an Intreo office about this.  As an example, a mushroom grower contacted me a couple of months ago, in Carlow or Kilkenny, and he could not get staff.  Nobody applied for jobs yet there were 470 people in the same area on the live register or the PUP.  I contacted the Intreo office and it clarified for me - if members want statistics and facts, not just a little anecdote - that there were more than 400 people on the PUP but none of them applied for the job.  I am not saying that people have to come off the PUP because there is a job available picking mushrooms, but are we missing a piece to this?  Employers are not allowed to engage directly with Intreo offices and I am not sure how we fit that piece into the jigsaw.  I believe most people want to go back to work, but perhaps there is a missing piece or the way we link people who are on PUP or unemployment benefits with the businesses that want to pay them properly to go to work, even if it is only short-term.  We cannot blame people for wanting only part-time workers if it is a seasonal thing.  That does not mean that they only want part-time staff.  It just means that they need more staff when crops are in season.  I am curious to hear from Mr. McDonnell about that.  What is the missing piece in this because pay is not an issue as they are paying above the minimum wage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.46" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil McDonnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021061600002#F00200"><p>We briefly summarised much of that.  Many of the statistics Senator Garvey referred to will only emerge in time, when the Department of Social Protection and Intreo say what is going on on the ground.  At the beginning of my submission, I used the expression of being in "a state of denial" and we appeared to have some words about it.  Further on in our submission, we referenced a previous submission given to the committee on the Jobs Kill Zone.  We should talk about to the disincentives that exist for workers earning between &euro;18,000 and &euro;30,000 per annum.  If we take that back to hourly wages, &euro;30,000 per annum equates to &euro;14.79 an hour, in a standard working week.  When earning &euro;17.41 an hour, a person goes on to the marginal rate of tax.  Ireland's tax system scoots up very quickly and there are significant inducements for people, especially single parents or parents of two or more children, who are on any form of social protection payments.  There are significant disincentives for them to exit unemployment.</p> <p>  We have made four simple recommendations - I will be quick outlining these.  First, the PRSI charge should be adjusted to eliminate the very high marginal rate deduction on people earning between &euro;18,300 and &euro;22,000 per annum.  Second, the basic rate for qualifying for the medical card should be set at more than 30% above the jobseeker's rate.  Third, the child element in the jobseeker's payment, and in all other welfare payments, should be replaced with a significantly increased child benefit payment.  The working family benefit should be phased out and that higher child benefit payment should be taxed.  Fourth, and final, the income thresholds for access to social housing should be looked at, which in some parts of the country are as low as &euro;25,000 for a single person.  Let us not kid ourselves: our welfare system actively discourages people from going to work.  It is not that people are lazy, they are economically rational by not going to work.  If I were in their position, I would not go to work because I would have a family to feed.  It is as simple as that.  It is in the members' gift to address those things in the social welfare system.</p></speech>

When I went back to work, I was certainly out of pocket, so I completely concur with McDonnell.  It was a hard thing to do but for my self-worth it meant more to me to go back to work.  I lost the medical card and rent allowance.  I was not on high earnings so I was down in terms of money.  I understand where Mr. McDonnell is coming from.  There are probably more nuanced situations for other people in different cases.  I appreciate that.</p></speech>

I will start with Mr. McDonnell in regard to the call for an accelerated cut in the PUP.  Previous speakers have gone over the evidence, or lack thereof, of the case he is making, that ISME's members are finding it difficult to get workers as a consequence of people being on the PUP.  Is the other side of that equation not an admission that some of ISME's members are paying poverty-level wages?  If ISME wants to get people back to work, should businesses not be paying people a decent level of income that is more than &euro;350 a week?  Therefore, taking Mr. McDonnell's view that people act as rational agents, people would be incentivised to go to work because they are going to get an improved standard of living.  Let us be honest: &euro;350 a week does not provide people with have a high quality of life, especially if they have to pay to go to and from work and so on.</p></speech>

If Deputy Murphy knows of an employer who is doing that, he or she should be reported.  I deliberately went into detail with reference to our Jobs Kill Zone report.  The minimum wage is now &euro;10.20 and there is an argument for a living wage in excess of &euro;12.  The point we are making is that the jobs kills zone tops out at &euro;30,000 per annum - that is equivalent to &euro;17.41 per hour.  I do not know at what level Deputy Murphy wants to set the minimum wage because he is using loaded comments like "poverty wages".  If it is the decision of the members as legislators to increase the minimum wage to &euro;17.41, do so but there will be economic and employment consequences.</p> <p>  We find this debate very circular, sterile and not very productive.  The fact is, if the cost of labour keeps being increased, employers will use less labour.  I referred Members of the Houses to the Seattle minimum wage study, which was a large-scale study of what happened when Seattle increased its minimum wage from $9 to $11.  It did not have much effect in Seattle because Seattle was going gangbuster but there were severe impacts elsewhere.  Washington state is very much like Ireland.  It is a rural state with a big city on a seaboard.  The increase in the minimum wage did little or nothing, or reversed the situation, for lower paid people outside Seattle.</p> <p>  I do not see why we should be at loggerheads about this.  There are things that can be done within our social protection system that do not involve bidding up the cost of labour.  It should be the priority of members to look at that rather than simply putting up the minimum wage to &euro;17 an hour.</p></speech>

As it happens, my partner was the organising director for the 15 Now campaign in Seattle.  She would certainly dispute some of what Mr. McDonnell has said about the impact that had in terms of raising the floor for all workers in Seattle.  That obviously became a national campaign.</p><p>Moving on to the issue of sick pay, Mr. McDonnell was quoted in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>at the weekend, and he referred to it in his submission, effectively criticising elements of the statutory sick pay scheme.  He opposed the ten-day entitlement which will be in place by 2025 and called for the burden of payment to be place on workers, so that workers pay for their own sick pay scheme.</p><p>One of the things Mr. McDonnell is quoted as saying is that he had had the unfortunate need to dismiss people for that level of absence when he was working in the haulage sector, when people were taking ten days of sick pay.  Is it ISME policy to sack workers for taking sick days?</p></speech>

When that termination was over and I left the room, and I will not say where, with a trade union official, he said to me, "You should have done that a long time ago, Mr. McDonnell."  There is a notion that many people think that co-workers should be able to go sick as often as they want, and the people who are most discommoded by that are their colleagues.  What we have said, and again, this is very clear in the submission we have made, is that the burden for this should fall on the Social Fund, not on the employee, but what we are saying, and the Deputy is correct when he says this much, is that where Ireland is a significant outlier by comparison with other European countries is on the social contribution made by employees at 4%.  It is in excess of 20% for some income earners in France.  Yes, our 11.05% contribution is relatively low by comparison with some, but I ask the committee members to bear in mind that the auto-enrolment proposals which are before them - I know they have been pushed out somewhat - refer to about a 6% contribution to auto-enrolment from the employer.  That would take the employer's wage tax to 17.05%, so the committee needs to look at these things in the round.</p> <p>  The kind of philosophical point we are again making is that the Members are the legislators, it is in their gift to increase these charges as much as they want, and it should be borne in mind we have the second highest minimum wage in Europe.  We also have the second highest cost of living in Europe, and the country with the highest cost of living does not have a minimum wage at all.  But we also have the most progressive tax system in the EU and the second most progressive tax system in the OECD.  These are-----</p></speech>

I do not wish to get involved in philosophical arguments about employee rights or enterprise rights.  Many people out there, particularly in the private sector, are looking for answers and support from the State.  I commend ISME on the work it has done on SCARP, which I think Deputy Bruton has already mentioned, and on insurance reform.  I think those measures have been very much welcomed by private sector employers in particular, and it is hoped we will see reforms and cost savings from that.</p> <p>  I refer to the ISME report.  Senator Garvey spoke about it.  We have to do something about the jobs kill zone.  There is a lot of anecdotal evidence supporting the fact that many people just cannot afford to take on employment in that threshold area.  We have to try to see how we can incentivise people to get back into the work zone.  It is also worth noting in ISME's statement that only 40% of SMEs, according to the Central Bank's April report on SMEs, are functioning profitably at the moment.  I think that might be an overstatement when we get into the far side of understanding what Covid has delivered.</p> <p>  I have brought up at this committee a number of times the absence of ISME from the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF.  I am a firm believer that ISME should be a member of that.  Will Mr. McDonnell outline why he thinks this should be the case and why it is not the case?</p></speech>

Then partnership effectively went by the wayside.  Parties withdrew from it in the great recession and then it sort of restarted quietly under the Administration in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il as the Labour Employer Economic Forum, but we are not members of that.  This is not simply an issue of negotiating terms and conditions of employment and so on.  We make specific reference to, for example, workplace health and safety, which have obviously troubled us since the start of the pandemic.  I mean this as no criticism of the people who came up with the Work Safely Protocol 1 and 2, but they were very clearly drawn up with big businesses and big premises in mind and assigning a manager who would look after someone on the premises who was symptomatic, having an allocated room in which to put someone who was symptomatic, sending him or her home and making sure he or she did not use public transport.  Quite frankly, we have people doing these protocols who have never worked in a corner shop, a caf&eacute; or a hairdressing shop.  Those Work Safely Protocols would never have been generated as was had there been a small business involvement in it.  Obviously, now, as we talk about other things such as those we have talked about today, for example, statutory sick pay, the living wage, the minimum wage and so on, these things are meaningless if the 99% of employers who make up the business demography in the country are ignored.  ISME would say that unless LEEF somehow takes in the SME sector, it is just a group of people in the State sector and the multinational sector talking to each other.</p></speech>

These issues have all been brought to the table of the Government from outside LEEF because they are not priorities for anyone inside LEEF.  It is as simple as that.</p></speech>

We had the Minister of State, Deputy English, with us yesterday morning and I asked him this question.  I do not want to say he was evasive but he certainly did not give any comfort or say leases and landlord arrangements would come under the remit of SCARP.  It sounded as if he was saying legally they could not.  Will Mr. McDonnell outline what he believes the main problems with scoping this in terms of SCARP will be and the pressures that will bring on employers into the future?</p></speech>

They will probably also come under pressure from Revenue, telling them what they can and cannot do.  I got a call this morning from a business that has been shuttered since March of last year until this month.</p><p>This is not just an issue with private landlords.  This business has been contacted by Dublin City Council advising it that its rent will be increased but it has been shut for a year.  The State acts as landlord as well.<br/><br/>We have been arguing for a long time about upward only rents and so on.  A completely bogus assertion has been made that leases constitute property rights that cannot be touched and it is <i>verboten</i>to go near them at all.  That simply is not true under the Constitution.  We had a legal opinion to that effect from a senior counsel who is now a member of the Supreme Court.  Anyone can take that on, including Dublin City Council by all means.<br/><br/>We need to get real.  We have had a kind of a steroidal residential and commercial property market in Ireland.  In commercial property, it has been underpinned by these leases that do not reflect real commercial value.  We now have Dublin City Council putting the gun to the head of a business that has been shut for a year.  The committee needs to understand where some of the pressure will come on legislators in the next number of months.</p></speech>

The decision by Aer Lingus to close its cabin crew base in Shannon Airport, as well as the more recent decision of Stobart Air to cease trading in the Republic of Ireland, along with the implications of that, brings into sharp focus what we have been trying to point out for a number of months, namely, aviation will be one of the last sectors to emerge from and recover fully from the pandemic, if it ever does.</p> <p>  We need to be focused on what particular supports are required to keep a functioning aviation sector in the economy.  As an island economy, we rely crucially on aviation for connectivity, business and many other purposes.  We need to be mindful that decisions could well be taken outside of the country about companies that operate in the aviation sector.  The Oireachtas and trade unions with members in those companies will have little or no say in this.  Shareholders and multinational companies may well decide that keeping an aviation business in Ireland that continues to make losses is not something they are prepared to do.</p> <p>  Much has been said about the aviation sector.  Yesterday, the Minister for Transport spoke about the ending of the restrictions on non-essential travel on 19 July.  Even after that date, supports will be required for the aviation sector.  Deputy Bruton asked earlier about an appropriate place for the piloting of a short-term working scheme.  Aviation would be a perfect fit for that.  It will take some time for workers in aviation to get back to the level of activity that they would have been involved in prior to the pandemic.</p> <p>  Shannon Airport has been significantly challenged for quite some time.  A decision was taken by a previous Government to separate Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority.  That was a mistake.  We said so at the time.  We believe the reintegration of the three State airports into a single company would be the best way to protect Shannon Airport in the future.</p></speech>

Would the employer continue to employ people for part-time hours?  Would training schemes make up the balance?  Will the witnesses talk through how a scheme like that might work in the airline sector?</p> <p>  If the rebate for employers on redundancy were to be a temporary scheme for a short period, how would it work?  I assume it would be substantially expensive to do that forever.  Would it work as a temporary scheme?</p> <p>  Should we consider a revival of the back to work allowance, which allowed people to go back to work but retain some supports such as the pandemic unemployment payment?  Mr. Neil McDonnell put forward some more permanent tax changes.  In the context of the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, Mr. McDonnell talked about the availability of equity.  Will there be many zombie companies coming out of that process that cannot rebuild because of difficulties due to the lack of equity undermining their access to finance?  Has there been any thinking about those areas?</p> <p>  Dr. Laura Bambrick referred to the transition period and issues in accessing childcare.  Are there practical suggestions that might bridge the difficulties for certain people who are trying to return to work but have childcare problems in that transition period?</p></speech>

Workers would be given a guarantee of a significant proportion of their net income.  The employer would employ them for as much time as they could.  The remainder of the time may be used to engage in upskilling to address future skills needs of the company or the general sector.  That is the way these schemes work in other places.  The balance of the money not paid by the employer is paid through the social welfare system.</p> <p>  Some of the forecasts for the aviation sector from industry experts are quite scary.  Some have said that 2019 levels of activity will not be seen again in aviation until as late as 2026.  That shows the need for a detailed look at how aviation employers and workers are supported into the future.  If we do not, there is a possibility that decisions will be taken outside of the State that will damage the aviation.  The sector is important to its workers and to the economy more generally.</p></speech>

The first was on the rebate and the notion that it would be temporary.  If I can be blunt for a moment, we say that the removal of the rebate ten years ago was a mistake.  Therefore, the mistake should be reversed and the rebate should be reinstituted because the 0.5% charge on employers' PRSI is quite permanent.  We are simply saying that the money is paid into the Social Insurance Fund by employers to fund statutory redundancy and one can only recover 60% of statutory redundancy.  We understand that as well, because there had to be some moral hazard on employers to stop them laying off people willy-nilly.  An employer bears 40% of the cost of laying people off.  It was a mistake.  If you make it very hard for businesses to lay off people when times are bad, they will be extremely reluctant to hire people full-time when times change.  By way of illustration of that, one of the queries we get now from the grooming sector is that people are setting up hair dressing salons where they are not employing anyone: what they are doing is setting up a nicely branded salon and doing what is known as "rent a chair".  They are letting people come in, which is discouraging full-time employment.  The Government really needs to think about the unintended consequences of the actions that are taken.</p> <p>  On the zombie company issue, post the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, there is no greater risk of zombies emerging from SCARP than there is from examinership.  When an insolvency practitioner looks at an insolvent company and tries to put in a scheme of arrangement, in most cases he or she will be seeking equity.  If no one is willing to put in equity, that is the first red flag that we are not dealing with a business that is going to survive.  There is moral hazard in this system.  If the creditors do not like it and if the insolvency practitioners themselves do not like it then it is not going to happen.  Perhaps one of the advantages of the pandemic is that we are going to see a lot of zombie companies exit the economy because there is a considerable number of them.  I know it is something that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment tracks.  We must bear in mind that where there is a good examinership regime, if we look at the UK, they will only rescue 10% to 15% of businesses that become insolvent.  To be honest, I do not see a risk of maintenance of zombie companies.</p></speech>

However, many carers, who are entitled to work for 19 hours a week, are claimants in the &euro;200 to &euro;250 PUP category.  We have not had a return of day services centres for older vulnerable people so a lot of carers who are also PUP claimants are not in a good position.  This has been a really neglected sector and group of people.</p> <p>  On the return of the statutory redundancy rebates even for a short time, there is already a facility whereby if a company that is continuing to trade but is unable to make statutory payments, once it is able to show an inability to pay either through an accountant or legal person, the Social Insurance Fund will pay the statutory payment but the business continues to have a liability to the Social Insurance Fund.</p></speech>

We were talking about who is going to pay for this.  He spoke about low rates of employees' PRSI.  We could make the choice to improve workers' conditions but then someone has to pay.  How about we make the choice that employers' PRSI should rise, considering that we have the lowest employers' PRSI in all of Europe?  Part of developing a proper social insurance model would be to significantly increase the amount of employers' PRSI.  That way we could afford to pay decent sick pay and other benefits.  How would ISME respond to that?</p></speech>

What we are saying is we do have one of the lowest rates in Europe.  That is not contested.  We are <i>ad idem</i>on that, so let us not make differences where we seek to make differences.  One of the interesting factors with our social insurance system is that while we have a low rate of deduction, we also have a very low rate of entitlement and those entitlements are means tested.  If we go back some years, there used to be something called the income cap.  I will not comment on the Deputy's age, but he may not remember it.  In recognition of the fact that benefits were capped, there was a &euro;50,000 cap on employees' PRSI.  It went to &euro;75,000 and then it was eliminated altogether.  There is no cap on employers' PRSI.  Albeit PRSI is at rates that are a European low, we do not have universal access to healthcare and our benefits are all capped, so jobseeker's benefit, for example, has a hard cap on it.  I note this is under consideration and it will be among the issues considered by the welfare and taxation commission.  Thankfully, one of the good things to come out of the pandemic is that we are talking about social insurance now, so one will get a benefit as a percentage of one's salary rather than as &euro;203 a week.<br/><br/>If the Government decides it wants to put employers' PRSI to 30%, that is an entirely valid output and consideration from the Legislature.  What we are saying is that if that happens, the ability of employers to employ labour will decrease commensurately.  The other point is that it would disproportionately affect the low-skilled and the no-skilled.  It would simply put up the cost of labour.  The Government must put employers' PRSI at whatever rate it thinks is appropriate.  It will not get an intellectual or moral pushback from us.  We are just saying that if one has a business that delivers a service or manufactures a good, in SMEs the cost of labour can be up to 86%.  If the Government severely impacts the cost of labour, then it will impact the ability of the business to sell.  That is all.</p></speech>

In rich economies, of which Ireland is one, having an occupational pension - auto enrolment was mentioned earlier &ndash; and having paid sick leave from one's employer is a normal part of the worker's compensation package.  Ireland is the only OECD country that does not have an occupational pension with contributions from the employer.  Up until last week we were one of a handful of rich countries where the employer is not legally required to pay sick pay.  Should employers pay more social insurance?  Absolutely.  That is where the gap in the Government's revenue is coming.  We are a low tax economy and the gap is mostly made up from social insurance contributions from employers and the self-employed.  However, the normal practice in how sick pay works is that for a period, from anything between two weeks and two years, the employer is responsible for the full cost and after that it is social insurance, if the illness continues longer than the entitlement.  It is not a case of saying if we increase social insurance then employers will not have out-of-pocket expenses for pensions and for sick pay.  It is the way the rest of the developed, rich economies have worked.</p><p>They do not have massive<b></b>unemployment or underemployment.  We have heard the same arguments against employer groups every time we have had modest, progressive improvements in the pay and conditions of workers.  This was the case with the introduction of annual leave in the 1930s, equal pay for women in the 1970s, a national minimum wage in 2000 and every other modest improvement since.  The sick pay scheme introduced last week, contained in the Bill that will be coming before the House, is very modest.  It will be introduced over four years.  At the maximum, it will involve the equivalent of a 2.5% increase at the top of the income earned before the cap over four years.</p></speech>

His submission states SMEs now need "a bailout with recovery funds ... on favourable terms of at least &euro;15 billion to reboot the recovery of society and our economy".  I am not necessarily opposed to his suggestion but I would have to see the details of what such bailouts would look like.  He also mentioned that two thirds of his members would have availed of the TWSS or EWSS, or have been in receipt of billions of euro of State funds to allow them to survive and continue.  I wonder, however, whether there is not a certain irony in his coming here today with his two core messages, one being that there should be an acceleration of the cuts for workers who lost their jobs during the pandemic because the money being given to them is distorting the labour market and the other being that more money should go to businesses.  Does the second one not also distort the market?  I base this question on ISME's vision of rational agents and people not doing work because they get so much on the PUP, etc.  I am not advocating this but if we cut the supports for businesses across the board, would it not incentivise them to be more efficient based on the logic Mr. McDonnell applies to PUP recipients?</p></speech>

To be very clear, the PUP is a payment made directly to an employee or former employee and the EWSS payment is a payment that goes via the company to the employee.  The Revenue Commissioners are quite rightly auditing businesses to make sure this occurs.  The direct non-debt supports to business have been very small.  They have been among the smallest in Europe.  I do not have the direct grant-assistance figures in front of me.  The last figures were produced by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on 21 May but the grant supports have been of the order of &euro;350 million to &euro;400 million.  This is greatly appreciated and we are not knocking it but the rest has been debt-based.  There has been no appetite to take up that debt.  The credit guarantee scheme-----</p></speech>

He said there is potentially a constitutional problem with addressing upward-only rents and that he has legal advice &mdash; from the Supreme Court, I believe &mdash; to that effect.  Could he clarify that?</p></speech>

Funnily enough, a constant refrain from landlords before the establishment of the rent pressure zones was that one could not go near leases for constitutional reasons, yet when the State had to intervene to control rents, lo and behold, we had rent pressure zones.  There has been a persistent invocation of the Constitution to state leases cannot be touched because they involve a property right.  I said somewhat flippantly at a different forum, thereby revealing my age, that when I did constitutional law in University College Galway in the 1980s, the then lawyer said the 1937 Constitution is a very flexible document that protects the rights of the unborn and the right to life but also allows a convict to be taken out of his or her cell and hung by the neck until dead.  In short, there is no right in the 1937 Constitution that is not balanced by another.  Essentially, the guidance on leases refers to a public good requirement.  I appreciate that the Oireachtas has banned the signing of future upward-only rent review contracts but a great many historic ones remain extant, including ones involving the State or local authorities.  I gave only one example of one.  A local authority notifying a small business that has been shut for a year that its rent is going up is absolutely absurd.  It shows the intellectual disconnect between some people and what has been going on for the past year.</p></speech>

I look forward to receiving that correspondence.</p> <p>  Could I ask Mr. Berney a question on aviation?  He has highlighted his thoughts on the reintegration of State airports but there is also a problem regarding airlines.  What activity has Congress undertaken to support the air travel protocols that are being used, particularly in the United States, but which we have not decided to use yet?  Has Mr. Berney any perception of IAG's present attitude to Aer Lingus?  Does he believe Congress has a position on the State taking an increased shareholding in Aer Lingus?</p></speech>

We have recognised aviation as a problematic sector and have been encouraging the Government to act to open aviation as quickly as possible within the parameters of the available public health advice.  All the time, the view of Congress is guided by the public health advice.  The Government has taken a decision to open aviation or allow non-essential travel from 19 July.  We support that and believe there should be continued support for employers and employees in the aviation sector until it recovers.  As I pointed out in response to a question by Deputy Bruton, there are varying forecasts as to when there will be a full recovery of aviation.</p> <p>  With respect to the attitude of IAG to Aer Lingus, I would only be speculating.  I do not believe it is useful to do that.  Aer Lingus comprises 5% of the IAG group.  It is a small component of what is a very large organisation.  As everybody at this meeting will know, large business is very unsentimental in making business decisions.  I would genuinely be careful about decisions that may be taken strictly on the basis of revenue generation and such matters in boardrooms outside this country.  Whether IAG would be open, or the State would be willing, to take a shareholding in Aer Lingus is an interesting question.  I remember being in discussions with Deputy Paschal Donohoe and the current T&aacute;naiste when the State was desperate to get rid of the last 15% of its shareholding in Aer Lingus.  Various individuals, including me, have said decisions made in the past were mistakes.  Depending on how circumstances unfold, maybe we will reflect in a little while on whether the Government's selling of its 15% share in Aer Lingus was not also a mistake.  I would not like to speculate, however, on what IAG thinks of Aer Lingus at the moment.  It would not be worthwhile and I could possibly be wrong.</p></speech>

I apologise for having had to step out.  It was an unavoidable absence.</p><p> In respect of financial supports available, in his opening statement Mr. McDonnell mentioned that credit is not currently available at affordable rates or, indeed, on reasonable terms in comparison with our European neighbours.  While we may not agree on everything, I tend to agree with Mr. McDonnell on that.  I ask him to expand on that point and outline what could be done to address it.  There is not an endless supply of money.  Everybody knows that.  However, equally, we are storing up problems for ourselves if we do not support small to medium-sized businesses to recover from the pandemic.

Many of them are not applying for credit.  When the revamped credit guarantee scheme was announced last year, there was a lot of interest in it.  However, it should be borne in mind that the credit guarantee scheme has been on the go since 2012 and, historically, there has been an uptake rate of only 13%.  That did not substantially change with the new scheme.  Many members contacted me to tell me they had gone to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, completed their application, got an application number, gone to the bank and then the process went into the dust.  It seems to me that even with the State shouldering 80% of the risk, the banks did not view some of the SMEs as good risks.</p> <p>  I am aware that the Minister for Finance said, if the State gave a 100% guarantee, it would remove all moral hazard from borrowers.  I do not accept that.  We should not forget the debt is between the borrower and the lending institution.  The State only steps in if the debt is not repaid.  Only &euro;250 million of the &euro;2 billion available under the credit guarantee scheme has been lent to date.  There is no desire to take up the scheme.</p> <p>  That is why I referred at the outset to the US scheme.  I am not being naive.  I know the system is sometimes prone to some level of abuse.  However, when the abuse argument is raised, I make the point that robust anti-abuse measures should be put in place.  We should not refuse to take a measure because it is potentially subject to abuse.  Frankly, every law that is ever passed is going to be subject to some level of abuse.  If we were to follow the American model, there would be debt finance and there could be forgiveness for some of the debt down the line.  For example, the Legislature could take the view that if a business has maintained 100% or 90% of its workforce, a certain amount will be forgiven.  That is the sort of thing we could look at doing to potentially make debt more attractive.</p></speech>

I note he referred in his submission to two pieces of legislation, one of which I brought forward concerning domestic violence leave, and both of which are small amendments to the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  He stated very clearly he and his organisation are not in the habit of opposing legislation on workers' rights.  I offer him the opportunity to put his views on the record.  For my benefit and that of the other members, will outline what legislation in support of workers' rights his organisation has welcomed and supported?  I can see he has no great enthusiasm for the legislation to which he referred in his submission to the committee.  He also referenced the sick pay scheme.  I ask him to provide an example of two pieces of legislation on workers' rights he has welcomed.  He has the opportunity to put that on the record.</p></speech>

As a legislator, the Deputy is charged with bringing in laws that work for people and their employers.  I have no criticism of the legislation to which the Deputy referred inasmuch as they are well-intentioned pieces of legislation.  However, I and the people I represent are at a loss.  Why do we not simply bring in a compendium act?  Currently, we are dealing with six or seven pieces of primary legislation that deal with time away from work.  If we continue down the track of talking about taking leave on miscarriages or domestic violence, we will eventually end up with workers taking leave because they have been involved in a car accident or because something else has happened.</p></speech>

I will give Mr. McDonnell the opportunity to correct his point.  Comparing miscarriage and domestic violence to a car crash is really not appropriate.  I do not believe it was Mr. McDonnell's intention to make that comparison.  It is highly inappropriate.  He can correct his statement if he wishes.  Those two comparisons are not correct or right.  I wish to give Dr. Bambrick the opportunity to speak on the topic now.</p></speech>

When measures such as the sick pay scheme are introduced, they are brought in to bring us into line with what is happening elsewhere.  If we want to become a modern economy and continue to attract workers who have experience of working in labour markets internationally, we must be on a par with the normal standards those workers expect.</p> <p>  With legislation for leave for domestic violence, maternity, breastfeeding and so on, only the very unusual person will require all the leave.  That should be borne in mind.  ICTU can only hope any legislation we call for is delivered.  We are most fortunate when it happens.  A lot of the legislation we have called for is only in the early stages.  I return to the point that very few workers will require the legislation and all the measures if they are introduced.</p></speech>

If we do not, the Stobart announcement will not be the last.

The mortgage tracker scandal has revealed attempts by most Irish banks to charge interest well above what the law allows.  Sadly, banks have used loopholes to avoid the Central Bank&rsquo;s tracker mortgage examination.  The Central Bank has warned that high interest rates often push customers into unnecessary default.  In the rush to window dress with short-term artificial profits, banks create considerable long-term problems for themselves and their customers and lessons from the banking crises are ignored.  Many defaulting customer loans are sold to vulture funds at huge discounts.  Tony Lawlor has first-hand experience of some of these obstacles and will address this committee shortly.</p> <p>  The Central Bank wants commercial banks to examine buy-to-let customers as part of the tracker process, yet banks say that only home loans qualify as tracker.  In addition, some banks will only advance Covid-19 loans provided those customers reclassify themselves as non-consumers thus enabling banks to use unfair terms and avoid a tracker examination by failing to retain historic interest rates.  Banks have used this opportunity to increase interest rates without justification or customer consent.  One bank has forced a customer to sell his property at distressed prices and even threatened the auctioneer with legal action if they attempted otherwise.  Worryingly, the Irish courts believe there is nothing wrong, otherwise, the Central Bank would have investigated this behaviour.</p> <p>  The second topic I intend to discuss is banking licences.  To the distress of many borrowers, the Irish courts will not examine whether the former mortgage provider IIB Homeloans and Finance Limited had a proper licence before 2008 thereby causing illegal repossessions.  Courts say the burden of proof rests with the borrower not with the bank.  IIB Homeloans has refused to confirm that it did not have a licence.  The Central Bank has repeatedly avoided questions on this matter but instead said that IIB Homeloans did not need a licence.  In a recent parliamentary question, the Minister for Finance refused to answer a direct question on the licence issue and simply repeated the Central Bank&rsquo;s answer that a licence was unnecessary.</p> <p>  Fortunately, on 26 May 2021 the Central Bank, after persistent questioning, eventually confirmed that IIB Homeloans Limited did not hold a licence prior to 2008, an important admission that will help overturn illegal repossessions.  Section 7 of the Central Bank Act 1971 requires entities describing themselves as a bank to hold a valid licence.  On 20 May 2021 the Central Bank was asked to clarify why IIB Homeloans had an exemption from section 7.  Clearly, this matter requires an urgent answer.  Looking at the Irish court system, in practice, if the borrower as defendant claims that IIB Homeloans acts illegally and the Central Bank has not raised the issue then the courts have nearly always found against the borrower.</p> <p>  On another matter, a group of EBS tied agents has also suffered from Central Bank inaction as Shane Kavanagh will reveal shortly.  Some of this group are before the courts facing repossessions.  Their defence is straightforward, that is, that EBS was in a perilous financial position which it failed to disclose and therefore signed contracts that it was not able to honour.  The group has evidence from former EBS directors and sworn evidence from the Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis that EBS knowingly misrepresented its financial position.</p><p>A legal opinion from George Bompas QC confirms that such practices are contrary to EU and, therefore, Irish company law, yet the courts have ignored the tied agents because the Central Bank, as regulator, has not raised the matter.  The courts have ruled that sworn evidence at the Oireachtas banking inquiry is not acceptable and have simply ignored evidence from barristers on the application of EU company law, yet they are happy to rely on evidence from redacted documents provided by the vulture funds.  Clearly, Central Bank investigations are necessary if the courts are to take repossession defences seriously.<br/><br/>With regard to money laundering, during the 2008 financial crisis, banks used window dressing to conceal substantial deposit withdrawals from worried customers.  At least one bank funded substantial but artificial deposits by lending money to itself.  In a particular case that I have come across, a bank advised a customer that he could receive a bank loan only if he entered into a partnership with associates of the bank.  Although named as a borrower, the customer never actually saw the loan advances.  The bank instead paid loan proceeds to its associates, who placed much of it back on deposit with the lending bank in an account held with the Irish Central Bank.  The customer saw his business collapse with unnecessary cash flow problems, yet the courts were completely unsympathetic.  In my view, the courts assume that all regulated banks are operating above board if the Central Bank does not raise an issue.  Injustices, therefore, arise.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this committee has already raised these matters with the Irish Central Bank and it wrote to Chartered Accountants Ireland on a serious matter of potentially<br/><br/>wrong legal advice, yet no one has responded, despite a <i>Financial Times</i>article raising very serious concerns.  I hope the committee will continue to address these important matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.111" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Lawlor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061600002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for inviting me to speak, to highlight and to provide a human picture of the sheer devastation the bank has caused me and my family for the past 11 years.  I approached the bank in good faith in the hope of reaching agreement with regard to a loan facility for the purchase a family home.  I am a strong family man and live for my children and my one grandchild.  I have always prided myself on my honesty and have a huge resistance to dishonesty and wrong-doing.  I come from a very much respected Kilkenny family and my late dad was awarded Kilkenny person of the year in 2002 for his lifelong dedication to amateur drama and sport.</p> <p>  The agreement that was reached in April 2004 between Bank of Ireland and me was for a credit facility equating to a loan to value ratio of 90% for the purchase of a family home to the value of &euro;245,000.  The bank provided for a discounted variable rate of 2.69% for a period of 12 months, which was welcomed, noting no arrears.  The bank had unilaterally retained a higher marginal rate of 1.10% some 12 months after the negotiation of the contract.  However, it applied a rate of 1.60%.  This higher marginal rate formed the central aspect of my mortgage contract with the bank and I entered into it in good faith.  The expectation that the bank would act in my best interests and honour the central aspect of my mortgage appears to be a lost expectation.</p> <p>  Twelve months after reaching agreement with the bank, a business record detailing my business relationship going forward was entered into my mortgage file by a Bank of Ireland financial adviser as the discounted period was nearing an end.  This business record identified with my mortgage account and qualifying tracker rate prerequisites, namely, a home loan, a loan amount of in excess of &euro;200,000 and a loan to value greater than 60%, contractually entitled me to an ECB tracker rate in addition to a 1.10% Bank of Ireland Group marginal rate above the ECB rate.</p> <p>  The bank had informed me, following my complaint and investigation in 2014, that &ldquo;there is no provision anywhere in your mortgage agreement for a tracker rate of interest&rdquo;.  This is untrue and contradicts the business record of my banking relationship with the bank entered on my mortgage file as interpreted by the bank&rsquo;s financial adviser dating back to April 2005.  The bank set about denying my business relationship in pursuit of increased interest payments and was prepared to rely on redacted documents, withhold relevant documents, misrepresent terms and, in my case, produce a mortgage deed that triggered a civil procedure to possess my family home.  How wrong was I to expect the bank to act in good faith with my best financial interests front and centre when profitability for the bank is at stake.</p> <p>  The operational effect of my variable rate mortgage with the bank allowed for positive and negative variable rates to be adopted by the bank and applied to my mortgage contract on foot of ECB announcements during this time.  Following the banking crash of 2008 and the removal of tracker rates as a viable option for Bank of Ireland Group in 2008, positive and negative reflections continued to be applied to my mortgage account, reasonably understood as a tracker mortgage.  The bank cannot exercise discretion over ECB variable rates of interest.  How wrong was I to expect the bank to honour its side of the bargain.</p> <p>  Following the banking crash, my mortgage agreement fundamentally changed.  In April 2010, two years after the banking crash, the bank unilaterally and fundamentally, without consent of any description, changed my mortgage contract and agreement whereby it exercised total control over my variable rate mortgage.  ECB rates were no longer adopted and applied to my mortgage contract.  This totally changed my life.  The immediate impact was that it generated arrears for the first time in my life on my mortgage, pushing me into me an unnecessary default.</p> <p>  Several case managers adopted the same attitude.  Terms were introduced into my mortgage, with bank officials misrepresenting my contract in a way that was not visible in loan offer documentation, and these terms were known or should have been known to unilaterally alter the central aspect of my mortgage contract.  A common thread adopted by the bank was to deny, defend, delay and destroy anyone who dared to question.  The psychological reign of terror put on me by the bank had a devastating effect on all aspects of my life.  The line adopted by the bank was that at all times when a variable interest rate applies to the loan, the interest rate chargeable will vary at the lender&rsquo;s discretion, upwards or downwards.  What the bank failed to include and consider is that clause 6(a) in the loan offer was that it was subject to a referencing index in the same loan offer.  For Bank of Ireland to apply the term &ldquo;variable rate&rdquo; in such a manner is unfair within the meaning of the EU directive on unfair terms in consumer contracts, and it was utilised to deprive me of a tracker mortgage examination and appeal procedure mandated by the Central Bank.</p> <p>  How and why the bank was retrofitting my mortgage contract with higher rates caused me untold and life changing personal damage, and the reason for this was simply to increase the bank&rsquo;s profitability.  Over the time period involved with dealing with the bank, my health deteriorated very significantly.  I suffered two heart attacks, was fitted with cardiac stents and finally was subjected to a quintuple coronary artery bypass graft in 2014.  I was left with no other option but to retire from my very well paid job with the National Ambulance Service, a job I loved.</p> <p>  Due to what can only be regarded as a presumption at law, namely, that the bank at all times acted honourably and honestly, the court moved to grant a possession order on my family home, despite forensic evidence of overcharging and overwhelming evidence of a tracker mortgage scandal, of which I was a part.  On appeal, the court did not admit my sworn evidence of truth as it was claimed by the bank to contain legal argument.  My contractual business relationship with the bank in 2004 and 2005 was knowingly withheld from me and from the entire court process by the bank, including my appeal, despite freedom of information requests prior to the commencement of a summary application made to the court seeking possession of my family home.</p><p>The court's own motion regarding an assessment of unfair contracts was sidetracked and cast aside.  A general data protection regulation, GDPR, data request under Article 15 in 2019 subsequently discovered, for the first time and following the courts process, the existence of the business record and the classification of my mortgage product as a tracker product.  The bank determined that my account was not impacted and is not within the scope for a tracker mortgage examination despite the bank&rsquo;s records identifying my mortgage as an European Central Bank, ECB, tracker variable, with the rate set at 1.10% above the ECB rate in 2005.  The bank also chose to ignore the criteria set by the Central Bank of Ireland in determining whether accounts are within the scope.  This, in turn, also deprived me of an appeal process under the examination process.</p><p> The impact on me personally during this reign of terror, during which the bank defended the indefensible, delayed the inevitable, and denied the obvious, has been akin to living a hell on earth.  One stares financial ruin directly in the face and lives with the real and present risk of homelessness destroying one as a person as one receives the dreaded visit from a sheriff or private security firm to evict one from one's family home.</p><p> I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to expose this clear and obvious wrongdoing.  It stands in plain view to the reasonable man, although this is a contention the bank will do anything to deny.  I hereby call on Francesca McDonagh to honour a commitment she personally gave to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on her appointment as chief executive officer to the Bank of Ireland Group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shane Kavanagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061600002#C00200"><p>I thank the committee for this invitation.  In 2018, I appeared before the committee as a representative of a group of EBS agents to express my concerns about accounting and other irregularities within EBS.  Despite letters from the joint committee to EBS on the matter, EBS refused to engage.  A former EBS director confirmed my concerns and appeared before the committee to outline the consequences of these accounting irregularities.<br/><br/>In a separate case taken by another agent to prevent termination, the company claimed it was being terminated because it resisted pressure from EBS to adopt underhanded sales tactics for investment products.  Mr. Justice Jordan ruled against the EBS and noted that he was being told to move along, there is nothing to see here.  In his 2019 ruling, the judge called on EBS to &ldquo;lead by example&rdquo; adding:</p> <blockquote> 	I would have thought that a competent mediator could bring sense to bear and mediate a solution to the dispute between the parties.  If the parties are committed to doing business with integrity and in accordance with the regulatory requirements that exist, then what possible obstacle stands in the way of both sides starting on a new page </blockquote> <p>Sadly, the bank did not listen and instead, in 2020, brought the case to the Court of Appeal where once again all three judges ruled against the bank.<br/><br/>Today, our group of EBS agents are like insects caught in a spider's web.  Since our last appearance before this committee in 2018, there has been no attempt by EBS to engage with any of the agents in respect of our dispute.  Sadly, two of our colleagues have passed away, both of whom are in our thoughts today, as are their families.  We have now spent more than ten years trying to get justice and, to add insult to injury, EBS will not negotiate with us, although it appears to be willing to negotiate with a third party who is soliciting a fee.<br/><br/>EBS signed contracts with us knowing that it was unable to fulfil its obligations.  The result was that we could not sell mortgages and EBS instead instructed us to sell investment products associated with a high commission, although they were highly unsuitable, and to do whatever it takes.  These products were not suitable for every customer as many customers simply did not have a tolerance for risk.  We objected to these instructions and were warned that if we reported it our lives would be hell.  Agents who failed to comply lost their livelihoods.  Clearly, having the courage to speak out was dangerous.<br/><br/>I welcome the protected disclosures legislation which must be transposed later this year and I hope my comments will be of assistance.  If we are to restore the integrity of the financial services industry in general, the foundation stone must be accountability.  Every decision which impacts customers or consumers must be traceable to the individual or individuals who made the decision.  If we tackle the issue of accountability, we will, at the same time, tackle inequality, dishonesty and corruption in our banking industry and become a beacon of hope for the world's banks, which have, in recent years, lost the trust of the nations to the point that Bitcoin, which is not regulated, has established itself as an acceptable currency on the world stage.  Where will this end if we do not stop the rot?<br/><br/>Sadly, whistleblowers are often seen as conspiracy theorists, troublemakers and a threat.  They are exposed to bullying and retaliation, leading to financial insecurity and stress.  The courts will normally ignore criticisms of regulated banks if the Central Bank and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, have not raised any objection.  Having first-hand experience, I have outlined the efforts we personally made with regard to resolution.  I refer the committee members to Exhibit 1, which I included as part of my opening statement.  It is a map regarding the activity of our group of EBS agents.  <br/><br/>If Government regulators are unwilling to act, the role of the whistleblower becomes more important.  Ireland's record of dealing with conscientious workers is extremely poor.  Conscientious workers are not being publicly represented, apart from the representation provided by a few politicians who are simply doing their job.  The very fact that our group exists tells one that Ireland has a long way to go.  The State's attitude is concerning.  Healthy scepticism is one thing, but when one knows one is correct and is telling the truth, it is soul-destroying to be dismissed as a crank.<br/><br/>What do we have to do to win the interest of the gatekeepers with a view to ensuring an independent and transparent investigation?  Personally, I must admit I was very naive.  I thought we were all on the same side.  I was wrong.  The powers that be are just not interested in uncovering the truth and appear more interested in covering up for their corporate cronies.  The question must be asked: why does the Garda Economic Crime Bureau not take the lead and investigate these issues irrespective of establishment perception?<br/><br/>In our case, the Central Bank wants this issue to go away simply because it did not do a sufficient job and, as it turns out, it was in its interest that the truth be circumvented.  The Minister for Finance and his Department have made it clear to me that they are never going to believe me no matter how well the evidence is presented.  The result of all this is that reputations are saved, careers are made and society pays.  The time has come for the State to exit its bunker mentality, to stop turning a blind eye, to turn over a new leaf and to engage and support those who speak up for the betterment of society.<br/><br/>I suggest that a dedicated independent anti-corruption agency should be established to tackle white-collar crime and corruption in the corporate world and political spheres.  The State should establish a fund to financially support conscientious workers who find themselves with no income and introduce legislation which will provide free legal aid for all conscientious workers who have no alternative but to take their case to the courts for resolution.  The State should also introduce an incentive scheme to encourage employers, including State bodies, to employ conscientious workers who find themselves with no work having previously made a qualifying disclosure.<br/><br/>I believe that very few people are aware that the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 exists and that there are legal protections available.  The relevant authorities need to educate people on how to use the Protected Disclosures Act safely and to ensure that people are aware of its protections.  The State and its representatives also need to educate themselves on the Act and when it applies as there appears to be some confusion among some State employees.  I have personal experience of making a disclosure to a State entity only to be told that my complaint did not fall within the Act under a section that I never mentioned in my original disclosure.  When I appealed this decision, I highlighted the section of the Act under which I believed the matter fell.  However, my disclosure was dismissed on the grounds that it was a matter for another entity, that being the same entity against which the disclosure was made.  I responded and informed the recipient that there was nothing in the legislation to allow that body to evade its responsibilities where the responsible company, for whatever reason, refuses to investigate.  I provided evidence demonstrating that the company in question was not independent when investigating matters that I was raising.  To this date, this concern remains outstanding.  I have a question for all legislators on this committee.  Do they believe this behaviour is legitimate?</p></speech>

A few areas struck me.  Mr. Butler mentioned the pressure on people to reclassify themselves, to be pressed into inappropriate financial instruments and loan structures that do not match their needs, and the abuse of power.  It is striking that only a European legal provision, GDPR, has allowed Mr. Lawlor to have the information about the business record.  GDPR is proving useful to prevent blanking of information by institutions.  It leads to a question about when contradictory information is intentionally withheld in a legal or court process, with devastating impacts.  That should be challenged.  There is a question about where those decisions are being made.  I will ask Mr. Kavanagh about some of the ideas to have accountability.  We need to look at measures for when contradictory information is intentionally withheld by a major actor such as a bank.  There need to be ways to re-enter the appeal process when such things emerge.</p> <p>  Mr. Kavanagh mentioned the protected disclosure legislation.  This is timely because it is an opportunity for us to try to improve it.  I have heard similar stories to what he has told us from people who have had the same experiences, where they are referred to the entity about which they are complaining.  It seems to be a matter of going from pillar to post as an attempt is made to shift the responsibility when, in fact, it cannot be shifted.  Mr. Kavanagh mentioned what we can do about protected disclosures.  The senior executive accountability regime is the other thing that we have been talking about in this committee.  Protected disclosures provide protection for those making the disclosures.  GDPR requires that decisions can be appealed and that there is transparency in how decisions are made.  To ensure accountability for the individuals making decisions, how important is the implementation of the senior executive accountability regime?  Does Mr. Kavanagh have suggestions about how that could be strengthened?</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Kavanagh about cryptocurrency regulation.  That is a separate discussion but it is a sign of issues in this area.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Kavanagh think that the anti-corruption unit needs to be separate from the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau or could it be reframed to serve that anti-corruption purpose?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shane Kavanagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061600002#D00200"><p>The reality is that the senior executive accountability regime needs to be introduced.  I have no difficulty with it.  It is correct and right but I cannot understand what the delay is in introducing it.  How many standards do we need to get this over the line?</p> <p>  The anti-corruption agency needs to be separate and absolutely independent of everything.  Ireland is a small nation.  Everybody seems to know everybody.  It goes around in a circle, being passed from pillar to post.  The terms of reference of that agency need to be clear and there needs to be absolute accountability.  We sent correspondence to the garda&iacute;, they said that company law matters are not for them and sent it to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, which then sent the correspondence back to the garda&iacute;.  It is a merry-go-round.  The banks say that it is a matter for the Central Bank which then says that it does not see any evidence of criminality, that it is a matter for the garda&iacute; and that it does not have anything to add.  If there is evidence and possible criminality, why does the Central Bank not simply do its job and pass it on to the Director of Public Prosecutions to let it make the decision?  The Central Bank is essentially saying that it is deciding that there is no criminality.  Let the Director of Public Prosecutions do its job, independent of the Central Bank.  There seems to be significant reluctance to do that.  I cannot understand or get my head around that.  Mr. Butler may have points to make on that too.  We have spoken about this before.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061600002#D00300"><p>As Mr. Kavanagh said, we lodged complaints with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Central Bank.  Neither took an interest in it.  The issue is serious since, as Mr. Kavanagh explained, he signed contracts on the basis that EBS would provide mortgages.  At the time, when he signed the contracts, EBS was aware that it was in financial difficulty and could not really honour those contracts.  Therefore Mr. Kavanagh and his group have a legitimate claim against EBS, because these contracts should not have been signed.  We have tried to raise this matter with many people but there does not seem to be any concern about the fact that some banks are not complying with company law.  Compliance with company law requires showing financial positions correctly.  That means that banks must show that they have enough capital to withstand losses.</p> <p>  Prior to the banking crisis in 2008, the banks went through a reckless period where they loaned money without any regard as to whether they would get the money back.  The aim was to constantly expand.  They were able to record short-term profits even though they were entering into loss-making transactions.  This should all have been exposed in 2008 but the attitude at the time was to cover up the fact that the banks were not complying with the law and to pretend that they had complied.  There was a pretence that they were all solvent, then they were given money to keep things going.  Banks at that time had many hidden losses and they had to generate profits to cover up the black holes.</p> <p>  They adopted a few policies, one of which was to increase interest rates as much as possible.  This is why people like Mr. Lawlor are affected.  The European Central Bank said that it would reduce interest rates to protect people like Mr. Lawlor but the banks did not pass on those interest rate reductions.  Instead, they appear to have increased the interest rates.  The view seems to be taken that when borrowers are vulnerable, they are good for profits.  We therefore have a situation where people like Mr. Lawlor were paying excessive interest rates to the point that they were pushed into default.  That did not seem to worry the banks, which said that short-term profitability had increased and nothing else mattered.</p> <p>  It got to the stage where people like Mr. Lawlor were classified as having defaulted, and many loans, although not Mr. Lawlor's, were sold to vulture funds at extremely high discounts.  Anyone with a half-hearted knowledge of economics will say that that is a disastrous thing to do.  Why sell loans to a vulture fund at a significant discount when it is possible to negotiate with a customer directly?  The consequence of selling loans to vulture funds at significant discounts is that the capital of the banks was depleted because they lost money when they sold to vulture funds.  Their capital decreased.  This is why we have a situation, together with the fact that banks are not producing proper accounts, where it is difficult for banks to borrow money on the open market.  The result is that Irish mortgage borrowers are suffering.  I am not just talking about Mr. Lawlor, although his case is severe.</p><p>I am talking about young people who are paying in rent double what a mortgage for a similar property would require, yet they are denied a mortgage.  What Mr. Lawlor has exposed is quite important but it is not confined to a few people in mortgage arrears.  There is a large group in their 20s, 30s and 40s who will be rent captives for life.  They will be paying high rents to consumer funds for the rest of their lives.  Mr. Kavanagh has pointed out that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Central Bank of Ireland have no interest in the matter.  If those two entities have no interest in it, we can rest assured that the courts will not have any interest in it.  It would be very difficult for Mr. Lawlor to say there are problems with the Central Bank and that it is not doing its job properly.  We can guess how the judges would react to that.</p><p> There is a very serious problem and Mr. Lawlor has explained it very well.  Mr. Kavanagh has explained, on behalf of a group of EBS agents, the difficulties they are going through and the fact that very few have any interest in what is going on.</p></speech>

Euribor rates have come down into negative territory.  The Central Bank deliberately reduced those rates so people like Mr. Lawlor could survive.  That is not what has happened.  The banks stated their position on paying lower rates to the ECB but said they would not pass on the interest rate reduction to people like Mr. Lawlor.  They engage in all sorts of actions to get around the mortgage requirements.  They say they will keep charging people like Mr. Lawlor a high rate and that if there is a default, they will not be their problem in the short term.  This is why many in financial difficulty should not be in it.  Once they are in difficulty, they are vulnerable.  I can assure the members that once they are vulnerable, the courts will not take any interest in it.  The courts will ask why, if there was a major issue with the banks, the Central Bank did not intervene.  People like Mr. Lawlor are not being allowed to get that far.</p></speech>

In my submission, I refer to following the court procedure.  I was put through a court procedure in the Circuit Court and High Court in which the most significant piece of information was withheld from the process.  The banks and legal people are telling me that, in these circumstances, all the banks will do is claim protection according to the principle of<i>res judicata</i>, whereby I am told my case has already been before the court and that I had a chance to raise the arguments with the judge.  However, the most important piece of information contained in my entire mortgage file was withheld from me.  This would have impacted greatly the affidavit made for the courts and it would certainly have steered the court to carry out an own-motion assessment of the unfairness of the mortgage and the bank.  However, the information was kept out of the process in the first instance.  I was given the information when the process was over.  I have sought legal advice on re-entering the process and have been told the banks will just claim the principle of <i>res judicata</i>.  I will be told, &quot;It was already before the courts, Mr. Lawlor&quot;, but it was not.  The most relevant information was not before the courts.<br/><br/>Let me make it absolutely clear to the committee that I have no intention of trying to seek my home in the way that might be suggested.  I will honour the commitment I have given but I will not be blackguarded.  That is what has happened here.  These people show no mercy.  I live every single day in fear of a sheriff arriving at the door.  Now I have to contend with the fact that there is legislation going through the D&aacute;il to allow private security firms to evict me from my home.  What these people are doing to me is a living nightmare.  I have told the bank that I will pay my mortgage at the rate agreed but it is just not interested in that.  It just wants more and more profit.  It does not care.  As I said in my statement, evidence from redacted statements is used to keep the courts happy and to facilitate the granting of possession orders.</p></speech>

Some are before the committee for a second time.</p> <p>  I will begin with Mr. Butler.  I thank him for his opening statement.  In it, he said some banks will only advance Covid-19 loans to customers reclassifying themselves as non-consumers, thus enabling banks to use unfair terms and avoid tracker examination by failing to retain historic interest rates.  Can he clarify and expand on that statement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.127" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061600002#E01100"><p>I will start with the Covid-19 loans.  As the Deputy is aware, Covid-19 loans are made available to people who get into difficulty as a result of the financial crisis.  That allows them to delay payments until the Covid crisis abates and they are in a position to earn money again.  I have a letter on file from an individual who was classified as a consumer and who could therefore avail of consumer legislation, in other words, legislation on unfair terms.  When the loan was restructured, the same individual was classified as a non-consumer.  The individual was a consumer in the letter with the first offer.  For the Covid loan, it was stated the individual is now a non-consumer and therefore cannot avail of the consumer legislation.  There are two impacts.  The first is that if I borrow money from the bank and it sneaks in an unfair term, as Mr. Lawlor alluded to, I can go before the courts and they are obliged to examine the matter.  I do not even have to bring it up in the courts or raise it; they are obliged to examine contracts for unfair terms.  If the individual is not classified as a consumer, that protection appears to disappear.</p> <p>  Second, on the tracker mortgage, in order for a bank to carry out the tracker mortgage, it must consider interest rates from about 2005 to the present.  If there is proof that between 2005 and, say, 2012, the interest rate charged tracked Euribor or ECB rates, there is an obligation to go into a tracker examination.  The customer I have mentioned was told he was a non-consumer and that the institution was therefore not obliged to keep records for the full period, but only for the period from, say, 2012 onwards.  By that stage, the banks had been increasing rates regardless of Euribor.  Therefore, by changing the customer's classification from consumer to non-consumer, the institution was able to put itself in a much stronger bargaining position.  The customer in question is being forced, as we speak, to sell property at distressed prices.  The bank has written to the auctioneer to state that under no circumstances is it to put the loan back onto the market, that it, that is, the bank, has classified the loan such that it is to be sold immediately and that it will take legal action if the auctioneer tries to do otherwise.</p></speech>

Would Mr. Butler's client be happy to share both pieces of documentation with the committee, in whatever redacted format is deemed suitable, so we could follow this up with the financial institution in question?</p></speech>

I spoke to the client and he says he will make the letter available.</p> <p>  As to the Deputy's first question, there is some ambiguity as to whether a customer should be classified as a consumer.</p><p>Some banks take the view that if a customer gets it through a different branch, which normally deals with commercial loans, then he or she is not a consumer.  It is particularly vague, so there is no rationale as to how banks decide if someone is a consumer.  An individual was identified as a consumer in the letter and the consumer Act was used and then afterwards when he had signed the Covid letter he was told that he must be classified as a professional customer.</p></speech>

I would be happy to follow up on that, as I am sure would the committee.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Kavanagh for his opening statement and for coming before the committee today.  This is not the first time he was before the committee.  Three years ago this month, he was before the committee and it is unfortunate that he has had to come back and tell a very similar story to what he told at that time.  During the committee hearing three years ago he was asked by a member of the committee whether it was legally permissible for the EBS to have taken the approach it did under the contract to which he replied that it has not been proven otherwise and has not been tested before the courts.  Could he take this opportunity to update the committee on any developments since, whether he has considered bringing a case before the courts or whether there have been similar actions before the courts?</p></speech>

One particular agent, who still has an EBS office, has taken a case.  The person was issued with an order for termination a while back and took a case to the High Court to secure an injunction to prevent the three offices he has from being terminated.  The judge ruled in favour of the agent.  As I indicated in my opening statement, EBS was asked to show leadership, sit down with the agent and deal with him in a professional manner on the issues.  Instead of listening to the High Court judge, unfortunately, the bank decided to go ahead and proceed to the Court of Appeal.  The three judges in that case again dismissed the EBS's argument.  The case is potentially going to a full trial later in the year.  I do not want to say much more about that because there is a trial pending.  That particular agent has spent in excess of &euro;500,000 to get to here.  The ordinary agent just does not have that kind of money.  I do not have that money.  There is not a hope in hell I would have that money unless I won the lotto, and neither would any of the rest of my colleagues.  There are 23 other agents involved here and we are not all wrong.  We do not have that kind of money.  We cannot take a class action because the legislation in Ireland does not allow for it.  That is where we are at.  We are stuck in limbo and that other case is potentially going to trial later in the year.  That is the kind of money we are looking at.  Realistically speaking, the taxpayer is paying it and backing up that charge.</p></speech>

Is it that they were let go or encouraged to mis-sell?  In Mr. Kavanagh's words, what is the core argument they have with the EBS?</p></speech>

In other words, we were asked to dupe our customers, mislead them, and sell products.  We would have known the risk appetite of much of our client base.  Some people wanted their money to be safe and secure in a deposit account with a guaranteed return.  We were asked to basically lure people into investment-type products, which many of them would not have been comfortable doing.  When we said it was not in the customers' best interest to do this, we were essentially seen as troublemakers and we were told we were not team players.  The issue was what to do: whether to do what the bank told us or to trick the customer.  Our conscience got to us and we said we were not going to do that.  By not doing that, the bank then decided it wanted us gone out the door.</p> <p>  During my time in the office I was put under enormous pressure to sell these products.  I was also encouraged to tamper with the evidence; in other words, when I was filling out the documentation for customers I put in customer-centric wording which gave the impression that the customers pushed for the sale of the product rather than me pushing the product on them.  If, down the road, the clients realised that they had bought a product they did not necessarily want to buy and that rather than their money being safe it was in an investment product, if they made a complaint to the Ombudsman and he looked up the paperwork and investigated it he would not be able to rule in favour of the client because it looked like the customer had pushed this product.  In other words, I did-----</p></speech>

It would be impossible for them to show that it was a mis-sold product.  Could Mr. Kavanagh give an example of the type of products that he was being asked to push on his customers?  I think of laypeople who may not be involved in the purchase of these type of products.  What kind of products were they and how were they not suitable for certain individuals?</p></speech>

If people hear the word "protected", they assume their money is protected.  It was very well marketed and sold in such a way that it seemed the money was protected and there was nothing to worry about, but the reality is that it was not protected.  It was only protected if the customers did not take it out until after a five-year period that they were guaranteed that they would get back their initial investment.  In the interim, if they wanted the money and they took it out, there was a chance they were going to lose their money.  Therefore, they were not protected, but they were sold a protected bond and customers potentially felt they had got a protected bond.</p> <p>  Another example was a bonus save, whereby if a customer was saving he or she got a bonus.  Again, the bonus only applied after a number of years, but before that customers could potentially lose money if they tried to withdraw it before a certain period.  It was all trickery in relation to the words that were used.</p></speech>

The EBS has avoided this issue and in spite of the great efforts of the Chair to have someone accountable from the EBS come before us, it has continually avoided coming in and dealing with this issue.  We will continue to pursue it.</p> <p>  What would Mr. Kavanagh say, if for example, the EBS was to say it did not force agents to mis-sell the product, that it provided an incentive to sell the product but it was up to the agents to do their due diligence on the customers and they decided to increase their profitability through increasing incentives?</p></speech>

I have written documentation showing where I was instructed to "do whatever it takes" in the words of the EBS.  What does that mean?  It did not matter what we did, we just had to get our sales.  Our remuneration was on the basis that it was "critical to achieve all targets".  In other words, if we did not achieve the targets then our remuneration would be reduced.  Essentially, we would argue that it was a case of either turn a blind eye and do what we had to do or challenge management on this and ask what was in the best interests of the customer?  Were we looking after the bank's balance sheet or doing what we were supposed to be doing, which was looking after the customer?</p><p>I have given the committee plenty of documentary evidence but I can provide it again.</p></speech>

I wanted to give Mr. Kavanagh an opportunity to put that on the record at this meeting.  After contracts were terminated with the witnesses, do they have any information or evidence to suggest that this type of practice continued with new agents?  Do they have an estimate of the number of products that EBS was involved in mis-selling?</p></speech>

I will not put myself in a position where I could be challenged about what other agents have done.  We have come together as a group of 23, or 25, if the current case is included.  When we were terminated, it was obvious that there was no real selection process for the terminations.  People who were not team players were put out the gate.  What was interesting was who took up the agencies.  Only a handful of people took them and they all seemed to be friends of senior management at the time.  I do not know how they were selected but there seems to have been a serious conflict of interest with regard to why it was the same individuals.  Two or three people happened to get the guts of 15 or 20 offices.  It is questionable.</p></speech>

It has transpired that in 2008, the members of the EBS management team knowingly, intentionally, deliberately and willingly deceived us all into signing new contracts, knowing that their accounts were not accurate.

I thank Mr. Lawlor again for putting his information and personal story on the record.  This is a scandal.  These things start with one person.  A comment was made earlier about how whistle-blowers are sometimes perceived as contrarians, cranks or such.  If somebody said a number of years ago that every single bank that had sold a tracker mortgage in the country had ripped off their customers to the tune of nearly &euro;1 billion, with 40,000 people involved and more than 100 family homes repossessed, and that this was done despite customers and the Financial Services Ombudsman repeatedly challenging the banks, you would say that that is very hard to swallow.  That is exactly what unfolded with the tracker mortgage scandal.  It takes just one individual and we need to sit up and listen to those concerns.</p> <p>  I hear what Mr. Lawlor is saying.  It is appalling that it appears that the bank has deliberately withheld key information about a court proceeding that had a serious impact on Mr. Lawlor's family and led to repossession.  That is not acceptable.  We need to follow it up as a committee.  Whatever about the legal process now, the Central Bank is responsible for ensuring that banks behave ethically, appropriately and within the law with regard to the licences that it provides.  I will not go into the finer detail other than to ask that for us, as a committee, to follow up on this, would Mr. Lawlor be willing to share some of that documentation with the committee?  For example, might he share the information that he received from the GDPR request and the terms of the contract that would allow us to quiz both the Central Bank and institution about this case?</p></speech>

Of course I will share any information that needs to be shared.  I will borrow a phrase Mr. Kavanagh used, and "do whatever it takes".  That fits my entire story with the bank.  It did whatever it took to increase my interest payments.  It produced a mortgage deal that is not capable of standing up to legal scrutiny.  It ignored all the evidence.  It changed and abused the terms.  It abused me and it will do whatever it takes.  To answer the Deputy's question, I will share any and all information that I have in my pursuit of exposing this injustice, getting justice for myself and for any other people who may suffer the same fate.</p></speech>

I was trying to attend four meetings at the same time, which is difficult.  I am back.  I have just heard something that we have sadly all dealt with over the last years.  Differentiating between people as being customers and non-customers is nonsense.  I would have presumed that everybody is a customer if they have a deal to borrow money and repay it over a certain period.</p> <p>  When we go back to the banks to try to negotiate on behalf of customers, every proposal we put before them is met with a reply that it is not sustainable.  If we look at the day on which the loans were granted by the same institutions, they were not sustainable from the beginning if we take into account the necessity to protect the customer.  I have said many times that I believe the Central Bank has a role that it needs to exercise in such circumstances because the public needs to be protected, especially in an inflationary market.  People were told that they were sitting on assets, that they should borrow money to ensure they put the asset to work and they would become wealthy, and all kinds of nonsense.</p> <p>  Sustainability is an issue.  I dealt with many cases where the loan was not sustainable from the first day, given the circumstances of the applicant, but they were encouraged to incur the debt in order to allegedly improve themselves.</p> <p>  Another issue is settlements versus repossession.  We have all tried to arrange settlements.  It is not unreasonable that in the event of a crash or such, the customer can come to the lending institution and attempt to negotiate.  I had a discussion with a lending institution last week.  Whenever I turned the conversation around and said that the lender really wanted to repossess people's homes, put them out on the road and make them homeless, they said that I was putting words in the lender's mouth.</p><p>That is, in effect, what the proposer wants and we need protection against that.  I note the number of evictions that are currently proposed is still very alarming.</p><p> The point at issue is this.  I cannot see why, when the crash came, it was not possible for the lending institutions, even at that stage, to negotiate with their borrowers some kind of long-term or medium-term proposal whereby they could ease the person back into a business or allow the person who borrowed the money to pay over a period and in stages in order to safeguard their home and property.</p><p> My next point is in regard to the courts.  Sadly, we have all been in the courts on various occasions with customers over the past ten years or so.  Generally speaking, the courts have been very sympathetic but it is true, as was said, that some of the institutions think badly about adhering to what the court decides and will go a different route, if possible.  Like the Chairman and other members, I have dealt with cases where, having negotiated what appears to be a reasonable settlement in the circumstances, the lending institution decides it does not want that and that it wants to take everything because the customer finds they cannot meet what was originally intended.  The word of the court needs to be observed.</p><p> Incidentally, on that question about the courts having dealt with the issue before, I am conversant with this.  We need to talk at our private meeting about the ways and means of ensuring that, even though the courts have dealt such issues before, there is a possibility and a structure whereby the courts can deal with them again in the light of emerging circumstances.</p><p> I am sorry for the rant but the Chairman and I know we have all been through this many times.  Hopefully, we will not have to go through it again.  However, anything we can do for people who found themselves in this situation, we must do it.  At the same time, we must try to ensure that the Central Bank, which has a very important role in these matters, does its job to the extent that it should in order to protect the customer.</p></speech>

I agree with the previous speakers who highlighted how outrageous and shocking this is.  As Deputy Pearse Doherty said, this needs to be something that we pursue as a committee.</p> <p>  My first question is to Mr. Kavanagh.  I note his opening statement mentions the forthcoming protected disclosures legislation and that he stressed the need for accountability.  While this legislation is timely and important, concerns have been highlighted by some whistleblowers about how the line of accountability will work in practice.  I would like to hear Mr. Kavanagh&rsquo;s thoughts on this and perhaps he could expand on some of the issues of accountability that he stressed in his opening remarks.  That is my first question.</p></speech>

The legislation is timely and important and, obviously, Ireland has to transpose it.  I would respectfully say to the committee that there are a good few whistleblowers out there who need to have their story heard.  At the moment, there is no platform for them to have their story heard and without that platform, we cannot have accountability.  If we establish the facts, we can then work to try to get accountability but, at the moment, there is no platform for people in that position.  They are trying to highlight serious wrongdoing and they find that every door is closed in their face and that people do not want to hear it.</p> <p>  A massive issue is the amount of time people put into this.  It takes years and it affects their families.  The onus on them is to always be right - in other words, one little mistake and, straight away, they are discredited.  It is so frustrating for the conscientious people involved that the burden of proof is on them at all stages, yet there is no real platform to get that story out there.  In order to have accountability, we need to have that platform.  I hope that gives the Deputy an idea.  As I said, the time involved is huge and I know people who are at this for ten, 12 or 13 years.</p></speech>

For anybody I have dealt with in a similar situation, it is all-consuming.  They really are trying to get the truth and the story out there, and they often feel there is barrier after barrier.  Mr. Kavanagh expressed that very well and it is very important for us all to take note.</p> <p>  There was a recent scandal in regard to Davy stockbrokers, and I have heard some people compare this with what Mr. Kavanagh was speaking about.  We saw that serious regulatory breaches under the EU&rsquo;s markets in financial instruments directive, MIFID, were uncovered by the Central Bank, which was forced to investigate conflicts of interest, personal accounting and provision of information to the compliance function.  What parallels, if any, does Mr Kavanagh see between what went on in his own case and what occurred in Davy, and also in regard to how it was dealt with after concerns were raised?  Mr. Kavanagh may have answered this earlier but, as I said, I was in the Chamber.  However, he might give a little background because to have this heard is very important. </p></speech>

He was going back to 2008.  I presume if that one is giving home loans, one is obliged to have a licence.  The Central Bank was asked about this and it said a licence was unnecessary.  Mr. Butler went on to say that, after questioning, the Central Bank said it did not hold the licence.  Can Mr. Butler bring some clarity to the statements he is making in regard to that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.159" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061600002#H01200"><p>Certainly.  IIB Homeloans Limited passed itself off as a bank.  It often referred to itself as &ldquo;the bank&rdquo; and in some trade articles referred to itself as &ldquo;the bank&rdquo;.  It may well be a subsidiary of another bank but that is not important.  What is important is that if IIB Homeloans Limited enters into a contract with customers and says it is a bank, then it must hold a licence under section 7 of the Central Bank Act 1971.</p><p>One of the consequences of advancing a loan without a licence is that the customer may not be able to avail of the Consumer Protection Act.  That aside, the legal requirement from what I can see is that under section 7 of Central Bank Act 1971 a body describing itself as a bank and-or engaging in banking business is required to hold a licence.  Several customers are currently before the repossession courts and I believe they should not be there.  IIB Homeloans transferred its activities to KBC Bank, but KBC Bank cannot avail of the Bankers' Book Evidence Act from what I can see because IIB Homeloans does not have a licence.</p><p> I imagine that the remedy for IIB Homeloans, given that it advanced a loan without a banking licence, is that it may be entitled to get its principal back, but I cannot see how it is entitled to charge interest if it has advanced a loan without a licence.  It is important to emphasise that the Central Bank has a different view on this.</p><p> Returning to the Chairman's question, the group of IIB Homeloans customers asked IIB Homeloans to provide the licence and it was reluctant or refused to do so.  They then wrote to the Central Bank of Ireland asking it to provide confirmation that IIB Homeloans had the licence when they took out our loans.  The Central Bank wrote back on numerous occasions stating that IIB Homeloans did not need a licence.  When these customers went to court, the court maintained it is not up to IIB Homeloans to confirm it has a licence but it is up to the customers to prove it does not have a licence.  It is clear that the courts are taking the view that IIB Homeloans is always right.  </p><p> After persistent questioning by this group, a letter appeared around 26 May in which the Central Bank confirmed that IIB Homeloans did not have a licence.  It also stated in the same letter, which will make things difficult for those in the repossession courts, that IIB Homeloans did not need a licence and is regulated under the Investment Intermediaries Act.  I dispute that, but to keep the argument simple I believe it is up to the Central Bank to confirm where in the legislation section 7 of the Central Bank Act does not apply to IIB Homeloans Limited.  It may be that it comes under different regulations and it is quite entitled to make that point, but it needs to answer that question specifically.  If it does not answer it, we could end up with many more repossession cases.  As I speak, these cases are going through the courts.</p><p> One of the problems that the IIB Homeloans customers have is that even when evidence is presented to the courts, they tend to claim it has gone too far and has now gone to the appeals stage, the High Court or the Supreme Court.  In other words, whatever evidence the customers have, it is now too late.  This is why Central Bank intervention is necessary.  The Central Bank has already confirmed that IIB Homeloans does not have a licence, but it needs to clarify why IIB Homeloans Limited was exempt from the requirements of section 7 of the Central Bank Act 1971.  Until it does that, there is the risk that these customers will face illegal repossessions.</p><p> The matter was also raised with the Minister for Finance, who answered a parliamentary question in May.  The question asked if IIB Homeloans Limited had a licence prior to 2008.  It is very clear that the Minister was evasive in his answering.  He simply copied the Central Bank rhetoric, which states that it did not need a licence.  He may be entitled to say that, but that was not the question asked.  We can only resolve this if the Central Bank states that a section 7 does not apply because there is alternative legislation which means that in certain circumstances an entity may lend money, call itself a bank and engage in banking business but does not need a licence.  We need to get that information.  Given that we have been looking for it for a while, the Central Bank should treat this as a priority.  </p></speech>

In essence, while a building society is not a bank, it can lend money, but it must not call itself a bank and must not engage in what is known as banking business or claim it is involved in banking business.  The short answer to the Chairman's question is a building society, a friendly society or a credit union which is authorised as such may be allowed to lend money without a licence provided it does not call itself a bank or claim it is engaging in banking business, but I do not I think that applies to IIB Homeloans.</p></speech>

My question is quite general.  Ireland already had a concentrated banking sector before the exits of KBC and Ulster Bank were announced.  The State has significant shareholdings in the remaining pillar banks, which I imagine could make it more difficult to attract other banks into the market.  Other credit providers, including the credit union movement, have repeatedly told me they are finding it very difficult as a result of regulations and that they are slowly being starved out of existence.  Economists, such as Jim Power, have proposed the prospect of a public-led bank, but the Government has been somewhat dismissive of that idea.  Credit provision is a fundamental component of any economy.  What recommendations would Mr. Butler make for what could be done here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.164" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061600002#J00500"><p>The question of whether a bank should be under public control or private control has several aspects to it.  Let us consider the situation where they are left under private control.  There is the possibility that the system could work as long as banks are reminded to comply with company law.  That means they must disclose all their losses, reveal everything to the markets and disclose annual reports which are correct.  The benefit of that is that it is easier for them to raise capital overseas.  It is easy for them to provide capital.  We certainly would not have the disastrous situation where a person through the monthly rental payments can afford not one but two mortgages.  One quick solution to the problem is to get to the private banks to comply with company law.  If they comply with company law, the Central Bank will more or less allow them to lend to whomever they wish provided they record losses correctly.  That means it is self-correcting and there is no need for Government intervention.</p> <p>  However, there is a strong case for public intervention in the sense that a public bank may have to do what the private banks are unwilling to do.  We know there is a large gap in the market because people in their 20s and 30s will be rent prisoners for the rest of their lives unless something changes.  Therefore, there is an argument that the public sector could get involved if the private sector banking system does not clean up its act.</p> <p>  We want banks to be measuring risk correctly.  For instance, someone training to be a dentist will have lower income in earlier years and greater income in later years.  The bank might decide to exceed the 3.5 times annual earnings limit and perhaps bring it to four times because such a person will earn more money in the future.  There is nothing wrong with that.  However, the banks are not allowed to do that.  They are following the rules the Central Bank offers them, but the Central Bank rules are too crude.  A civil servant on a decent salary with wealthy parents can pull the deposit together and will be able to borrow money.  However, for all other people, those in the private sector, the rules are extremely unfair.  Therefore, there is an argument for public intervention.</p> <p>  The ultimate objective is to ensure that risk is measured correctly.  They should be incentivised to say to a customer, "Look, there's no way you're going to be able to afford this mortgage.  You need to be realistic and come down to a level that you're willing to pay."</p><p>In other cases they may tell a trainee dentist that they realise that it will be challenging in the early years but they will earn more money later on so they can structure a solution for them whereby they can get off the rental sector, get into a mortgage, maybe even reduce the mortgage rent knowing that the customer will become safer down the line.</p><p>I will not venture to suggest which way it should go, obviously the committee members are the policy makers and have a better understanding but these are the points that should be considered.  First, there is a vacuum in the market.  It is possible that the Government may decide to leave it in the private sector but it would need the banks to comply with company law.  If it decides to go to the public sector, you need to make sure that there is a system in place where risk is measured correctly to discourage customers from taking out mortgages that they cannot afford.  </p></speech>

That relates to a bank that advised a customer that he could receive a bank loan if he entered into partnership with associates of the bank.  I do not want Mr. Butler to name the bank or the person.  I ask him please not to do so, but will he explain that to the committee?</p></speech>

They were hiding huge amounts of losses and people were unwilling to lend money to them.  The Chair may recall that there was a radio programme where the presenter was told to calm down on his comments because people were queuing up and taking money out of deposit accounts with the bank.  If banks are insolvent, they will face difficulty in retaining deposits.</p> <p>  The litmus test in 2008 was that if a bank had sufficient deposits then everything was okay, and if it did not it was in trouble.  Therefore, banks used what I can only describe as window-dressing opportunities to make sure that their deposit figure was going up and not going down.  The way they achieved that, put simply, was that they lent money to themselves.  They lent money to a customer but that customer loan came back in as a deposit so they were able to say that their deposits were increasing and therefore they were very helpful and there is no need to be concerned and no need to have a run on the bank.  In order to do that they had to involve third parties.  This is known as a circular transaction where you lend money and then take it back in again through your deposit account.</p> <p>  These circular transactions often involved third parties.  Sometimes these third parties were compliant and in some cases they were unwitting victims.  The case I came across was where an individual had land and was in a bit of difficulty.  He was approached by somebody who said they had connections in a bank and that they may be able to resolve his difficulties.  The result was that the bank lent out the money, the money was not given to the customer but the associates.  The bank told the customer that it would lend him money as long as he involved an associate.  The bank lent the money to the associate and rather than the associate passing it on to the customer, the associate took complete control and we have evidence that the money went back into a deposit account.  The consequence of that was that the customer was on the loan agreement as a borrower but they never received the money.  One can see what is going to happen next: the customer got into severe financial difficulty and he was left in the lurch by the bank.  It was quite a cash flow shortfall but if the bank had behaved properly, that customer could have had a viable business whereas as a result, the customer was forced to sell assets at very distressed prices and suffered losses well in excess of the money that was lent.  There was contagion damage as a result of this misdemeanour.  My understanding is that this practice was quite popular at the time.  As I said, back in 2008, banks were in severe difficulty.</p></speech>

It would appear on the bank's balance sheet as a deposit and therefore the bank could say it had deposits with the Irish Central Bank, we have deposits with customers, therefore we are very safe.</p></speech>

They are suffering today as a result of those transaction.  Basically the transaction put them in severe financial difficulty.  There were consequential losses apart from the actual loss.  So if the loan was for &euro;4 million, for example, and the person did not receive the &euro;4 million, the person loses &euro;4 million and that puts him or her in cash flow difficulty and the losses are an awful lot more.  The result is that the other loans go into default, they are sold to vulture funds and then they are sold at distressed prices, so there is a compound situation.</p></speech>

It identifies with my mortgage account number and the tracker criteria that the bank requested in order to qualify for that tracker rate.  The significance of that document being given to me when it should have been given to me would have made all the difference in the evidence that I could have laid before the register's court, the Circuit Court and that I could have laid before the High Court on appeal.  In preventing me from seeing that document, it destroyed any defence that I could have put to the claim that the banks were making against me.  When presenting it to me following the legal process, the bank's way out was that the matter was already before the court so "goodbye".</p></speech>

In the agreement or businesses record, that amount was capped at 1.1% above the ECB rate.  When my discounted period ended one year after I had drawn down the mortgage, it increased that to 1.6%.  The mortgage was unproblematic to me at a rate of 1.6%.  However, the agreement was for 1.1% above the ECB rate.</p><p>In monetary terms, that represented an additional &euro;1,100 per annum for the bank.  In 2010, that 1.6% margin, which had applied for the previous six years, was suddenly gone, nowhere to be seen.</p><p> At the moment, the banks are charging me 4.34% above the ECB rate, which to me is a very high rate.  It might not be very high for bankers, given the type of remuneration they earn, but to me the significance of that was soul-destroying.  It destroyed every aspect of my life.  My personal retirement savings account suffered, as did my VHI contributions and my family.  All my other commitments and little things I used to pay for, such as Sky television - I am a big sports fan - had to go to accommodate all this.</p></speech>

Is that the correct description?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.186" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Lawlor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021061600002#L00300"><p>Yes, this ties in with much of what Mr. Butler and Mr. Kavanagh stated.  Before a person can draw down the money, the solicitors give an undertaking that the deeds of mortgage will be signed in advance of the money being given to that person.  I have no doubt I did that.  I drew down the money on 23 June 2004.  The deed of mortgage should have been signed, and was signed, before the money was drawn down on that date, yet when I was in court, the bank produced a mortgage deed signed on 8 April 2005.</p> <p>  I got no money in 2005.  It is not possible for that mortgage deed to stand up to legal scrutiny.  In fact, my mortgage had been securitised at that stage and had been transferred to another entity.  It was not possible, therefore, for me to sign a document that authorised the bank to proceed with an application on a summary basis to possess my home.  That does not stand up to legal scrutiny.  I should add that I hold an honours degree in law, so I have a basic idea of what I am talking about, although I am sure it is much more complicated than that.  In essence, that document does not stand up to legal scrutiny or to the current law in this country, yet banks are allowed to use it in court and the courts do not ask any questions.</p></speech>

I do not want to cause him any distress further to that which has been caused already.  Nevertheless, he mentioned that his life had changed completely.  Has the bank stopped pursuing him or is it continuing to do so?  How stands Mr. Lawlor's house?  Does he still live in it?  He stated he had had to give up his job due to ill health.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

In 2014, the stress of everything going on at the time led me to suffer quite a significant heart attack.  As a result, I required a quintuple heart bypass, which involved five grafts on my primary arteries.  This was the only way in which I could maintain any sort of cardiac stability at that time.  Because of the nature of the job I was in, namely, an emergency responder to road traffic accidents and so on, I could have experienced an adrenaline rush and my heart just would not have been able for it.  I was advised by my GP that the best avenue for me at that stage was to retire on the grounds of ill health.</p></speech>

That was put on my home in 2019 and the bank has since completely ignored me.  I live in fear for a number of reasons.  Based on the bank's history, it may be the case that it will hold on a little longer and sell the debt to a vulture fund, and then God only knows what will happen to me.</p></speech>

We laypeople place our trust in these people and in policymakers to make the right laws in order that we will be protected.  We place our trust in these people and they are given oversight by regulation to protect us.  Some very simple examinations by the court, within its remit, would have identified certain issues.  One simple example is that if the bank had calculated my liabilities at the rate they had identified in my business record, I would not have been arrears in 2014, and the banks would not legally have been in a position to issue a demand letter to tell me to get out of my home within seven days or immediately pay back the money I owed.  That was a simple exercise the courts refused to examine.</p></speech>

Mr. Butler made a number of references to the Central Bank of Ireland.  It is a view I have held many times, both in court and out of court.  I am not a lawyer, so I do not have any authority to go into court, other than as an advocate.  This is not so easy to do anymore but it was possible in the early stages of the crisis.  There is a citation that goes with loans, that they are governed by the Central Bank of Ireland.  To my mind, that gives the customers the belief that they are okay and are covered, that the Central Bank of Ireland is looking after them and nothing will go wrong.  That was not the case.  Did the Central Bank of Ireland look the other way?  Whatever happened at the time, I do not know.  The fact is that it had disastrous consequences for the ordinary householder or the borrower.  That is but one side.  The other side is that a number of banks left the country.  They came here, raided, and walked off, having undermined the banking system in the country.</p> <p>  Some banks, but certainly not all of them, were, in fact, anxious to talk and to try to work it out.  Some of them indicated this.  In all of the cases that I have dealt with - and I am sure it is the same for everybody else and Oireachtas Members in general - there were some very combative meetings.  The situation developed whereby families were in tears, losing their house, and listening to the harsh words dished out to them by the bank in question.  The bank gave them no sign of any kind of willingness to accommodate them at all, other than to ruthlessly enforce the law, insofar as it saw it, for itself.  The Central Bank of Ireland needs to be awake to this kind of activity now and in the future, or whenever it may occur.  If it has happened once, it can always happen again.</p> <p>  Mr. Butler referred to the Companies Act 2014, and I entirely agree.  It was obvious they were not fulfilling their obligations under company law and they did not care.  There were no consequences for them and there are still not any consequences for them.  Most of those people disappeared from the customers' view.  I could go on and on, Chair.</p> <p>  The point is that we need to have regard to the points made by our witnesses this morning.  We need to take them into account.  We need to try to ensure that as a result of what has happened that, first, perhaps something can be worked out at this stage for their benefit and, second, there should be no repetition of this kind of nonsense and the way some people were treated.</p></speech>

To explain my rationale for asking this question, up to now, the normal sequence of events has been that the committee will engage with the main stakeholders and they will respond by saying the usual thing that it is a legal matter, it is a commercial mater, etc.  We are then back to square one.  In my view, this is an attempt by the Central Bank of Ireland to avoid responsibility by telling us to take the matter to court and to pay huge legal fees.  As members are aware, the Central Bank of Ireland sympathises with us.  However, the courts will not believe regulated commercial banks are acting illegally if the Central Bank of Ireland refuses to take action.  In 2020, a court made it clear that if bankers confessed to an Oireachtas committee that they have hidden losses, this will not be acceptable evidence.  Neither will it accept legal opinions as evidence.  We need the Central Bank of Ireland to publicly express its disapproval of how banks conceal their financial position and, as a result, empower borrowers and EBS agents.<br/><br/>Why is it that private individuals, who are impoverished by the banking system, must fund legal costs and take legal action to do something that the Central Bank of Ireland is required, authorised, and empowered to do?  This committee has a duty to reprimand the Central Bank of Ireland and ask it once again to comment on the <i>Financial Times</i>story, which suggested that the Central Bank of Ireland is conflicted.  Once we have confirmation that the regulated banks are not following the regulations, we can then set about undoing the great damage that the banking system has inflicted on our society.<br/><br/>It surprises me that those people who are paying high rents and who can afford a mortgage are denied one.  Irish banks are not trusted overseas because they continue to conceal their true financial position.  The result is that mortgages are scarce and, when they are available, they are expensive.  Those trapped in the high rental market should blame the Central Bank of Ireland.  While I applaud this committee's work, it is now time to say that it is the Central Bank of Ireland's inaction that is causing the hardship here.</p></speech>

This was to give witnesses the opportunity to present their cases, which they did very well.  It will now be our job, in the banking report we are concluding, to bring some sort of framework to examining all of this.  We will do that in the course of our work.  That is as much as we can do, to influence policy and influence the policy in relation to the Central Bank of Ireland.  Perhaps we can share each of the witnesses&rsquo; experiences.  We can take the transcript of this meeting and send it to the various named sources the witnesses identified for further comment from them.  That is what we are doing here.  This is not a court, by any means.  It is meant to inform policy and direction.  That is the positive contribution that all of the witnesses have made to this meeting.

The financial cost of doing so would be far from prohibitive.  Much larger amounts of another currency are required to tackle this grim toll of death and misery, that is, political will.  We need more political will to address the factors fuelling preventable cardiovascular disease, including overweight and obesity, uncontrolled blood pressure, smoking, physical inactivity, excess alcohol intake and air pollution.  Strong action on these issues, along with cost-effective measures to remove chronic deficits in heart and stroke services, will impact innumerable lives in every corner of the country. </p> <p>  Today, we ask the committee to work with us on what we can do right now within the realms of budgetary constraints to save lives that should not be lost and to create a healthier Ireland.  In addition to unnecessary deaths, approximately 2 million people are at risk, or living with, the long-term effects of heart disease and stroke.  No family is left untouched and we are not doing enough to help them.  Better treatments, public health measures and awareness campaigns drove down the burden of heart disease and stroke in the previous generation, but the curve is turning due to a combination of an ageing population and the impact of lifestyle factors.  </p> <p>  What can we do now to make a difference?  It may sound extraordinary that for the world's biggest killer disease, the first thing we need is a plan.  The previous national cardiovascular strategy expired two years ago.  Not only has it not been replaced, it was never evaluated.  This is even more galling given how neatly a good cardiovascular policy would dovetail with the objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare.  A national cardiac services review has been mothballed by Covid and a stroke strategy focusing on acute services, but we have no overarching framework and no intention currently to create one.   This, we believe, is a recipe for failure, with services reliant on piecemeal strategies and HSE firefighting, no long-term planning and, therefore, much-reduced prospects of funding, regardless of patient need, all against a background where services decimated by the pandemic and subsequent cyberattack desperately need to recover. </p> <p>  Cardiac services face many severe challenges due to Covid, on top of significant historical service deficits.  Chronic heart disease patients comprise 44% of Covid deaths and 49% of related ICU admissions in Ireland, while the future impact of reductions in heart attack admissions, which peaked at 80%, remains unknown.  In the absence of a national cardiac register, real-time data is hard to establish.  We know from cardiologists that outpatient waiting times for new cases were as high as 14 months and have deteriorated further.  Echocardiogram waiting times that were seven months are now 12 months in some hospitals and waiting lists for angiograms can be more than a year depending where a person is treated.  Cardiologists also report that their patients are generally sicker due to cancelled clinics and reduced GP access.  In this information twilight, it is not possible to estimate the impact of Covid-related service deficits on death and disability. </p> <p>  We have accurate information on the impact on cardiac rehabilitation from our own national survey and the picture is grim.  Evidence shows this service can reduce cardiac mortality by 31%, but 77% of centres closed during the pandemic and 69% had services fully suspended for 12 weeks, the longest for 35 weeks.  Even before Covid, services were in crisis with a national waiting list of 2,818, seven centres having a four- to six-month waiting list; seven, more than six months, and three, more than a year.   </p> <p>  Stroke services also face a bleak outlook.  It is estimated that stroke incidence will increase by 60% in a decade, from approximately 7,500 to 12,000 per annum.  Almost four years after the commitment was made to our first national stroke strategy, it remains unpublished.  Meanwhile, the window of opportunity to future-proof stroke services, preventing a devastating spillover of cases affecting all emergency services gets ever smaller.   The stroke strategy addresses acute service deficits, but it contains no measures to aid the recovery of stroke survivors living in the community.  Nothing typifies the neglect of post-discharge services more starkly than the failure to establish how many stroke survivors we have.  The estimate used by the HSE and Department of Health of 30,000 is based on an estimate that is almost a quarter of a century old.  Institute of Public Health research and extrapolations from UK statistics suggest the real figure is approximately 90,000. </p> <p>  Other aspects of cardiovascular health have also been grievously harmed by Covid.  There is evidence of significant weight gain and lower physical activity levels among children and adults and already shocking rates of high blood pressure are getting worse.  Surveys suggest people are smoking and drinking more and the most damaging forms of air pollution to people's health have increased. </p> <p>  What steps can we take now?  Given time restrictions, I refer members to our accompanying submission for a fuller explanation, but I particularly highlight the need for a new cardiovascular health policy underpinned by a national cardiac register to provide an evidence-based framework for service recovery and development and urgent implementation of the stroke strategy, with additional measures to support recovery in the community.   We also must address the causes of cardiovascular disease rather than just its aftermath.  Being overweight and obesity is the biggest threat to the health of our children.  Similar to tobacco with the previous generation, we cannot tackle this scourge without first loosening the grip of advertising and require an outright ban on junk food marketing, at the very least to under 18s, in the promised public health obesity Bill.  Almost 6,000 people die here annually from smoking.  We need increased momentum in the tobacco-free Ireland policy.  Teen smoking rates are increasing for the first time in decades amid an explosion in vaping that we know is a gateway to smoking.</p><p>This should be addressed in new legislation, including a full ban on e-cigarette advertising and child-friendly flavours.  High blood pressure is the biggest cause of cardiovascular disease but we have among the lowest rates of awareness and treatment of it in the developed world.  About two thirds of over-50s are affected.  A comprehensive plan is required, starting with a rolling national awareness campaign, which would have huge impact at minimal cost.  Air pollution costs 1,500 lives here every year, mainly due to heart disease and stroke, yet clean air continues to be addressed from a largely environmental standpoint.  We urge the committee to take a lead on addressing this issue through a health lens and a thorough investigation of the actions that may save many lives.</p><p> It was always assumed that Covid would end and the world would return to normal, but we are now realising we have to learn to live with this virus.  We therefore have to tackle the drivers of Covid-related deaths and hospitalisations, including obesity, smoking, high blood pressure and air pollution, in addition to health service recovery, particularly treatment of chronic heart disease responsible for half of the most serious Covid cases.  We therefore ask the committee to support strong action combining a package of preventive measures with improved service planning and development.  Doing this would also have a huge impact on preventable death and chronic disease rates generally and, ultimately, help to secure the future of our health services.</p></speech>

I represent Cro&iacute;, the west of Ireland heart and stroke foundation, and the NIPC.  Cro&iacute; is a charity which was established in 1984 to lead the fight against heart disease and stroke in the west.  The NIPC was established in 2014 and is an independent medical research and education institute committed to driving the cardiovascular disease prevention agenda in Ireland.  In the context of a cardiovascular health policy, we wish to highlight some key challenges for Ireland, to outline some unmet needs and to make some specific asks of members as guardians of our health service.</p> <p>  Despite the enormity of the Covid pandemic, we must not be distracted from the fact that cardiovascular disease remains the biggest cause of death globally and in Ireland.  The burden of this disease is enormous and growing, driven in particular by the increase in diabetes and obesity.  Covid-19 has added an additional burden.  Thousands of our patients have had their heart procedures and hospital appointments cancelled or postponed.  Consider those who could not get to see their doctor, those who delayed or avoided seeking help and who are now living with the consequences, those with long Covid cardiac complications and together we have a tsunami of post-Covid cardiovascular disease burden coming down the tracks.  From a policy perspective, this burden requires urgent attention if our health system is to cope.</p> <p>  Against this background, we live in the absence of a formal national cardiovascular health strategy.  As already mentioned, the last strategy expired in 2019.  We urgently need a comprehensive strategy to tackle classical cardiovascular disease, that is, cardiovascular disease caused by atherosclerotic disease, or ASCVD, whereby lifestyle and behaviour factors such as high cholesterol, smoking, diet, lack of exercise, etc., are largely preventable risk factors.</p> <p>  We also need to tackle age-related heart conditions, which are primarily a function of vascular ageing.  The development of a strategy needs to embrace the views and needs of all stakeholders across the continuum of care, and the patient perspective is central to that.  Chronic diseases, of which heart disease is a major contributor, place the greatest demands on our health system, largely presented in the third age, that phase of life from 60 years onwards.  Global and national age demographics predict a growing aged population in the coming years.  We are living longer but we are not adequately focused on reducing the consequential health burden.  We need a specific third age strategy for early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment of age-related heart conditions such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure and heart valve disease.  All these age-related conditions, which can be life-threatening and cause chronic disability, could be detected by annual low-cost diagnostic tests, for example: taking a simple blood pressure measure for hypertension, a major cause of heart attack and stroke; checking a pulse for atrial fibrillation, the major cause of devastating stroke; a blood test, proBNP, as a marker for heart failure; or a simple stethoscope examination, which can detect a heart murmur indicative of heart valve disease.  Cro&iacute; recently launched a pilot third age programme in County Mayo supported by HSE West and Mayo County Council and we look forward to publishing the outcomes of this shortly.</p> <p>  What has been and remains significantly absent from our national approach to cardiovascular disease is a serious commitment to prevention.  We urgently need a dedicated national cardiovascular disease prevention strategy.  In parallel but equally important to the development of acute care and interventional cardiology, we need to advance preventive healthcare and the science of behaviour change.  The NIPC has commenced the development of a national white paper in this regard and, when it is completed, we would welcome the opportunity to present it to the committee.  In Ireland what little focus there is currently on prevention from a strategy perspective is on secondary prevention, primarily cardiac rehabilitation for those who have had an event.  However, despite the overwhelming evidence of the benefits and importance of cardiac rehabilitation, we have neither agreed nor adopted a national standardised model of care.  Equally, a crucially important area of need is primary prevention, where the focus should be on those at highest risk.  These are typically individuals without any symptoms but whose cardiovascular disease risk profile puts them at a high risk of a heart attack or stroke.  At the Cro&iacute; Heart and Stroke Centre in Galway we have just completed a very successful demonstration of an effective community-based intervention programme called MySl&aacute;inte.  The development of this evidence-based programme was supported by innovation funding through Sl&aacute;intecare and it has delivered compelling evidence on the effectiveness and benefits of a multidisciplinary, nurse prescriber-led prevention and rehabilitation programme for high-risk individuals.  It was set up during the Covid pandemic as a completely virtual programme and was the only one of its kind in Ireland.  In the context of challenges, we wish to impress on the committee the growing burden of disease our citizens face, exacerbated by Covid.  Ireland now needs unprecedented policy action to reduce premature death and disability, with its associated enormous economic costs.</p> <p>  As for our calls to the committee, we seek its support as follows.  We urgently need a radical national cardiovascular health strategy which can tackle the human and economic burden of the disease.  Unlike the previous strategies, we need equal focus on prevention and acute care, and the development of a strategy must involve patients as key stakeholders.  We need a strategy which will respond to the burden of atherosclerotic disease.  ASCVD is the umbrella term for heart conditions caused by fatty build-up in the lining of the artery wall, the major cause of heart attack and stroke.  High cholesterol plays a big part in ASCVD.  One cause of high cholesterol has its origins in a genetic condition known as familial hypercholesterolemia, FH.  Approximately one in 500 Irish people has this condition and regrettably remain undiagnosed until they experience a cardiac event, usually before the age of 40 which is very often fatal.  If someone has FH, there is a 50:50 chance that a parent or sibling has it.  In Ireland this lethal condition remains underdiagnosed and undertreated because we do not have a strategy on screening, detection, referral, specialist care or treatment.  The absence of a national strategy on FH is allowing our citizens to die prematurely from an easily detectable and easily treated lethal condition.</p> <p>  We need a strategy which responds equally to the degenerative heart conditions linked to vascular ageing.  In particular, we need to address forgotten conditions such as heart valve disease, which is common, serious and treatable.  One in eight people over the age of 85 has moderate to severe heart valve disease.  The prognosis for untreated severe aortic stenosis is worse than most cancers, yet heart valve disease has not even been mentioned in our previous cardiovascular health strategies.  We ask the committee to ensure that, going forward, this treatable condition comes into focus to ensure early and timely diagnosis and treatment.  The cost-effectiveness of annual mini cardiac screens, for example, for everyone over the age of 60 might be worth evaluating.  We need a strategy which adopts and implements a national model of care for cardiac rehabilitation, supported by the necessary resources to provide comprehensive programmes that are accessible to all.  We need a strategy which embeds primary prevention as a central activity in the proposed community hubs, and we strongly recommend the adoption of the Sl&aacute;intecare-funded Cro&iacute; MyAction programme as a suitable and scalable model.</p> <p>  In light of recent media attention on the importance of first responder CPR and defibrillation, we call for greater emphasis on bystander CPR training and suggest it be an obligatory part of the senior cycle curriculum in second level schools.  The more people trained the greater the likelihood of effective, life-saving CPR in cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.</p><p>We also need national policies and guidelines for sports and community organisations with regard to first responder training, defibrillator access and equipment maintenance, etc.  Most importantly, we need support for a critical incident and trauma debriefing service.  At Cro&iacute;, we have noticed an increasing demand for this service, as more public access defibrillators have become available.</p><p> I thank the committee for this opportunity to address it.</p></speech>

There is commonality in the statements they have given on the need for an updated cardiovascular disease and stroke strategies.  I am sure it is something the committee will take up.</p> <p>  In general, people know what they are supposed to be doing in terms of getting check-ups, eating healthy, taking exercise, not smoking and limiting drinking.  Most people are aware of that but putting that into action is a different matter.  When we consider the success of the vaccine roll-out for Covid-19 and the fact people volunteered and registered, perhaps we are missing a trick in terms of taking people's blood pressure at the same time, although that would delay appointments.  However, there is opportunity through measures such as that to encourage people to lead healthy lives.</p> <p>  Generally, people understand heart attack and stroke but heart failure is a concept many people are not as aware of and maybe it goes under the radar to a degree, but it is a hugely important issue in terms of loss of life and debilitating impact.  Perhaps the witnesses would like to comment on the difference in how they would promote that.  With regard to the stroke and cardiovascular disease strategies, what practical issues do they envisage in those strategies to encourage people, especially those aged over 60, to get check-ups to monitor their blood pressure, cholesterol and so on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.221" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021061600002#C00300"><p>We need to a lot to raise awareness among people about the impact their health behaviours can have on their cardiovascular health and to alert them to the various risks in their health.  We concur with Mr. Johnson that we need a comprehensive national prevention strategy.  It needs to start with what we call the commercial and social determinants of health.  We tend to place significant emphasis in this country on individual responsibility for people's health, whereas we need to start much further back.</p> <p>  There are quite a number of structural issues to do with health inequality and people living in poverty and disadvantage, as well as people being assailed by from all quarters by inappropriate marketing, especially children, in terms of junk food marketing.  Until we begin to seriously address many of these commercial determinants of health, we will not make great inputs in terms of impacting on cardiovascular health, just by increasing awareness.</p> <p>  More needs to be done in that area.  We need to resource Healthy Ireland more effectively.  Its budget this year is &euro;20 million.  That is up from approximately &euro;5 million, out of a total health budget of &euro;20 billion, which is, quite plainly, a ridiculous amount to suspend on primary prevention.  A hypertension campaign needs to be prioritised.  We are in discussions with the Department of Health and Sl&aacute;intecare about a full-scale national hypertension awareness campaign to encourage people to get their blood pressure checked.</p> <p>  With regard to heart failure, the Senator Kyne is correct.  Approximately 90,000 in this country are living with heart failure.  They are largely unrecognised and there are few facilities for people living in the community with heart failure, in terms of helping them with self-management.  We have a new programme, which we began less than a year ago, supported by the HSE, to help people and to give them the information and support they require to help them to manage their condition.  However, it is a significantly under-recognised condition and we need to do much more, both at acute service level and in terms of community support, for people living with the condition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.222" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021061600002#C00400"><p>I will add to what Mr. Collins said and endorse everything he said.  With regard to the last comment on heart failure, this is a huge issue and burden, which presents many challenges.  One of the big challenges is the diagnosis of heart failure and access to a basic echocardiogram.  Reference was made earlier to the waiting time.  GPs, who tend to be the first presentation, have a dilemma in that they cannot diagnose the condition if they do not have access to these tests.  Access to echocardiograms is an important issue in heart failure.</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms Gibson, to address behavioural change because she is a specialist in that area.  In the context of the overall burden of disease we are describing, there is a bottleneck in that third age when a large proportion of these conditions present.  Reference was made to a blood pressure awareness campaign, which is needed, but, equally, there is also a need for a national mini-cardiac screen using some sort of free mechanism through which people can be detected before these conditions become exacerbated.  These conditions are easily detected.  It is not high science to take a blood pressure, listen to somebody's heart with a stethoscope or check a pulse.  These simple tests can detect conditions that have an enormous impact on the individual and a significant economic burden on society.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Johnson think there could be scope for the HSE to set up a stand at mass gatherings such as football, soccer or rugby matches to do quick blood pressure tests?  It may not be as accurate after the match as it would be before it.</p> <p>  HE also mentioned echocardiograms.  Would primary care centres be in a position to do them, subject to having the equipment, or is it a specialist requirement in hospitals?</p></speech>

In the context of echocardiograms, one of the biggest challenges right now is the availability of cardiac physiologists, those who conduct these tests.  We do not have enough of these in the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.225" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Irene Gibson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021061600002#C00700"><p>The Senator raised an important point regarding accessibility and supporting people to self-manage their conditions.  One of the biggest challenges we have when it comes to prevention of cardiovascular disease is many of the risk factors are silent.  Our health system is a reactive system and there are no incentives for people to attend general practice.  For the past 20 years or so, much of the Cro&iacute;'s work has been about trying to bring preventative services into the community and reaching hard-to-reach communities, in particular.</p> <p>  There is significant inequality when it comes to accessing services.  The highest prevalence of cardiovascular disease is among under-served communities.  It is important we look at how we can bring screening services into the community.  We know screening in the community works.  We have done many projects with the farming community and Traveller and migrant communities, and, without a doubt, early detection makes a huge difference.</p> <p>  It is important we look at universal access to screening services.  For many people, unless they have a medical card, they have to pay to go to their GP and have their blood pressure and cholesterol checked.  That is a significant problem.  I appreciate and acknowledge the great efforts being made in the new GP contract and the management of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, whereby people over the age of 70 are entitled to two checks per year.  However, we need to look at shifting and widening that to the group aged over 40, in particular, when risk significantly increases.</p></speech>

We are thankful that he is recovering.  Speed, the availability of defibrillators and the fact that this sporting event was being monitored were factors.  What more can be done with regard to our front-line paramedics, the old system, particularly in rural communities, involving the Order of Malta and the Red Cross, and the availability of defibrillators?  There are State supports but what more can be done?  Perhaps Mr. Collins could take that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.229" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021061600002#D00400"><p>There are a couple of simple things we can do.  With regard to the availability of defibrillators, we need to give more support to community first responder groups.  One very simple thing that could be done would be to allow such groups to claim VAT back on equipment they buy.  That would decrease the cost of the equipment to the groups significantly.  Approximately 1,800 automated external defibrillators, AEDs, are available to first responder groups around the country.  We could probably do with more.  We need to fund a cardiopulmonary resuscitation, CPR, programme for schools.  In the past four years, we have trained approximately 300,000 children in approximately 70% of schools around the country.  We have run out of funding for that.  We would like to increase that figure to 100%.  We agree with Mr. Johnson that this should be brought in as part of the curriculum.</p> <p>  The final practical thing that could be done would be to ensure that there is enough funding for the National Ambulance Service, NAS, to put in place a registry of defibrillators and an app.  The most important thing is that, when a person attends a cardiac arrest and is on the phone to NAS, the service needs to be able to tell the person that there is a defibrillator 100 yd away and that the person should ask someone to get it.  We need to know that the defibrillator is properly serviced, that the battery is charged and that the pads have been replaced.  Simple things like that will save lives and bring us from a survival rate of 7% or 8% for cardiac arrests in the community to where we should be, which is at least 10% or 12%.  That would save 100 or 150 lives.</p></speech>

There is an old adage: fail to plan, plan to fail.  It is extraordinary that a strategy for a period of almost ten years has not been evaluated.  We do not know what has worked from the HSE's perspective or what it might be looking for in a new plan.  From what Mr. Collins said, there does not even seem to be an indication as to when we might see the bones of a new strategy or plan.  What has the IHF's engagement with the HSE on this matter been like?  Has the foundation been given any indication as to when movement on the framing of a new strategy is likely?  I assume it has regular contact with the HSE.  Has any indication been given as to when discussions on a new strategy might even begin?</p></speech>

To go back a bit, any information we have on the previous plan, which ran from 2010 to 2019, we largely got through parliamentary questions.  We undertook an exercise in 2017 and 2018 to try to understand the status of the recommendations, particularly as the plan was coming to an end in 2019, but no formal evaluation was planned at that stage.  We were told that it would take place in 2019 and that, in deliberations on the national cardiac services review, the status of these recommendations would be revealed.  Again, nothing came out of that.  In the end, we submitted freedom of information requests to the Department of Health.  What we found was that there was no designated responsibility for cardiovascular policy within the Department.  We could not find someone to take these freedom of information requests.  Eventually, they went to the national patient safety office, NPSO, which had responsibility for the cardiac services review.  No evaluation of the recommendations was ever done.  As yet, there is no plan to review them, to carry out an evaluation or to put together a new plan.  I reiterate that there was nobody with responsibility for cardiovascular policy.</p> <p>  The only thing that is happening in respect of cardiac services is a cardiac services review.  This was put on hold as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and because Professor Philip Nolan is playing an active and important role on the national public health emergency team, NPHET.  However, when he took his place there, the process stopped and only recently the post of project manager for the review was advertised.  That position was advertised as a 12-month secondment.  Outside of the completion of the national cardiac services review, there is no responsibility for cardiovascular policy.  I will highlight that the scope and parameters of that review do not cover that full and holistic approach to health that would involve prevention, treatment, care in the community and rehabilitation.  It is just looking specifically at the reconfiguration of cardiac services.</p></speech>

It is obvious that we need a new strategy.  There is a role for the committee in ensuring that is developed.  Following this session, we need to write to the HSE to find out what is happening and to put pressure on for a new strategy to be put in place.  It is extraordinary that an advocate organisation has to go to the lengths of seeking parliamentary questions and submitting freedom of information requests to evaluate the effect of a strategy that was in place for nearly ten years.  It is outrageous that there has been no evaluation of that strategy.  That has to be made very clear to the HSE.</p> <p>  It is also extraordinary that there seems to be no lead unit in the HSE or Department when one considers that cardiovascular disease is one of the biggest killers of people in this State.  It is just unbelievable that is the case.  There is a need for the committee to shine a spotlight on this issue.</p> <p>  I will move to the issue of stroke survivors.  I will go back to Mr. Collins in this regard first.  He said that the best estimate the HSE has of the number of stroke survivors is 30,000 but that there has not been a comprehensive survey so the figure could be treble that.  Is that the reality?</p></speech>

Again, I find this extraordinary.  How, in God's name, are we meant to plan for the needs of stroke survivors if we do not even know how many of them there are?  If the HSE has not even conducted an audit and does not have a registry of the number of stroke survivors, how are we going to put in place a plan that provides for their needs?  Again, this is something the committee has to take up.  It is just outrageous that this is the case.</p> <p>  I will move on to Mr. Johnson on the issue of prevention.  He quite rightly outlined that prevention is important.  He talked about screening and testing.  I myself have been tested, mainly at party Ard-Fheiseanna.  The IHF sets up a stall at party Ard-Fheiseanna and similar events and does blood pressure testing.  What level of screening and testing is carried out by the HSE in the general population?  What more needs to be done?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.244" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021061600002#D01900"><p>My understanding is that very little is carried out.  There is not a formal strategy for testing.  In fact, one can question what tests would be done if, for example, a person was presenting to their GP and what is covered under the GP contract.  There is a clear lack of opportunity for some holistic cardiovascular assessment.</p><p>It might be a bit of a clich&eacute; to say that we refer to the health system or health service, but, actually, it is a sick system.  I do not mean that disparagingly.  The focus is on treating the sick.  What is missing is a preventative healthcare system.  That needs to permeate across primary and secondary care.  I referred to the idea, which could perhaps be evaluated from a cost-effectiveness point of view, that there would be significant value in carrying out annual mini-cardiac checks on those aged 60 or older, although that might to be too late.  I am not talking about comprehensive, heavy diagnostic equipment.  Matters such as atrial fibrillation, heart valve disease, heart failure and hypertension can be detected through low-cost intervention.  One will not be able to prevent the condition if it has been detected, but if it is caught at the right time, one can halt or slow its progression and thereby reduce the health impact on the individual and the economic impact on society and, potentially, a more active and healthy ageing population with people living longer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.246" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021061600002#E00200"><p>I wish to make a final comment.  My time is almost up.  When there is a review of the existing strategy and consideration is given to framing a new strategy, screening and testing have to be front and centre.  It is unacceptable that screening and testing are so minimal.  As Mr. Johnson pointed out, it can be low cost and rolled out through general practice.   It can also be done in a serial way at mass gatherings, as was stated.  There are obvious opportunities there and that has to be part of the national strategy.</p> <p>  The national review of cardiac services is a matter close to my heart, if colleagues will pardon the pun, because it arose from a very high-profile campaign in the south east, where we do not have 24-7 primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PPCI, services, as those present will be aware.  It is important that we have regional balance and that all areas have access to critical cardiac care.  It is unacceptable that the review still has not been completed.  I accept that Professor Nolan was taken away to do other work, which is fair enough, but the review is at least a year and a half in the making.  It will have profound implications for cardiovascular policy in the State.  In light of its importance, I again ask that the committee write to the HSE to ask about timeframes for the review and its completion.</p> <p>  I will leave it at that.  I thank the witnesses for their presence and for raising the important issues they have brought to our attention.</p></speech>

It was great to see Deputy John Paul Phelan on the Leinster House campus yesterday.  It has been well reported that he had cardiac health problems.  It is great to see him back looking in full health.  I wish him plenty of good health in the months ahead.</p> <p>  Events in the past week highlighted the need for greater screening in cardiac care.  It was shocking to see Christian Eriksen collapse on the pitch while playing for his country and everything that followed.  It is good that he is making a recovery in hospital.  One of the statistics in the opening statements is that up to 60% of Irish people are now considered to be obese or overweight.  What happened to Christian Eriksen needs to be closely considered because it could be of relevance to several people in my network of friends and acquaintances alone.  When persons who are overweight they visit their doctor, more often than not, they are told to stand on the scales and their blood pressure is checked.  There are kind of warning signs there already.  The very fact that they are carrying excess weight puts them at a high risk.  However, many people who jog the roads every day, do triathlons or play team sports and look the picture of health could have blockages in their arteries or their heart may not be firing properly and they may need a pacemaker.  Such issues are not always detected.  When such people go to a doctor or other health professional, it is often the case that they are looked over but not considered to be particularly high risk.  Is there a way to get more of those people into the net?  Running has become more than a fad in recent years.  Every evening, a significant number of people go running and put their bodies under pressure.  Are we focusing very much on those who are obviously in poor health and morbidly obese or very overweight to the detriment of those who appear to be in good health?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.248" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021061600002#E00400"><p>It is a good point.  We need to focus on the low-hanging fruit.  The biggest modifiable risk for cardiovascular disease is probably high blood pressure or hypertension.  Ireland is a complete outlier in this regard in Europe.  The Irish LongituDinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, data for the over-50s indicates that approximately 64% of those aged over 50 have hypertension and approximately half of those have undiagnosed hypertension, so there are many people with high blood pressure, which can cause stroke, heart disease, kidney disease and, ultimately, dementia.  They will remain undiagnosed until they have a blood pressure check.  The other difficulty in Ireland is that among those who know they have high blood pressure, fewer than half have their condition properly controlled.  That is one of the reasons we have promoted the idea of a national hypertension awareness campaign to let people know this is a relatively symptomless condition that can have a major bearing on their health in terms of chronic disease and acute incidents such as stroke.  Until we start putting resources into screening for such conditions, we will continue to have the same level of death and disability, with approximately 9,000 lives lost each year from cardiovascular disease.  It is an important issue.</p></speech>

All members are politically attuned to their communities.  It is our bread and butter to know the people around us and the communities we serve.  However, it is difficult to identify where defibrillators are located in neighbouring villages.  Mr. Collins might be able to enlighten the committee on this issue.  I am aware of two ways in which one can identify the locations of AEDs.  One is the Helping Hearts website, which provides a map on which one can zoom in to see where the AEDs are located.  The other is to call 999 or 112 and the dispatcher can relate where there is an AED nearby.  It concerns me that this is expensive kit, with some of the devices costing up to &euro;2,000 or &euro;2,500.  The school in which I formerly taught has an AED mounted on its side gable.  There is a code to open the secure box to remove the defibrillator and use it.  There was a time when I knew that code off by heart but I have forgotten it.  My worry is that when defibrillators are needed, people do not now where they are or the code to open the box.  That is happening around Ireland.  Are we lacking a database in that regard?  Ms Walsh or one of her colleagues may wish to reply to that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.250" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021061600002#E00600"><p>I am happy to respond.  The most important thing on coming upon a person who is having cardiac arrest, 70% of which happen in the home, is to immediately call 999 to quickly make contact with the NAS, which can give directions to a nearby defibrillator and all the information about the defibrillator.  However, the ambulance service needs a proper national register and to know that the defibrillators on the register are being properly maintained so that it can give things like access codes and so on.</p> <p>  In advance of such a register being put in place, it is important to note that defibrillators are important, but only approximately 20% of people who suffer a cardiac arrest have a shockable rhythm.  The most important thing is to have more people in the community who understand how to do high-quality CPR.  The main focus for the Irish Heart Foundation in recent years has been to train people in how to do CPR.  There is a really high rate, at approximately 85%, of what we call bystander CPR, that is, people who will have a go.  Irish people are very good in that regard but many people do not know how to do CPR properly.  More resources need to be put into awareness and training of people in CPR at a national level, to begin with schools, as was mentioned, but to also include training the adult population.  While they are being trained, they can be told how to use an AED or a defibrillator.</p></speech>

Inadequacies for stroke survivors were mentioned.</p><p>I ask the witnesses to detail those inadequacies and to outline what buttons we, as Oireachtas Members, need to push in that regard. </p><p> It was mentioned that air pollution is the cause of 1,500 deaths per annum.  That shocked me.  In Ireland, much of the resources in this area are focused on litter pollution, with little heed or credence to noise or air pollution.  That air pollution accounts for the loss of 1,500 lives per annum is alarming.  Are there particular types of air pollution about which the organisations are concerned?  Is the figure of 1,500 referenced under a general pollution heading or are there specific things of which we should be more fearful as a society?</p></speech>

Before doing so, I will try to answer the question on air pollution.  We did a pubic opinion-awareness survey recently.  Most people in Ireland think that air pollution, or at least the air pollution that is impacting on health, comes from transport emissions.  The bulk of the particulates we breathe in that cause heart disease and stroke come from burning solid fuels.  We have been strong in saying to Government that it needs to do a number of things in this area.  It needs to bring in WHO air quality standards, move forward with a clean air Act and ban the burning of the worst smoky solid fuels, that is, smoky coal, wet wood and peat sod turf.  We also need to phase out the burning of fuels.  We are an outlier in Europe in our reliance on solid fuel to heat our homes.  We need to ensure that people have the resources to retrofit their homes and to deal with the issue of fuel poverty.  I will hand over to Mr. Macey.</p></speech>

We have become good at saving lives from stroke.  We are putting a lot of expertise and resources into that area, but we are squandering people's recovery because they are being abandoned at the hospital gates without any access, unless they can afford to pay for it themselves, to the basic rehabilitation programmes they need such as physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and psychology.  This is about a brain injury.  There are three whole-time equivalents in the country to help people recover from that injury.  They are some of the issues.</p> <p>  The issue is gross underfunding and the sense people have of abandonment in the community.  We need to establish the number of stroke survivors in Ireland.  That will require a proper needs survey and a plan to roll it out.  We have a plan for everything in Ireland these days, but people are being discharged after stroke without a right to a discharge plan.  That is crazy and it needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

What the witnesses are talking about is, in many ways, the blindingly obvious but we have to ask questions as to why this is not happening.  What they are talking about is also the essence of Sl&aacute;intecare.  One would imagine that at this stage we would have learned lessons.  They identified the main causes of cardiovascular disease, most of which are outside of the health services.  Why are we not tackling those issues?</p> <p>  Is a chronic illness programme in place in the cardiovascular area?  What is the leadership in all of this?  The IHF and Cro&iacute;, as community-based patient organisations, play a critical role.  Where is the leadership on this at the Department or HSE level?  Why do we have such an overly medical model?  The witnesses mentioned the personal burden.  This also imposes an economic burden on the country and on the health service.  The solutions are obvious.  Why are we not doing the obvious?  Why are we not concentrating on prevention and doing those things that would make people of the risks involved?  Why do we not have primary prevention, community-based healthcare, nurse-led programmes?  I would like to know where the blockage is.  Why are we not doing what we should?</p></speech>

We have seen inaction on climate change and on a range of social issues that are immediately impacting on us.  That is the problem.  It is the reason prevention is the poor cousin of acute medicine.  I am optimistic.  There are things happening.  The chronic disease management programme in general practice, which mandates GPs to do annual checks among people of a certain age group, is a good start.  There has been a sea change in the attitude and enthusiasm of GPs around the country in regard to prevention, particularly because of that programme, but it is not enough because it is confined to medical card holders.</p> <p>  There are straws in the wind in that the excellent plan which the Deputy shepherded through a number of years ago, that is, Sl&aacute;intecare, has commenced implementation.  Laura Magahy and her team are making inroads and it looks like they are getting some budget.  We are in contact with them about hypertension awareness.  The response has been slow but positive.  I am not pessimistic.  We are beginning to make inroads, but we are so far behind in terms of the resources that we put into prevention.  One of the things we are asking of the committee today is that it reaches outside of its traditional remit of health and look at the wider determinants of health.  Unless this committee takes a lead, there will be no consideration of the health impacts of air pollution and junk food marketing to children.  There is no sense in addressing weight management in children unless we shop junk food marketing.  That is the first step.  Everything else, in terms of the services they need at a health level, must come after that.  I am optimist and I think we are beginning to make progress.</p></speech>

We need to call it as it is.  The reality is that preventive healthcare has never been a priority.  We are at a point now where our health system is crumbling under the burden of cardiovascular disease.  It is not sustainable.  Clearly, the penny is beginning to drop through programmes such as Sl&aacute;intecare, but this requires a significant and unprecedented approach, perhaps with a Minister of State with responsibility for prevention at Department of Health level.  It may sound an extreme suggestion, but we need somebody to take ownership.  So much of cardiovascular disease is preventable.  Simple things can be done, but much of it is more challenging, particularly when we get into the behavioural science side of things.  We are missing strong, central government leadership.  We need a stand-alone strategy on cardiovascular disease prevention.  Such a strategy would have knock-on benefits for many other diseases such as cancer, kidney disease, diabetes, and obesity, all of which share the same risk factors, but nobody in Ireland is taking singular responsibility for the prevention agenda.</p></speech>

The commercial determinants we are talking about, which are the real drivers of obesity, are intense marketing and the high volume and availability of energy-dense foods.  There is now a worldwide snack food industry worth $374 billion that did not exist in the 1960s.  It did not exist before obesity became a problem.  These are the issues that are driving the problem.  All governments tend to do is come up with voluntary codes, which puts the personal responsibility back onto individuals and families when the environment just overwhelms them.  You might walk past a shop nine times and not go in for a chocolate bar, but the tenth time you do.  The other nine times do not count.  We all do it.  These are issues that are driving the problem.</p></speech>

Can we unpack that a little?  The need for greater data has come up during committee meetings on other areas of health.  Registers for people who experience chronic illness allow faster access to care or more immediate access to screening and testing.  Can the witnesses unpack how that would work for cardiovascular issues in particular?  There is a wide spectrum, from people who have fully managed but identified heart murmurs right up to people who experience complex health events.</p></speech>

People representing cancer services were before the committee last week.  There is a national cancer registry, which provides real-time data that just does not exist for us.  As has been said, waiting times for outpatients for echocardiograms and angiograms are months long and getting longer.  We get a snapshot of that.  We hear about what is happening in an individual hospital, but we never get a full clear and consistent picture of what is going on.</p> <p>  There is a heart attack audit and registers are being done by individual cardiologists for some specific conditions, but there is a dearth of regular real-time data to inform health planning.  Service delivery impact and cost-effectiveness cannot be maximised clearly when we do not know what is happening, or what is and is not working, and if there is no fast alert system when problems arise, as they do regularly in individual hospitals and collectively on things like waiting lists.  As far as we are concerned, this is something that has to be front and centre of a new national cardiovascular strategy.</p></speech>

We heard from groups speaking about diabetes that a well-working register allows people to access care immediately as soon as they arrive at a hospital.  Is it accurate to say data collection also impacts outcomes, not just data?</p></speech>

Registries are clearly an issue, but it is more about the registry.  It is a central health record.  In cardiovascular disease, comorbidities are quite significant and what is happening, unfortunately, are silos of care.  This is why we have a messy situation.  The Deputy mentioned diabetes, for example, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.  The number of individuals being treated for diabetes whose cardio risk factors are not being managed at all is quite disturbing.  If there was some central health record that tracked these comorbidities, clinicians would be alerted and prompted to look at a more integrated care approach.  The registries are needed first of all to understand the numbers and who has what and how many have it.  However, more importantly, we need some central health record, which we do not have, that allows tracking of comorbidities to prompt integrated care.  That is not happening, unfortunately, in cardiovascular disease.</p></speech>

It is important that we begin with a register and then go to the next generation of ensuring that we do not silo information.</p> <p>  On that data issue, one of the points made in Mr. Collins's opening statement was about the incredibly high numbers of women with heart disease.  In the past few years, international studies have implied that heart disease in women, or negative outcomes, is increasing.  What are the answers in tackling that issue for women, in particular, including the data issue but also, perhaps, public information? </p></speech>

Heart disease has almost been considered a male disease.  Most women are not aware of the idea that women have heart disease.  However, post-menopause, women are as at risk from heart disease as men, if not more so.  It is a serious cause of death and disability in women post-menopause.  We need to make people aware so that women are more aware and ensure they get themselves checked and that their blood pressure is normal.  We also need to get the wider health system to take it seriously as an issue.  The chronic disease management programme in general practice will help us there, but we need to put a much greater emphasis on awareness at all levels both within the health services and with women generally.</p></speech>

They have been most informative.  In some ways, they have been relevant in respect of what happened on a football pitch a few weeks ago in the match between Denmark and Finland.  Everybody was shocked to see what happened to Christian Eriksen on the pitch.  One of the best places that someone could suffer a heart attack is on a pitch in a football stadium because there is access to immediate care.  Christian Eriksen seems to have made a speedy recovery.  Other footballers and athletes have not been so lucky in such situations.  The incident threw up many questions in respect of our own heart health.  The fact that a professional footballer at the peak of his career can have a heart attack like that has sent shudders down the spines of most people who are healthy and going about their lives.  Advancements in health, particularly in cardiac care and CPR, have saved lives.  That is good.</p> <p>  I wish to address a number of points in the submission from the IHF.  The first point concerns what the foundation describes as the scourge of junk food marketing.  It is insidious in society.  These companies are involved in extreme marketing that targets young people.  They get into the heads of not only young people, but everyone.  They tell them that they deserve the food they are marketing.  Junk food is marketed as no being longer a treat, but as something to be consumed daily as part of a balanced diet.  I ask one of the IHF representatives to comment on how we can address the scourge of advertisements.  There are so many vested interests in fast food advertising.  It is insidious.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the Deputy is aware, but we presented to the Joint Oireachtas Committee Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media a number of weeks ago in a discussion of the online safety and media regulation Bill 2020.  We need a ban on junk food marketing to children.  We need statutory regulation of that.  Voluntary codes do not work and they have not worked.  Evidence produced over decades illustrates that it does not, and will not, work.  Broadcast regulations have been produced by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  There is a broadcast watershed that we believe needs to be extended.</p> <p>  Online junk food marketing has become a particular problem, as young people, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, have migrated online for educational purposes in particular.  We believe that a statutory ban on junk food marketing to children has to happen.  In the UK, the Government committed to introducing an online junk food marketing ban and to extend the watershed from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. in the Queen's speech. </p> <p>  The Irish Heart Foundation commissioned a public health (obesity) Bill.  We presented it to the previous Government and it made it into the programme for Government.  There is a commitment to pass such a Bill.  We believe and hope that the Bill will be brought forward.  We have a serious concern that the commitment in respect of the public health (obesity) bill within the recently published Healthy Ireland strategic framework is just to explore with stakeholders the issues relating to the introduction of the Bill.  We are concerned that the Bill will not go further than an initial exploration.  It goes to the Deputy's point about the vested interests involved and what was discussed earlier about the commercial determinants of health.  </p> <p>  In every group that has been established on obesity policy in Ireland, the food and drink industry has been at the table.  Through the submission of freedom of information requests in respect of the voluntary code of practice for non-broadcast marketing that was published three years ago, we know that in some instances the food and drink industry asserted that its members would not agree to it and it needed to be changed.  At the last minute, the Department of Health had to pander to industry to change that.  When industry is represented in these groups, it is hard for change to happen.  If we want change to happen and the scourge of junk food marketing to be eliminated, industry must be removed from the equation.  Representatives from the industry should not be sitting at the table in policy discussions.  That is not just the case in respect of junk food marketing; it applies to all harmful products.  The passing of the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 serves as an example.  We need statutory regulation.  If Government and the Oireachtas do not intervene, these practices will continue because voluntary codes simply do not work.</p></speech>

We are not drafters of legislation.  We are looking at the introduction of no-fry zones and advertising around schools.  In the Bill we are also seeking to extend the broadcast watershed.  Online marketing to children should also be considered.  Currently, we are looking at the online safety and media regulation Bill 2020 because it transposes the audiovisual media services directive and establishes the Future of Media Commission.  There are means of banning junk food marketing within that Bill.  We encourage members to take an active role in that when the pre-legislative scrutiny process concludes and the Bill eventually gets published.</p> <p>  We are looking at a model that is similar to that used in the Public Health (Alcohol) Act.  We are focusing on advertising and no-fry zones around schools and the broadcast elements.  We cannot just focus on the broadcast elements; we must deal with the online marketing.</p></speech>

At the outset, the Deputy referenced the Christian Eriksen incident.  One of the things that we hope will come from the media attention around that incident is the distinction between cardiac arrest and heart attack.  They are quite different.  I do not have a full report on what happened to Christian Eriksen, but it would seem that he suffered a cardiac arrest, which, in layman's terms, is an electrical malfunction as opposed to underlying cardiovascular disease and a heart attack.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's question, in the case of cardiac arrest, as the IHF has indicated, first and foremost, CPR is needed.  Good CPR saves lives.  That is the bottom line.  It is not a great burden on anybody to learn.  There is no obligation, moral or legal, on anyone to use it if they happen to witness a cardiac arrest.  The simple maths are that the more people know how to administer CPR, the better.</p> <p>  The foundation is doing great work in training secondary school children through its own resources.  Why can we not make it obligatory, as part of the second-level curriculum, that everybody, before they leave secondary school, undertakes a basic course in CPR?  I would even go one step further and assert that those who continue to vocational training or third-level education should also be required to complete a top-up or refresher course before they complete their training or studies.  In some countries, it is obligatory to be CPR certified before getting a driver's licence.  I do not suggest that we place a large burden on the population, but the reality is that CPR saves lives.  I am not just talking about cardiac arrest, because part of CPR training also teaches participants how to respond in cases of choking.  I strongly suggest that perhaps the Minister for Education considers this making it an obligatory part of second-level education.  It could be introduced, for instance, under a CSPE programme or another element.  It takes no more than two or three hours to learn CPR.</p></speech>

It has been quite an informative morning.  As others have said, the events over the weekend have crystalised the importance of this issue.  Following on from the previous contribution, it would be a very good start if every teacher in the country were trained in CPR.  I agree that CPR needs to be an obligatory part of the curriculum and taught in the workplace and that top-ups should continue.  Do the witnesses have a view on the Health and Safety Authority having a role in this?</p> <p>  Defibrillators should be commonplace in workplaces.  People should be trained in their use.  They should be at the centre of any kind of health and safety plan or programme in workplaces.  What engagements have the witnesses had with the Health and Safety Authority in this regard?  I missed the very start of the meeting because I had another engagement, so maybe this question has been answered.  Do the witnesses know how many defibrillators in the country are working?  What is the percentage of defibrillators that are broken, have not been updated or have not been serviced?  That has to be a very serious situation.  A defibrillator might be used only very rarely but it is critical that they are all working.  The witnesses might give us an idea of those percentages.</p> <p>  Other members, including Deputy Cullinane, have spoken about the strategy.  It is appalling to think the Department of Health has not been monitoring the strategy or has not really taken it seriously.  This is a serious issue.  I believe that the engagement with the committee this morning will result in our making contact with or engaging with the Department.  We will no doubt have the HSE, the Department officials and the Minister before us in due course and we can put this issue to them then.</p> <p>  Those are a couple of my observations.  Any of the witnesses may respond to them; I do not mind who.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.299" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021061600002#J00200"><p>I will jump in here if that is okay.  We think the key to ensuring there are sufficient working defibrillators around the country is community first responder groups.  They are volunteer-led groups but are highly trained, very effective and linked in with the National Ambulance Service in a very effective way such that when somebody calls 999, they are alerted if there is a cardiac arrest.  They currently have about 1,800 defibrillators around the country in community first responder groups.  We think that distributing defibrillators through community first responder, CFR, groups is the way to go because they will maintain them and ensure they are charged, ready to go and available for use.  Every major workplace should have a defibrillator.  This may be an issue for the Health and Safety Authority.  There is a national out-of-hospital cardiac arrest strategy and a lot of work has been done on that.  It links in with the ambulance service and CFR Ireland.  We train many teachers around the country as part of our CPR for schools programme.  About 70% of post-primary school teachers have been trained.  If CPR were a mandatory part of the curriculum, we could ensure that all teachers are trained.  There is a huge level of enthusiasm among teachers for this.  We find it is an easy programme because the teachers like it, it is something different, young people really like to get the skill and it can be done very quickly, in less than one hour.  I hope that has answered the Senator's questions.</p></speech>

Recently, by which I mean in the past two or three years, there was a significant media campaign on what to do if you are in the company of somebody who shows symptoms of a stroke.  What was the feedback from that media campaign?  Is there any evidence from it or was any research done following it to the effect that it was a success?  I thought it was quite a powerful campaign and I am curious to know whether the witnesses deem it as having been a success?</p></speech>

We ran a major TV campaign in 2011 on FAST, the stroke warning signs.  It brought Ireland's level of awareness up to the highest in the world.  The call to action part increased a lot as well but probably not as much as we would have wanted.  It went up to about 60%.  In the most recent campaign we focused on why minutes matter and why you just have to get in and get treated as quickly as possible.  There is nothing else to do.  The average stroke destroys 2 million brain cells a minute.  There was an 11% increase in awareness following that campaign, which was really good because it was only a radio campaign.  We only had the funding for a radio campaign.  It was a really good trial of something that needs to be a lot bigger.  This needs to be a rolling TV-based campaign that ensures that people get to hospital as quickly as possible.  The median presentation time for stroke is now just under three hours, which is just not good enough because with literally every minute that is saved more of the brain is saved.  We are talking about 2 million brain cells every minute.  Therefore, what we are asking the Department of Health and the national stroke programme to do now is to support a rolling FAST campaign that hardwires this awareness into the national consciousness.</p></speech>

I have learned an awful lot.  One thing that kept coming into my mind is that my mother used to say prevention is better than cure, and how true that is, listening to all the witnesses.  A lot of the questions have been covered.  I am interested in a couple of specific areas.  Mr. Collins mentioned looking at air pollution through a health lens and that it is a huge public health concern.  Could he say a little more about that?  He mentioned fuels like coal and peat.  Is gas in there as well?  Should the committee link in with the climate action committee on this and explore it a little further?  I think the awareness of this is very limited.  I certainly had not been aware that air pollution was connected with heart health at all.  That is my first question for Mr. Collins.</p> <p>  In Mr. Johnson's opening statement he mentioned the Cro&iacute; MySl&aacute;inte programme as a community healthcare model.  I would love to hear a little more about that and how it works.</p> <p>  I think it was Mr. Collins who mentioned Healthy Ireland - or was it health and well-being - and how little funding they have received.  That could be the Department that could look at prevention.  If they had more funding, what more do the witnesses think they could do?</p> <p>  Finally, maybe Ms Walsh could speak a little about the relationship between alcohol and heart disease.</p></speech>

I will endeavour to get through her questions as quickly as I can.</p> <p>  Air pollution is an interesting one.  I worked for Mary Harney in the late 1980s.  She was responsible for bringing in the first ban on smoky solid fuel in Dublin and, subsequently, in other major cities in 1990.  Over that period we saved about 10,000 lives, but our understanding of air pollution has evolved significantly since then.  We used to think air pollution was the stuff you could see, the smog, but in fact the air pollution that kills people is fine particulates called PM2.5.  They are invisible.  They are about 1/30th the width of a human hair.  They are emitted from burning solid fuel.  More are emitted from sod turf, which is the worst fuel type in this regard, wet wood and smoky coal, but they are also emitted from other solid fuels.</p><p>Smokeless coal also emits these fine particulates.  They not only go into the atmosphere through the chimney; they go into the home.  Between 30% and 40% of the particulates of an open fire will flow into a living room.  We know that these are causing health problems, including cardiovascular disease.  They move from the lungs into the fine blood vessels and they cause blockages in those blood vessels.  They can cause dementia and a range of other illnesses.  The only way to tackle this problem is by removing solid fuel burning as a practice in society, first by tackling the worst fuels.  The Government has a consultation process in place to examine the phasing out of smoky coal, wet wood and sod turf.  We have wholeheartedly endorsed that process, but we believe it needs to be an all-island basis because air pollution is not something particular to the Twenty-six Counties.  If these fuels are available across the Border, towns along the Border will still be exposed.  </p><p> On Healthy Ireland funding, we think the level of funding is ridiculously low.  There is so much that can be done in terms of prevention.  As stated, it must start with address of the commercial and social determinants of health.  We need to get out into the disadvantaged communities where health inequalities are significant and work at that level.  Healthy Ireland has a role to play in that regard.  I will hand over to Ms Walsh now.</p></speech>

We know from the evidence that there are strong links between alcohol and cardiovascular disease.  For example, two alcoholic drinks per day in midlife increases a person's risk of stroke by more than one third and it leads to people suffering stroke, on average, five years sooner.  Every unit of alcohol per week a person drinks increases the risk of artrial fibrillation by approximately 2%.  Alcohol can stress the heart muscles and lead to heart weakness, which makes it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body.  In terms of heart failure, the heart is not pumping blood around the body as well as it used to.  There are many links as well with high blood pressure.  We have always been strong on recognising the harms caused by alcohol in terms of cardiovascular disease and health and the need for that to be recognised in legislation was fed into the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018.  That is important.</p> <p>  We often hear stories that alcohol is good for the heart.  With regard to the increased risk of stroke and heart disease we need it to be front and centre that alcohol increases the risk for cardiovascular disease.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.309" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Irene Gibson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021061600002#K00400"><p>I will start with by giving a little background.  The Senator will have heard about the burden of cardiovascular disease.  Between 30% and 50% of cardiovascular disease occurs in patients with existing disease.  That is why secondary prevention is so important.  When the pandemic hit, 70% of cardiac rehabilitation services in Ireland were significantly affected.  Staff were redeployed and centres were closed.  One of the projects led by Cro&iacute; under the Sl&aacute;intecare integration funding was the development of a virtual cardiac prevention and rehabilitation programme.  In essence, it provided an online web-based programme of care to individuals living with cardiovascular disease.  Many of these patients were waiting in excess of three to 12 months for preventative care.  Some of these problems existed prior to the pandemic.  In Ireland, capacity for cardiac rehabilitation is around 37%.  We need to look at alternative ways of delivering care.</p> <p>  One of the positives of the pandemic is that we can deliver care digitally and it is acceptable to patients.  Over a period of 12 weeks, we offered people an intensive lifestyle and medical risk factor management programme led by a nurse prescriber, supported by a multidisciplinary team of dieticians and physiotherapists under the medical governance of a cardiologist and in collaboration with general practice and community pharmacists.  Under the programme, patients joined us once per week for an online Zoom session, such as we are engaged in today, where they completed a supervised exercise session and participated in an interactive health promotion session.  A key component of that session focused on self-management.  We provided patients with blood pressure monitors to track their blood pressure.  We also gave them Fitbits to track their physical activity levels.  In looking at the lifestyle factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease, we need to also look at engaging with people in a way that goes way beyond education and information giving.  We need to work with people on identifying their goals and priorities for change.  We have been astounded by the outcomes of this programme.  Over a short timeframe, we have seen anxiety and depression levels halve, an 80% improvement in blood pressure control and improvements of 40% to 60% in cholesterol levels.  In terms of our care for cardiovascular patients, we are not meeting the recommended targets and guidelines.  That is a real priority.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions for them.  First, I would welcome their opinions on the cholesterol reducing drinks and foods, such as butter, that are advertised regularly on the market.  Are they worthless or do they have an effect?</p></speech>

We have a number of dieticians working for the foundation.  Our view is that they have a role to play, but we always place the emphasis on a proper, balanced diet.  If somebody has a diagnosed problem with cholesterol, he or she needs to be on a low cholesterol diet.  The products mentioned have a role to play.  We think that it would probably not be a great idea to say that if a person is using these products, he or she can then afford to eat whatever he or she likes.  We do not have a negative view of them, but we think the emphasis should be on a proper, balanced diet.  Ms Gibson may have a view on this as well.</p></speech>

They work for some individuals, but not for everybody.  If we are recommending these products to people, we need to do so with sight of their cholesterol levels and recognising that some products are more efficacious than others.</p></speech>

Almost everybody suffers from hay fever, as I do, and a number of other similar complaints.  What advice would the witnesses offer regarding the multiplicity of so-called cures for these conditions?

What would be the advice of the witnesses on how to avoid such conditions?  Is there anything we can do, or do we just have to go with the flow?  There are appliances readily available on the market that can be installed in a living room or bedroom, which clean the air and eliminate viruses as well.  The witnesses' opinion on those would be helpful.</p></speech>

First, we would go back to basics and say that if someone suffers from asthma, it is not a great idea to have an open fire in the house.  It is not even a great idea to have a wood-burning stove in the house, because every time a stove is opened to refuel it, it emits particulates and they can impact on the health of someone who has asthma.  As we emphasised earlier, it has a much broader health impact as well in terms of cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>  We would say to people to move away from burning fuel in their house indoors.  Over and above that, people with asthma need to make sure that they have a good relationship with their GP and that they are regularly monitored, and their asthma is controlled.  Asthma is not only an inconvenient disease; it can be a fatal one and it is something that needs to be properly monitored and controlled by a GP.</p></speech>

Nobody.  I suggest, with no disrespect to the panel, that perhaps somebody might look at that because it is an issue that affects an awful lot of people, especially in the kind of weather conditions we have had in the past three or four weeks.</p> <p>  Could I ask about the air purifiers to which I referred that are available on the market?</p></speech>

One of the questions I want to ask relates to priorities.  There has been a sea change in funding for healthcare, which has increased substantially in the past two years because of the Covid pandemic.  We now need to prioritise.  We touched on heart disease and other areas earlier.  Could the witnesses set out a list of four or five priority areas where immediate action could be taken to achieve results reasonably fast?  We as a health committee could get the Department to respond to it.  The witnesses covered an extensive range of issues and each of those areas is iimportant, but what are the four or five areas they feel the Department and the HSE could respond to very quickly that would produce a beneficial result?</p></speech>

We agree with Cro&iacute; that the first is a cardiovascular health policy with a significant emphasis on prevention.  The second is that we would like a public health obesity Bill to be introduced and immediate action on junk food marketing, in particular to under-18s.</p> <p>  The third, in terms of low-hanging fruit and the best buy to give us a good impact, is a hypertension awareness campaign.  Hypertension is costing the health service &euro;700 million a year through chronic heart disease, kidney disease and a range of other illnesses.  We think that for tuppence, a small portion of that, we could have a hypertension awareness campaign that would be impactful.  We need to take about 100,000 blood pressures a year for the next five years to reduce by 50% the number of people in the community who are hypertensive but unaware of it.  That is a realistic target and we can do it with a relatively small budget.  They are just three things.</p></speech>

The first point I will make relates to the plan, or the absence of a cardiovascular strategy.  The second is a serious commitment to prevention.  The third point relates to a reference I made earlier to the third age cohort.  It would be cost-effective to initiate early detection and early diagnosis of many conditions that have an enormous impact, hypertension being one of them.</p></speech>

As has been said earlier, we are talking about a 60% increase in strokes in a decade due to lifestyle issues and age.  We have got to future-proof these services but we must also ensure that while saving lives and reducing disability, we put emphasis on recovery as well and we do not squander people's recovery when we can deal with these issues cost-effectively.</p></speech>

We are running out of options as far as solid fuel is concerned.  I was one of the people who changed over my entire heating system to eliminate coal and turf some years ago.  I moved to wood.  Am in now in a position where I have to remove wood as well?  This will affect a lot of people throughout the country who see dry wood as a means of heating their homes.  Many people cannot afford more modern methods.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.335" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021061600002#L01900"><p>We need to remove the worst fuels first.  Dry wood is probably the least polluting fuel, but it still emits particulates and many studies in the UK show that where people have moved away from traditional fuels and are now burning dry wood in stoves  there are significant levels of air pollution, which are causing health issues.  Ultimately, our view is that we need to move away from burning anything in our homes.  The Deputy is correct to point out that fuel poverty is an issue.  There needs to be a transition allowance to retrofit houses.  It is simple to put electric storage heaters into homes.  It is not that expensive to retrofit houses.  Major retrofits cost upwards of &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000, but we can replace a lot of solid-fuel burning devices with electric central heating and other forms of heating, which will reduce the particulate matter to zero.  Unfortunately, the news is that we are all going to have to move away from burning anything.  For the moment, let us move away from the worst fuels.  There is no immediate threat to burning dry wood in the home, but it is a health issue both for internal air and external air quality.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#A00300"><p>Good morning everyone.  I remind members and witnesses to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of this meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment even when on silent mode.  This meeting has been convened to consider the Further Revised Estimate for Vote 42 - Rural and Community Development, which was referred to the committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  As members are participating remotely, I ask them to put their microphones on mute for the duration of the meeting and to indicate, via the raised hand icon, when they wish to contribute.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Joe O'Brien, and their officials to the meeting this morning and thank them for the comprehensive briefing documents that were provided to the committee.  At the outset, and bearing in mind that this meeting is convened to consider the Further Revised Estimate for the Department of Rural and Community Development, it should be noted that the Minister has graciously agreed to address the issue of the procurement of local employment services at the end of the meeting, notwithstanding the fact that this matter is under her remit in her capacity as Minister for Social Protection, a Department which is also under the remit of this committee.  If members are agreed, I propose to set aside 30 minutes at the end of the meeting on the Revised Estimates, at approximately 11 a.m., if not earlier, to discuss this particular issue which has exercised members over the past few months.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I thank the Minister for her co-operation in this regard.</p> <p>  As the Minister is now present, officials should not speak in public session.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also wish to advise everyone that the opening statements and any other documents that have been submitted to the committee may be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  I now invite the Minister to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.344" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#A00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend here today to discuss the 2021 Further Revised Estimate for the Department of Rural and Community Development.  I am seeking approval of this Further Revised Estimate to enable my Department to continue its important work in the areas of rural development, community development and charities regulation.</p><p>As we all know, the last 15 months have been incredibly challenging with Government, society and our communities all working together to address the social and economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Our community development schemes have been an important aspect of the Government's response to the pandemic.  I want to thank the individuals, volunteers and numerous community and voluntary organisations across the country that have helped our nation to respond to the pandemic.  Throughout this period, by working together, we have ensured support for those most in need.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Brien, and I are committed to ensuring that our community development schemes continue to support the recovery of our society and communities. </p><p>The rural development schemes operated by my Department continue to deliver real and tangible projects in local communities right across the country.  Programmes like the town and village renewal scheme, CL&Aacute;R, the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme and LEADER are highly important and are making a real difference.  Those schemes are fantastic examples of small amounts of funding making a huge difference.  Of course, we also have the rural regeneration and development fund for larger-scale projects.  Through the Our Rural Future rural development policy, which the Government launched in March, I am committed to and passionate about ensuring that the recovery from this pandemic is fair and balanced and reaches all parts of our country. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s functions are delivered across three programme areas, namely, rural development including the islands, community development and charities regulation.  Gross expenditure of &euro;351 million is budgeted for in 2021, consisting of &euro;182.4 million in current expenditure and &euro;168.6 million in capital expenditure.  In addition, my Department has a capital carry-over of &euro;13.18 million from 2020 into 2021.  In terms of the split of gross expenditure across programmes, &euro;178 million is allocated for the rural development and the islands programme.  The &euro;13.18 million in capital carry-over is also intended for use in this programme area.  A sum of &euro;169 million is allocated for the community development programme and &euro;4.6 million is provided for the Charities Regulatory Authority, CRA. </p><p>The &euro;178 million allocated to the rural development programme is made up of &euro;151 million in capital funding and &euro;27 million in current funding.  This will support a range of schemes that invest in the economic and social development of rural areas and communities.  For 2021, I have allocated &euro;87 million in capital funding for the rural regeneration and development area.  A sum of &euro;55 million will be provided for the rural regeneration and development fund,<b></b>which has now approved funding of &euro;249 million towards 164 projects worth &euro;338 million. </p><p>Funding of &euro;20 million will be provided for the town and village renewal scheme and this year will see a particular focus on addressing dereliction in towns.  In addition, &euro;5 million of this funding will be used for the connected hubs call that I announced recently.  This will focus on supporting the development of remote working hubs across Ireland and will help realise the potential of remote working for our rural towns and villages.  Funding for the outdoor recreational infrastructure scheme<b></b>will increase from &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million, reflecting the need to provide high-quality outdoor facilities for rural areas that can also support the domestic tourism offering.  For the LEADER programme, I have allocated &euro;44 million in capital funding for 2021, an increase of &euro;4 million on 2020.  As Deputies will be aware, I announced details of the &euro;70 million LEADER transitional programme in April and I am delighted that project approvals are already ramping up under that new programme.  Other important funding for rural development includes &euro;10.5 million for the local improvement scheme, LIS, which is a 5% increase on 2020.  Moreover, funding for the CL&Aacute;R programme will increase by 10% to &euro;5.5 million.</p><p>I am also making &euro;11 million available for the islands in 2021, which includes additional funding of &euro;1 million to support transport services for the islands.  Given that the rural development programme is capital funding-intensive, it is important to note that there will be real challenges in making up the ground lost due to the closure of construction sites until May.  I therefore will keep expenditure plans under constant review and will seek to ensure that the resources provided are put to best use across the schemes in operation.</p><p> Moving to the community development programmes, I acknowledge the work of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, who is present this morning and who is passionate about our communities, both urban and rural.  The &euro;169 million allocation consists of &euro;151 million in current expenditure and &euro;18 million in capital expenditure.  With this funding, the Department administers a range of programmes supporting both individuals and the broad community and voluntary sector.  I propose to increase the allocation for the community services programme from &euro;46.9 million to &euro;48.9 million.  This funding will benefit more than 400 community organisations and 2,000 people across the country and will help to ensure that vital community services are maintained into the future.  I also plan to allocate &euro;45 million to the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, in 2021, an increase of &euro;1 million on 2020.  This will ensure continued support for over 2,220 organisations and 23,000 disadvantaged individuals.  The types of interventions being delivered through this funding will be vital in ensuring that the most vulnerable in our society also benefit from the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p> Other key provisions include &euro;17.5 million for supports for the community and voluntary sector, &euro;4.5 million for the community enhancement programme, &euro;7.7 million for libraries development and &euro;7 million for the cross-border PEACE programme.  There is also a provision of &euro;10 million for further once-off supports for charities, community and voluntary organisations and social enterprises through the Covid-19 stability fund.  In 2020, this scheme benefited approximately 600 organisations and this additional funding is intended to focus on those who may not have benefited from Government support to date.</p><p> I thank the members of the committee for their time and attention this morning.  I was with the committee a few weeks ago to discuss the Revised Estimates for the Department of Social Protection.  The focus today is very much on the Department of Rural and Community Development.  This Department was only established in 2017, but it is a brilliant Department and I am very proud to lead it.  The staff in Dublin, Ballina and around the country are passionate about the work they do and I do not have to tell the Deputies about the good work that happens in the various schemes because they all see it in their own communities.  We have made a great deal of progress and I believe the drive towards remote working has given the rural development agenda a major impetus.  Dare I say it, but coming up with new ideas and new ways of doing things can be a challenge at times when one is in older, more established Departments.  That is not the case in the Department of Rural and Community Development.  The staff want to do their best for communities.  They are open to trying new things and if we need to tweak a scheme to make it work better, we will do that.  In other Departments, such as the Departments of Health and of Social Protection, one could be talking about billions and more billions of euro.  This might be a small Department but it certainly makes a big impact.  I want to maintain that and, hopefully, grow it even further.</p><p> I and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, are happy to answer any questions members have and to hear their ideas on how we can make things better.</p></speech>

I invite members to raise any issues they have with regard to the Estimates on a programme-by-programme basis and I ask them to indicate which programme they are addressing.  The first member who has indicated is Deputy Carey.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1517" speakername="Joe Carey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#B00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and Minister of State to the meeting.  I will speak about the local improvement scheme but I do not know which programme it is under.  On foot of the Minister's remarks about taking suggestions on board for tweaking schemes, this is a vital scheme for rural Ireland.  It provides better connectivity for communities.  During the lifetime of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il, the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development made a proposal that the Department of Rural and Community Development reach out to the Department of Transport and to local authorities to develop a new scheme that would be properly funded.  Three different funding streams would be pulled together.  I acknowledge that &euro;10.5 million is a lot of money but if one breaks it down on a county basis, one sees that County Clare gets &euro;500,000.  As the county has a list of roads that is longer than the length of my arm, it will be years before the issues will be tackled.  I believe we must do more work on this and re-examine the scheme.  We must reach out to the Department of Transport and get it involved in a joint initiative with the Department of Rural and Community Development.  It would also tie in the local authorities and get them to make a contribution as well.  We would therefore have a more substantive programme and much more money.  We would get a great deal more work done.  That is my proposal to the Minister.  I hope she will take it to the Department of Transport and, perhaps, report back to the committee on her progress on that proposal.</p> <p>  I welcome the work that has been done on the connected hubs initiative and I compliment the work of the Western Development Commission in that regard.  The biggest issue in rural Ireland is access to broadband.  While that does not fall under the remit of this committee, there is an acknowledgement from the Government that the broadband scheme has to be accelerated.  Is the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, party to discussions in that regard?  As she said, remote working and access to broadband are transformational.  If the Minister is part of those discussions, where does she see this going?  How will the national broadband scheme be accelerated?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.349" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#B00500"><p>I thank Deputy Carey for raising these issues.  With regard to the local improvement scheme, the Deputy is correct that there is a huge backlog in terms of the lanes that have to be funded and repaired through the local authorities.  I know from my county that there could be a waiting list of ten years, and it is the same across the country.  In 2017, my predecessor, Deputy Ring, reopened the local improvement scheme and it has received funding of just over &euro;68 million since then.  I was keen to try to increase the funding again.  Basically, the LIS is about repairing roads.  The Deputy is absolutely correct that the Department of Transport has a role in this as well.  I have written to my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, regarding the issue of funding and I have been speaking to him about it.  I will certainly raise it with him again.  If the Department of Transport could contribute some funding in this area, it would mean we could try to get some of the long lists dealt with.  Nobody knows better than us and members of this committee the importance of access to farms across the length and breadth of the country.  A lot of transport is needed to collect milk, deliver meal and so forth, so it is important that these roads are in good shape.</p><p>We need that investment.  I will certainly take this from the committee and go back to my colleague, the Minister for Transport, with whom I had very positive discussions.  We must see the money, which is most important.</p><p> I thank the Deputy for raising the question of hubs.  As the committee knows, we are rolling out broadband connection points and we now have 300 sites throughout the country located in some of the most rural communities, including the islands off Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Cork.  The broadband connection points initiative was established to ensure remote areas, particularly those likely to wait longest for broadband connections, would be provided with some access to high-speed broadband while waiting for the national broadband plan roll-out to reach them.</p><p> The national connected hubs network was launched by me on 31 May and we are funding the Western Development Commission to help us with setting up an app.  We currently have a website and we want to produce an app to widen the functionality.  It is for the providers and users of hubs so that spaces can be booked whenever needed on an app.  We want to get providers signed up and 66 hubs are currently fully signed up.  We have a target of 100 to be signed up by the end of 2021.  It is hoped that up to 400 hubs may be engaged over time.  We recently launched the &euro;5 million connected hubs call under the town and village renewal scheme, which will further enhance a remote working offering.  That will bring benefits to people and communities throughout Ireland.</p><p> On the rolling out of the national broadband plan, the Government is absolutely committed to speeding up the process.  It was meant to proceed over seven years and we are hoping to bring that down to five years.  There is no doubt it is a mammoth task.  I said before to this committee that the amount of cable required to connect to premises across this country would go around the globe four times.  Nobody knows this better than the Chairman.  There is no doubt it is a big job.  When Deputy Naughten was involved as the Minister in that space, he and I set up the broadband officers and they have been a vital resource in helping to progress much of this at a local level.  They have identified the broadband connection points.</p><p> There is no doubt we are all working together on this.  Covid-19 has led to some elements falling behind a bit but nevertheless there is a commitment and I and everybody else in the Government wants to see the roll-out of the national broadband plan as quickly as possible.  Having said that, there are many private operators entering the market, which is also helpful.  I thank the Deputy for the questions.</p></speech>

Some of the recent reported delays in the roll-out of the network across the country arise because of delays in engagement with some local authorities.  All of us as public representatives can play a role in helping to expedite those matters.</p></speech>

I see there is a reduction of 15% from 2020 to 2021.  I understand with the pandemic last year there was an increase in special funding arrangements but 2021 has been as difficult for the community sector as was 2020.</p> <p>  I will speak to the community services programme and funding for staff.  There is a bit of concern in that the special funding relating to the pandemic for the community services programme is only guaranteed until June 2021 and many people I have met who are connected to projects are very concerned and want this extended right through the entire year.  They do not foresee any major improvements in funding and although they are already six months in, we are only really coming out of the lockdown.  Many of the projects are still only operating at a minimal level with respect to rooms for rent or hiring of football pitches, etc.  They are only being opened now and there is a real concern about them being able to fund that.</p> <p>  On SICAP, a &euro;1 million increase is too small, particularly if we look back to 2008, which I will raise again, when funding was &euro;80 million.  We are currently at &euro;45 million and at this rate it will be over 40 years before we get back to what was seen as acceptable in 2008.  That must be addressed.</p> <p>  I welcome the pilot community development projects.  This was the standard when I was involved with community development projects many years ago and it should be the standard as we go forward.  I am puzzled as to why we are doing this as a pilot project.  It is the way we should move forward and the community should be involved with local community development projects at a very basic, low level.  It needs to happen right in the heart of the community as we move forward.</p> <p>  I have also looked at the funding for the community enhancement programme, which is very much welcome for the projects or community centres that need it.  Hartstown and Huntstown community centre would take approximately 20% of the entire budget if it got the required funding to enhance that centre.  I make the point again that these community centres were provided by the community or parishes and paid for by the community.  That may have happened 20, 30, 40 or 50 years ago, or even before that, and these organisations have never really sought any major and substantial refurbishment.  They need that now.</p> <p>  These facilities would have had to have been provided by local authorities if the community had not stepped up to the plate as they were not provided by local authorities.  We really need to look at these.  There are dedicated community volunteers and the organisations cannot take on huge loans.  If some of these centres are not funded properly in order to maintain standards, they will close, which would be a massive loss.  The councils will then have to step in and take over these centres, or else they will have to build their own.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Donnelly for the questions on the Estimates.  There was extra support in 2020 of &euro;50 million for the Covid-19 stability fund, which was a once-off payment.  There was also an increase in the July stimulus package of &euro;10 million provided in the Revised Estimate for the islands.</p> <p>  The reality is that there are additions to the funding for programmes, with an extra &euro;4 million for LEADER, an extra &euro;5 million for the town and village scheme and an extra &euro;2 million for the community services programme.  We want to ensure our programmes support recovery.  In 2020 my Department supported close to 600 organisations in continuing to deliver vital services to the most vulnerable through the Covid-19 stability fund for community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprise.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, can deal with the questions on SICAP etc.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#C00500"><p>It is important to say we are processing the additional &euro;10 million for the fresh applications to the stability fund this year.</p><p>Without pre-empting all of the decisions, the initial indications are that those community and voluntary organisations that are in a difficult position will be in a better position after this.  I believe the Deputy's initial question was what about this year, given that these organisations were in a bad position last year.  The application process indicates that we will be able to support a good few of them to a sufficient degree, if I can speak in a broad term.  I believe we will have more details in a few weeks' time when decisions come out.</p><p> In terms of the community services programme, when I came into office last year I realised that it was the first programme that we needed to give attention to.  We did so during the budget last year.  As the Deputy will see, additional money has been provided for the programme.  We also found other funds for it from what was left over last year.  I made a priority out of highlighting the need for these projects.  Earlier this year, we created an additional support fund of &euro;4.5 million.  That can be spent throughout the year.  I hear what has been said about organisations saying that they are running out of funds, and we will take that view away.</p><p> We are approaching the position now where a lot of the organisations can open.  I understand that people are not exactly flocking back to their community centres in large numbers and we are not quite at that stage.  We hope, over the next few months, that there will be some semblance of a return to normality, including in respect of the income that centres can generate but that obviously depends on the public health restrictions, which are going in the right direction.</p><p> I take the point made about SICAP.  It is a multi-annual funding programme.  Obviously there is guaranteed money in the programme period.  We have received a request to extend the current iteration of SICAP another year and we will make a decision next week.  I take the point made about the need for an increase.</p><p> There have been other things, in addition to SICAP, in the whole area of social inclusion and community development that have started since the cuts, which have been mentioned.  A significant proportion of LEADER funding is spent on social inclusion projects, the community enhancement programme has started since and there is additional funding in the area of volunteering.  SICAP is on my radar in terms of a programme that needs to be augmented.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the pilot community development programme.  Part of the logic of that is to make a first step towards filling the gap that was left in terms of what happened to previous community development projects.  It is a pilot scheme because things are starting up again and we want to see how it goes.  The level of interest is extremely encouraging.  As approximately 150 applications have been received, clearly there is a hunger to use this approach across the country and we received multiple applications from every county.  That is a good sign in terms of the scheme's potential for growth.</p><p> On the community enhancement programme, I am sure that members will be aware that we have given supports over time to Huntstown and Hartstown.  Connected to that it is important to say that the community services programme, which they depend on as well, is under review at the moment to try to make it more appropriate for the different types of organisations involved, including the funding model.  There is a wide variety of organisations in the community services programme.  The restructuring review, in which we are in the middle of doing, seeks to tailor it a little bit to the different types of organisations, which includes funding and training.</p><p> A point was made about providing supports for community centres and structures.  We have made a submission on community centres to the national development plan and await news.  A lot could be done on the capital side for community centres and we await a response to our submission.  I believe that I have touched on most of the issues that have been raised.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#D00400"><p>First, on the Our Rural Future policy, can the Minister update us on its work plan for the coming year?  She might give us details on how she thinks it is going to work.  Is she considering a number of the recommendations and actions from the report on a year-by-year basis and, as each one is completed, will she mark it off the list and move on?</p> <p>  My second issue is in respect of remote working, which the Minister referenced a couple of times in her opening statement.  Remote working is really important.  At one stage during the pandemic, as many as 900,000 workers were working remotely which, especially in rural areas, is a huge number of people.  In recent days and weeks, the T&aacute;naiste has made comments about workers returning to their offices.  Has the Minister communicated to him and his Department the importance of keeping as many of these people in their communities so that they do not have to return to an office setting or, if they do, it is on a limited basis weekly?  I ask because we do not want to see many of the thousands of people who had the opportunity to work from home in the last year, particularly in counties like Roscommon, Galway and Mayo, having to resume commuting to Dublin, Cork, Galway or to wherever, to their office jobs.  I am conscious that people should be careful that, when calling for workers to return to their offices, they keep in mind the many thousands of people who have been working remotely in the past year and hope to continue doing so.  We do not want to see any of that undone.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#D00500"><p>I thank Deputy Kerrane and I will first address the issue of remote working.  The T&aacute;naiste is absolutely committed to remote working and is bringing through legislation that will give workers the right to request to work remotely.</p> <p>  Some people will wish to work remotely for a number of days a week while for others, it is about going into their offices for a couple of days, so we must get the blend right.  I am totally committed to remote working, as is the Government.  Remote working will make a huge difference to towns and villages, and will breathe new life into them.  Remote working will increase footfall.  People can use hubs, which I think are the best place in which to work remotely.  We know working from home can be lonely.  I am always concerned that a person's work life impinges on home life and there is no demarcation.  Availing of a remote working hub will mean that one can finish a day's work and then go home.  These hubs need to be close enough to people's homes to allow them to either walk or cycle to them so they must be within a reasonable distance.</p> <p>  As members will know, the policy, Our Rural Future, was launched at the end of March and it is the Government's blueprint for rural development over the next five years.  Implementation will be across Government and it will be ensured by developing the annual work programme, of which I have a copy to hand.  It is an extensive document and has been published on my Department's website.</p> <p>  I am glad to say that since we launched the policy, actions have already taken place.  We have launched the &euro;5 million connected hubs initiative and have approved &euro;81 million for successful projects under the rural regeneration scheme.  We have launched the &euro;70 million LEADER programme, announced a fund of &euro;72.8 million for 340 active travel projects in 19 local authorities and have seen the approval of the joint application by Athlone Institute of Technology, IT, and Limerick for designation as a technological university.  We have had the launch of the final call for applications to the LEADER food initiative, a new action plan for apprenticeships has been published, the 2021 town and village renewal scheme has been launched and a &euro;14 million fund for outdoor adventure activities under the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme has been announced and the Local Link service has been expanded to Dingle..</p><p>There are many new measures.  We have achieved that already and are now working on the other initiatives and actions in the policy.  We will invest significantly in remote working facilities and in developing the network of more than 400 remote working hubs.  We also want to establish the rural youth assembly.  I am just giving the Deputy some of the highlights of what is contained in the policy document, including the development of a pilot scheme to support the use of rural hubs as community spaces and centres for local services, the publication of Ireland's first ever national outdoor recreation strategy and examination of the establishment of a community ownership fund to help communities take over local community assets at risk of being lost.  </p><p> The way this will work is that I will report to the Cabinet on the progress being made and we will be giving a report on a six-monthly basis.  We will then review the document after a year.  This is a living document and if we have to insert new initiatives and measures into it, then that is what we want to do.  We want to ensure that the policy is relevant.  If I had been writing this document three years ago, we would have been putting a focus on remote working, but nowhere near the extent that we are now.  Therefore, as things change, we want this document to remain relevant to rural Ireland.  This Our Rural Future rural development policy commits to developing an effective rural-proofing model to ensure that all Departments fully consider the effects of their decisions on rural communities and how proposals may be adjusted to mitigate any negative impacts in that regard.    </p></speech>

My first two questions were going to address digi-hubs and broadband connection points, but those issues have been relatively well covered now.  We all understand why there has been a slowdown in trying to hit the targets we were aiming at and that it is pandemic-related.  We all want to see that process expedited as much as humanly possible.  Remote working presents great opportunities for all rural communities, but especially so for the islands and in trying to get life back on some of them.</p> <p>  Turning to the town and village renewal scheme and the town centres first initiative, the Minister knows that I think the town centres first approach can be transformative for rural Ireland, and especially if we pursue it in the right ways.  A sum of &euro;20 million has been allocated to the scheme for this year.  We struggled to spend the money allocated last year, however.  Again, we all probably understand why that was the case, but I ask the Minister to comment on that aspect.  Regarding the future of this initiative, is a pathway foreseen that will allow for the money to be spent and spent in the proper ways?  I am talking about skills and whether we are facing a deficit of the required skills, particularly regarding bringing heritage buildings back into use.  I would also very much welcome the Minister's comments concerning trying to tackle vacancy and dereliction in our rural towns.  It is an important issue.  However, many 18th- and 19th-century market town buildings will require very specific skill sets to bring them back into use.  </p> <p>  Turning to the town centres first master plan funding, I strongly believe that if we are planning for a town centres first approach, we must plan from a community basis upwards.  The collaborative town centre health check programme is a great model and I hope it is the one we are going to use.  I also have a question regarding the public participation networks, PPNs, and where the line funding for those is to be found in the Revised Estimates.  I note that it was moved from its own budgetary line into subhead B3, which is the allocation for supports for the community and voluntary sector.  That change had the effect of suggesting that the funding for the community and voluntary sector had been increased, whereas if the PPN element is stripped out I believe there was an overall decrease in funding.  I would like the Minister to comment on that point as well.  </p> <p>  Moving to the Charities Regulator, the number of charities submitting annual reports decreased from 7,321 to 5,910.  The bare figures alone do not give me much information.  Will the Minister help me to understand those figures a bit more regarding what they show as happening in the charity sector?  Is it something this committee should be aware of?</p></speech>

I think the Minister is ready to go.</p></speech>

Like the Deputy, I am committed to the town centres first policy.  I have been talking to my colleagues in government about this initiative and we are having another meeting today to progress this scheme.  Attending will be the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  We can make a huge difference by repurposing old buildings in towns and villages.  Those locations have the required services, water supply and electricity connections in place.  What we must do is to incentivise people to come back and live in the centres of towns.  For many young people, indeed, these buildings could be their first starter homes when they buy properties.  However, the problem we have now is that the cost of renovating such buildings will outweigh the finished value.  We are exploring several options in that regard through the town centres first policy.  I am totally committed to progressing the initiative, because it forms another part of the solution to the need for housing.</p> <p>  Turning to the town and village renewal scheme, it has been very popular since its launch way back in 2016, I believe.  I remember launching the scheme, which had funding of &euro;5 million when it started.  The funding has now increased to &euro;20 million.  Funding of &euro;15.4 million for 170 projects in rural towns and villages was announced in January 2021 and the funding rate for the local authorities increased to 90%.  The scheme launched in May has an indicative budget of &euro;5 million and the closing date for applications is today, so those who may be interested had better get them in.  The scheme focuses on projects which will bring vacant and derelict buildings back into use for town centre living.  We are investing in the centres of towns and by doing so we are making those towns more attractive for other things to happen.  That might mean people moving back to live in them, while the funding will also improve the streetscape and the value of the buildings in the towns.  There has been a good deal of investment and I want that to continue.  Some &euro;5 million of the town and village renewal allocation is for the connected hubs.  That aspect is important because it will provide funding to help with those buildings that do not need major renovation but which could do with some limited adaptation.  It will turn those buildings into remote working spaces.  </p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point regarding the skill sets that may be needed to ensure that the character and design of some of these old buildings are maintained and that their heritage importance is respected whenever we are doing this type of renovation in the town centres.  The Minister of State with responsibility for heritage, Deputy Noonan, has different training programmes in his section in this regard and much good work is also being done with the Heritage Council concerning the skill sets required to do that type of work.  I think I have covered all the questions asked now.  </p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the islands as well, and I will use this opportunity to mention the Clare Island ferry, because questions have been raised about it.  I visited Clare Island as recently as last year, or it might possibly have been the year before that - I am losing track of the years - and I spoke with many of the islanders.  I know the challenge they are facing.  I have much time for islanders and I will be happy to meet a delegation from the island.  Regarding the current tender process, about which some people are concerned, the date for receipt for all tenders for the ferry service has now passed.  The deadline for documentation to be received via e-tenders was 8 June.</p><p>Deputies will appreciate that I cannot comment on the specific details of tenders for a live procurement process but I want to be absolutely clear that there can be no reduction in the current level of service being provided to Clare Island.  I expect we will have an outcome to the tender process imminently and I ask members of the committee to await the outcome of that process and reserve judgment until we see what the level of service will be.  I assure the committee and the islanders that if the level of service were to be less than what is currently on offer in terms of minimum sailings following the tender process, I would be prepared to look at re-tendering for the service.  My priority is to make sure the local people on Clare Island have a decent service available to them.  I know that some members may have been getting representations about this issue and I wanted to take the opportunity to outline the position.  I thank the Chairman for his indulgence.</p></speech>

With the consent of the committee, we will circulate it to the community on the island.  The issue relates to the number of operations to and from the islands.  The islanders believe that has not been given adequate weighting in the tender structure.  There are presently five services a day during the summer and three services during the winter.  Is the Minister saying that will be the minimum standard that will be achieved or is the minimum the two services a day referred to in the contract?  That is the key aspect.  I ask the Minister, in the context of the deliberation on the tender, to take that into account.  I thank her for the offer to meet a deputation from the island and we will communicate that to the islanders.</p> <p>  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, to answer some of the outstanding questions from Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh.</p></speech>

I reassure the Deputy that funding for PPNs has remained the same.  The change to the subhead just allows a little more flexibility for community and voluntary sector supports.  This is an opportunity to highlight some of the supports we are providing to PPNs.  A new handbook for PPNs was published last year, which was the first refresh of it since their establishment.  There has been much learning during the initial years of the PPN process and that is reflected in the new handbook.  The roll-out of online training courses for PPN stakeholders started in October last year.  That will roll on through this year and probably into next year.  We also support a database to assist PPNs in their work and their ability to communicate with their member groups.  A structural review of PPNs has commenced.  We hope that will be completed by the end of the year.</p> <p>  The Deputy has caught me on the hop a little with the figures he quoted about submissions to the Charities Regulator.  Can he call the figures out again?  I did not catch them as he called them out.  It is important to say at the outset that the Charities Regulatory Authority is independent of the Department.  I met the board a few months ago but these figures were probably not available at that stage so they did not come to light.  I will confirm this later but my suspicion is that if reporting to the Charities Regulator was down last year, it could be to do with some flexibility it provided to community and voluntary organisations during the pandemic to give them a little more time to comply with the requirements.  That is my suspicion but I do not know if that is the case.  I would appreciate it if the Deputy could call out the figures again.</p></speech>

I will not go into that.  Due to IT issues this morning and yesterday, I was unable to print out the Minister's opening statement so I am at a slight disadvantage.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a number of issues.  I caught the tail end of what the Minister said about the boat to Clare Island.  I accept she cannot talk about those who have tendered but, of course, what is in the referral for tender is publicly known and on the public record.  The Minister can obviously refer to that.  She can certainly refer to what is there at present.  Can she confirm that the contracted service at present is for two sailings a day every day?  Can she confirm that other services are being provided that are not contracted and not at the islander rate?  In other words, there is no obligation on the ferry service to provide fares at the islander rate.</p> <p>  There are always extra sailings in the summer because it is convenient for tourists, who are important to the island.  However, the islanders are concerned about their day-to-day living for the rest of the year.  They want the base level of two sailings a day to be increased.  Their argument is cogent.  Clare Island is what I call a medium-range island in terms of its distance from the mainland.  Some islands have very frequent services but the Minister would be able to argue that the boat to such an island only takes ten minutes to travel each way.  A boat to other islands could take an hour and a half to get out and another hour and a half to get in.  Clare Island is what I call a medium-range island.  In fact, it is in the lower range.  I am told it takes 20 minutes to travel to the island, unlike its neighbouring island, Inisturk.  The islanders make the cogent case that there should be four sailings a day every day because it would facilitate people going to work, children going to school on the mainland and so on.  There is no secondary school on the island, unlike the Aran Islands, Tory Island and Arranmore.  Sustainability of the islands is at a crucial point.  Can they hold their young populations?  Asking children to leave home semi-permanently at 13 years of age is not great.  If a more frequent service for September to spring is not contracted, is the Minister saying to us she will look at withdrawing the tender, starting again and reconfiguring it?  I am disappointed it went to tender without a prior agreement among the islanders.  There was obviously serious discontent on the island.</p> <p>  My next question relates to piers.  When will the pier for Inis O&iacute;rr go to tender?  Will the Minister ensure that full delegations of islanders on Inis Me&aacute;in get to see the model?  It is no good telling the islanders that one person can do down on his or her own.  I know there are restrictions because of Covid but small groups can be allowed in.  It is important that everybody is happy with the design for whatever is being proposed for Inis Me&aacute;in and, therefore, it is important they see the wave model in Cork.  </p> <p>  Will the Minister expedite the development of proposals for a safe pier in or around Roonagh?  The problem of winter berthing for Clare Island and Inisturk is ongoing.  It will take a serious investment but we need to start down the road, otherwise services in the winter are totally variable. </p> <p>  My next question relates to community services programmes.  There are many community centres in this country.  Many tourism projects cannot operate to their full extent because without a community services programme, they are not viable.</p><p>They need some input from the social economy, but they provide huge services to the community.  All of these very expensive community centres which we are investing in should be open from 8 a.m. or 9 a.m. for gyms and so on right through the day to 10 p.m. or 11 p.m.  To do that staff are needed.  The community services programme is great.  It diverts people who would otherwise be unemployed and gives them gainful employment by providing essential services. </p><p> The next question I have is about CL&Aacute;R.  When it was set up it was a comprehensive leverage funding programme.  There is always an argument that if a health centre, water or sewerage services or roads are required in depopulated rural areas a cost-benefit analysis is necessary.  An agency would state glibly that depopulated areas have to wait at the end of a queue because a cost-benefit analysis was not positive.  CL&Aacute;R used to put up half the money or a different proportion.  Suddenly the cost benefit became very attractive in terms of providing services.  The same happened on the islands in terms of health services and so on.  Suddenly projects jumped up the queue quite legitimately.  Projects that had been waiting for funding for years and years in areas that would probably never get top of the queue received funding.  Is the Minister considering reconstituting CL&Aacute;R as a comprehensive leveraged programme aimed at levelling the playing pitch in terms of basic infrastructure for the least populated parts of the country?</p><p> My final question relates to local employment services, LESs.  I do not know if this issue arose before.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#G00700"><p>I thank the Chairman and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I will pass the community services programme, CSP, question to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien.  In the meantime I will try to answer other questions the Deputy has raised with me.</p> <p>  He mentioned CL&Aacute;R.  As he and I know, it is a great source of funding to help local communities in depopulated areas.  Since it was relaunched in 2016 after being closed for a good while, it has approved funding of almost &euro;39 million for over 1,600 projects throughout rural Ireland.  I take on board the Deputy's points about how it could be used as leverage for other funding streams and to put plans in place for other things. </p> <p>  This year I created a new measure to support communities to develop and test new project ideas and encourage them to think outside the box.  The current measures include support for schools and outdoor community recreation facilities, which do fantastic work.  We all know the projects in our locality that have benefitted.  The community well-being measure involves community gardens and allotments, which a lot more people are showing an interest in since lockdown.  Mobility and cancer care transport are also available.  Another measure involves thinking outside the box and it is for communities to come up with good ideas.</p> <p>  On Clare Island, I want to be clear that my expectation is that the outcome of this tender competition will satisfy the needs of the islanders.  Clare Island, above all islands, is one I am familiar with.  I spent a few days on it two years ago when attending a wedding.  I got a good chance to chat with the local islanders.  I was not the Minister with responsibility for the islands at that time, but I listened to them.  I fully understand their concerns and challenges they face living on an island.  We think we face a lot of challenges living in remote parts of rural Ireland, but it is not half as many challenges as they face living on islands. </p> <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on this particular procurement process because it is live.  I will be very clear that if for any reason it does not meet the required number of sailings per day I will review it and, if necessary, put it out to tender again.  We will have to wait until the process finishes.  I am happy to meet islanders.  In fact, I would love to get over to see them rather than them having to travel all the way to see me.  We will see how that goes.  There are other ways we can meet now through Zoom etc.  I am very conscious of that and I want to find a satisfactory resolution for them.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point on Inis Me&aacute;in.  It is important that communities are involved.  Galway County Council is working to progress this project.  It is working with the National Maritime College of Ireland, NMCI, to develop a model simulation of the sea conditions in the harbour which will inform the eventual business case for the development.  Work has been delayed due to Covid-19 and limited access to the NMCI facility, but the local authority is now working to finalise a date to progress this aspect of the project.</p> <p>  On Inis O&iacute;rr, I am familiar with the business plan.  The Deputy is more than familiar with it.  It was approved in April and the local authority is now moving to tender stage.  There are four major projects I have identified in the national development plan, Project Ireland 2040, namely, Inis O&iacute;rr, Inis Me&aacute;in, the pier going out to Tory Island and the Tory boat.  They are all live issues.  I am happy to work with the Deputies and communities involved to resolve that.  I think I have covered all of those issues.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that it needs work.  I announced funding of &euro;139,000 for refurbishment work for Roonagh as part of the capital works scheme funded through the islands unit in partnership with Mayo County Council.  Large-scale redevelopment of the pier is a matter for the local authority in the first instance.  If the local authority develops a business case for further works or development at the pier, my Department will be happy to engage with it and consider same in the context of the available budgets.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point.  We have given some funding.  It is about putting a case together.  Local authorities have to step up to the plate in these instances.  I will pass over to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, who will speak about the community services programme.</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>

There are also new community centres, as well as older community centres that do not have the backup of this scheme that they need to make them viable.  They are leaders within communities in terms of enticing people in.  Dunbrody comes to mind, as does Athenry Castle.  Such schemes are dotted all over the country.  The same applies to community centres.  A lot of urban community centres do not provide a full range of facilities because they do not have the staff.  There are people in receipt of welfare who would give their eye teeth to have a decent job in a community services programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#G01200"><p>I take the point.  There is potential this year for a lot of tourism-based projects to get a boost with people holidaying at home.  We perhaps have a responsibility to push them out and encourage people to visit tourism-based community services programmes.  The few services I am aware of tend to be hubs for various types of activity, but there is always scope for broadening what they do.</p><p>They tend to be crucial to the local communities nearby.  We are restructuring the programme also, which can be taken into the mix in that process as well.</p></speech>

Will the Minister please comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#H00400"><p>I do not know where that came out of.  Certainly, as far as I am concerned, working from home can often increase productivity, not reduce it.  I could not see any reason people would have reduced wages because they work from home.  Sometimes working from home is a better solution for people and productivity is much better.  The person is not spending hours commuting and he or she is better able to face the day's work when there is not the long drive ahead in the morning or in the evening.  A better quality of life and well-being can be much more conducive to improved output.  I would not agree with that in any shape or form.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#H00500"><p>I will stay on an issue related to remote working, which comes back to the Minister's comment earlier in the committee meeting that if the report on rural development had been produced three years ago, it would have a very different focus on remote working.  There is absolutely no doubt about that.  Both of us will know from our engagement in previous roles the absolute determination of some people to oppose outright the issue of remote working, especially within the public service.  That mindset is still there today.  I have one point and a question to put to the Minister on that.  The Government and State bodies need to lead from the front with regard to setting an example on remote working.  Will the Minister give us an idea on the progress to date on the target by year end of 20% of public service workers working remotely?  The Minister may not have those figures to hand but perhaps she will come back to give us an indication, including an indication across the Minister's three Departments on the staff who are now permanently working either in remote hubs or from home.</p> <p>  There have been a lot of negative aspects to Covid-19 but one positive aspect is that it has shown many of the naysayers out there the huge opportunities around remote working.  This is not just about quality of life and rejuvenating rural communities, it is also about our carbon footprint and reducing our overall domestic emissions.  There is a huge opportunity there also.  It is important that we do not lose what we have gained in this aspect.  I am very concerned about this and I have articulated this to the Minister for Finance on a number of occasions.  I believe there is a mindset and an attitude within some of the decision makers in government to try to get everyone back again into city centre working.  The concept behind this is not so much to protect the other ancillary businesses in the cities - we can look at other innovations in that area - but to protect the investment funds and the insurance funds that have office accommodation leased out on a long-term basis in our cities.  It is fundamentally wrong that we will sacrifice the rejuvenation of rural communities and sacrifice the reduction in our overall carbon emissions purely to satisfy some of these investment funds that have bought large office complexes in our cities.</p> <p>  My second brief question for the Minister is on a different topic.  Again, if the Minister does not have the figures to hand, perhaps her officials may have them.  If not, the Minister might come back to the committee.  What percentage of the transition LEADER programme funding is funded from the Exchequer?  Does it meet with the requirement of the co-funding ratio that has been set down under the rural development programme?  Before the Minister answers, there is also a brief supplementary question from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, which we will take as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#H00600"><p>Again, I am operating without having seen the script.  There is a lot of talk about remote hubs but I do not know if the Minister outlined clearly in her opening statement details of the funding.  If a person is trying to set up a remote hub in a town, a village or a rural area, what funding streams are available for fit out and so on for getting the remote hub?  Does this cover leased buildings as well as owned buildings?  In other words, does funding cover a case where a community leases a building from a private owner?  If the Minister does not have the information to hand, perhaps she will make the information available to the committee.  It would be very useful for all the committee members to get this information.  When the bigger things are announced, we always get a few phone calls from very savvy people who say "How does this work, where do I apply, where do I get the form, how do I fill it up, who do I sent it to, and what are the small-print conditions?"  This is what we need.  Maybe the Minister could arrange to get that information for the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#H00700"><p>Perhaps the Minister will come back on that series of questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#H00800"><p>I will try my best and if I miss any, come back to me.  I thank members for those questions.  Of course, as rural Deputies we are all passionate about remote working.  It is the game changer for which rural Ireland has waited for a long time.  I do not want to let it slip away.  Above all things, I want to see it supported, I want to see it working, and I want to see people enjoying a better quality of life in their local communities.  For too long, we have educated young people and Dublin was only place they could get a job.  Now that is changing.  They can get a job in their own community and they can be part of that community.  This will revitalise the towns, villages, communities and parishes throughout the country.</p> <p>  On the fund to help remote working hubs, we have been doing a lot of work with local authorities through the rural regeneration development fund and the town and village renewal scheme.  They identify the buildings, we help and support them in renovating them and in converting them into remote working hubs and multipurpose use buildings, which adds another level of vibrancy to these premises.</p> <p>  The &euro;5 million fund is part of the town and village renewal scheme specifically targeted at providing support to kit out remote working hubs.  I was very clear that this would apply to public sector hubs and to private sector-owned hubs because we want them in the market too.  A good number of them are being developed in different towns and villages.  They see this as an opportunity.  That fund is there now.  It is currently open.  I would encourage anybody who has a remote working hub that needs some adaptations to put an application into that fund.</p> <p>  The Chairman spoke of making sure there are no barriers to remote working and he is absolutely right.  I have been doing a good bit of work with Grow Remote.  Perhaps some of the members will be familiar with Ms Tracy Keogh.  Tracy started Remote Grow and it is now a social enterprise that we support.  It is about helping employers to understand the benefits of remote working.  It is helping them to make the move.  Some employers are, obviously, concerned that it may have unintended consequences for them.  We must help them to understand the benefits, to bridge that gap between them and their employees, and to give them the chance to try it and work it out.</p><p>It is a win-win for everybody.  There are some jobs where remote work is not possible, which must be acknowledged.  There are many ways in which it can be facilitated.  When I speak about remote working, it is about giving people choice rather than telling them they must work here or there.  It is about allowing people choice with a hub network.  I can perhaps see a time where people on their holidays might need to spend a few days at work.  They could look up on the app where to get a space to work for a morning or afternoon before continuing their trip around the Wild Atlantic Way.  That is what we might call blended work or a blended lifestyle.  I do not want to get the saying backwards but it is about working to live, as opposed to living to work.  It is important and Covid-19 has taught us a lesson in that regard.</p><p> There is a 20% target for remote working in the public service as a minimum.  There is much work ongoing in that respect.  I want to continue to ensure this can happen.  In my Department of Rural and Community Development, we are talking about 98% of people continuing to work remotely and they do so very successfully.  There may be times when people need to come into the office for a day or two but it will be a blend.  The Department of Social Protection is very much a customer-facing Department with 6,500 staff and 50% of them continue to work remotely.  We have managed to roll out an unbelievable amount of services and payments over the past year and a half.  Credit is due to them.  I cannot give figures for the Department of Justice but I know from being in the building that much remote working is taking place there as well.  It is something we want to continue by keeping that momentum.  We do not want it lost.</p><p> I take the Deputy's point about concerns about the city centre but I am not prepared to see the communities, towns and villages across the country being sacrificed for any one part of the country.  This is about balanced regional development, which is what we want.  There is no reason we cannot look at centre of city living as well.  There are opportunities there too, and we all saw what happened with the lockdown.  The offices emptied and the city centres were hollowed out.  People bring vitality to city centres the same as they do with town centres.  It is something we should consider.</p><p> I should reply on the LEADER question.  The distribution of &euro;65 million of the &euro;70 million transition programme to the local action groups, LAGs, was announced in April.  Of the remaining &euro;5 million, &euro;3 million is being allocated to support co-operation projects and &euro;2 million has been set aside to support strategy development for the next LEADER programme.  There is &euro;20 million from the EU recovery investment, at 100%, and the &euro;50 million is 68% EU-funded, I believe.  I will confirm that.  The rate of aid for private enterprise has been increased from 50% to 75%.  I hope I have answered all the questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#J00800"><p>We now proceed to an engagement with the Minister on the matter of procurement for local employment services, a matter that has very much exercised the members of this committee over the past number of months.  I ask members to be concise in their questioning and bear in mind that this questioning must conclude by 11.30 a.m.  Before bringing in members, I say to the Minister that the regional employment service is set to replace the existing jobs clubs and local employment services.  These have been assisting communities across the country for the past 25 years both in urban and rural areas.</p> <p>  Research commissioned by the Minister's Department that was carried out independently by Indecon indicates attendance at local employment services have been beneficial to those who have used the services.  The concern is we are going to deny people access to a walk-in, person-centred and community-based employment service, to be replaced with a profit-driven, results-based process that will happen on referral only.  Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann have consistently criticised this model since it was first introduced nearly a decade ago.</p> <p>  We will now take questions from members before I ask the Minister to respond.  The first member who has indicated is Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh and he will be followed by Deputy Paul Donnelly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.401" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1617" speakername="Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#J00900"><p>I will be brief as other members of the committee have more knowledge of the granular details of the matter.  I will defer to their greater experience in that regard.  I say to the Minister that I am worried.  This committee has received an article of correspondence from Maynooth University entitled, Winners and Losers?: the social marketisation of civil society.  It is an extremely good document that addresses many of my concerns.</p> <p>  I accept the rationale presented by the Minister that this had to be introduced in this manner because of competition law but I am very worried that we are moving away from a model that is person-focused to one where a person is reduced to a unit and we may be looking at attempts to increase throughputs of units through the service.  It is a real worry that there will be a change of focus.  Will we begin to look at a jobs service focused on getting people into any job rather than getting them into the right job?  Perhaps we will not even be worried about the job at the end but the other aspects of the process.</p> <p>  It may be somewhat tangential but I noticed Denmark managed to get around procurement problems because it has an well-empowered local government system.  It is widely acknowledged we are much too centralised in our Government model.  Would it not be fantastic for the likes of Waterford's council to be much more hands-on in procuring this kind of service?  I will defer to other members now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1476" speakername="Paul Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#J01000"><p>I concur with the comments of Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh.  I was also sent the document from Maynooth.  Has the Minister read it?  If she had, she would be much more concerned about moving forward with the policy that is currently proposed.  As others wish to contribute and time is very short, I will ask some questions.</p> <p>  Has there been any consultation with the local employment service, LES, providers prior to the roll-out of the proposed regional employment service model?  Has the Department carried out an analysis of the impact that the proposed model will have on existing local employment services?  If such analysis has been carried out, is the Minister willing to share that with the committee?  Models of commissioning have been outlined to us by a number of community projects and local employment services.</p><p>They outlined that the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, and Tusla have built-in performance targets and penalties for underperformance.  They protect the taxpayer's investment.  That is particularly true of SICAP, which was developed by the Minister's own Department and is based on contracts that guarantee performance but respect the financial structure of community-based charities.  Why has this model, which serves the funder and service users so well, been ignored in this request for tender, RFT?</p><p> Can the Minister confirm that the proposed regional employment service, RES, will be a referral-only service and not a walk-in service similar to the LES?  What is the rationale for that proposal?  A lot of people will be left out of this service, like lone parents, carers, people with disabilities and others who will not be able to access it because they prefer walk-in services.  Other people wish to ask questions so I will leave it at that.  There is massive concern in the community about this and there is a huge fear that we are moving a lot of our services to a for-profit model.  That fear is now being realised.  This is absolutely unacceptable.</p></speech>

Can the Minister confirm that the regional employment service being proposed will be done by referrals from the Department only?  If that is the case, how does the Department propose to provide employment services to cohorts like lone parents, people with disabilities and others who are not in receipt of jobseeker's payments?  How are they to be provided with that employment service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#K00300"><p>Some LES staff said to me that they were worried about the tender but that this is worse than they had feared.  This is a big mistake.  This proposal would erode the community ethos and the not-for-profit model so well fostered by the likes of the LES and job clubs for so many years.  I am disappointed about how this has been put forward.  The LES and job clubs were led to believe that they would be pleasantly surprised and now they may not even be in a position to tender for what has been put forward, if they would even want to, given what has been put forward for a payment by results model.  Can the Minster outline what this tender means for job clubs specifically?  There has been a lot of emphasis on the LES but what will this mean for job clubs, both those included in this first tender for those seven areas and those not included, in the new year?  I also ask the Minister for details on the second phase of this tender.  When is that planned and are things going along on time?</p> <p>  The walk-in issue is hugely concerning given that those furthest away from the job and labour market will not have the access to services they have had up until now.</p> <p>  What are the differences between the model being proposed in this tender and JobPath?  I ask the Minister to please look at the results from JobPath.  Nearly &euro;300 million was spent and over 280,000 people were referred, some of them two, three or four times.  That is now ended, which is welcome.  Around 7.9% of those people found jobs that have been sustained for over a year.  That is not a success.  I ask the Minister to look at that.</p> <p>  For an awful lot of people, the wraparound services and supports provided in LESs and job clubs will not be available in what is being proposed here.  That is also a huge loss.  For some people it is not just about any job.  It is about training, education and other supports they may need, which they will need now more than ever as we emerge from Covid-19.  I would appreciate if the Minister could come back to me on those questions.  There has been a real lack of engagement on this matter.  I met with the job club in Ballaghaderreen last week.  It has not been communicated with and the people involved do not know what is happening.  That is a mistake and must be corrected.  People need to know.  Some of them have been running these services for 25 years.  They have given it everything and have been treated poorly in all of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.406" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#K00400"><p>Many of the questions I was going to ask have been asked.  I will not repeat them but I endorse all the points made by my colleagues.  There are two types of model here: one in which the focus is on getting number results to satisfy the Department and get paid; and one based on service.  We need the latter.  There is a cold chill going down a lot of people's backs with the fear that when the SICAP comes up for retendering a similar results-based approach will be taken.  My experience of the JobPath programme over the last number of years has not been good.  I am not blaming the providers because they just bake the cake according to the recipe.  JobPath encouraged throughput, numbers and "results" but the problem with that is that people in such a system do not have the time to reach out to those who most need help.  Instead, they reach out to the people who are going to give them the best results.  That is inevitable in systems that become results driven.  As I said, there is a big concern that this is the model being adopted by the State for the community and voluntary sector.  It is not the one we were used to, that gives the best results, is most community friendly and reaches those who are hardest to reach in society.  At the end of the day, reaching those people takes a lot of time but what is the point in helping people who probably would have sorted themselves out anyway at the exclusion of those who really need assistance?  That is the nub of this issue.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to encompass responses to the questions that have been raised in her contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#K00600"><p>I thank members for their contributions.  When I started this process I had the same concerns as they do but, having put a huge amount of work into this and having consulted extensively with the providers, I am satisfied that this request for tender will meet the needs of the one person I am most concerned about in all of this, namely, the person who is unemployed and looking for a job.</p> <p>  I will try to answer some of the questions that have been raised.  I accept that they are valid questions because I asked the exact same ones of my officials when we started this process.  There has never been more consultation with the local employment services than there is now.  For people to say they were not consulted is absolute nonsense.  My Department has undertaken extensive consultations with the existing contract providers over the last number of years.  This is about expanding the services.  There are a number of areas in this country that do not have an employment service and I want to expand that service.  That is why this has gone out for tender.  We will learn from this tender process because at the end of the day it is about making sure unemployed people get all the supports they need to help them get a job.</p> <p>  In 2018, my predecessor attended the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, annual meeting and informed all the CEOs of the partnership companies that the current contractual approach was not in accordance with EU and national procurement rules and that the Department would be working to introduce reforms, including open competition for the existing contracts, in order to meet our legal obligations.  Officials from the Department engaged in a detailed question and answer session with the CEOs following the Minister's speech.  In January 2019, the Department published the Indecon report and hosted a briefing session with all LESs and job club providers at which Indecon presented its findings and the Department outlined that it was now moving to implement those recommendations.  They included the need to amalgamate LESs and job club services and award contracts through open procurement.</p><p>Officials from my Department in late 2019 visited all LES and job club providers to inform them of the Department's intention to procure contracts on a competitive basis and seek their input and views on the possible design of the RFT and contracts.  The Department appointed consultants in 2019 to review the public employment service, including the contractors.  As part of this review process, the Department insisted that the consultants engaged without the presence of the Department with nominees from the local employment service and job club providers.  A series of workshops were organised as part of this process. </p><p> Officials in my Department have briefed representatives of the ILDN on the plans for future procurement since 2019 and these briefings have continued on a regular basis throughout 2020 and 2021.  In my role as Minister in the two Departments, I host a regular forum with ILDN member companies and we have provided updates on the Department's plan at previous forums.  My Department continued to engage with the ILDN to the fullest extent possible prior to the publication of the RFT rules.  On 3 June, I hosted an information session on the phase 1 procurement process for the interested parties.</p><p> I want to be very clear.  We have consulted extensively with local employment service providers.  I know that in some places, they provide an absolutely excellent service.  Reference was made to the Indecon review.  It found that LES had, on average, a job placement rate of 28.8% when the annual target was 30%.  Some would say that is not bad, and it is not.  </p><p> However, I would like to point out something else.  When one breaks down the figures a bit further, this average covers a significant range in placement rates from 14% to 45%.  Some providers provide a great service and others do not do as well.  I want everybody to provide a good service.  That is why in this contract there is a minimum price.  That is to ensure that people get the service they deserve.  That is important.</p><p> I want to be clear that the total focus is on the user.  My Department wants to procure high-quality employment services which focus on supporting individual jobseekers and other cohorts who are furthest from the labour market.  This will be a tailored intensive employment service designed to address the needs of the people who are supported by the service.  Bids will be evaluated on the basis of quality and an organisation's ability to access a wide range of supports and services to best meet the needs of their clients. </p><p> I do not want to say too much about the procurement process but I can state clearly that local employment services have a lot of contact with many different organisations.  On that basis alone, an organisation's ability to access a wide range of services will be evaluated as part of the process.  There is a limited cost element in the RFT, but it is within defined parameters. </p><p> The vast majority of the awarding criteria will be determined by the quality of the service, design and key personnel, as well as links with relevant local partners and stakeholders.  There is a strong focus in this request for tender process for local services from local providers.  This is about expanding the delivery of high-quality employment services across seven counties.  The new service will have a strong local focus and its fee structure will be heavily weighted towards client engagement and progression.  That is the one thing we all want to achieve.  We will all agree that it is the client that is the number one person in all of this.</p><p> My Department will learn lessons from the phase 1 procurement process and apply them in the design of the multiple requests for tenders that we will publish later this year under phase 2.  I cannot stress how much effort and time we have put into working with providers.  This is not a for-profit driven agenda by any manner or means.  This is a service for the people who need assistance to get them to help them get back into the workplace.  Now more than ever, we need that because of the challenges Covid has presented to us.</p><p> Walk-ins were mentioned.  The public employment services Intreo offices offer all individuals who require advice access to employment services.  Under the request for tender for the new service, my Department will be able to refer long-term jobseekers, as well as other cohorts to the new service.  All referrals will be organised by my Department's Intreo offices.  They will determine the best employment service based on an individual's specific circumstances and requirements.  In many cases, supports for individuals will be delivered through my Department's Intreo offices or will be referred to the new regional employment service. </p><p> If an individual is not in receipt of a social welfare payment he or she should contact the local Intreo office, which will offer him or her the supports and advice they want.  It is important to say that this focus is again on the person looking for employment.</p><p> The JobPath model was mentioned.  It is not the case that this is replicating the JobPath model in terms of procurement.  I want to be clear that the request for tender for regional employment services is carefully designed to ensure that all sectors can bid for the contract and the fee structure reflects the intensive engagement required to support those furthest from the labour market.  This is very much focused on the needs of the person.  It is about how he or she can be assisted and helped to the maximum extent possible to help him or her get ready to enter into a job.</p><p> The JobPath payment structure is almost an inverse of the payment structure within the request for tender.  JobPath has a nominal fee associated with the engagement with the customer.  After that, any further payment to the contractor is associated with sustained employment.  This means that where the customer does not enter into employment, the JobPath provider only receives the registration fee but must provide 12 months of employment services to the jobseeker. </p><p> The opposite is the case with regional employment services where the majority of payments, an indicative average of 90% of total fees, are associated with engagement, the service and individual progression.  Under this model, 90% of the fee goes to the provider of the service in order that it can put all of the resources necessary into getting a person a job.  A provider will get the last remaining 10% of total fees when the person secures a job.  I want to be clear that 90% of the fee, which involves a minimum price, will go towards working with a person and giving him or her all of the support he or she will need to get him or her achieve employment.</p><p> I do not know if I have answered all of the questions, but I hope I have given the committee a flavour of what we are trying to achieve.  It certainly is not to short-change anybody.  It is about working and making sure people who need that service get it.</p></speech>

Could she outline specifically what the request for tender means for current job clubs?  While there is a lot of focus on the LES, I refer to job clubs.  Is the Minister able to tell us whether there will be a referral fee built into the aforementioned 90% of fees?  I ask her to confirm that the model is shifting to payment by results.</p><p>To be clear as well on the level of consultation, which I acknowledge, my point was that I believe the LES thought there would have been a pleasant surprise with this tender in respect of job clubs, but that has not been the case.  From my engagement and meetings with several job clubs and local employment services, there is a feeling that they were consulted with but not listened to, from the looks of this tender.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#M00400"><p>Before the Minister responds, I have been contacted by representatives of the jobs club in Ballaghaderreen.  Job clubs around the country are very concerned about this tender process.  The core of this issue is that we must help people to not just get a job but to get a long-term, sustainable job.  There is a fear that all we are going to see is a certain amount of churning, instead of securing long-term sustainable employment.  The Minister comes from a rural part of the country, like myself, and she knows that the range or availability of jobs in those parts of the country is not the same as the opportunities in urban areas.  Sustainability is not the same in rural areas as in urban areas.</p> <p>  We all agree that this scheme needs to go to a tender process, but the key element is how this process is structured.  Established models exist, like the SICAP model, that have performance targets and built-in penalties for underperformance.  It is imperative that such aspects are included in a process but that the focus will be on securing long-term, sustainable employment for the people availing of these schemes.  No one is prepared or willing to defend a situation in respect of successful employment outcomes, as the Minister referred to in her contribution, ranging from 14% to 45%.  We want to see all the groups around the country providing these services achieving that rate of 45% and, hopefully, going even higher than that level in providing long-term, sustainable employment.  All members of this committee feel that is the approach which must be taken in this regard and that is the outcome we achieved.  </p> <p>  I will let the Minister wrap up now on this area, because we are coming close to the time limit for this meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021061600002#M00500"><p>I thank the Chair for his contribution and I also thank the Deputies for outlining their issues.  I do understand those issues, by the way.  My officials will attest that the questions the Deputies have asked me were the same questions as I asked my officials.  I want to be clear that this initiative is not about profit but about the service we provide to those people who need assistance in upskilling, guidance or whatever advice they may need to get them into sustainable and good-quality jobs.</p> <p>  Turning to job clubs, the amalgamation of the local employment service and job clubs into one service was a key recommendation of the Indecon reports on the local employment services and jobs clubs.  It was recognised that there was close interaction and complementarity between the services and that amalgamation would reduce administrative duplication and support a more effective and efficient overall employment support service.  The request for tender is designed to ensure that all competent service providers of appropriate scale can bid competitively.  For some independent job clubs, there will be a challenge in bidding for much larger contracts in respect of services, scale and geographic coverage.  </p> <p>  My officials have visited all existing providers and have encouraged them to work collaboratively, and that is the important word here.  There must be collaboration with other service providers in their sector and areas.  Therefore, the request for tender encourages providers to explore the possibility of collaborating with other similar bodies to submit a joint tender.  Under this request for tender, tenderers working together and submitting a joint bid may satisfy the minimum turnover criteria in the RFT as a whole.  Again, therefore, there is an advantage to working together and there is also an advantage to the service when people work together and more collaboratively.</p> <p>  Regarding the request for tender, 90% of the funding is in respect of securing the service and the individual agreeing to the personal programme.  The individuals concerned get 90% of their payments then and the remaining 10% when they secure employment.  Turning to the job club in Ballaghaderreen, representatives from that club came to Dublin and attended the consultation with the consultants.  We have certainly taken on board their views.  I have to say that some people do not want to change, and I can understand that there is a reluctance to change.  Having looked at this issue, though, and examined it very carefully, I am very clear that I want to ensure that it is the end-users who benefit.  </p> <p>  Having visited local job clubs in my area and spoken to the people rolling out the employability service, I have every confidence that they will be well positioned to put in a good tender and I have no reason to believe that they should not be successful.  I genuinely believe that, because we worked extremely hard with them before the request for tender went out to help them to understand this process.  The tender is out there now.  We will learn from this process when the applications come in and before we look to the next requests for tender due to be issued before the end of the year.  I think this process will instil confidence in the providers.  Ultimately, they are providing a service to people and giving them the confidence and advice to help them to take up a job.  There is no reason, therefore, why the service providers should not have that same confidence in themselves to win this tender.</p></speech>

We are all agreed that the focus must be on the individuals and on ensuring that they secure sustainable employment.  We are all at one on that issue.

I ask colleagues to bear with me while I go through some housekeeping matters.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Professor Brian MacCraith to make his opening statement, to be followed by an exchange of views with committee members.  As our guests are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.</p><p>Before I invite Professor MacCraith to deliver his opening statement, which is limited to three minutes, I advise the witnesses of the following with regard to parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they may be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  As some of our witnesses are attending remotely from outside of the Leinster House campus, they should note that there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present in the confines of Leinster House or the convention centre to participate in the public meeting.  Any member who is not so present will be asked to leave the meeting.  I ask members to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the Debates Office staff who are preparing the Official Report.  I also ask them to mute their microphones when not contributing in order to reduce background noise and feedback.  I ask our guests and members to use the raise hand function on their screen if they want to contribute.  I remind all those joining the meeting to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or on silent.</p><p>I welcome the following witnesses who will be joining us from committee room 3 remotely via Microsoft Teams: Professor Brian MacCraith, chair of the Future of Media Commission; and commission members Ms Sin&eacute;ad Burke, CEO of Tilting the Lens; Professor Gillian Doyle, professor of media economics at Glasgow University; Ms Siobh&aacute;n Holliman, deputy editor of the <i>Tuam Herald</i>; and Mr. Mark Little, CEO of Kinzen.  I welcome, too, Mr. Andrew Munro, secretary of the commission, who has been most helpful in arranging the meeting.  I thank all our witnesses very much for attending.  We are delighted to have them.  I am sure they know well the format of the meeting, whereby we will hear the opening statement and then have questions from members, who will get a certain amount of time for their questions.  We will try to keep matters moving and give all members an opportunity to contribute because it is a short meeting and there is a lot to get through.</p><p>Without further ado, I invite Professor MacCraith to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

T&aacute;im ag s&uacute;il go m&oacute;r le comhr&aacute; dearfach.  On behalf of the Future of Media Commission, I thank the committee for the kind invitation to have an exchange of views on the future of the media and the work of the commission.  I am joined by some of my fellow members of the commission whom the Chairman kindly introduced.  In the interests of time, I will just refer to some small sections of the written statement I have provided to the committee.</p> <p>  Broadly, our terms of reference identify four important public services: to inform, educate and entertain the public with regard to Irish culture, identity, sport and language; to ensure access to high-quality independent journalism; to bring the nation and diaspora together at important moments; and to ensure the work of Irish creative talent reaches audiences in Ireland and further afield.  We have been asked to identify the Irish experience in delivering the above aims and the challenges created for the media by new global platforms and changing audience preferences with regard to how content is delivered.  We have been tasked with examining whether current models are appropriate for the future and reviewing best international practice in this regard.  Arising from that work, the commission will propose how public service aims should be delivered in Ireland over the next ten years, how this can support the cultural and creative sectors and how this work can be funded in a way that is sustainable, ensures independence and delivers value for money.  We are to make recommendations on the role and financing of RT&Eacute;, as well as on oversight and regulation, having regard to our EU obligations.</p> <p>  Engagement and consultation have been a significant part of our work.  To give one example, more than 800 members of the public and stakeholder organisations took the time to make a submission to our public consultation process.  We held six online thematic dialogues that enabled a broad range of stakeholders, experts and members of the public and the commission to engage with each other.  The importance to the public of the media is and was evident.  The public really values the service provided to it by the media at national, local, and community levels.  Those three areas are important.</p> <p>  As I explained in my reply to the invitation of the Chairman, the commission has not reached its conclusions or submitted its report to the Government.  It will do so in July.  The commission is, therefore, not in a position to discuss its findings and conclusions at this stage.  We understand that the committee is engaged in pre-legislative scrutiny of the online safety and media regulation Bill.  The commission has been briefed on the Bill and its provisions to transpose the revised audiovisual media services directive, AVMSD, establish the media commission and provide for online safety and other matters.  Although the proposed legislation is of interest to the commission, we are not in a position to express a definitive view on it today.  What we can say is that our recommendations for the future of media may have implications for legislation and, where they do, we will endeavour to express them at a high level in terms of the underpinning principles and desired outcomes.  The finer detail of the legislation will be a matter for legislators, parliamentary counsel and departmental officials.</p> <p>  However, my colleagues and I are happy to speak about what we have heard and learned during our work and about the major themes and issues that are emerging from that.  These include, for example, the importance of fostering and maintaining quality journalism, independence in journalism, collaboration, innovation, platform neutrality and a very strong emphasis on equality, diversity, and inclusion.  We are eager to hear the reflections of the members of the committee, as elected public representatives, on the future of the media as they will be of assistance to us as we formulate our findings and recommendations in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

What kind of examination did the commission carry out with regard to the licence fee, other than the thematic dialogue that took place in March?  Did it speak to experts in other jurisdictions, for example, regarding their approach?  What other work was done with Irish experts, etc., when looking at the issue?</p> <p>  The issue of advertising was considered by the commission but I ask our guests to further address, in particular, potentially harmful advertising such as that relating to alcohol, betting, junk food and other advertising targeted at children.</p> <p>  Has the commission carried out work on Irish-language media and the importance of protecting and supporting it?</p></speech>

I will give some high-level comments on her questions and then hand over to other members of the commission who have specific expertise in some of the areas she mentioned.  In terms of the licence fee and the broader funding of public service broadcasting, we looked at a broad range of international models.  I am pleased to be joined by Professor Gillian Doyle, a professor of media economics who is an expert on these matters and can say more about that issue.  We have spoken to experts in several nations across Europe, as well as the European Broadcasting Union, EBU, but I will let Professor Doyle comment on that.</p> <p>  As regards language, of course the Irish language is an important part of our remit.  We are still engaged on that matter.  It is certainly significant.  It is in our terms of reference.  It is something we will make comments and recommendations on in our report, as appropriate and as the committee would expect us to do.</p><p> Before I call in Mr. Andrew Munro to comment on the matter of harmful advertising, I will go to Professor Doyle on the licence fee and alternative funding mechanisms for public service broadcasting which we have considered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.429" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gillian Doyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021061600002#B00200"><p>In the course of our deliberations, we looked at a variety of different models.  The compulsory licence fee used to be prevalent in many countries.  A number of them have moved in recent years away from it, however.  While it still prevails in the UK and in some other countries, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland and so on have moved away from it in recent years.</p> <p>  The licence fee has an advantage for consumers and citizens.  There is still a very visible social contract between those paying the fee and the provider.  We all recognise that, however, in this era where people are consuming content via devices other than the television set, a device-specific charge looks outdated.  The licence fee is an approach which has merits because it safeguards autonomy and editorial independence of public service media.</p> <p>  A problem with the licence fee is that it is regressive in that it charges the same amount whether one is rich or poor.  Another issue in the Irish context that we have heard about is that there are high collection costs and high evasion rates.  The main problem with it is the device-specific nature of the charge.</p> <p>  We have looked at a range of alternative models as well.  As the link between the receiving device and fee liability does not make sense anymore, one of the other options that would make sense would be to shift the basis of liability to a household levy.  That would allow one to make it a universal charge.  Potentially, it could bring in more revenue and the cost could be spread differently.  It could include businesses and bring in more progressive elements to it that take account of ability to pay.  It would be better future-proofed.  That sort of switch to a household charge was made in Germany in 2013.  In an Irish context, it could provide an opportunity to create a larger fund-----</p></speech>

It is actually on the agenda for this week's meeting and it will come up over the coming weeks as we formulate our conclusions.  It is clearly called out in our remit and terms of reference looking at RT&Eacute; and TG4 and across the broader media ecosystem.  We had some significant submissions on the subject of the language.  We also engaged with TG4, Conradh na Gaeilge and others around the matter.  I hope that reassures the Deputy that it is a significant priority for us.</p></speech>

However, we are conscious of the space when we are talking about the standards which should apply to public service media and content.  We are looking at the regulatory environment that applies to both public service broadcasters and the other independent broadcasters regulated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  We are also conscious that if we are to make any proposals about extending public funding support into any other areas of the media, standards and principles should underpin and go along with that funding.  We would be conscious of the need for high standards, not just in journalism but in terms of the protection of children, as the Deputy outlined with regard to advertising.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.434" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1641" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021061600002#B00700"><p>My first question is for Ms Siobh&aacute;n Holliman.  Professionally, she is <i>au fait</i>with the situation of local newspapers.  There are over 50 local newspapers affiliated to the Press Council of Ireland but many are in desperate financial straits.  The T&aacute;naiste has been quizzed by me in the Seanad about supports for local newspapers commensurate with what has happened in local radio.  He stated in the D&aacute;il that the business model is broken and has to change.  Is that a view shared by the commission?</p><p>Some people would like to paint local and regional newspapers as dinosaurs and as an outdated media.  If that is the case, we are throwing local journalism and local reporting of important events to the wolves.  If local newsrooms are not supported, they will die.  How strongly will the commission support local media?  If we go down the route of the UK and the US, we will not have the breeding ground for journalists to go to a national level nor the recording of important events.</p><p>I welcome Ms Sin&eacute;ad Burke, a fellow Navan person.  I compliment her on the excellent thematic dialogue that she chaired on how available the media output to an increasingly diverse audience is, such as to people with a disability, the LGBT community, as well as representatives from Black Irish Media.  It made sure they were not just tokenistic characters when represented in the media.</p><p>It is abundantly clear from these hearings that traditional media, such as the big beast of television, are dying.  They are being replaced by online media, such as Twitter and Facebook.  How will Ms Burke and the commission deal with this?  We have seen high-profile stances in the UK with the Premier League having a complete social media blackout when it comes to Black Lives Matter.  What is the commission's stance on this?  Progress has been made among traditional media outlets such as television but they have changed drastically where the game is now online.</p></speech>

At a personal level it is very much appreciated that it continues to be highlighted.  I have first-hand knowledge of the local media industry.  It has been my job all of my life to date.  I can assure Senator Cassells that I am not a dinosaur.  I do not believe local media is in any way extinct at this stage.  We are alive and well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.438" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>What is evident from the submissions and the stakeholder engagement is the high value that the public places on it.  It is something that people value.  They see it as something that provides unique content.  You cannot get the same content that is in a local paper, whether it is online or in the printed product, elsewhere.  The last few years have shown the importance of their availability across all platforms.  This is evident in submissions and in the discussions we have had with people in the industry.  That is one of the challenges that they face.  Local newspapers are highly regarded and have been much discussed by the commission.  We have taken a lot of time to take people's views on this subject on board.  Local newspapers are integral to communities in rural and urban areas.  It is important that media outlets have a connection to their communities, that local democracy continues to be reported upon and that items which might not always be of interest to the public but are in the public interest are also covered.  I assure the Senator that these issues are very much to the forefront of the Future of Media Commission's discussions and will be dealt with in our final report.</p></speech>

I am a white, visibly disabled cisgender woman who uses the pronouns "she" and "her".  I have long brown hair and I am sitting in front of green flower wallpaper in Navan.</p> <p>  On the diversity and inclusion question that the Senator posed, in the work of the commission we were really intentional about ensuring that the learnings we undertook within this space lived within the mandate of "nothing about us without us".  Through our thematic dialogues, we have engaged with stakeholders representing organisations and individuals with lived experience to compare to international best practice in thinking about the increasing representation of diverse people, in front of the camera but also behind it, with regards to our media entity.  As already stated, we have not yet come to our final conclusions within this but it is intrinsic to the work of the commission in terms of who we learn from and how we consider diversity and inclusion.  The Senator made specific reference to the digital landscape.  We have seen from international best practice is that digital has been a space where diverse voices have been most welcome.  We have also learned from our discussions, including our thematic dialogue, that these communities have a desire to ensure the digital landscape is not the only one in which diversity is represented.  We are currently trying to create recommendations which understand the desire, importance and relevance for diverse voices to exist within our media landscape as they do in our society.</p></speech>

I will focus on the legislation we are considering.  What do the witnesses see as the primary roles of the new media commission that we are going to set up?  Do they see it as becoming a regulator?  Do they believe it will also have a role in education and in supporting content creation?</p> <p>  My next question relates to the commission's third thematic dialogue around dealing with misinformation and disinformation.  Dr. Scott Ruston of Arizona State University has raised the question of transparency in the use of algorithms by social media companies.  This is particularly important.  We want to see a code around algorithmic decision-making and how algorithms are used to feed misinformation and disinformation.  I am interested to hear the witnesses' views on how we should tie that into legislation or the development of codes by the new commission.</p> <p>  I will put a direct question to Professor MacCraith which is related to the misinformation and disinformation issue.  He has headed up the very successful vaccination programme on behalf of the Government, and I think everyone is very appreciative of that.  There was concern about the spreading of disinformation and fake news about the Covid-19 vaccine.  What lessons can we learn from what we have seen over the last year?  In particular, how would the new commission deal in such circumstances with the need to get very important information to people?  When I raised the role of social media companies in tackling disinformation around Covid in the Seanad, I experienced a bit of abuse as a result.  Ireland has been very lucky that we had such a high take-up level of the vaccine but there are important lessons that are there to be learned.</p></speech>

I will turn to Mr. Munro on the role of the proposed media commission.  The Senator is correct in what he says about the functionality and the role of that commission.  While we cannot go into detail on that, the new commission will play a very important role.</p> <p>  I thank the Senator for his positive comments on the vaccination programme.  At the very beginning, we knew from international experience that anti-vax sentiment on social media platforms would be an issue, particularly as we look down through the age cohorts.  We are getting down through them, thankfully, and we will reach 30-year-olds very shortly.  We had direct engagement with Google, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok, in the first instance as a task force.  Subsequently, the HSE and the Department of Health have had ongoing engagements with those platforms, as well as Kinzen.  I will let its founder, Mr. Little, speak about that in a moment.  We engaged in terms of their co-operation in tackling this and directing individuals to reliable sites with reliable information.  As the Senator knows, it is a battle one can never win.  One must keep engaging with it all the time.  There have been Europe-leading levels of uptake of the vaccine in Ireland so far.  We are now vaccinating those in their 40s.  This is a good sign that people in Ireland have been turning to trusted sources of information and have not, so far, been overly influenced by continuing anti-vax activity.  It was very noticeable at the weekend when the European Medicines Agency came out with a statement that it was experiencing a lot of negative anti-vax material on social media platforms.  What is the lesson learned?  Certainly, Ireland is fortunate to have a significant presence of social media platforms which have been very positive and collaborative with us in this regard.  We have learned the importance of ongoing engagement and collaboration with them.  There might be a broader message in that for other issues we must deal with.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Little to speak about the more specific issues around technology, misinformation and the algorithms associated with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.442" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Little" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021061600002#C00500"><p>I have a personal perspective but also a professional one.  Personally, I believe we should see misinformation and disinformation around the vaccines as part of an infodemic that parallels the spread of the pandemic.  To that extent, we should focus on how we flatten the curve.  How do we detect and intervene early?  How do we help the essential workers, as I describe them, in those platforms - the trust and safety teams and the content moderators - to detect things that are global in their source?  All misinformation is global even as it washes up to our shores.  We need to watch out for the local accents and be able to give the platforms a sense of whether to intervene now, or wait and watch.  That is one of the roles that we play in our company, Kinzen.</p> <p>  In a broader policy framework, as Professor MacCraith indicates, having a strong public service media, and I mean that in the broader sense, is absolutely the first step in fighting back against disinformation and misinformation.  We need to paint our broader project here in that context.  The commission is focused on looking at the ways in which international policy is starting to align - or, in some cases, to misalign - in how we tackle ongoing resilience around the ecosystem.</p><p>The proposed digital services Act, DSA, is a great place to start.  We are way ahead of the Americans with the regulation we currently have in process, particularly as it relates to the role of trusted flaggers, which is how the company that I run is described.  We are waiting to see exactly how the code of practice on disinformation will translate into the online harm legislation, an area on which the committee's work will be key.  The code of practice is lagging behind.  Right now, the DSA defines illegal disinformation.  It does not address the threat coming from things that are still legal.</p><p> We are also watching how the European Digital Media Observatory starts to get rolled out locally in countries such as Ireland.  Work on that is ongoing.  Regarding media literacy, how do we train ordinary citizens to be able to see the telltale signs of things that are designed to reduce our faith in public health?</p><p> The Senator addressed the key question.  Regulation banning disinformation will not be the silver bullet.  He is right in saying that we need closer oversight of how the algorithms work in these recommendation systems.  We need to allow independent researchers to have access to the data sets these platforms are using.  Work remains to be done on how the DSA will address that bigger issue.  I am confident that we in Europe have a head start on the US.  Due to historical factors relating to the development of cutting-edge information economic companies like ours, we have an edge here in Ireland.  That is very much to the front of our mind.  It will require a partnership between policy and the practical everyday work of fighting back against this infodemic.</p></speech>

Newspaper circulation has more than halved and advertising spending is moving online.  The financial model underpinning traditional journalism is slowly beginning to crumble.  The question of the long-term viability of journalism has been looming for some time and it has been brought into sharp focus during the pandemic.  Does the Future of Media Commission accept the need for remuneration for content or the implementation of a digital tax, a system by which local media companies are remunerated for the use of their content by tech companies, remediating their problem, including the implementation of the copyright directive and the consideration of the new Australian model?  Has that been reviewed?</p> <p>  What are the witnesses' views on a tax on global tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, to create a fund to support public service content creation to address the challenges they face?</p></speech>

He will appreciate that we cannot give very specific answers because they would divulge our recommendations, some of which have not yet been made in this context.  I will shortly ask Professor Doyle to elaborate.  We recognise - it was a very significant part of our engagements and consultation - the challenges for the long-term viability of many sectors of the media system because of the absolute takeover of the advertising space by the big tech companies.  Senator Cassells spoke earlier about local and regional newspapers, and local and community radio.  That is very much to the fore in our deliberations, as is the very important issue of supporting high-quality journalism.  So much of what is important in our society and democracy relies on our sustaining and maintaining high-quality journalism.  Those issues will form part of our recommendations.</p> <p>  We have looked at the Australian, French and UK models in terms of how one engages with the big tech companies and how one addresses the difficult problem of the use of news content on those platforms.  We have discussed issues of the copyright directive, a digital tax and so on.  However, we are not at liberty to outline our exact thoughts in this regard, except to say that it is a very important part of our deliberation and has rightly consumed much of our time.  I will ask Professor Doyle to give some more specific detail on that.</p></speech>

That has been very damaging for public service media and for print media.  This structural change appears to be ongoing.  There will be more migration which means less money from advertising to support professional media content creation.  We have heard that addressing this will require some combination of traditional media finding new revenue models, market solutions plus interventions.</p> <p>  Consideration is being given to subsidies for public service media and for public service content that is more platform-neutral and perhaps some form of redistribution of revenues from big tech companies to traditional media.  This might be achieved voluntarily or through some form of collaboration and support schemes in which big tech companies might play a part, or, as the Deputy mentioned, through the imposition of a requirement for payments under copyright law for substantive use of content or through use of competition interventions.  There is also the option of imposing targeted levies to support local production, as exists in France.  We have looked at all these and our considerations are ongoing.</p></speech>

How is it proposed to protect small local media outlets?  We are in a sea of media outlets at the moment with more coming on board.  Particularly in rural areas, local newspapers and local magazines are very important to the community.</p> <p>  The areas of disinformation and media literacy are important but are also notoriously difficult to legislate for.  How is the content defined?  How is it possible to get around issues such as freedom of speech and expression?</p> <p>  When issuing new television and radio licences, would the commission be prepared to recommend 5% use of the Irish language?</p></speech>

I will call in my colleagues on specific matters, but I will try to deal with some of the issues he raised.  We were very conscious of the importance of local print and broadcast media outlets.  We had a significant engagement with Craol regarding community radio and so on.  As some members have mentioned already and as we have heard throughout the consultation process, the pandemic has proven the importance of this, particularly for rural communities.  We do not want to follow what has happened in other parts of the world including in the US with what are called media deserts or news deserts.  We want to ensure this happens at a local level.  It is forming an active part of our deliberations and we will be commenting on this.  We will be seeking to address supports in this regard, but I cannot be more specific than that.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned media literacy, which is another critical part of what we are discussing and goes back into the broader misinformation and disinformation situation.</p><p>There are some bodies like Craol that are addressing media literacy already.  We will comment on its importance and protecting our society in that regard.</p><p> If I talk about licences, it brings us to our deliberations on what is a sustainable funding model for public service broadcasting.  We are not in a position to comment specifically on that.  The Deputy asked how one could use income to support the Irish language.  Returning to what I said earlier, it is correctly an important part of our deliberations and we will make specific comments and recommendations in this regard.</p><p> I will turn to Ms Holliman to add more depth to my answers on local media outlets.  She will provide a more informed commentary.</p></speech>

We have heard considerable inputs from them during our work.  The sector is extremely fragile at the moment, as the committee will be aware.  The pandemic has heightened its reliance on its advertising income.  We are very much aware that circulation has been impacted in the last few years.  The sector has not yet come up with a solution.  We have considered how its unique content can be supported for what it does in the public interest, but while remaining independent.  In all this discussion, it is crucial that we have a trustworthy news sector and that our journalism is independent and transparent and has standards that it holds.  It is important that it does not succumb to commercial or political pressures.  That is the overview we are looking at in the local media sector in particular.  There have been calls for support and different ways to help not only the media but also the many workers involved.  We must ensure that they have a future and that there is a future for upcoming journalists at local and national level.  We are considering how it can be done in a balanced way that is not interfered with by commercial or political sectors.  We will bring the issues to the fore in our final report.</p></speech>

It has been said that the witnesses cannot go into it but inasmuch as they can, will they speak about the different models they looked at?</p> <p>   Education resources on disinformation have been mentioned.  Has the commission explored the need for educational initiatives around the use of our data online?  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has announced landmark litigation today around online ads and people being tracked.  It does not have to be that way.  Is there education on the existing alternatives to WhatsApp, Google and Gmail that do not track our lives?  Has the commission explored educating people about how their data is used online?</p> <p>  Has the Future of Media Commission considered sectoral stability for the community media sector?  Community radio and television make one of the greatest contributions to diversity in media.  The community media sector is a entry-level place for people who are interested in media to go.</p></speech>

The BAI policy on community media is due to be launched formally in the coming days.  Linked to that, last week I did a pre-recorded interview with Dundalk FM, which is part of that sector, and commented on the commission's views on that broader space, not only reinforcing the importance of community media - radio, newspapers and so on - but also., as the Senator said, indicating the particular role that community media can play in supporting equality, diversity and inclusion, and the whole representational aspect of the new Irish society that is with us.  We looked at examples of migrants and refugees and giving them a platform, and so on, but right across the broader equality, diversity and inclusion area, as Ms Burke mentioned earlier.  The theme of equality, diversity and inclusion will be evident in our report, with significant comments on the importance of the community media sector.</p> <p>  I will turn to Mr. Little on disinformation, and the education model around it, after Professor Doyle has finished her answer on the first part of Senator Warfield's question, which was an addition to Deputy Munster's question on other models to sustain and support public service media.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.453" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Little" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021061600002#E00500"><p>The thing to address here is the role that the data being collected are playing in the recommendations that are to be shown to citizens.  That is a critical part of the media literacy brief.  Someone said earlier that it is very hard to define what media literacy is.  One of the key elements of best practice internationally that we looked at is helping people to understand that when one receives a friend or family recommendation, it is not from one's friends or family but from a recommendation system that has hoovered up a vast amount of data about one and is telling one what it thinks one wants to see based on its need to optimise for advertising.  That is a key element of broader media literacy.</p> <p>  To diverge a little, one aspect we have seen in terms of supporting more community-based media is some good news around the world about international best practices.  Where news deserts have emerged in the US, we have started to see the rise of alternative business models around things like subscriptions, donations and membership.  We have been very aware of the extent to which we can help to incentivise business models for local community media that are resilient and will survive the next ten years, and not just rectify the pain of the last ten years.  We have also looked at the services that community media provide in terms of civic reporting, and at how we can help there.  Finally, we have been looking at some of the exciting stuff that is going on in community media around podcasting, for example.  One of the key aspects of the Irish media system is the resilience of local radio.  We want to see where there is optimism for what will never be a normal for-public media environment.  We really need to be prepared for an era when the only constant is change.  To that extent we are looking at some of the positive aspects of international best practice in supporting community media in its local formulation but also supporting the key communities around the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.454" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gillian Doyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021061600002#E00600"><p>In looking across the range of options, we considered whether there could be more reliance on commercial revenues.  There are questions around having a heavier reliance on advertising because as we know, expenditures on television advertising are in decline.  That money is migrating to the Internet and it is not coming back so some degree of reliance on advertising makes sense but not complete reliance.  Another possibility is voluntary subscriptions from citizens.  That option is being debated in many jurisdictions but has not been adopted.  The problem is the way it might cut across the universality principle.  From what we have heard, there are questions about whether a subscription model could work in Ireland.  There are concerns that you could not raise enough money, or that you might end up with a service aimed only at the privileged.  Then we are back to considering publicly funded options.  We have talked about the licence fee and the possibility of a switch to a household charge.  The other possibility is a government grant or direct Exchequer funding.  That would allow you to tap into Ireland's very progressive income tax system and perhaps spread the burden across businesses too.</p><p>It is an approach which would remove evasion and promote universality.  It also has the advantage of making income more stable and predictable.  The snag is that it runs the risk of political interference.  One would need strong safeguards to ensure independence from the whims of the government of the day.  A number of variants of the government grant approach have been implemented across Europe in recent years as a way of moving away from the licence fee.  There are various variant models in Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland.  We have looked at all of those and are considering them.</p></speech>

Looking at my laptop screen here, I am filled with confidence about the calibre and the quality of the people that we have chosen to do the work of the commission.  I look forward to its deliberations.</p><p>Fine Gael is finalising a submission that it will make to the commission on foot of significant engagement with local media practitioners, both in print media and broadcasting, over the past two months.  We have had some fascinating conversations with those colleagues of Ms Holliman who are on the front line in terms of the challenges they face with ever-dwindling advertising revenue, as well as the slow but steady migration from the traditional outlets to digital.</p><p>What brought it home to me was when I was listening to a podcast four or five weeks ago.  It was produced in the US and all its contributors were from there.  When it went to an ad break, the words &quot;Loughrea&quot; and &quot;Salthill&quot; were mentioned.  It was extraordinary.  It was this scalpel-like precision in homing in exactly on where I was listening, choosing the advertiser, who obviously paid to be on this platform, and feeding that advertiser directly to me because I happened to be listening in east Galway.  It was fascinating, if somewhat sobering, to see what was happening.</p><p>Like many other countries have already done, we urgently need to look at some sort of model that supports, as Ms Holliman described it, the production of independent, transparent and trustworthy output and content.  What has sustained us as a nation over the past year and a half is that our people have been able to turn to those trusted sources of local and national media, print and broadcast, to determine who exactly they could trust to give them strong, solid and reliable information.  We have to back that production of strong, solid and reliable information to the hilt in terms of the work that is going to happen over the next decade or so.</p><p>We are now moving into an extraordinarily fascinating and exciting but, as Mr. Little described it, ever-changing landscape.  We need to strike a balance between regulating the social media landscape and allowing people to use social media to communicate.  We saw an example of the effectiveness of that communication yesterday when we had thousands of people coming from Donegal to protest in Dublin, an event which, in the main, was organised on social media.  It is important that such a level of engagement is not suppressed in any way in an attempt to regulate social media.</p><p>Media literacy was spoken about at length in previous contributions.  If at all possible, will the commission engage with the Department of Education to determine what is happening in primary and post-primary schools in this regard?  Is there any element of digital or media literacy incorporated into general literacy?  When I was growing up, if one saw the <i>National Enquirer</i>on the top shelf of a newsagents stating Martians had landed in Normandy, one could discern quickly this was a nice, interesting and fun read but not the truth.  Do our young people, the nine- to 14-year-old cohort, have the skills and knowledge to be able to determine what is correct information?  It must be borne in mind that the only time we were challenged by misinformation when we were young was when we walked into our local newsagents.  Young people get it every day through computers, etc.  Will the commission engage with the Department of Education to see what element of provision there is and how that can be improved?</p><p>I thank the witnesses again for the wonderful work they are doing.  With the talent and skills we have, along with our exceptionally strong capacity across the whole spectrum of digital, Ireland can become the exemplar in how to develop a healthy, transparent and sustainable media landscape while, at the same time, not suppressing the opportunity for individuals and groups to keep communicating with one another in the future.  I wish the commission every success.</p></speech>

It is important that this happens along with the work that the committee is doing with pre-legislative scrutiny.  I concur with Deputy Cannon that this is probably one of the most important pieces of work of our age in the media sphere.  We have got a real opportunity to be a global leader in this.</p> <p>  Next week the committee is due to meet with the European Commission to discuss the strategy, A Europe fit for the digital age.  In terms of media plurality and diversity, Ireland does not score favourably on risk factors for social inclusiveness compared to some of our EU colleagues.  Of particular concern in Ireland is a lack of protections for minority audiences, in addition to a lack of active promotion of gender equality in programme-making.  Do any members of the commission wish to comment on that?</p></speech>

The necessity for greater representation of an intersectional society - "intersectional" meaning thinking about diversity and inclusion through a broad remit of gender, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, political belief and class - has never been more important.  The greater cacophony of voices that we can have shaping our content and our media, both in terms of visual representation and craft behind the scenes, has been integral to the issues that we have discussed today.  It has been central to our discussions both in terms of our thematic dialogue and the recommendations we will make going forward.  We wish to have a media landscape that is meaningfully reflective of the diversity that exists in Ireland and that any person who wishes to participate in the media sees it as a viable, accessible and equitable opportunity for them.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that they have a tougher job.  There has been huge disparity regarding pay and even equal rights in the media.  That could be explored further by the committee.  We have progressed well in this regard but there is still a further way to go.</p> <p>  It is not just women but other communities and groups who need a stronger voice.  That also comes through education and how they actually arrive into the media.  Through our engagement over the past few months, we have seen how difficult it can be.  We have mountains of media courses but they are not always accessible to everyone for various reasons, be it community or educational background or financial position.  We would endeavour to have an equal playing ground.  That also comes from the education point of view and opening up education for all.  It is not just a media issue but a society issue in general.</p></speech>

That notion of a truly representative media ecosystem, reflective of the diversity of Irish society, is one of the strongest messages we have received and will be reflected in our recommendations.</p></speech>

From the broadcasting and media division of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, joining us remotely from committee room 3 on Microsoft Teams, I welcome Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill, principal officer, and her colleague, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Shanley, senior policy analyst.</p> <p>  I ask colleagues and guests to bear with me as I go through some housekeeping matters for the benefit of the witnesses who have joined us for this part of the meeting.  The format of the meeting is such that I will invite the officials attending on the behalf of the Department to make their opening statement, followed by questions from members of the committee.  As they are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statement on its website following the meeting.  Before I invite our guests to deliver their opening statement, which will be limited to three minutes, I advise them of the following in respect of parliamentary privilege.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If, therefore, their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of any identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue.  As our guests are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, they should note there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a physically present witness.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Quill to make her opening statement on behalf of the Department.</p></speech>

I hope today's engagement will be of further assistance.</p> <p>  On 18 May, the Government decided to integrate the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019 into the proposed online safety and media regulation Bill, with the addition of three further heads.  I apologise for the delay in communicating the intention of the Government in this regard and for any interruption it may have caused to the work of the committee.  The heads of the 2019 Bill were subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the relevant Oireachtas joint committee in 2017 and its report was laid before the Oireachtas on 8 March 2018.</p> <p>  It is important to note that the integration of the Bills will entail no substantial policy changes regarding the provisions of the 2019 Bill.  The majority of the substantive provisions of the 2019 Bill, that is, sections 4 to 10, inclusive, will simply be folded into the online safety and media regulation Bill.  Sections 1, 2 and 11 will not be carried over, as these are technical provisions that already exist in the online safety and media regulation Bill.</p> <p>  The policy intentions behind section 3 will be carried over through the draft section based on head 40 of the general scheme of the online safety and media regulation Bill, given that both concern industry levies.  These policy intentions are, first, that the broadcasting regulation functions of the media commission may be part-funded from TV licence moneys and, second, that all community broadcasters will be completely exempt from the industry levy.  This is the only significant difference from the 2019 Bill, which had instead provided that community broadcasters would be exempt from paying the industry levy only if they fell below an income threshold of &euro;250,000.</p> <p>  Two of the additional heads were drafted to be Committee Stage amendments to the 2019 Bill in order to remove the requirement for RT&Eacute; to operate Aertel, which is outdated, and to remove the hourly limits for advertising minutage on commercial radio stations while retaining an overall limit of 15% of daily broadcasting time.</p><p>This was called for by the independent commercial sector and will offer greater flexibility.  The third head relates to the prominence of public service content.  This head transposes one of the optional provisions of the revised audiovisual media services directive, AVMSD, namely Article 7A.  It is intended to ensure that public service content and channels are easily findable and discoverable for Irish audiences as technology changes.  To conclude, I reiterate my hope that today&rsquo;s meeting will assist in the committee&rsquo;s scrutiny.  I look forward to answering its questions.</p></speech>

Can Ms Quill explain what became of that proposal?  Has it made it into the Bill?  Is it now completely off the table?</p></speech>

It was considered that because the commission would be looking at funding models for broadcasting going forward, it did not make sense at this stage to make provision for a specific channel or route to go.  It is therefore not included in this Bill.</p></speech>

If the Minister now says that the Bill will be published towards the end of July, and if the committee has not published a report on its prelegislative scrutiny by then, will we have a situation where prelegislative scrutiny is completely pointless, if the Minister and the Government are going to publish the Bill without taking the committee's views into account?</p></speech>

As a general point, it is worth noting that as was the case with the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019, changes can also be made on Committee Stage, when it can be decided to add in legislative provisions.  However, I cannot comment on the specific issue that the Deputy has raised.  It is a matter for the Minister.</p></speech>

Otherwise, this whole exercise will be a total waste of time.</p> <p>  I have a final question.  Did the Department liaise with stakeholders and interest groups around the changes that are being made to the Bill itself?  Can Ms Quill comment on that?</p></speech>

There are relatively few changes to the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill in terms of what we are bringing into the online safety and media regulation Bill.  One change relates to community broadcasters.  We were in touch with Craol, the representative group, about that.  It is an improvement for that sector.  The Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill provided that there would be no levy charged on community broadcasters with an income below &euro;250,000, but we are getting rid of this threshold and making it an absolute point that there will be no levy for community broadcasters.  Craol was happy with that.  It is also worth noting that some of the provisions around levies were already included in the online safety and media regulation Bill.  We are bringing in provisions to provide that the regulator can be part-funded by TV licence fees or, indeed, by Exchequer funding.</p></speech>

We do not want to make the weeks of witnesses coming in here to give their statements, and our scrutiny, futile.  It would make no sense.  We will do that and it is a good suggestion.  Moving on, I call Senator Cassells.</p></speech>

If there is no correlation with the timelines, I propose that we might as well stop today and quit because it makes a mockery of what we have doing in terms of the breadth and depth of what has been teased out over recent months.  I refer to the impact of the testimony we have garnered from the social media and tech giants, and from the children's rapporteurs who have touched on deficiencies and the need to address areas such as the definitions of online harm, online content, financial content and financial harm.  There is another aspect to this as well.  Is there a timeline for the publication of the report of the Future of Media Commission report, representatives of which we have just had on the line?  We will need to reflect on the content of that report and the recommendations in it.  We need synergy between our prelegislative scrutiny, the work of the Department and the work of the Future of Media Commission.  Getting that clarified is a huge part of what needs to be done.</p></speech>

I am trying to ascertain how the work of this committee is going to be respected.  The key point is respect for the committee's work, which has been quite arduous and intensive over a number of hours.  We need to make sure the Department and this committee work together.  When the report of the Future of Media Commission is published, it will have huge ramifications for everyone concerned.</p></speech>

For that reason, and in order to address that issue, the Government is aware of the urgency of getting the legislation enacted as soon as possible.  The Department has been working closely with the Future of Media Commission secretariat in relation to supporting the work of the commission.  There have been close synergies there.

They would basically tell us nothing.  They said that they do not want to divulge anything.  How close is the commission's report to being finalised?

A more likely scenario is there will be an additional Bill to address the many issues the Future of Media Commission will bring forward.  While the online safety and media regulation Bill amends the Broadcasting Act, it only deals with some elements of that Act.  There are many areas not addressed in the online safety and media regulation Bill that will need to be considered separately.  The work of the Future of Media Commission will set the template for that.</p></speech>

They can understand the frustration of my colleagues.  I would worry if this Bill were to come before the Oireachtas before we have concluded our prelegislative scrutiny.  Many of the key issues we are debating will end up being debated on the floor of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  There are still a number of fundamental issues we have to resolve.  As Senator Cassells said, part of what is crucial for us is the question of the timetable.  I appreciate the point Ms Quill made about the urgency with respect to infringement proceedings.  It begs the question, and I am not saying I am in favour of this, of whether there should have been two items of legislation, one to transpose the directive and a broader item of legislation.  We are setting up a new regulatory agency, which has the potential to be one of the most powerful regulatory agencies in the State.  I have no doubt that after we do it, we will be constantly introducing amending legislation as technology develops and as the digital services Act and the digital markets Act at EU level are considered.  It is important to have a discussion on that and on the timeframe.  I ask Ms Quill to bring that back to the Minister.</p> <p>  Some of the key questions in a number of the big debates on the directive are on the content levy.  The witnesses have been tuned into the debates we have had.  Has the Department formed a view based on our discussions on the Bill that will be presented to us?  Where will the content levy feature as part of that?  What kind of model may be proposed in the legislation?</p> <p>  A second aspect is the big element with respect to the establishment of the media commission.  We have had a debate on the appointment of an online safety commissioner.  As the witnesses will be aware, a number of us have suggested the appointment of an online safety commissioner on a non-statutory basis to get the office up and running.  We are all concerned about addressing the online harm issues.  What is the view of the Department in that regard?  The officials will have listened to our discussions to date.  If the Department is proposing to bring forward a Bill, they will be aware of some of the concerns and issues that we as a committee have not even settled.  For instance, has a view been formed on the establishment of an individual complaints mechanism and on what threshold will be used in those circumstances?  If it is proposed to bring forward a Bill when we as a committee have not even formulated the recommendations we will make, can Ms Quill outline what is likely to appear in that Bill with regard to those issues?</p></speech>

There is very little in the online safety and media regulation Bill that is not required to implement the AVMSD.  In order to implement it, it could not be done through the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland because it does not have the statutory powers regarding on-demand services and online safety aspects.  We needed to make statutory provision for a regulator with wider powers in that regard.</p> <p>  The other point to note is the AVMSD is quite high level in some of its provisions and they need to be teased out in more detail.  I entirely appreciate the points the Senator made but we attempted, insofar as it was possible, to keep the online safety and media regulation Bill focused on the implementation of the directive.  That is why we did not address other areas of the Broadcasting Act that are now being considered by the Future of Media Commission.  Nevertheless, quite a range of issues are addressed in the Bill.</p> <p>  Regarding the model and getting the office up and running, we have prepared a business case.  We have been engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and have strongly asserted to it not only that we believe the commission needs substantial resources but also that we would like to get recruitment going before the commission is formally established so that it has a chance to hit the ground running once it receives formal establishment.  Those discussions are still ongoing.</p> <p>  In terms of a content levy, there is provision in the Bill for a content production levy but it is recognised that potential impacts from introducing a levy for citizens and for others need to be teased out.  The levy will not be commenced until the commission has been established, has considered and researched the issues involved and has brought forward the detailed provisions in a levy order.</p></speech>

We have heard considerable evidence and some of it is competing.  Other countries have made a decision.  I do not accept the argument that we have to wait until the media commission is established before a content levy can be established.  I appreciate there are political decisions about the form of levy and all of that, but I am not clear on why we have to wait for the commission to be established.  Why can we not have the research carried out, design the model and so on and put it in place?  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has designed schemes previously.  I am not clear as to the rationale.</p></speech>

This work is valid and important, but it considers these matters only from that perspective.</p><p>There are also impacts for citizens.  There are risks because it is not possible to have a levy focused only on international entities that target Ireland.  RT&Eacute; and Virgin Media Ireland would also have to be targeted by the levy.  There are potential downsides depending on how the levy is structured and introduced.  It is important that the media commission, which will have responsibility for implementing the levy, will have an opportunity to review that and to be satisfied that, in the model that is brought forward, all of those impacts are considered and teased through.</p></speech>

Will Ms Quill and Mr. Shanley clarify what has changed for this committee with regard to our work?  Have the goalposts moved for what the Department is doing compared with the public consultations with a number of key stakeholders which we have been engaged in over recent months?</p> <p>  The aim of the establishment of the Future of Media Commission was to produce a report to submit to the Government in July as mandated.  It was expected that the Government would publish this report once it had an opportunity to consider it.  Where will that sit and will this committee get an opportunity to review that?</p></speech>

It primarily related to the levy function of the BAI.  We are integrating that into the online safety Bill.  There are no substantive changes involved.  The only real one is to make things a little easier for community broadcasters with regard to the levy.  The other provisions of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill that were thoroughly teased out through stakeholder consultation and separate prelegislative scrutiny are integrated into the online safety and media regulation Bill.  I would not say that the work for the committee has been substantially altered by the integration of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill.</p></speech>

There were three head changes beforehand which we were not made aware of by the Minister.  She apologised for the disruption to the committee.  I would say that every member was at least mildly embarrassed.</p> <p>  I am glad that community radio stations will be exempt from the levy.  I am concerned about medium-sized radio stations such as in Wexford.  They have possibly between 30 and 35 people employed.  The witnesses say that the turnover would have to be &euro;250,000.  With average of &euro;700 a week, wages alone would cost &euro;100,000, without including insurance, the building and so on, so &euro;250,000 is low.  There are 20 to 40 people in those areas.  What way will the levy work?  How did the Department come to the figure of &euro;250,000?  Is that turnover or what is it?  What is the difference between hourly limits and the overall limit of 15%?  Why was that brought in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.521" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021061600002#K01300"><p>The Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill previously provided an exemption from the levy for community broadcasters but only if their income and turnover was below &euro;250,000.  There is now no threshold.  We are just saying that all community broadcasters will be exempt from the levy.</p> <p>  On the 15% limit, it was previously the case that the commercial radio sector could have no more than ten minutes of advertising in an hour and no more than 15% of broadcasting time in any 24-hour period could be used for advertising.  We are keeping the overall limit and saying that advertising cannot be more than 15% of total broadcasting time, but we are abolishing the hourly limit.  That provides more flexibility to broadcasters so that if something is on which attracts a big audience, they have more leeway to shore up their revenue through advertising.  That echoes some additional flexibility for advertising on television that the AVMSD introduces.  That is being transposed by the online safety and media regulation Bill.</p> <p>  In addition to the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill provisions, two of the three additional heads that were integrated were intended to be integrated on Committee Stage.  One relates to abolishing the requirement for RT&Eacute; to continue to maintain a teletext service, Aertel.  The second is about the independent radio sector's advertising limits.  The final one is to introduce a provision regarding the prominence of public service media.  This was an option under Article 7 of the AVMSD.  We listened to the views brought forward by the European regulators group, RT&Eacute; and TG4, and we propose to include a provision in the online safety and media regulation Bill related to that, given the importance of public service media in an increasingly fragmented market and rapid technological changes that mean that media content on those stations that was previously easily found might not be so easy to find in future.</p></speech>

The vast majority of community stations are below the &euro;250,000 limit but when the various sources of revenue, including various grants and community employment and so on, of a couple of stations were added up, their income exceeded &euro;250,000 so they would not have been exempt from the levy.  The &euro;250,000 threshold was initially put forward in the hope that it would exempt all community broadcasters but then it was found that it might not exempt a couple of them, so we are now proposing that there will not be a threshold.</p></speech>

I would be a little cautious on this issue.  It is a very American approach to drive down the size of the television hour and the amount of advertising allowed within that hour.  A quick look at the commissioning site of TG4 informed me that it commissions for 50-minute shows.  I would be cautious about opening the door in that regard.  Under these rules, would a radio station be allowed to air almost a full hour of advertisements, which would not make sense from their perspective?  On paper, would they be allowed basically the full hour of advertisements at prime time or during a match?</p></speech>

Some of the detail is not set out in the legislation but there are ways of doing it.  It might relate to the search functionality or it might be an allocating requirement for an icon relating to public service media on a home page or something of that kind.  It is about recognising that people now search more by voice than was previously the case.  The detail of it will be set out by the media commission in rules that can be amended to reflect changing technology over time, but it is about recognising that the days of the electronic programme guide that just had all of the channels listed are drawing to a close.  We have tried to have similar provisions to those being pursued by other EU member states.</p></speech>

The information we got at the outset was quite shocking.  I refer to the Minister's decision, or hope, to bring forward this legislation before the committee has completed its prelegislative scrutiny work.  That makes absolutely no sense to me.  I have to concur with Senator Cassells that we might as well not have done the work we have been carrying out for the past five or six months.  Members have committed to hours upon hours of work each week, as have the witnesses coming before the committee to give their views on this very important legislation.  I say that not to reprimand the officials, but perhaps they can carry the message back to the Minister and the Government.  The decision reflects very poorly in terms of the regard of the Minister and the Government for this committee and the work we have been doing for several months.</p> <p>  I am also mindful of the fact that the committee became aware on 18 May that elements of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019 are to be integrated into the proposed online safety and media regulation Bill.  Today is 16 June, only four weeks later, and we are now hearing that this legislation will be brought before the Houses in July, before prelegislative scrutiny is complete and likely before the Future of Media Commission completes its work.  Can Ms Quill throw any light on why the Minister did not seek a waiver?  We all appreciate there is an urgency in terms of infringement proceedings.  We discussed that as a committee at the beginning of the process, as Deputy Munster will remember because she was the one to say it was important that we did this work correctly, robustly and transparently rather than just rush it through for the sake of saving a couple of weeks.  We need to finish it correctly and properly.</p> <p>  Does Ms Quill have any idea why the Minister did not seek a waiver of prelegislative scrutiny by the committee on the Bill if it was her ambition to push it through in July?  I note Ms Quill eloquently described the relationship between the Department and the Future of Media Commission in terms of discussions, close contact and work.  Has the Department had a similar relationship with this committee?  If it had, I do not think the revelation today would have been so surprising for the committee.  I would have assumed that as part of the work of the Department, it would have been liaising with the secretariat of this committee, just as it does with the Future of Media Commission.  If that were the case, members of the committee would have been much more aware that this was the intention of the Minister.  Two questions arise in this context.  Why did the Minister not seek the waiver of prelegislative scrutiny, as she could have done through the Business Committee?  Will Ms Quill comment on the working relationship of the Department with the secretariat of this committee in terms of liaising with it, given that the Department obviously has a very good and active relationship with the Future of Media Commission</p></speech>

The heads of the Bill were first brought forward in January 2020.  Through a series of circumstances, including the general election, the Government formation talks, the transfer of functions to a new Department and the establishment of the new committees following the formation of the Government, the committee was not established until October.  The Minister brought the additional heads of Bill to the Government in December 2020.  At that stage, prelegislative scrutiny was sought in recognition of the importance of some of the issues arising in the Bill.</p><p>That is the why prelegislative scrutiny was sought, namely, to recognise that these are key issues.  We appreciate there is much in the Bill for the committee to examine but, at the risk of repeating myself, infringement proceedings are under way as well.  Therefore, there are tensions between a few different objectives.</p><p> Regarding the integration of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill, it was not considered by the Government until 18 May.  I am not sure what we should have said to the committee in advance of that.  I have already apologised to the committee for any inconvenience arising as a result of that.  We got a briefing to the committee secretariat as soon as we could after that to support it in its work in briefing the committee regarding the integration of the two Bills.  We have a good working relationship with the committee secretariat and I hope that will continue.</p></speech>

I am sure the Chair would not disagree with it at this stage, given what has come to pass today.  In the letter that I am proposing we write to the Minister, I suggest we insist that she seeks a waiver to allow for prelegislative scrutiny in order not to be so bluntly dismissive of the work of this committee and of all the stakeholders who took time to make submissions and come before this committee to share with us their concerns or add whatever they thought would benefit the legislation in terms of their ideas, etc.  It would be totally dismissive and nothing short of sheer arrogance not to do so.  Could we write to the Minister asking her to seek that waiver to allow for the prelegislative scrutiny?  Otherwise, it might as well be the Minister&rsquo;s Bill, with no involvement of this committee and no taking on board of what stakeholders have said.  She would find it very hard to get support for that Bill in such circumstances.</p></speech>

If this is to continue in this vein we will find the Bill will get buried in committee with amendments if the prelegislative scrutiny does not have the input and the effect we had hoped it would have.

It is something we talked about at length at the beginning of this process but we made a conscious decision as a committee that it was more important we did it robustly, transparently and as thoroughly and comprehensively as possible.  That is why we have spent week and after week bringing in various witnesses to give them that voice and platform, and considering our own position on all of the elements that affect this Bill.  We will have to leave it there.  It is not the meeting we expected it to be.</p> <p>  I thank the officials for coming before the committee and giving us this information.  It has been very useful if not alarming.  I thank the members for their contributions, suggestions and ideas.  We will follow up with the secretariat on the suggestions made with respect to the Minister.  I suggest we will have to meet in private session as a matter of urgency before our next meeting, which would ordinarily take place next Wednesday.  There is a need for a meeting to discuss this matter in private session before our meeting next Wednesday.  I would ask members to make provision for that.  I am sure Ms Laura Pathe from our secretariat will be in touch to organise that.</p> <p>  To conclude, I thank Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Shanley for being with us.  I also thank the members for their participation.  We will meet in private session.  The next meeting on 23 June is confirmed, but we will meet before that regarding the revelations from today's meeting.  Our next public meeting will be at 3.30 p.m. on 23 June with the executive vice president of the European Commission, Commissioner Vestager, to discuss the subject of making Europe fit for the digital age.  That will be a very important meeting for us as a committee in terms of the work we are doing.  We do not want that to become futile.  I thank everybody for their participation.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome: Dr. Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer, CMO, at the Department of Health; Dr. Ronan Glynn, deputy CMO at the Department of Health; Professor Philip Nolan, chair of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, modelling group, Dr. Cillian de Gascun, consultant virologist and director at the National Virus Reference Laboratory; Professor Mary Keogan, consultant immunologist and national clinical lead for pathology; and Professor Martin Cormican, consultant microbiologist and national clinical lead for antimicrobial resistance and infection control.  I thank them all for appearing before the committee.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or to otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name to the person or entity.  If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identified person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending the meeting remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of how their domestic law might apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of their constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask that prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, any member who is participating by Teams would confirm that he or she is on the grounds of Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  For anybody watching this meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I as the Chair and the necessary staff essential to running the meeting are physically present in the room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask for everyone's forbearance should any technical issues arise.</p> <p>  This is a very important meeting for the public.  I thank Dr. Holohan and his colleagues for attending.  We look forward to a very good engagement on the role of rapid antigen testing alongside PCR testing.  They are not mutually exclusive.  We feel they have a significant role to play in aviation and travel.  I ask Dr. Holohan to make his opening statement, which should last approximately five minutes.</p></speech>

The Chairman has outlined the list of people accompanying me.  I am joined today by Dr. Glynn, deputy CMO; Professor Nolan, chair of the modelling group, Dr. de Gascun, consultant virologist and director at the National Virus Reference Laboratory; Professor Keogan, consultant immunologist and national clinical lead for pathology; and Professor Cormican, consultant microbiologist and national clinical lead for antimicrobial resistance and infection control.</p> <p>  I am glad to report that the Covid-19 epidemiological situation in Ireland remains encouragingly stable and currently gives rise to a broadly positive outlook, notwithstanding an ongoing level of uncertainty due to the threat of variants, which are of concern throughout the world.  A significant proportion of the adult population in this country remains to be fully vaccinated notwithstanding the good work of the HSE in that area.  Our progress has been made possible largely due to the great sacrifices of people in this country and their continued high levels of adherence to the public health measures.  Their compliance with those public health measures is what has controlled the disease so far, along with the progressive impact of the national vaccination programme.</p> <p>  We continue to target the public health response in order to most optimally in our judgment mitigate the impact of the pandemic, including as it relates to testing for SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus that causes Covid-19.  However, breaking chains of transmission cannot be achieved through testing alone.  Ultimately, breaking chains of transmission depends on the extent to which appropriate follow-on, and individual and public health actions are implemented and supported by a wider, comprehensive public health response.  As I have said, we have largely seen that in this country.  That said, access to timely and accurate Covid-19 testing is an essential component of a multifaceted response strategy which supports case identification, contact tracing, clinical management of cases, infection prevention and control, and disease surveillance including for emerging variants.</p> <p>  In this country to date, testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been primarily based on a robust and agile PCR testing capacity that has been built up to approximately 175,000 tests per week.  PCR remains the most accurate and internationally recognised gold-standard diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2.  Our PCR testing capacity is focused on high-yield target groups in the population, such as symptomatic persons or close contacts of cases, along with higher-risk settings and specific indications to limit the importation of Covid-19 as a result of essential travel to this country.</p><p>In addition, since late March 2021, free walk-in testing pathways have been established to provide access to free PCR testing for asymptomatic individuals in various locations around the country where there is deemed to be a public health need, for example, due to a high disease incidence in a local community.  The Chair will be well familiar with that in Limerick.</p><p> In addition to PCR testing capacity, substantial work has also been undertaken by the HSE to examine the potential role for rapid testing within the wider pandemic response.   As part of this work, the HSE has performed independent and site-specific validation in Ireland of a number of rapid antigen tests.  On foot of this work, the HSE recommends that the use of rapid antigen tests be considered as a diagnostic test in symptomatic people, when a public heath risk assessment determines that the rapidity of results is of utility as an adjunct to the available PCR capacity.  For example, in vulnerable communities where there is follow-up of those positive results that are likely to be challenging, or as a supplement to PCR testing in the event of inadequate PCR capacity to meet requirements, which is a situation that we do not find ourselves in at this point in time.</p><p> International evidence to date, including two recent major international publications from the Infectious Disease Society of America, published this month on 5 June, I think, and the Royal Statistical Society in the United Kingdom, which was also published this month; the recent Covid-19 Test Validation Summary Report that was published by the HSE earlier this week; and, existing guidance from the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, all indicate that rapid antigen tests typically perform best in symptomatic individuals and in settings of high disease prevalence, and less well in asymptomatic persons in low prevalence situations.</p><p> Based on existing evidence, the use of rapid antigen testing may be considered in high-prevalence settings such as outbreaks where the pre-test probability of individuals being infected is high, and where more rapidly available results may support PCR testing through the early identification of cases and implementation of appropriate follow-on public health actions.  The HSE has already made rapid antigen tests available for deployment in such scenarios, where deemed appropriate by local public health teams.</p><p> Rapid testing, with antigen testing, may also be considered in higher-risk environments for transmission of Covid-19 as may exist in, for example, meat processing plants.  Substantial work has been conducted to evaluate the results and use of rapid antigen tests in asymptomatic workers in this setting, under strictly controlled processes.  Both the HSE and the Department of Health have supported the piloting of rapid antigen testing in meat processing plants led by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p> The HSE has also made rapid antigen tests available for use in acute hospital settings, if deemed an additional utility by the relevant institutions in the context of access to typically quick turnaround of PCR testing on site.  In addition, the Department of Health has supported, and does support, the development of a collaborative pilot now in place by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, the HSE, HIQA and a number of third-level institutions.  It is a validation study to examine the potential applicability of different rapid antigen testing approaches in third-level settings.  We look forward to reviewing the output from that study.  Separately, the HSE is also progressing plans to pilot rapid antigen tests for use in childcare settings as well as in a number of third-level institutions.</p><p> While there may be a potential utility to be realised from the use of rapid testing in controlled environments, and this may further evolve over time, there is still much we need to learn about these tests and their actual, as opposed to hypothetical, benefits and limitations.  As stressed by the authors of the Royal Statistical Society Report in the UK, which I encourage members to read, the proper assessment of the suitability of Covid-19 tests has been neglected to date, with many tests brought to market without appropriate real-world evaluation or well-designed studies evaluating tests in real-world settings where they are used, and this must become standard practice.  In particular, while the aforementioned indications and pilots may be considered as &ldquo;red light&rdquo; rapid testing activities, picking up additional cases in a timely manner, and appropriately integrated into the wider public health response, significant caution is urged in regard to any move towards employing rapid antigen testing for &ldquo;green light&rdquo; or &ldquo;enabling&rdquo; activities that we would otherwise deem to be unsafe, particularly while not accounting for the prevailing epidemiological situation.</p><p> Given the limitations of such tests along with the current lack of a substantive supporting real-world evidence base, the hypothesis that antigen testing could be a precursor or enabler for the safe recommencement of certain activities, which would otherwise be deemed not to be safe given the prevailing epidemiological situation, poses several risks both to the individuals engaging in those activities, and those around them, as well as to the wider public health response.</p><p> As the evidence evolves, and assuming that this evidence is supportive of the use of rapid antigen testing, we are more than willing to support its further use where appropriate evaluation indicates that it can bring added benefit in the pandemic response.  Ultimately, based on knowledge to date, the safest way for us to reopen society, including international travel, will be to continue to control the incidence of the disease, and we are making encouraging progress in that regard, through a range of public health measures that are continuously reviewed, as we do, along with progressing the national vaccination programme to ensure as many people as possible within the population are protected through immunisation.  That is our current policy and it is working. </p><p> Once again, we thank the committee for extending an invitation to meet today to discuss the Covid-19 testing strategy in relation to travel.  We are happy to take any questions on the strategy or on anything else.</p></speech>

We thank RT&Eacute; for broadcasting this meeting live on its RT&Eacute; news channel.  This meeting will be a hugely important engagement for both ourselves and the public looking in.  We want to have a discussion on the science behind rapid antigen testing and the proposals.  We have heard from expert witnesses from across the spectrum and people who have advocated for antigen testing.  Obviously Dr. Holohan will appreciate that NPHET advises the Government on medical matters so it is critical that we engage and get NPHET's views on the matter so we can find a way to progress thing.</p> <p>  I wish to advise members that because we have limited time we must conclude this meeting by 2.30 p.m.  Therefore, I urge members to stick to seven minutes when they can ask the witnesses concise and succinct questions, and hear answers because a large number of members wish to contribute.  First up for Fianna F&aacute;il is Deputy James O'Connor and he has seven minutes.   </p></speech>

However, it has to be said that the group of witnesses before this committee, and I appreciate them coming before us today, need to have questions put to them, particularly for the many people who work in the aviation sector from whom all of us on the committee have heard here at meetings over the past number of months.  It is arguably the case at the moment that NPHET is the most powerful unelected body in the country.  Therefore, NPHET must be scrutinised by members of this committee, and by Members of both D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>  From my own perspective, I am extremely concerned about Ireland's lackadaisical approach to the area of antigen testing.  It is concerning to see Ireland being a laggard in this respect when countries like Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Spain, France, Hungary, Italy, and I could go on, are actively looking at the area of antigen testing and how it could benefit the area of aviation.  We are, arguably, arriving at a position where Ireland will have its vaccination process completed, or relatively completed, towards the end of the summer and early autumn.  Surely be to God we need to start looking at the implementation of antigen testing?  </p> <p>  Professor Ferguson's report said antigen testing has specific benefits in terms of its implementation.  I noticed that Dr. Holohan has used a couple of phrases here today regarding its accuracy.  Arguably, in a controlled environment like an airport or aircraft where there is security, policing methods and crowd control in place already, surely there is no better place for us to consider implementing antigen testing?  Specifically, on the area of aviation, why are we not looking at antigen testing?</p></speech>

It has already been examined in a number of settings.  When we find evidence of the value of it then we apply that evidence.  As I have set out already, in symptomatic situations and certain high-risk situations, I am not aware of any published data anywhere that is reported on use in the kinds of sectors or settings that the Deputy has described applied to asymptomatic individuals.  I am not aware of any.  There is no such data published in any independent studies conducted anywhere in the world that I am aware of.  Maybe the Deputy is aware of some but we are not.</p></speech>

We have not seen any evidence generated from that sector as yet.  If any validation study was proposed to be carried out, we would have no opposition to that whatsoever.  The Deputy quotes the Ferguson report and he rightly says it points out the need for us to have well-conducted validation studies supporting policy in this area.  That is what we want.  We are fully open to using antigen testing in the airline sector and we want it to be informed by the outcome of validation studies.</p> <p>  If I could point to one example, the Deputy may be aware that in the third level sector there is a good study getting under way this summer involving the academic institutions, funded through Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, and sponsored by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  That is exactly the kind of validation exercise we need to inform us as to whether there is a benefit to antigen tests.  The findings of the study will inform the application of rapid antigen tests in that particular sector.  That is exactly how a responsible approach to validation and the rolling out of antigen testing should happen.</p></speech>

Our response in our testing capabilities around antigen testing is not up to scratch in terms of large-scale events.  We should be increasing capacity at events, using the antigen testing systems that are available.</p> <p>  I want to make an important point.  There is a three to four-day window in early infection where both antigen and PCR tests can display a false negative.  We are trying to compare like with like in the different systems that are in place for testing Covid-19.  Is that enough of a reason to look at antigen testing in the area of aviation?  We are already using PCR testing because the likelihood is that in the three to four-day incubation or early period where somebody could have contracted Covid-19, there is already a strong likelihood we will miss that.</p> <p>  My position is that antigen tests should be implemented by the State in every possible location, because if it was taking place in a fuel garage, I would use it.  If it was in an airport, we would all use it if it was mandatory.  It is ludicrous for the 140,000 people whose livelihoods depend on aviation in this country that we are not looking at this particular mechanism for the area of Covid-19 testing.  The Ferguson report set it out clearly.  Professor Mina of Harvard University, an assistant professor of epidemiology, says it is a powerful tool in tackling Covid-19.</p> <p>  We should be doing more with this.  Does Dr. Holohan think there is the capacity for this State to up its level of testing events to see how we can implement antigen testing, looking at events like Electric Picnic and the aviation sector?  Do we have the capacity to do that in the next six months?</p></speech>

If he reads the Royal Statistical Society report, it is an excellent treatise on the dangers and risks of applying tests where there is not good evidence to support the application of those tests and on the standards that need to apply in the conduct of validation studies.  It makes many points and I would encourage the Deputy to read it.  We are talking about applying antigen tests in a wide variety of different settings.  We need to have that informed by the conduct of well-planned and organised validation studies that are applied to each of those sectors so that we know and understand what the impacts of them are.  That is a position the Ferguson report also sets out and that is our position.</p></speech>

Our Government's chief scientific adviser is Professor Ferguson.

Why can we not implement some of the findings of that report?</p></speech>

This is supported by all of the bodies I mentioned in my opening statement, which I can go back over if the Deputy wishes.  Our position is exactly the same.  We have good quality validation studies that inform us.  We have had a recent study published by the team in the HSE led by Professor Keogan and Dr. Lorraine Doherty that has looked at asymptomatic populations and the performance of antigen tests among them in comparison with PCR tests.  Where people who have a positive PCR test are also tested by antigen, it picks up the disease in 52% of those in asymptomatic situations.  That is one validation study that has been conducted in this country.  There is another study I have told the Deputy about also being planned for application in the third level sector.  That is an example of the kind of study that is recommended by the Ferguson report.  That is the way for us to go about establishing whether there is an evidence base to this.</p> <p>  We cannot simply start rolling out tests on the basis that people think they are a good idea without us supporting that with good quality scientific evidence generated from independent validation studies.  That is our position.  That is not at variance with the Ferguson report or with the position of all of the international bodies I have set out for the Deputy.</p></speech>

Every test put into practice needs to be validated.  This is not confined to antigen testing and the need over the past year.  There have been four PCR tests which have not met the criteria to be introduced into our hospitals.  Had we failed to validate, we would have missed the diagnosis in a number of patients, allowing outbreaks to proceed and denying patients appropriate treatment.  Validation is a key part of the diagnostics for any test.</p> <p>  Internationally and in all of the countries the Deputy mentions, manufacturers' claims of sensitivity and specificity have not been borne out in many cases by independent field evaluations.  In line with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, position, we need to do independent field evaluations to confirm or refute the manufacturers' claims.  Most of these antigen tests were developed to investigate symptomatic individuals.  The findings in symptomatic individuals cannot be extrapolated to asymptomatic individuals.  It is a key part of our public health response that symptomatic individuals should not be going to school, work or events and that they should not be travelling.  No test is perfect, and so, if symptomatic people continue to go about their business as if they are asymptomatic, that will cause problems.  We are talking about the results in asymptomatic people.</p> <p>  One myth with antigen tests is that they are rapid and easy.  To do one test is rapid and easy but to do 100 tests is extremely labour intensive.  For example, in the Barcelona conference at the end of March, 80 nurses were deployed to work 12-hour days to get 5,000 people tested.  It is key that members of this committee understand the enormous work involved.  Self-testing is promoted as a way to get around this but these tests are open to manipulation.  You can produce a false negative or positive test by using carbonated beverages.  Therefore, self-testing is not used in any jurisdiction for a test-to-enable approach.</p></speech>

I want to take up a couple of points.  We are not saying that rapid antigen testing should replace PCR testing.  It is quite the reverse and we are saying they should be complementary to each other.  Dr. Holohan makes reference to the Ferguson report and he is saying he is in agreement with it.  Has the report been discussed by NPHET?  We are putting it in the initial context for this committee around aviation and travel.</p><p>Is it fair to say that if someone takes a PCR test three days prior to arrival in Ireland, there is no guarantee that he or she will not have developed a high viral load and be very infectious when boarding a plane on the third day?  When such a person boards a plane he or she could infect others on the plane.  We believe that rapid antigen testing has a role to play post-departure.  It can be done within an hour. </p><p> I take the point made by Professor Keogan on tests for a large number of people.  I am talking about a test for one person going on a plane.  Are there any situations to date where someone who travelled into Ireland with a negative PCR test was found after a number of days to be symptomatic, and went for a PCR test which turned out to be positive?  Surely rapid antigen testing has a role to play as part of the toolkit alongside PCR in terms of reducing the risk of Covid regarding detection.  No test is foolproof, including PCR testing.  We accept PCR is the standard.</p><p> The report benchmarked antigen against PCR being at one.  It is not at one.  It is a great test and it is standard.  I ask the witnesses to deal with that point.  Has NPHET discussed the Ferguson report?  My basic question concerns antigen testing being done pre-departure.  Have passengers come into Ireland after a negative PCR test and then a couple of days later developed symptoms and had a positive PCR test?  Contact tracing goes back 48 hours.  All of the people on the plane would be deemed to have been close contacts and if the person had been tested pre-departure he or she would have been Covid positive.</p></speech>

I do not disagree with the idea that there is potential for antigen testing to work in a complementary way with PCR testing in any setting.  We must validate that use and we do not have validation in the settings the Chairman has described that show some of the things he said.</p> <p>  On PCR, we recommend a test pre-travel and then a second test after five days.  I will let Dr. Glynn come in on that in a moment.  The Chairman is correct in saying that it is not a guarantee.  There are no guarantees.  If we find ourselves in a situation where we have people vaccinated, our position from a European point of view - we are talking about travel between countries when people are vaccinated - is that we will not require any evidence of any form of testing in regard to that travel.  </p> <p>  That will not be a guarantee that there will not be a risk of infection because it is still technically possible.  These vaccines do not render people fully immune.  We know that.  We think of the risk substantially to allow us to proceed.  PCR is the best test that we have.  In the trade it is known as the gold standard.  It is accepted and the standard practice-----</p></speech>

If Dr Holohan is agreeable to that, we deem that to be a step forward.  In the limited time I have I want to discuss the delta variant in the UK.  Why did NPHET recommend to Government to extend the quarantine period of testing for people who have been validated by other tests but still have to have a PCR test within five days?  The digital green certificate will require no test.  Someone who has had a negative PCR test will now have to get a negative PCR test five and ten days into quarantine.  I ask NPHET to outline its thinking around why it made that recommendation to Government.</p></speech>

If I am exposed to the virus today it grows inside me undetected for three or four days.  I could be exposed today, take a PCR test on Friday and be negative.  Then the virus replicates very quickly so I could be PCR positive on Sunday or Monday.  That is why, as the Chairman knows, quite frequently two tests are recommended because the virus can be latent.<br/><br/>It is interesting to propose that on top of that two test regime an additional rapid antigen test might pick up some cases that we are missing.  It is not particularly plausible.  It would mean that one would have to go from a position of having almost no virus or no virus detectable to having a very large viral load within 24 or 48 hours.  In designing a pilot to check whether that would be a useful addition, one would have to be very careful about the number of people one includes.  It might have to be very large study.<br/><br/>The fundamental point that we want to make is that as a country we need to prioritise.  It is difficult to do a pilot study.  We cannot have a scattergun approach, and decide to try something everywhere.  It is important that we prioritise in what settings we will pilot the use of antigen testing.  That will clearly be the settings where it will be <i>a priori </i>most likely to be useful.  We then have to very carefully design the validation studies-----</p></speech>

Data from it is coming through on a weekly basis.  There was concern initially when it looked at early data that the incubation and infection periods might be slightly longer.  That has not yet been confirmed, but is something it is continuing to investigate.  Equally, the later test on day ten will cover the in-transit period of time from the UK for possible acquisition.  Obviously, the majority of cases there are associated with the delta variant at this point in time.</p> <p>  To come back to the bigger question of what the committee feels antigen testing is adding to the PCR system that is already in place, PCR is the preferred test.  It is a better test.  In terms of the standards put in place before antigen tests were ever developed by the WHO and ECDC the antigen tests we have do not perform to those standards in the asymptomatic cohort. </p> <p>  This is probably not for today, but it would be useful to try to get back to asking what problem we are trying to solve.  Is PCR too expensive?  Is it too labour-intensive?  It cannot be inaccessible.  We are doing 175,000 tests a week.  We need to try to address the fundamental principle because PCR is a better test.  Antigen testing in the asymptomatic cohort will miss one in every two cases.</p><p>The case that is missed may well be infectious and may be the Delta or another variant.  The public health measures that we have introduced are-----</p></speech>

In the past few weeks, we have seen a deteriorating situation there, with a 50% increase, week on week, in the number of cases reported across the UK, with a doubling time in some regions of less than a week.  We have seen an increase of 15% in hospitalisation, week on week, over the past couple of weeks.  That all gives us cause for concern.</p> <p>  Of course, the ultimate measure is to stop travel.  That is the only way we can entirely eliminate risk.  The next option is to institute a quarantine period of a full 14 days.  The next option after that is to decide on a regime that allows release from quarantine based on testing.  The recommended approach now in relation to overseas arrivals from Britain is that they should have a negative PCR test prior to departure, a not-detected test again at day five, post arrival, and a further not-detected test at day ten.  That is obviously for people who are not fully vaccinated arriving here from Great Britain.  </p></speech>

I am conscious of the fact that Dr. Holohan and Dr. De Gascun were with us on 2 November last.  At that time, we had no testing - either PCR or antigen testing - but we had a very similar conversation about the need for validation, the importance of validation and real-world testing.  In the meantime, a number of reports have been published.  We had one in October and two more in April from HIQA.  We had a report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, in November and May.  We also had the Ferguson report in April and the more recent report from the HSE.  There have been lots of conversations around comparisons, infectious versus non-infectious, symptomatic versus asymptomatic, serial versus single-point in time, self-administered versus laboratory administered, sensitivity, specificity, different platforms and testing strategies and yet we are back at the place we were last November, saying that there is not enough evidence.  We have heard very strong and compelling evidence from a range of people - and the witnesses will have heard this themselves - who say that serial antigen testing could be an improvement on the regime that we currently have in place.  I take that as an opportunity.  What they are saying is that antigen testing could be an improvement on what we have now which is the single-point in time PCR test 72 hours prior to departure, with people free to go about their business after that.  The weakness of the current regime must be recognised, as well as the potential of antigen testing to improve it.</p> <p>  Why have no pilot studies taken place in the aviation sector since 3 November?  Who made that decision?  Who decided to focus more generally on the meat industry and the third level sector?</p></speech>

We now have a very substantial proportion of the population vaccinated and will shortly find ourselves in the happy position where we think those people will be able to travel freely without the need for any form of testing.  That is a remarkably changed situation in relation to travel from the one that pertained when we met this committee last when frankly, any basis we would have had for expressing optimism about the future of travel was very guarded.  We are much less guarded about that now.  We are on the cusp of being able to see people being enabled to travel once they are vaccinated, with all the appropriate public health measures being applied to both travel and to what people do after they travel.  That is a really good situation but we will continue to advocate that people who are not yet vaccinated wait.  We are very close to the point where the majority of people in this country who are currently the target of vaccination will be offered a vaccine.  That is a much changed situation.</p> <p>  The Deputy, perhaps mistakenly, said at the beginning that we had no form of testing or tracing but that is not the case.  PCR testing has been in place since the very early days of this pandemic and there were many-----</p></speech>

How does one go about establishing a pilot study?  Why have they been done in the meat industry, which is appropriate, and in the third level sector but not in the aviation sector?  This committee wrote to various Ministers on 5 May recommending that a pilot study be undertaken in the aviation sector to provide the evidence base for which the witnesses are calling.</p></speech>

We depend on the sectors themselves to come forward.  What we have seen is the meat sector come forward, very responsibly, in respect of its own staff and put arrangements in place for public health measures of all forms to limit transmission among staff and that has included the use of antigen tests.  We are happy to support the evaluation of all of that but that happened because the meat sector and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine stepped forward.  Similarly, we are seeing the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, supported by funding from Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, and the third level bodies, coming forward-----</p></speech>

We heard from Dr. Niamh Power last week or the week before and she specifically outlined how she proactively established the antigen testing process at the airports here.  That strikes me as the sector putting its hand up and saying it was ready to play a role.  Is it the Department that takes the lead or the Minister?</p></speech>

They understand our public health advice.  It is clear, simple and straightforward.  It is applied in the form of guidance, with appropriate oversight.  The vast majority of society has taken that on very responsibly.  They take unto themselves the responsibility, the risks and the management of those risks in the resumption of those activities.  The Deputy asked about pilot studies of antigen testing, serial testing in meat plants and the planned testing for the third level sector and that is exactly how they have done it.  That is the responsible way for it to happen, with the sectors themselves, in seeking to make their activities as safe as they can be, applying all of the measures that we recommend in the plans that they have for resumption.  Whether one is talking about pubs, restaurants, airlines and workplaces of all kinds, that is exactly what is happening.</p><p>The plans for the individual sectors are not being drawn up by NPHET.  We do not have knowledge of the pub industry or the school sector in the way they do themselves.  They have developed their own guidance.  In a number of cases, it is world class guidance.  For example, schools are applying the guidance in such a way as to minimise the risk of transmission in the school environment, which has allowed-----</p></speech>

I am sure the sector is watching this meeting.  It has been publishing reports as far back as last July calling for the implementation of such a testing regime.  From its perspective, this is about aligning the interests of public health with public confidence that whatever international travel happens is done safely.  That is the objective.</p></speech>

It is one thing to call for the use of a test where the evidence to support such use does not exist, which has been the case heretofore.</p></speech>

There is considerable experience around NPHET's table and within the various Departments to design a suitable study that compares performance.  Now is an opportune time when there is limited travel and there is PCR testing in place.  We have not had such a pilot study since 5 May.  Are there other resistances to a study?</p></speech>

The reality is that many of the types of study that the Deputy is talking about have not been done in Ireland or internationally.  It is not as simple as turning up at the airport with a couple of thousand antigen tests, handing them out and seeing what they show.  A test validation study comprises a set of steps and there is a range of concerns to do with ethical acceptability and the performance and logistics of the test, all of which have to be considered as part of the work.  When we say we do not have evidence, it is not that we do not have evidence in Ireland.  Rather, there is no evidence internationally.  Other countries have not been able to do these studies to the necessary standard.  To give an example of that,-----</p></speech>

We are not.  The report that NPHET produced late on Monday evening was commissioned last October, which is nearly nine months ago.  It strikes me that consideration of a pilot scheme in aviation would have fit into that report perfectly.  NPHET's caution has served us well and I compliment its work.  Nevertheless, we need a pilot scheme to provide the level of validation NPHET is seeking.  If such a scheme is introduced by the Department of Transport or the Department of Health, would NPHET support and expedite it?</p></speech>

As Dr. Glynn stated, it is not as simple as turning up with a couple of thousand antigen tests.  We need to go through planning and ensure that the study is adequately powered in terms of epidemiology so that we get useful information.  There are international guidelines about the size of the cohort required.  There are problems with validating in asymptomatic cases.  It is very difficult to get the number of positives required.  The ethical and consent issues need to be considered.  The scheme needs to be set up in a safe way that looks after the health and safety of the people performing the test and of the people being tested.  There needs to be GDPR compliance with the gathering of appropriate data and the follow-up.</p> <p>  It took a large team of people to do this work.  Reading the report, the Chairman may feel it was easy to write and could have been done more quickly.  We worked on this for seven days per week since last October, though, so I beg to differ.  It required an enormous amount of work.  I thank all of the participants who allowed themselves to be double swabbed as well as the scientists from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the scientists employed by the HSE who did the work.

No one knows better than the witnesses the difficult and complex environment in which we are fighting the virus.

Before one goes off and invests in designing pilots to be added to the highly effective regime that we already have, one has to consider how likely it is that there will be a positive finding.</p> <p>  It is not possible to say how long it would take until someone sits down and sets out the use case through which these tests would be validated.  To give a simple sense of the matter along the lines that Professor Keogan mentioned, if we go out tomorrow and administer tests to 100,000 people in Ireland, we are likely to find 100 to 200 infections.  We would not be testing 100,000, but 100 to 200 people.  As Dr. Holohan stated, doing these pilots is very challenging and takes time, and before one embarks upon a pilot, one must judge whether there is a likelihood that it will-----</p></speech>

Some of them are publically commissioned and some are privately commissioned.  Dr. De Gascun or Professor Keogan are better placed to comment on international practice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.655" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Mary Keogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021061600002#G00300"><p>The Senator needs to consider one thing.  We, in Ireland, built up our PCR capacity very quickly to a high level.  A number of other countries are extremely challenged in their PCR capacity and, therefore, in the absence of being able to offer PCR are using antigen tests where they really would like to have a PCR.  The fact that somebody is using them does not mean that it is their preferred option.</p> <p>  To be honest, one of the huge misconceptions is that if one is antigen negative, one is not infectious.  Our data from the meat plant validation show that while overall there is 52% sensitivity, of those people who have been missed, over half of them have PCR positivity at a level that would correlate with infectiousness and being a risk.  So it is not correct to say that if one is antigen negative, one is not infectious.  In fact, having waded through all of these data, some extremely strongly positive people, who would almost certainly be culture positive, have come up negative on antigen tests.</p> <p>  To be honest, if we were starting a validation in the aviation sector then I doubt if we would improve on available PCR capacity, and we have abundant PCR capacity.  In the same way as when clinical services come to me and ask about using point-of-care testing, I often look at point-of-care molecular testing that will give a much better outcome, rather than antigen testing.</p> <p>  We have become too polarised and too focused on antigen testing.  As Dr. De Gascun said earlier, we need to be clear what is the question that we are asking because good diagnostics involves getting the best available test to answer the question that is being asked.  Tests do not exist in a vacuum or tests do not have a role in a vacuum.  We have got to define what is the question, what do we want to achieve, how do we best achieve that and then look to a validation study of the best and most likely to work solutions. </p></speech>

Let us consider the level of vaccination and the very significant reduction in death and hospitalisation.  Surely the question now is within reason, how do we get people back travelling as safely as possible, while recognising there is still potential for some spread, yet recognising that the potential for death or hospitalisation is greatly reduced?  How, on a wider level, can we support an industry that has a significant impact on our economy?  How do we get some level of normality back into the sector?  Perhaps these questions are not for the witnesses.  These are wider governmental issues but NPHET makes a significant input into them.</p> <p>  Dr. Holohan talked about the level of vaccination and how well the programme is working.  I say well done to everybody for that.  What is the justification for restricting the people who are fully vaccinated from international travel, particularly within Europe, until 19 July?  Today, there are people who are fully vaccinated and could start travelling again because some airlines have opened routes.  What is the justification for the delay from the perspective of NPHET?  Is there a justification?  </p></speech>

We are doing our best to control transmission through public health measures.  At the moment, incidence has been falling over the past couple of weeks in this country.  We have seen encouraging moves in that direction, even though we are closely watching the Indian variant, what is happening in the UK and now what is happening in Northern Ireland.  More and more people are being vaccinated.  Those are the things that will allow us to safely resume airline travel and have people flying again, without the need for us to put in hurdles such as testing, where we do not believe that testing will add anything in their way.  We think that when we have a low incidence rate and a high level of vaccination, we can have a safe resumption without the need or recourse to testing.</p> <p>  It might be worth us working through a worked example of the current prevalence rate in this country and I have a note on that.</p> <p>  The Government made the decision about the resumption of airline travel as and from 19 July, and reflecting on all of the different matters to which the Government had to give consideration to, including all of the arrangements that must be now put in train to enable that in terms of certification, which the Senator is familiar with-----</p></speech>

They will have to think about where they are going.  They will have to think about how to minimise the risk while they are travelling.  They will have to think about how to comply with the appropriate public health guidance in the places that they are travelling to.  These are all the standard precautions that we will continue to advise.  Yes, we are looking forward to the resumption of that travel from then without recourse or need for any form of testing.</p></speech>

The committee has held a number of hearings on this specific issue and heard compelling evidence from a wide range of witnesses.  They all have recommended that we use antigen testing in order to restore international travel.  The impact of not using antigen testing is being felt hard by the aviation sector in this country and more damage will be done to this critical industry if we do not embrace antigen testing in full.</p> <p>  Can Dr. Holohan outline the formal NPHET position on the use of the antigen test?  Without doubt, other countries have embraced the use of antigen testing in full.  They rolled out pilot schemes, learned from them and now are using antigen testing in international travel and across society to open up cultural events.  Antigen testing is widespread yet for the last number of months we, here in Ireland, have had our head in the sand and do not have a coherent position.</p> <p>  I welcome that Dr. Holohan has said it would be a good idea to roll out a pilot scheme in terms of international travel.  Obviously the State and NPHET, which advises the State, need to get behind the initiative, step up and give timelines.  I ask Dr. Holohan to please outline when, where and how the pilot scheme will happen.</p> <p>  Today's meeting is our third hearing on this issue.  Last year, we raised these matters in terms of antigen tests.  We, on this island, all want to move forward and get back to the rhythm of normality, of which international travel plays a key part.   </p></speech>

We are on the point of a widespread resumption of that if things stay where they are currently at in Europe and, in a few weeks' time, one could find oneself in a situation where we see a significant range of travel being available to people.</p><p>I do not want to be wasting the Deputy's time repeating what I have said about vaccination and all of that, and people have had evidence of recovery from the disease.  We do not have a dependence in relation to PCR or antigen testing to enable that, and I am not entirely clear where the Deputy thinks the use of antigen testing in what has happened in recent months would have changed things for travel in this country relative to other countries in Europe.  I am not clear on that from the Deputy's question.  The position around Europe has been a fairly homogenous one in terms of the risks attending to travel.  What is changing that now is Europe is getting into a better position epidemiologically with the disease as a result of the control measures for the most part that are in place and the economic and social restrictions that Europe has had in place.</p><p> We have had a range of arrangements in place in this country, of course, which are being eased in an evidenced-based way, as they are across Europe.  On the position we found ourselves in, we had, in European terms, the fifth lowest cases in the course of this pandemic in this country and the sixth lowest number of deaths, and we count cases and deaths more comprehensively than any other country.  That has been the effect of the measures we have had in place in this country.</p><p> Travel has been restricted right across Europe, and not selectively in this country.  It is not entirely clear to me from what the Deputy said, if I am picking it up correctly, how, if we had done something differently on antigen testing, in spite of the fact we do not have evidence to support what the Deputy said, it would have changed things in terms of people's ability to travel over the course of recent months.</p><p> I will ask other colleagues to contribute.</p></speech>

It is very important we understand at any point in this conversation exactly what we are talking about.  Are we talking about repeated serial testing?  Are we talking about one-off testing?  Are we talking about testing before events?  Are we talking about symptomatic people versus asymptomatic people?  Another way to look at it is what settings are they are appropriate in.  For many months now we have said they can be used in red-light settings to pick up extra cases in outbreaks.  Antigen tests have been available in this country for many months for that purpose led by public health specialists throughout the country where they deem it appropriate.  The second is in high-risk settings where you want to do serial testing, for example, as we are doing in the meat-processing facilities.  That has been in place and has been looked at on an ongoing basis over many months now.  The third is in green light settings, specifically relating to asymptomatic people going into events and various other settings where people do not know they have the disease.</p> <p>  Rather than taking our word for it, it is worth looking at what the Infectious Diseases Society of America has said in recent weeks about this.  It is very simple.  It is one line.  It simply says that for asymptomatic individuals with risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, a rapid PCR or laboratory-based test should be used rather than a single rapid antigen test.  That is the current position of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.  It is backed up by the Royal Statistical Society's report from the UK.  It is backed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and by the WHO.  It is not just us saying it.  We have to be led by the evidence.  In that regard, I might bring in Professors Cormican or Keogan.  Ultimately, if we move away from speaking about the evidence, all we are doing is seeing who speaks better.  It is eminence over evidence.  It is opinion over fact.  At all times, we have to be very careful as we go through this that we are led by what the evidence is telling us as opposed to what we want to be true.</p></speech>

First, it is important from an infection prevention and control point of view, which is my brief, to be very clear that no testing replaces the key message that if you have symptoms, you should be self-isolating.  There is no test that will substitute for that message.  I think we all know it but it needs to be repeated.</p> <p>  Second, as colleagues have said, it is not about antigen testing versus PCR testing.  It is about what is the problem you are trying to solve and which test is fast enough, reliable enough and cost-effective enough to be deployed in the setting.  Being for or against antigen testing is like being for or against the Phillips screwdriver.  You choose the screwdriver for the job that you want to do.  Nobody is for or against antigen testing.  It is about the specific tool for the job that you want to do and that the evidences bears-----</p></speech>

PCR is the best available filter we have.  Antigen testing, we can see from the evidence, will filter out fewer people who are carrying the virus than PCR will.  You can make a policy decision - some countries may have made a policy decision - to use the filter which has bigger pore sizes and some countries may use the smaller ones, but that is a policy decision.  What we need to be very clear on is that the pore size in the PCR filter is smaller and it is a better filter and the pore size in the antigen test is a bigger pore size and it is a less effective filter.  You can choose which filter you want but it is important from a scientific point of view to be clear on what you are choosing, what the differences are and how effective each of those two filters are if you choose to use them.  Right now, we do not have the evidence about how effective that filter with the bigger pore size is.</p></speech>

I do not want to go back over the ground that has been covered.  In summary, similar to what Deputy O'Rourke stated earlier, if we had started putting together a pilot scheme earlier, we would be in a different place where we would have the evidence to assess, particularly as regards aviation.</p> <p>  What NPHET members are saying is the aviation sector would have a responsibility.  Obviously, they would state they have done some elements of work on this, but beyond that, Government would need to take a lead, no more than it is taking a lead on antigen testing in third level.  The idea, as presented to us, was that sometimes serial antigen testing, especially in real time, is a better test around transmissibility at that time, and I suppose that would have to be built into it.  I certainly will not get into the ins and outs of the parameters of a test, but I assume we would need those sectors to step up as quickly as possibly and to ensure that gets done.</p> <p>  Beyond that, what I am hearing from NPHET members is that they are talking about safe opening from the point of view of the roll-out of vaccinations, and at the same time everybody accepts the necessity of connectivity across this island and in the State as regards aviation.  In that regard, I would appreciate if they could give any other indicators of anything else that can be done to ensure we have an opening up of the aviation section that it is as safe as possible and that gives people the ease to travel while being assured it can be done in a safe way.</p> <p>  I have a question, I assume to Professor Nolan, on whether we have game-planned the timeline of our roadmap in relation to the Delta variant and it taking the lead as the main virus as we open up.  I suppose it is a battle of time in terms of the Delta variant versus the vaccine roll-out.  I would appreciate if it I could answers on that.</p></speech>

It is about time.  It is about buying ourselves as much time, in the face of an organism that is likely to become dominant in many parts of Europe if things continue as they are in the UK, to get us protected as much as possible through vaccination.</p></speech>

It is also about detecting as many potentially importable cases as possible before you potentially import them.  Missing a percentage of imported cases becomes critically important if, within that percentage, you are introducing new variants.  The Deputy put his finger on the fundamental reason we are concerned in the safe reopening of travel to detect every possible case, and not only a percentage of cases, that might be coming into the country.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's second question about modelling, how quickly a more transmissible variant becomes dominant depends upon its transmission advantage, and we are not entirely sure what it is yet.</p><p>However, in the context of us having 200 to 300 new cases per day, it also depends, sadly, on how many cases we are likely to import.  It depends on the number of imported new variants plus the rate at which it transmits within the population.  Frankly, one can get a wide range of answers when one plugs that into different models.  Models are not entirely useful in this context, because the assumptions are so broad.  However, they point us to one thing, which is the vital role of surveillance at the point of entry and rapid public health intervention at the point of outbreak.  These are the two things we know are critically important.</p></speech>

If unvaccinated people are travelling to places in which they are mingling with unvaccinated people from other parts of Europe, for example, over the course of the coming weeks as we open up airline travel and are not following the advice to avoid travel and coming back to this country having perhaps come from areas with higher incidence or areas which have genuine problems with variants of concerns - and some parts of Europe are not testing as readily as we are for some of that and do not know the extent of the problems they may have with variants of concern - we could find ourselves in a situation in which, for our own transmission reasons, we have been able to open up things such as indoor hospitality and there is an opportunity for people to mingle indoors in this country who have been travelling unvaccinated and have been exposed to variants.  That could threaten the continued progress we are making and will be a risk to some of the congregation that will be necessary to resume normal or near-normal, for example, third level education in the autumn.</p> <p>  We saw at the beginning of this year, the confluence of a number of different factors such as our opening up, the change in behaviour, the time of the year and the emergence of the, at the time, B117 variant.  However, we have a concern about a confluence of factors now in that there is a new variant, international travel and people who are unvaccinated mingling with people abroad and coming back into this country taking advantage of the social opportunities which may be offered if we are opening up indoor dining and so on in July.  That is an emerging concern.</p> <p>  Anything the committee can do to help in terms of promoting that message would be welcome.</p></speech>

There have been a couple of suggestions we could have moved in this space earlier.  I want to acknowledge the work of the aviation centre.  I know they have been having meetings since this time last year in this space, because I was involved in a couple of those meetings.  However, as the pandemic evolved, we had to prioritise.  The first priority was to build up our testing capacity on-island for symptomatic individuals.  Then our priority was residential care facilities and nursing homes.  We had the meat processing plant and hospital outbreaks.</p> <p>  Our testing strategy has had to evolve and prioritise the most important areas of need.  It is not that aviation was not important but given the restrictions on travel not only from Ireland but also from many other countries into Ireland because of our epidemiological situation at a point in time, it was difficult to do the pilots in those sectors.  As Dr. Keogan has alluded to, it takes an awful long time to put in place the right pilot project to answer the question Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is trying to ask.  It is not that the aviation sector has not been willing to do this, it has just been challenging, given the fact there has been restriction on travel and the priorities have shifted over time, through no fault of its own.</p> <p>  The future out of this, as Dr. Holohan has said, is through vaccination and in a general sense, immunity.  We need the population to be protected and vaccination is the best way of getting towards that direction.  Probably 10% - 15% of the population has been infected over the course of the pandemic, so they will have natural immunity.  However, as this virus becomes endemic, the way we are all protected is through immunity of some shape or form.  Obviously, we want to use vaccination for that, so people do not get the disease and do not end up in hospital or with long-term morbidity.  Ultimately, vaccination is the way through this.</p> <p>  We want to normalise this virus over the coming six months.  We want it to become a virus along the lines of influenza.  They are obviously different viruses, but we want to move towards that approach in which a person will be tested because he or she is sick, going into hospital, part of an outbreak or in another different setting.  We do not want to medicalise normal life.  We want people to get back to travel.  They will still have to follow the public health guidelines.  They will still have to be careful because other countries will not be in the same situation.</p></speech>

In principle, we do not have any difficulty with the idea of sectors studying the potential value of antigen testing or anything else in their own sectors.  We have been neither a break on that nor advising against that.

Some sectors have already come forward with that.-----</p></speech>

I have raised the subject of antigen testing on numerous occasions.  I have raised it with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and various Ministers and we have political consensus, in that antigen testing should be used.  We then have professors disagreeing among themselves.  We have heard evidence from Dr. Mina and Professor Ferguson and many other professionals and today we hear a counter-argument by the professors around the table at NPHET.</p> <p>  I want to use my couple of minutes to make a few statements of fact, on behalf of the people who are most impacted by this dithering on antigen and whether it should be used.  It is a fact that following the advice of NPHET, the Government imposed serious, severe and prolonged restrictions on international travel.  As a result of that, the aviation sector has been crippled.  The consequences for many thousands of people who depend on the sector for a livelihood have been devastating.</p> <p>  The hopes, dreams and aspirations of workers in that sector have been shattered.  Their lives are in turmoil.  They despair about their future and ability to survive.  Those workers, throughout the aviation sector, are stricken with deep fear and anxiety.  They feel the ability to control their own future has been snatched from them by NPHET and Government policy.  They feel their financial security and well-being has been sacrificed to NPHET decisions.</p> <p>  The last year and a half has been a traumatic and upsetting time for everybody in this country.  However, no one has paid a higher price than the aviation workers.  They are outraged.  We have been listening to them and it is important to convey that message today.  They are outraged NPHET has stubbornly objected to the use of antigen testing.  They look on in dismay, while Dr. Holohan and NPHET dismiss the use of antigen testing.  They cannot understand their logic and rationale.</p> <p>  They ask us to ask Dr. Holohan and NPHET why they steadfastly contradict international experts and defy the European Commission, which said we should be using antigen testing?  Why are we so different in Ireland?  Why is Dr. Holohan and NPHET's advice so different from other countries throughout Europe using antigen testing?  Are Dr. Holohan and NPHET saying these countries are not making this decision based on evidence or validation?  Are Dr. Holohan and NPHET saying these other countries are irresponsible in using antigen testing?  Why are we so different?  That is what the public is asking.</p> <p>  Why are experts in so many other jurisdictions encouraging governments to embrace and utilise antigen testing to control the spread of the virus?  Why is our advice so at odds with that advice?  That is the contradiction I need to understand today.  Are we saying all of these other countries are wrong and we are correct?  If we are saying that, I need to hear the justification for it, because I see no logic or justification in Dr. Holohan and NPHET's decision not to endorse the roll-out of antigen testing.</p> <p>  Other sectors were mentioned earlier.  The fact is the construction and meat industries, which were riddled with outbreaks at the outset of the pandemic, became impatient.</p><p>They were frustrated with no direct advice from NPHET on how to control the virus and they brought in antigen testing, which has been very successful.  They moved ahead of NPHET, decided to use antigen testing and have done so very effectively.  Therefore, antigen testing is an important aspect.</p><p> Finally, we have discussed antigen testing for nearly 12 months, such testing has been raised on numerous occasions at Oireachtas level and now a consensus has been reached.  Have the members of NPHET made any attempt to engage with the various professionals who promote the use of antigen testing?  The message that we have gotten back is that the door is closed and there is no engagement.  If we are going to talk about introducing a pilot project at this late stage then will NPHET make an effort to reach out to the people who have expertise in this area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-16a.687" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021061600002#K00200"><p>I will bring in some colleagues to answer.  I cannot accept a number of assertions that the Deputy has made about our motivation, position and advice.  Our position on antigen testing is not as articulated by the Deputy.  Our position on antigen testing is that it is used in situations where that is supported by evidence.  We have outlined already, on a number of occasions this afternoon, the circumstances in which such use is endorsed by us, and it is made available in symptomatic and high-risk situations.</p> <p>  Dr. Glynn or Dr. Keogan will come back to the meat processing examples in a moment.  Many other countries use antigen testing in a variety of different settings and for different purposes.  Members will have heard Professor Keogan mention earlier that, for example, it can relate to the relative availability of PCR capacity.  We have been in the fortunate position that we built up PCR testing capacity to a very high level and it is well in excess right now of what our current demand for PCR testing.  So we have a better test and it is available, which is why we use it.  Many other countries are not in that happy position.</p> <p>  In terms of the relative position, which I outlined earlier, we have seen in relative terms that the incidence of this infection in this country has been one of the better in Europe, and the impact of that in terms of the number of deaths.  Earlier when the Deputy asked for NPHET's position on testing and the impact of NPHET's advice on the airline industry what he did not mention was the virus.  It is Covid that has created that impact.  The measures that are in place regarding the restriction of airline travel impact airline travel all over the world and it is because of the following.  Quite simply, when this infection began, we had no natural immunity as a global population, we had no vaccines and we had no drugs to treat this disease.  All we had available to us was the relatively crude means of keeping people apart from each other for long enough to stop the transmission of that infection.  Unfortunately, at a global level, that had a big impact on many activities and one of those clearly was the airline industry.  It simply is not the case to say that we, in some selective way, in this country through advice from NPHET selectively impacted the airline industry on a basis that was not proportionate to our concern about the transmission of this infection.</p> <p>  We followed, for the most part, the international guidance that came from international bodies and measures that were in step with measures that were happening around the world but, in particular, in this part of the world.  What people must bear in mind is that the spread of this infection through successive waves has seen Europe in the path of each of those waves over the course of the last 15 months.  We have been at the epicentre of this since the get-go and that has had a big impact on a relatively small country that has such open relations with the rest of Europe.  That is the reason we have had that impact.  It is the virus.  Our recommendations are based on interrupting the transmission of the virus.  Our evidence tells us that we have done a good job in this country through the efforts that ordinary people have made to comply with public health guidance.  That is what has, in relative terms, given protection around incidence, etc.</p> <p>  The Deputy talked about antigen testing in a global sense without recognising that antigen testing applied to symptomatic, serial and one-off.  Whether it is symptomatic or asymptomatic is entirely different.  We had a different view in relation to it in each of those settings.</p></speech>

We cannot do a validation while international travel is shut down.</p> <p>  We can learn a lot from the meat plants because the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine worked very closely with the steering group, and we designed the study collaboratively.  We designed the study in a way that it would bring key learnings for the meat processing plants and also information that would be of interest to other sectors.  I would like to acknowledge the role of John Salmon who is a member of the group because he played an enormous role.</p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine recruited a lot of its scientists to support the validation study.  There is no way that we could have succeeded in testing over 5,000 individuals in parallel with PCR in the meat plants without that support from the sector.</p></speech>

I am involved in the technical working group that looks at antigen tests.  There are countries that have less access to PCR than we have or have other pressures.  We do have the advantage of being an island where we can control travel a little bit more.  We have the advantage of having more than adequate PCR capacity.</p> <p>  We are in a race between the variants and vaccination.  As Professor Nolan alluded to earlier, we do not want to start importing cases when we have the option of using a better test. </p></speech>

Some countries may have chosen to use a filter with a smaller pore size.  We know that antigen testing will let more infectious people through than the PCR test.  So some people make policy decisions about which filter they are going to use.  We are using the higher grade filter and some countries may choose to use the lower grade filter.  It is a question of which filter one chooses to use.</p></speech>

I also thank them for the expertise and commitment that they have shown to this country over the past 14 months.  Their guidance and advice has undoubtedly saved lives.  The vaccine roll-out, walk-in tests and the PCR tests have been really well done so I compliment the team.</p> <p>  It is important that we take the advice of experts, especially experts who have responsibility here at home.  It is important that we also represent constituents in protecting their health but also to protect their livelihoods.  What we are trying to do here is take the expert advice and see how that can be applied so that we can have that successful outcome for the public.</p> <p>  In every piece of tested equipment or process there are always cheap varieties, which may not be accurate or reliable, and one can go to much more expensive highly reliable and accurate pieces of equipment and test processes.

There is checking of each batch that comes in, checking of batches of antigen tests against variants to ensure their performance is not compromised, membership of external quality assurance schemes and so forth.  We have very detailed near-patient testing guidelines which should be applied in any setting where the tests are considered for use.</p></speech>

We had experts before the committee last week who talked about Croke Park being a possibility, with 80,000 people in it in September with the use of antigen testing.  It was mentioned earlier, I believe it was by Professor Keogan, that a 5,000 person event took 12 people over 12-hour shifts to try to apply antigen testing.  Logistically, the issue that must be considered with hundreds of thousands of people going through an airport or 70,000 or 80,000 people going to Croke Park or Electric Picnic is what can go wrong in those situations if it is not controlled properly.</p></speech>

This is massively labour intensive.  It is very manual.  Each test takes 15 to 20 minutes to perform.  There generally is no space to have people sit there and wait for the results.  In most settings, people come in, are swabbed, one does the record keeping and so forth and then people receive their results by text.  It is a massive logistical undertaking to antigen test a large number of people.</p></speech>

It is not as simple as just carrying out an antigen test on one person.  I have heard the references that it is easy on one person, but when the numbers start to increase it becomes more difficult.  That might create a situation where there might be a slippage in standards or a slippage in how that is managed.  One can understand how that might happen.  In terms of the overall numbers, I heard the witness say that antigen testing does and can have a role, especially in controlled situations such as the universities.  How could we best use it to complement PCR testing in terms of aviation and trying to assist people who have lost their jobs or cannot work in aviation at present?  Is there a role for it there?</p></speech>

A lot of the things people are thinking about are serial testings in particular settings in order to pick up an outbreak early and then move in and manage that outbreak.  It is an utterly different type of circumstance from the one-off test we are discussing.  To give an example, if one gathers 60,000 people together, there is another problem with the one-off testing.  If one gathers 60,000 people in Croke Park at a higher prevalence than we have - we expect that by September prevalence will be lower - so let us say 150 per 100,000, with the test sensitivity at 70%, which is generous to antigen testing, as opposed to 99.8%, one can expect about 90 infections in that crowd.  Perhaps the test will pick up 40 of them, miss about 20 and would also generate about 120 false positives.  If the specificity is worse, there would be more of those.  The first thing to mention is that of those 90 people, perhaps 40 or 50 of them would be symptomatic.  They should not even be considering going to see a match.  They should not be going for antigen testing.  They should be calling their GP and seeking a PCR test.  We are now down to 45 asymptomatic people.  In that 60,000 people that we are considering to rapid antigen test, there are 45 with asymptomatic infection.  We might detect one in two of those with a rapid antigen test.  We will find 22 or 23 cases and let 22 or 23 potentially infectious people into the event.  They may not be as infectious as the symptomatic people, but they are potentially infectious people.  There will also be 120 other people.  We get five false positives for every case we are detecting.  It is not a big thing-----</p></speech>

She was quite strong in support of the use of antigen testing as an additional tool, not a substitute or replacement for any other testing methods such as PCR testing.  We are again quoting another eminent professor in a senior position.  As a committee, we need to be respected for our work in responding to the comments and contributions from people in these positions throughout the country.  What is the response to Professor Mary Horgan's widely covered remarks this morning on "Morning Ireland"?</p></speech>

Ultimately, that is what we are doing.  We are following the data and the evidence.</p><p>We all want things to move faster than they are moving at the moment, we all want to get back to a level of normality where we can forget about Covid and about the pandemic.  However, ultimately, as advisors, as people who look at the evidence as it is published, assess it and liaise with colleagues in the HSE like Professors Cormican and Keogan who look at the real-world utility of these tests, we must be guided by the evidence and the science.  Throughout this pandemic we have tried to be guided by the science.  As Professor Horgan noted this morning, ultimately that is what we are all aspiring to do.</p></speech>

However, it seems we have different levels of science because we have EU states recognising the utility of antigen tests.  Upwards of 36 antigen tests have been recognised by the European Commission as being accepted for EU states.  That is one bar of science that must be acceded to by those tests and which has been.  What I am hearing in this committee meeting is we have another bar which is the real-world testing of those in particular fields or sectors.  What is different about those two tests?  How does an antigen test meet a bar to be accepted by the Commission but then does not meet a bar to be accepted by the Irish State for use in a particular sector?  There was a comment earlier about carbonated beverages impacting on the results of antigen tests, saying they can be befouled by such.  What piece of academic research is that based on because I had never heard that before?</p></speech>

PCR will detect more of them.  I will go back again to the filter issue.  The filter one uses with an antigen test will let more through than the filter one uses with a PCR test.  In any particular application people may choose to use one type of filter or the other but we have very clear evidence, from the work that has been done, the validation that has been done here, that if 100 people who are infected are tested with an antigen test, at most 60% to 65% will be detected and the other 35%, which would be detected by PCR, will not be detected.  Thus one chooses the filter one wants to use.  This is not a matter of opinion.  Every study I have seen done in any country will show that antigen testing will miss about a third of asymptomatic people who are likely to be infectious at the time.  People may have all sorts of opinions but I would pick up what Dr. Glynn says: what is the evidence?  Sometimes the evidence is very uncomfortable and sometimes I wish the evidence was different as well.  However, what we have to do is tell the committee what the evidence is.  If anyone can find publications by peer-reviewed scientists that show what I have just told the committee is wrong then I will change my opinion but I have tried and I cannot find them.</p></speech>

Obviously I would not be handling it without gloves if it had any biological material on it.  What I did to produce this this morning was put butter on it.  This is why self-testing is not acceptable for any sort of test-to-enable approach.  If one just puts on butter with no sample one gets a negative result.  The control line just tells one that diffusion has occurred.  It does not indicate there is any specimen in this test.  This is unlike a PCR test where one would get an invalid result if there is no ribonucleic acid, RNA, present.</p></speech>

It is widely publicised on the Internet that if this is done with diet coke one can get a false positive.  This was done with tonic water because it does not stain down below and this looks like a positive.

I agree with Senator Buttimer about the combative nature of this issue. There is a really unfortunate narrative that has grown up around this that people are completely opposed to antigen testing and people who think it is the best thing since sliced bread.  Neither of those positions is the truth.  It is a question of using it in appropriate settings as one more intervention.  There is no reason in the world we would not want antigen testing to be used where it brings an additional level of safety and reduces risk, whether that is in aviation, sport or anywhere else.  Ultimately, we have a responsibility to make sure that we also give advice based on science and that we do not say that an event or activity that is otherwise unsafe at a given point in time, given the prevailing epidemiological situation, should go ahead just because there is antigen testing, if antigen testing or any other testing or other modality does not make up for the risk that is posed by that event or activity.  We have got to weigh all of those things up at a given point in time and give the advice as it stands, but of course we will change our advice.  We would love to see evidence that these tests have improved and that there is real-world evidence behind them so that they can bring the conditions and we can all move on.</p></speech>

Any experience I ever had when he was Chair of the Oireachtas health committee is that his recollection is exactly the same as mine.  It was always an experience I enjoyed and relished.  I hope that we gave good evidence and supported the work of the committee during that time.  That is exactly as I remember it.</p> <p>  In broad terms, our ambition is to find ourselves in a situation where two things happen: one, we get the level of disease in this country down to a level that we think we can safely resume activity.  So far, we have been making good progress as a country in relation to that through the work that people have been doing.  If anything, we are seeing an improved situation epidemiologically.  We are taking confidence from that, but perhaps not getting ahead of ourselves too much given that there is still potential for things to go wrong.  That is not dissuading us at the moment from staying the course that we are on, which is really encouraging.</p> <p>  We are getting people vaccinated at a very high rate in terms of the acceptance of the vaccination and the numbers.  The HSE is getting through a very impressive programme of vaccination that is giving people increasing protection.  That is the strategy.  It is working.  We want to be in a situation whereby we can see the economy and society in all of its manifestations returning when it is appropriate and safe to do so without a dependence on any form of testing.</p> <p>  This is what the estimates of the green light that we spoke about is all about: that we will not find ourselves in a situation whereby something is unsafe from our point of view but is now rendered safe simply through the use of antigen tests.  We have not seen any evidence that would give us assurance that we think something that was inherently unsafe can now be rendered safe because people are using antigen testing.  The premise, not of what Senator Buttimer said, but a lot of what is being said in general terms by people, is that we would use it in these green light situations and that we would be able to resume a named activity, whatever it might be, if only we were using antigen testing.  That is an implied use in a green light way for asymptomatic populations.  There is no published evidence at all in that regard.  In fact, very few studies have looked at this question in any setting and those that have not produced encouraging results.</p></speech>

NIAC has looked at the question already and the evidence so far has not given it cause to conclude, but we can anticipate a conclusion.  There have been a number of studies, one in Spain and one in the UK, that may well change the situation on the mixing of vaccine doses.  The term used is heterologous vaccination.  It has not as yet been recommended in this country.  It is really important now to people in the 60 to 69 age group and any other people who are in other age groups that have received it.  I have a daughter who is 20 years of age who had her first dose and is due a second dose of AstraZeneca.  I am quite happy to recommend that she gets it.  That is our position.</p> <p>  On the related question on boosters, some element of that is something that we will be looking at through NIAC over the course of the coming weeks.  It is a very good question that Senator Buttimer has raised.  We think there will be some role to play in that regard but we want to take a careful look at the evidence as we move through to the optimistic situation whereby we can look to August or September when the great majority of people who are currently the target of our vaccination programme will have been vaccinated.</p></speech>

I had to move while the committee was sitting.  I welcome Dr. Holohan, Dr. Glynn and all of the team who are here today.  I thank them for their role and efforts in the past 12 to 15 months or so.</p> <p>  I very much take the view that rapid antigen testing is a cheap, fast, uncomplicated and most important of all, safe way, of testing people before they travel.  We have seen approximately 17 European countries embrace this.  If one takes a PCR test three days before departure, in the three-day period between testing and boarding the flight one will come into contact with hundreds of door handles, flush hundreds of loos, turn on taps, hand driers and multiple items.  There are multiple opportunities for an individual to pick up the Covid virus elsewhere.  While the PCR test is considered the gold standard, it does not capture everything.  It is rather akin to being breathalysed a few hours before one goes to the local pub: it does not capture all the information and it does not capture the most salient information in terms of antigen levels at the point of departure.</p><p> Testing in the field has been mentioned but why would we not consider a parallel regime, not a competing regime, of antigen testing to capture the most up to date data before someone boards a flight?</p></speech>

If I am due to take a flight in 72 hours' time, and the Deputy is absolutely right that I could pick up the virus in the next 72 hours, but if I am swabbed right now, go out that door and I am immediately exposed to the virus, and pick it up then it will take three to four days for that virus to replicate inside me before it is detectable by any test, and probably longer before it is detectable by a rapid antigen test.  So the difficulty is that I will have taken my flight and arrived at my destination before I am in any way likely to be detectable.  So this is why we have this caution around how frequently one tests and it depends on all kinds of things like prevalence.  It has not been tested.  There has not been a proper study done but I can say a rapid antigen definitively would not pick up an exposure that occurred after my swabbing.  It may detect an exposure that occurred beforehand.  It is quite unlikely, given the evidence that we have, that being swabbed for PCR up to 72 hours beforehand could be improved upon by adding an antigen test up to 48 hours before I board the flight.</p></speech>

The problem is that it would make things more difficult.  The reason that people are promoting it is as an alternative.  Of course, if one had the PCR and an antigen test it would not make things less safe.  Nobody thinks so, I think.</p></speech>

I will quote the Assistant Professor of virology at UCD, Dr. Gerald Barry who said that it is an "absolute no-brainer" and "I cannot understand why we are not looking at this, explaining it to people, teaching them how to use it and rolling it out on a mass basis".  I think there is an overwhelming school of scientific thought and, indeed, Professor Ferguson has completed a report for the Government and  recommended implementation.</p> <p>  The witnesses have suggested that in-field evaluations need to be done.  There have been a number of matches over the weekend where low attendance was allowed and NPHET is examining a number of situations.  In terms of testing passengers on a flight, three or four weeks ago I suggested here that we would use the interim period between now and 19 July to test passengers on an inbound and outbound flight between parts of Ireland and the UK to allow for antigen testing to be used as a test case.  In terms of advancing that, just like NPHET has advanced matches and concerts at the weekend, who needs to give a green light?  Is there pushback at any level be it departmental, by NIAC, NPHET or the Government?  Has NPHET sought a test?  Has the matter been discussed?  Has there been pushback on doing a test on a flight?

The reason that matches are happening all over the country now and 100 people are in a position to attend is because we provided advice that we believed, because of the epidemiological and vaccination status, we thought it was safe for us to cautiously but ambitiously move on to that level of easing of restrictions without the dependence on testing.  So there is not a requirement on testing applying in any of those tests.  People are free now to go to a match.  We give public health advice.   </p></speech>

They are test events to see how life will progress over the summer and autumn months.  What is the delay in having a test case, testing a flight and using an antigen test on passengers flying over and back between Britain between now and 19 July?</p></speech>

We have looked at a number of different publications.  The recently publication by the Infectious Disease Society of America was referred to, which talks about these tests not being reliable in a prevalence of less than 5%.  That is what our data is telling us.  We cannot rely on the test at this low level of prevalence so I am just not clear what one would be testing, and testing one flight in that situation, where the probability, on a flight of 150 people, of anybody being infected is very, very low.</p></speech>

Where and when and how will it take place, and who needs to sanction same?  Between now and 19 July we want to see this tested and proven in the scientific field, and implemented, when people get back on planes again.</p></speech>

We think it will be appropriate and safe for individuals who are vaccinated, and who take all of the other precautions that we recommended here and in whatever country they are travelling to, to travel to other countries and areas of low incidence, where the use of the digital green cert and so on supports that travel.  We think that will be safe without the need for PCR testing.  So in that situation, to support that, there is no need for any validation.  Without the need for any form of testing, I should say, there is no need for validation because we think it is safe and appropriate because the disease incidence is low.</p></speech>

I am pointing to the fact that to support the use of antigen testing in other settings, other than those where we know they have been established to be effective and reliable, we would need further validation studies to be carried out.  That is the position as advocated by all national bodies.</p></speech>

As many as 17 EU countries have embraced antigen testing on a scientific basis.  These days there is a huge sharing of information over and back whether it be the European Medical Agency and engaging with NPHET's counterparts in other countries.  We need to embrace the idea that there is scientific advice and validation in other countries.  There are countries that are willing to fully embrace antigen testing.  The fact remains that on 19 July when people go to book flights they might get their &euro;40 return bargain basement air ticket with Ryanair but it will cost them hundreds to get tested, which will be a barrier to international travel.  Antigen testing is safe and cheap.</p></speech>

We are talking about scientifically qualified people doing this.  This is not TikTok, Facebook or anything like that.

That is the realm in which we want antigen testing and we want it to co-exist with PCR to make flights safe and affordable.</p></speech>

We do not think antigen testing is viable enough for the reasons that we have already set out.  If people are vaccinated and follow the other public health measures then we think it will be safe for airline travel to resume without the reliance on that testing.  So the question again is for what purpose would that validation exercise be done at this point in time.</p></speech>

Will the same apply to fully vaccinated people when they fly over and back to the UK from 19 July?  I mean that they will not be required to either get a test or isolate but if people are not vaccinated they will still require a PCR test.  Dr. Holohan has signalled that he agrees with what has been proposed by the Government.</p> <p>  In terms of the UK, the common travel area is hugely important to us.  At the moment one could have to quarantine up to 14 days with tests at five days and ten days.  What will happen on 19 July for travel between here and the UK, which is vital to us in terms of connectivity?</p></speech>

The  disease is increasing in incidence.  Dr. Glynn gave an outline earlier on.  It has doubled in less than a week in many parts of the country.  Infection is rising, in terms of its incidence, quickly.  Over 90% of the spread of that infection is now attributed to this new Delta variant, which makes it relatively unique in comparison with other countries so we are genuinely concerned about that.  It would be impossible to predict where we will find ourselves in five weeks time in respect of where the UK will be.  I think that the UK itself is concerned.  It is pausing some of its own measures for that particular reason and I am sure that members are aware of that.</p></speech>

It is important that we consider a field evaluation, as the delegates are saying, but do so between now and 19 July.  There is no point in delaying.  The Covid situation is improving week on week.  Vaccination is going really well but we do not know what circumstances will be like in the autumn.  For people to travel internationally, we need a regime that is cheap and safe.</p></speech>

It is very much appreciated by all the Irish people.  This is the transport committee and it obviously has a role to play in trying to get Irish aviation, in particular, back up and running, bearing in mind the impact on sectors such as tourism and hospitality in general.  I am aware that all these areas are areas in which Dr. Holohan sees a risk.  Last Christmas, I am sure there was a reason NPHET wanted nobody going anywhere, nobody doing anything and everybody staying at home but, thankfully, through the efforts of the Irish people and NPHET's direction, we are now in a much happier and better place.  I hope Dr. Holohan can clarify, for the avoidance of any doubt, the position for anybody who is fully vaccinated after 19 July.  Could the witnesses clarify exactly what "fully vaccinated" means?  Are they talking about two weeks after having received the second dose?  Does "fully vaccinated" mean an individual can travel without the need for a test regardless of whether the journey is inbound or outbound?  While other countries may have their own rules, is Dr. Holohan saying people who are fully vaccinated will not need any PCR or antigen test for entering and exiting Ireland?</p></speech>

I can sense from NPHET that it really has to rely on evidence that antigen testing is reliable.  If it wants to accept antigen testing as valid, it will want a study but, if I am correct, Dr. Holohan is saying that if the time were taken to do a study, it would almost be 19 July anyway.</p></speech>

Their concern was that antigen tests were being written off.  Now Dr. Holohan is saying there will not be a need for antigen tests from 19 July onwards and that any study that could be relied upon would take longer than the period up to that date.</p> <p>  I became a member of this committee only recently.  The committee has had meetings on antigen testing in the past few months.  There was one last week with Dr. Michael Mina, whom I believe is arranging a seminar or webinar next week to which the witnesses have been invited.  Would Dr. Holohan be willing to meet Dr. Mina's team?  It has asked me to ask whether the witnesses are in a position to meet it and even explain to it that what they are saying is that PCR and antigen tests will not be required exiting and entering Ireland from 19 July.</p></speech>

They have had their incomes and lives decimated in the past 15 months along with many others in other sectors.  They would love to be able to meet, if only for half an hour or 45 minutes, if possible.  I hope it might be possible for Dr. Holohan to meet them, obviously in the same way he is meeting us in that he would not have to travel to meet them.  Could Dr. Holohan look as favourably as possible on that request?  It would be very much appreciated by the entire aviation industry, many of whom I am sure are watching today.</p> <p>  Much of what I wanted to ask or might have asked has been asked or covered but I have another question on PCR and antigen testing.  Will what Dr. Houlihan outlined apply to every country or will there be countries whose passengers will still be subject to mandatory hotel quarantining?  Will there still be passengers from areas of risk around the world whom we will be restricting?  Is Dr. Holohan saying people in Ireland will be able to book flights to anywhere they want to go on the website of Ryanair, Aer Lingus or any other airline without needing a test to leave Ireland or to come back?  Is the arrangement only for the EU?  What are the implications of travel to different countries?</p></speech>

The duration is slightly different for different vaccines, as members know.  For Moderna, full vaccination is two weeks after the second dose, which means six weeks from the first dose.  For Pfizer, it is one week after the second dose, which means five weeks after the first dose.  For AstraZeneca, it is two weeks after the second dose, for the purpose of travel, at least.  We have a lower level in respect of some of the activities within the country but we are just talking about travel now.  For the Janssen vaccine, full vaccination is two weeks after the single dose.  There is a slightly different period for each vaccine.  I should have pointed out the position on where there is PCR evidence of infection within the past nine months &mdash; in other words, evidence of recovery.  For many countries, that will involve a sizeable percentage of the population.  Up to 10% of the population of this country could have PCR-demonstrated evidence of infection.  All of those criteria are the qualifying criteria.  Unvaccinated people will still have to go through the testing arrangements.  We would need to retain an ability to examine what is happening and the possibility of an increase in the rate of infection that requires us to take action.  Unfortunately in this regard, our nearest neighbour has seen a surge in infection caused by a genuine variant of concern.  The measures put in place at EU level make provision for some of the arrangements and "emergency breaks", as they are called, to be applied if such concerns arise.</p></speech>

As more evidence becomes available, more tests may be added.  Some may be removed from the list.  This is a living document and it will move with the science.  As regards whether antigen testing will be accepted for entry into Ireland, that is a Government decision, but many member states have not declared that they will accept antigen testing.  It is not for me to say whether the antigen tests on the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety list will be accepted.</p> <p>  I refer to the question on validation.  Reference was made to costs.  It is really important to be aware that although the reagents to do an antigen test are cheap, the technical scientific time is expensive.  The cost of PCR tests is actually decreasing to much closer to the cost of getting a professional to do an antigen test.</p></speech>

When will we have clarity on distancing requirements for school transport for the coming year?  School buses have been cancelled in Moyvane in north Kerry and pupils are literally being left on the side of the road.</p> <p>  Dr. Holohan referred to a matter relating to football matches.  As all present are aware, trial events have been taking place but football matches that we lost out on are taking place all over Europe.  In advance of summer championship matches, will we be in a position to accelerate the percentage of people who are allowed to attend matches during the summer?</p></speech>

Our original plan, going back to the advice we provided to the Government in April, was that we did not foresee any outdoor gatherings taking place during June.  As a result of how things went for us, we decided to bring that forward and now up to 100 people can attend not just a match, but any outdoor gathering during the month of June.  We will increase that further in July on the assumption that things stay as they are and we will continue to grow from there without a dependence on antigen testing or anything else because we think the disease incidence is low enough to enable us to do that and increasingly we are getting more people vaccinated.  We will continue to tell people that if they are not vaccinated, maybe they should stay away from matches, but if they are vaccinated, they can regard it as something safe that they can do.  I was at a match last Saturday evening in those circumstances.  It is something that is safe for us to resume.</p> <p>  I ask the Deputy to remind me of his first question.</p></speech>

It is not.  As we move through the summer, so long as we stay on track epidemiologically and things do not go wrong in terms of the Delta variant or some surge in infection that we do not want to see happening, we will continue to increase during July and August.  If we get to the end of August and we have not seen a challenge, we think that at that stage we will have sufficiently high levels of vaccination - it remains to be seen whether we get the levels of vaccination we hope to get by then - to be able to resume much closer to normal activity.  The sector itself will then put in place arrangements in that regard.</p></speech>

Most of Europe is continuing to move towards an encouraging situation.  Incidence is falling in many European countries.  The UK is the main exception to that, although not the only one, due to the variant over there.  That is why we are particularly concerned about that and are watching it closely.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about social distancing.  We will be looking at that as part of a general consideration of the evidence as the summer progresses.  If we think the circumstances are right in terms of transmission and vaccination for us to ease any of these measures, including social distancing, that will be considered.  We understand the impact it has on school transport, as the Deputy mentioned, or the impact it might have on the resumption of third level education-----</p></speech>

We hope that will continue as we move down through the age groups and the further we can get the safer we will be.  That is the message we want to give on vaccination.  If one is called to register, one should register and if one is called for a vaccination one should turn up and get vaccinated.  We have safe and effective vaccines and we are encouraging people to come forward for them.  We will not put a ceiling on the progress that can be made.  There are questions to address on the possible use of these vaccines on the under-16s and we will look at all of those questions in the context of-----</p></speech>

As a committee, we are duty-bound to raise the issues.  What has come out of today's meeting is that the committee will follow up on requesting that a pilot scheme be set up to see the role that antigen testing could play in aviation.  I understand that the objective is that everyone is fully vaccinated and that there is no requirement for testing.  However, there still will be people who are unvaccinated.  There is a body of work to be done on that and we will follow up on that with the Departments of Transport and of Health.  We wish to acknowledge the phenomenal work NPHET has done.  It is fair to say Dr. Holohan has been the guardian of public health in a good way with Covid but hopefully, we are now coming out of the pandemic.  Aviation is a critical sector for us in Ireland with 140,000 jobs supported by it.  We want to see how rapid antigen testing can assist in that process.  It will in no way replace PCR testing, which is the gold standard, but will be complementary to it.  I thank Dr. Holohan and his colleagues for making themselves available today.</p></speech>

We want to see a safe resumption of airline travel as early as possible that is unfettered by testing or any other requirements.  That is where we want to be and I am sure I speak for the entirety of NPHET when I say that.  I can certainly speak for the people in the committee room today.  That is where we want to be.  We have no predisposition against any test or technology that will help us in getting there and that is where we want to be-----</p></speech>

I know it has not been ideal from the committee's point of view in terms of how we would normally be present so we apologise for that.  Hopefully we have been able to make ourselves understood.</p></speech>

We thank Dr. Holohan for taking the time to come to our committee, which he has done previously.  There have been elements of the discussion that have been robust but people's views are genuinely held.  We thank Dr. Holohan for the phenomenal work he has done and we wish him well into the future.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Holohan, Dr. Glynn, Professor Nolan, Dr. de Gascun, Professor Keogan and Professor Cormican for attending today's engagement with the committee.  We look forward to further engagement.</p></speech>
