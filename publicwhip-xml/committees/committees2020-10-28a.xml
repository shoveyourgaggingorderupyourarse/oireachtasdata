I thank him for agreeing to come before the committee.  The format of the meeting is that the witnesses appearing remotely from outside the Leinster House complex will be invited to make a brief opening statement and this will be followed by a question-and-answer session.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise Professor FitzGerald who is giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to him.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  If the witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction.  I also wish to advise them that any submission or opening statements made to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile telephones or switch them to flight mode.  They interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  They have an adverse effect on television coverage and web streaming.  I invite Professor FitzGerald to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am speaking in a personal capacity as the Climate Change Advisory Council has not yet had time to formally consider the draft legislation.  When we do so next month, we will write to the committee.</p> <p>  I welcome the ambition and serious commitment to tackle climate change underpinning the Bill.  I also welcome the members' deliberations as I feel there are aspects of the Bill that could do with greater clarity.  </p> <p>  My comments today are confined to the issues of direct relevance to the work of the council rather than over the range of the Bill.</p> <p>  In singling out particular elements for comment, I am concerned that this important legislation should offer mechanisms that would be practicable to operate and to ensure that, in the detail of the Bill, we do not tie ourselves up in knots or bring about unintended consequences.</p> <p>  I have five key points.  On the national targets for climate change, EU legislation is the key framework within which we define our national targets and how we successfully pursue ambitious climate action.  While the EU defines our minimum national target, Ireland may choose to set a more ambitious one.  I welcome the Government's increased ambition reflected in the Bill.  </p> <p>  The EU is planning to raise our ambition as EU citizens for 2030 and to define the 2050 objective for the EU as net zero emissions.  The EU legislation could be very helpful to us.</p> <p>  In the separation of policy-making and policy advisory roles, the major strategic decision on the scale of our national climate goals for 2030 and 2050 should be determined by the Oireachtas in legislation.  We need a clear and unambiguous definition of the targets for 2030 and 2050.  The role of the council is to develop policy advice and carbon budgets within those clear parameters.  </p> <p>  The council has recommended a split national target for 2050, net zero emissions of long-lived gases and a separate target for biogenic methane.  The targets set by the Oireachtas should be consistent with evolving EU legislation and informed by the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC.  The council will then work within that framework.</p> <p>  The carbon budgets which will be adopted by Ireland will have very far-reaching consequences.  They should be based on detailed research and analysis that stands up to independent scrutiny.  That will require a much better resourced secretariat, and the time to do their work properly.</p> <p>  The expected timeline for development of carbon budgets is not practical, given experience in other jurisdictions which demonstrates the need to mobilise significant resources for the task.  </p> <p>  Drawing up carbon budgets requires the use of detailed models to explore the implications of different pathways and policy interventions.  A memorandum of understanding guaranteeing the council's access to the necessary skills, expertise and models in Departments, Government agencies and academia should be put in place before Christmas.</p> <p>  In developing the council's advice on carbon budgets, it would be desirable that the Department and other bodies that will have to implement the budgets should participate in the research undertaken by the council to ensure they fully understand the scientific basis for the council's recommendations.</p> <p>  The Bill should seek to identify the general set of principles which shall be taken into account in carbon budgets rather than listing a long list of possible issues, which might or might not be relevant.  The list of 25 criteria which the council may or shall have regard to in making its deliberations is lengthy and would make council deliberations very difficult.  It could also leave the council's advice exposed to legal challenge.  </p> <p>  The council should be required to frame its recommendations taking full account of the legislated national targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as I have indicated.  However, it is essential to retain criterion (e) that would require the council to consider the cost effectiveness of the policies.  Its exclusion will make it extremely difficult for the council to make recommendations that were either sensible or workable.</p> <p>  On climate justice, under the Bill one of the criteria the council should take into account is climate justice.  The council has advised that climate justice and related issues are very important and these should be addressed in the implementation of mitigation and adaption actions.  However, while I believe that the council may make recommendations on this issue, the details of these distributional issues are ultimately for the Oireachtas to consider and resolve.  I would be concerned, if the legislation is not carefully drafted, that recommendations by the council could end up in the courts rather than being determined by the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  Regarding adaptation, climate resilience is an essential component of proposed national objectives for 2050.  There is a danger that adaptation risks do not receive adequate attention if they are only considered once every five years as part of the adaptation framework rather than being part of the normal process of drawing up plans and climate governance.</p> <p>  On the composition of the council, I welcome the intent of the Bill to ensure a more diverse range of experience and expertise on the council.  In addition to any formal qualifications, members need to be people who have qualities of judgment and independence, can make forthright and well-grounded contributions, are open-minded and listen to others.  It would also be valuable to have international expertise at the table.</p> <p>  While I acknowledge the Bill's intentions in setting out a list of expertise required of council members, the outcome could be exclusionary in practice.  For example, Greta Thunberg probably would not qualify on these criteria for membership.  It also makes no reference to expertise in adaptation resilience.  A more general formulation in the Bill itself, with more detail possibly fleshed out in the explanatory memorandum, would give some desirable flexibility.</p> <p>  The council needs to be strategic in achieving its statutory functions of advising Government on climate policy and in preparing carbon budgets.  There are a number of additional tasks and processes implied in the Bill that, unless carefully considered and sequenced, could overload the council and dilute the impact of its work.  I thank members for this opportunity to talk to them.</p></speech>

I have specific questions on some of the sections and I will be specific regarding some of the technicalities.  Does Professor FitzGerald believe that if section 3(1) was to be amended to state &quot;achieve a transition by at least the end of 2050&quot; it would take into account the changing nature of European targets?  On the make-up of the council, can he suggest any amended wording that will facilitate a broader range of expertise?  Does Professor FitzGerald have any views on whether we should have a gender quota in that section in respect of the council?  Does he have a view on the area of the <i>ex officio</i>members and can he suggest an amendment to the wording in that regard?  Also, does he believe that interim targets other than for 2050 are required?</p></speech>

Perhaps Senator O'Reilly could clarify that.</p> <p>  On the make-up of the council, I think that-----</p></speech>

It states that the State shall pursue the transition to a climate-resilient and climate-neutral economy by the end of the year 2050.  I am asking whether we should change "pursue" to "achieve" and "by the end of the year 2050" to "by at least the end of the year 2050".</p></speech>

There should be no doubt on that.  Certainly, that is how the council would interpret it.  Clarity on that would therefore be helpful, but what we said about the split target should also be remembered.</p> <p>  As for the make-up of the council, a general principle-----</p></speech>

We will see if we can fix it.</p> <p>  Could Professor FitzGerald speak again and we will see how it sounds at our end?</p></speech>

We cannot see Professor FitzGerald but we can hear him well now.  He might go back over his most recent remarks in answer-----</p></speech>

I am not a lawyer so I will leave that to lawyers to work out.<br/><br/>As for the composition of the council, I think we take gender balance for granted.  Whether a gender quota needs to be put in place is for the committee to decide, but the council is unbalanced in that regard at present.  I do not need to say it; it is obvious.  The <i>ex officio</i>members have been very helpful.  We have been able to command their resources, like having the SEAI at the table.  When we say we want something, they deliver, but that is not necessarily a reason.  I do not have strong views on this.  It is essential for the EPA to be at the table because it houses our secretariat.  I felt Met &Eacute;ireann would be valuable in bringing to the table a collective scientific experience on the science of climate change but I will leave that to the committee.<br/><br/>I have forgotten the Senator's final question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2020102800002#C00800"><p>It was on whether we should have interim targets in the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2020102800002#C00900"><p>It is essential to have interim targets.  We cannot go along for 30 years and then find we have done a botched job and have not got there.  That is what carbon budgets are for, whether or not they take the form of legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  That will set every five years a target so we will know if we are meeting the target and if we are failing, so interim targets are important.  Given the EU's position and the focus in this regard, we need to define a 2030 target as well.  That will then be enshrined in the carbon budgets.  The carbon budgets will be consistent with that.  Carbon budgets basically provide the interim targets.  In forming those targets, however, we need the Oireachtas to say what the interim target is for 2030.  Then, within that, we can define what the targets should be for 2025, but the 2030 and 2050 targets have to come from the Oireachtas and must be clear.</p></speech>

Professor FitzGerald might correct me if I am wrong on that.</p> <p>  The other question I wanted to ask Professor FitzGerald is whether he feels we need language in the Bill to ensure that the carbon budgets are therefore - and it sounds like this is what he is saying - consistent with the target for 2050, and if there is any other interim target.  Is that what he is saying?</p></speech>

What I am saying is that the Oireachtas enacts the 2050 target and a more ambitious target for 2030 and we then take that into account.  I think the phrase in the Bill refers to Government economic policy or environmental policy, but the way we would interpret that is that if the Oireachtas says this is the target for 2030 and this is the target for 2050, we will then set out carbon budgets consistent with that.  It is for the Oireachtas, however, to be clear on the 2030 and 2050 targets.</p></speech>

Should they have a vote when it comes to deciding on the advice coming from the committee?  In addition, would Professor FitzGerald be happy to offer an opinion on the following?  He referred to the SEAI and how invaluable it was in the past and the fact the SEAI and the ESRI are no longer members of the council but that Met &Eacute;ireann and Teagasc are, Teagasc being there to represent agricultural exporters.  Does Professor FitzGerald think there should be a difference between the <i>ex officio</i>members and the other members?  Furthermore, as for how the advisory council comes to decisions to get right that balance between the science and all the other interests that are listed in the make-up of the council, should more weight be given to the scientific side of it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2020102800002#C01400"><p>The way it works with the <i>ex officio</i>members is that they do not pursue a line.  They are members of the council.  They do not say, &quot;The Teagasc line on this is X.&quot;  They contribute to overall decision-making.  I certainly do not think the way it has worked in the past five years has in any way infringed our independence.  The expertise they have brought has been valuable.  I know the director of the ESRI never wanted to be on the council.  I was in the ESRI at the time, so the committee can ask the ESRI but I suspect it does not want to be there <i>ex officio</i>.  All I can say is that until now our independence has not in any way been affected by the <i>ex officio</i>nature of their being there.<br/><br/>As for the scientific advice, our job as a council is to advise on policy.  We have relied on the EPA and other public bodies.  We take the climate science as given.  The Oireachtas will define what the targets are for 2050 and 2030.  Where the science becomes important is in how, in particular in agriculture, our understanding of the science has been important in influencing our recommendation on a dual target for 2050.  We have had access to the scientific advice, but having a range of expertise on the council makes sense, as does gender balance on the council, which one would take for granted.</p></speech>

I wish to ask about the climate justice aspect of his presentation.  I have two questions.  I am very glad he raised the fact that the climate council will take into account climate justice.  He reminds us how the council has been at pains to say how vital climate justice is in reassuring us on a just transition.</p><p>In raising this, Professor FitzGerald rightly points out the distributional issues.  That is despite the council taking into account that it is the Oireachtas that will consider and resolve these.  That could be open to interpretation.  While all of us on the committee want to rise above politics, and there is a need for the Bill to rise above politics, there is a gap between the council's aspiration taking climate justice into account and the Oireachtas considering and resolving that.  We do not want climate justice becoming a hostage to fortune.  How do we close the gap and seal it?</p><p> On a just transition, does the Bill sufficiently demonstrate that we are mindful of our international responsibilities as we achieve our own targets.  It is almost like a Weight Watchers approach where one might make cuts somewhere to do something somewhere else and that might be detrimental to poorer countries, such as cobalt mining?</p></speech>

Our counterparts in Britain were talking about exactly this issue.  It is not clear cut.  Ultimately, the distributional issues are a matter for the Government or the Oireachtas.  For example, we have said on carbon taxation that if we are to make any progress on climate change we must raise the carbon tax but we have also said that there is evidence from 1992 from research by my then-colleague Sue Scott in the ESRI that people on low incomes, on the bottom 30% of distribution, would spend a higher proportion of their budget-----</p></speech>

However, it has negative effects on those on lower incomes.  We said those have to be addressed and there are different ways of doing that.  It could be by giving a carbon dividend of the same amount to everyone or one could use the welfare system.  We decided not to recommend which because we felt that was a matter for the Oireachtas.  However, we recommended that the Oireachtas and the Government do something about it.  In the last two budgets, the Governments chose a way of dealing with it.  It is appropriate for the Government and the Oireachtas to make the final decision on that.  It is our job to point out where the problem lies and the need to address it.</p> <p>  International responsibilities are an important issue.  I am not sure the Bill is the place to do it.  Our Danish counterparts have worked out what the appropriate carbon budget for Denmark will be out to 2050, thinking about climate justice and what Denmark owes the world, given past emissions and so on.  We should be conscious of our responsibilities to the rest of the world.  To some extent, we subcontract that to the EU.  As EU citizens, the EU is playing its role.  It is something where further research and reflection is required but I do not think that enshrining that in legislation where we do not know what the right approach or answer is makes sense.</p></speech>

He said that in addition to any formal qualifications, members need to be people who have qualities of judgement and independence.  Other witnesses have spoken of their experience of other advisory councils in other jurisdictions and many have spoken of the need to have a young voice on the council.  Depending on the age group one goes for, they might not possess those formal qualifications.  Someone could be <i>ex officio</i>, it depends on how one looks for these individuals.  How does Professor FitzGerald propose that we deal with ensuring a young voice or young voices are on the advisory council or in its work?</p></speech>

It is an expert council established to look at the evidence and provide expert advice so the first qualification for someone on the council needs to be their expertise.  There are people who have demonstrated their expertise who are much younger than I am and much younger than the average age of those on the council but it is not meant to be a representative body.  We are meant to assess the evidence and provide the advice.  That is the first consideration.  As currently constituted, it is not our job to go out and consult on our advice, but it is for the Government to consult on the advice we provide.  Up to Covid, I kept a pair of boots in the car because I spent a lot of time wandering around farms and bogs listening to people which probably is not part of my function but it reflects my elderly age, that I am retired and have the time to do it.  Particularly in agriculture, I have found that one learns a lot by talking to people.  It has guided our policy advice.  The members of the council are part time and they are there to spend a day or two a month on this.  We need to concentrate on understanding the science and the evidence on how best to deal with this and then draft the advice to Government.  I stress the need for expertise and people who can work together in drafting policy.  I anticipate the next council will have a younger average age than this one.</p></speech>

Is Professor FitzGerald aware of any sections in the Bill, as drafted, that would do that?  Does he suggest that we remove anything or is it a warning against being overly prescriptive about the council?</p></speech>

We will give written evidence on that after the council has considered it.  For example, where the Minister has to come back and consult with the council, if there is a large amount of toing and froing between us and we must comment on everything.  This has been a problem for the council which has a small secretariat, but also for the council itself where there are people serving in a part-time capacity, meeting once every one or two months and it must consider every policy document, with the Government producing an awful lot of documents.  One cannot give enough time to it.  It is about being focused on where the council can most make an impact.</p><p>Where it sees something in policy that it feels is appropriate or it wants to offer advice, the council has the freedom to intervene.  However, requiring us to intervene at every stage in, for example, the legislative process would not make sense.  There are one or two cases in the Bill that we will revert on where there is a danger of overload for the council.  It is not the intention of the Oireachtas to do so.  Rather, I believe it is being done by accident.  We must take the law seriously and follow it.  If it contains too many prescriptive measures about the stages we are on to be consulted on, it could pose problems.</p></speech>

I noted with interest his comment on the carbon budget and the amount of resources that will need to be invested to get it right.  He spoke about possibly doing some preparatory work on that now.  Will he expand on that?  Could any other preparatory work be done, perhaps by Departments, to ensure that we can get off to a quick start once we get through the legislative process and the Bill is ready to be enacted?</p></speech>

To us, it looks like it would probably take a year once the team was in place.  I specifically suggested a memorandum of understanding to get us all looking at the models before Christmas so that we could start laying out pathways and questions.</p> <p>  Something else that could be done now would be to recruit the team of people who will do the work, those with the relevant expertise in modelling and so on.  Recruiting people, particularly in the context of Covid, takes a significant time and it could be three months before a team is in place.  Taking action now, that is, before the legislation is enacted, to put in place the team that will do the job would speed up the process.</p> <p>  It is difficult to assess exactly what resources will be required until we see the final roles of the council and the Department under the carbon budget.  If we are to define the carbon budgets, we must understand what the implications, costs and so on will be at a sectoral level.  It will take time.  I believe New Zealand is deploying a team of 28 people, which seems thoroughly excessive for a country the same size as Ireland.  According to someone from the council who spoke at the seminar I attended this morning, Denmark's team has 22 people.  We have four.  There needs to be a substantial expansion of resources in advance.  Even if all of the resources were available and we were starting now, it would still take the better part of a year to produce carbon budgets.</p> <p>  Given the legislation, I envisage the carbon budget being from 2021 to 2025.  A year may have played out before the budget is in place.  In drawing it up, one would take that into account.  We should be taking action now before the carbon budget is enacted.  Some actions are starting to be implemented under the budget.  None of this prevents urgent policy action from being take to tackle climate change now.  We do not have to wait for, and should not wait for, the carbon budget.  Doing this the first time will be complicated and a learning process.  Given that carbon budgets will be enshrined in law, we must get this right.  With the national budget, there is legislation on the night of the budget and there is a great deal of preparation because one must be sure one is right.  Once the carbon budget is laid out, the Government will have to consult the various sectors.  It will be improved by talking to and learning from people about where they see particular obstacles or opportunities.  Getting all of this right will be difficult the first time round, but it is an important process.</p></speech>

If he does not have the details with him now, a written response will be fine.</p> <p>  I read the Bill again last night and focused on the section on the role of local authorities.  It reminded me of how Cork County Council published a climate action plan in 2019 when I was a member of it.  That focused on adaptation measures, though, with very little in the way of mitigation.  Should the Bill place greater obligations on local authorities in terms of how they achieve their adaptation and mitigation measures?  Since local authorities are major landowners or have a remit over large areas of land, could they be obligated to implement more nature-based solutions?  Given that they also run car parks, what about electric vehicle recharging stations?  Could there be stronger obligations?  The Bill requires authorities to produce climate action plans, including mitigation measures.  While this might address the matter, it has not been the experience to date.</p> <p>  Will Professor FitzGerald flesh out another point?  He felt that the 25 elements that the Government should have regard to were too many.  Will he elaborate?  Actually, I am not sure if he said there were too many.  Is he suggesting that the number should be reduced or more focused?  Perhaps I misinterpreted him.</p> <p>  Will Professor FitzGerald elaborate on the matter of split budgets?  He mentioned that he had been consulting the agricultural sector during his time off.  He stated that the EU recommendation was for a split budget in terms of carbon versus biogenic methane.</p></speech>

Not a single economist was appointed to it.  They were all from scientific backgrounds because we needed their expertise on adaptation across a range of disciplines.  Local authorities are crucial where adaptation is concerned.  When we spoke to them first, we received a very good presentation from Clare County Council.  A man there was doing remarkable work on predicting possible flooding in the Shannon region by using buoys at sea and collating information.  He could tell whether Shannon Airport would be flooded.  However, on the other side of the Shannon are Kerry and, at the top, Limerick.  We deemed local authorities too small to do this work by themselves.  I am sure the man in question talked to the neighbouring councils.  Climate action regional offices, CAROs, were set up, in which local authorities were grouped together with environmental offices, which provided the expertise.  This was a major innovation.  Local authorities are the ones that have to clean up - I will not say "the shit" - the problems when we are flooded and things go wrong.  They need advice and resources.  This is an adaptation to which people have not paid enough attention.  The people of central Cork probably have, but the problems of central Cork &ndash; for example, rising sea levels - will also affect Dublin and Limerick.  Local authorities need help and resources to determine what they have to do.</p> <p>  We also need to plan our resources for adaptation.  When I appeared before an Oireachtas committee last year, I believe it was Senator Chambers who pressed the Department strongly on the budget for adaptation to deal with future coastal and river flooding and the budget for dealing with the danger that we will cook our elderly in nursing homes because the temperature is too high and there is no ventilation.  Local authorities have an important role to play, but they need assistance in doing so.</p><p>However, 25 elements are too many.  I speak from experience.  I have been a regulator of the energy sector in Northern Ireland.  Between 2003 and 2007 I was on the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation.  I was on the Central Bank Commission until the end of last month.  The problem as a regulator is that if one is given too many objectives, one must consider them and if one does not consider them all in detail and write up what one is doing, one is subject to judicial review.  If there are 25 things - remember that one is talking about a council of part-time people and a secretariat that is under pressure - then one must show one has considered all 25.  Now, one does so indirectly.  If one must document that and then defend it in the courts, however, it could be extremely time consuming.</p><p> Our problem in the Northern Ireland authority was that our major task was to deliver a secure energy system to consumers at minimum cost in the long run and to deal with climate change.  The problem was that dealing with climate change meant raising the prices for consumers.  If, therefore, one gives lots of objectives and the council must then arbitrate between them, one is moving into an area which is more for the Oireachtas than the council.  One should keep it relatively simple, therefore, in terms of what the council is asked to do because 25 is just too much.</p><p> The split methane target is important because that is what the science says.  When I took up my position I thought my job was going to be to encourage the farming community to get out of livestock totally by 2050.  The first thing we learned was the science is actually more complicated and that is not the right answer.  If we do not a have a split target for 2050 and we must decarbonise, assuming that methane is like carbon dioxide, we would have to put in place carbon budgets which plan to eliminate all cattle by 2050.  Quite rightly, the farming community would say this is rubbish because the science does not say that is the answer.</p><p> For credibility, and where appropriate, we must reflect what the science says and the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, last year was important in this regard.  It is interesting that the latest European Commission proposals, although not fleshed out on this issue, look to be moving in this direction.  We feel, therefore, we must reduce our methane emissions.  In its legislation, the New Zealand Government plans to reduce emissions by 20% to 40% by 2050.  We do not know what the right target is.  It is going to be substantially less than what we do today but it will not be zero.  We need the Oireachtas to tell us what we are to plan for and we will then put in place carbon budgets to try to deliver that.</p></speech>

Does Deputy Bruton wish to come in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2020102800002#F00500"><p>I thank Professor FitzGerald.  It is good to hear his voice.  In his last comment, Professor FitzGerald raised the point about the distinction between biogenic methane and other greenhouse gases.  The way in which the legislation has defined the 2050 target is a "climate neutral economy", meaning "a sustainable economy, where greenhouse gas emissions are balanced or exceeded by the removal of greenhouse gases."  Is that a proper approach to this?  It would appear to say we can have biogenic methane not at zero.  One would, however, have to have negative emissions from the other sectors.  When he talked of a split target, did Professor FitzGerald have a target in mind which would have positive biogenic emissions which are not balanced?  I am aware the latter would be less onerous than the former but, perhaps, he could comment on this legislative framework we are creating.</p> <p>  Professor FitzGerald advocates the 2030 target should be spelled out in legislation.  Currently, as he will be aware, the programme for Government indicates we should achieve a 51% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030.  That is very much shared as a political objective.  Unlike what Professor FitzGerald is talking about in terms of carbon budgeting, however, I do not believe any of us have been able to do the detailed assessments of its implications for Irish society and so forth, so we recognise the obligation.</p> <p>  Is it premature for us to enshrine in law something which is a determination to deliver, although we have not seen the sort of work that underpins it?  Undoubtedly, the next two climate budgets will seek to achieve that.  By enshrining it in law, however, do we create something that can open the State up to litigation?  Is that a correct approach?  I am aware this is a difficult issue.  On one side, people will say if one makes it a legal obligation then that is important for the future of the world and it forces the Government.  On the other side, we are politicians trying to bring people with us, as Professor FitzGerald rightly said, farmers, people in the motor industry and all these different groups.  I am seeking Professor FitzGerald's advice on striking that balance between them when we have pretty imperfect knowledge as legislators.</p> <p>  I fully sympathise with Professor FitzGerald when he says 25 things is too many but, I suppose, politicians are always trying to balance all these things.  I am sure that is where the figure of 25 came from.  Does Professor FitzGerald suggest we should just make simpler the language to take into account the many economic, social, cultural and other implications when setting climate budgets?  Would that be a better way to deal with this?</p> <p>  My final question is on climate justice.  Professor FitzGerald rightly said this is a matter primarily for the Oireachtas.  Should we, however, create some sort of a framework in this Bill which would, at least, be the framework Ministers forming budgets from year to year or whatever should consult.  Would that be of value?</p></speech>

I could work with the definition of 2050.  I would interpret it in the way the Deputy suggests.  I just want to be certain the legal eagles will interpret it that way.  We must get to net zero on long-lived gases, in particular carbon dioxide, but I would interpret it to allow a split target.  Of course, we have not mentioned land use.  A huge way of dealing with the biogenic methane, however, is to offset it by changes of land use.</p> <p>  The point I make about imperfect knowledge is an interesting one, and we do not know what we are signing up to for 2030.  The way I see it is that the Government sets its 2030 target and we go off, because this work has not been done and, as the Deputy said, we have imperfect knowledge, and beaver away and we produce the carbon budgets.  The carbon budgets may not be sufficiently attractive or they may bring such major problems that the Oireachtas may decide to modify them.  Its role is to determine the feasibility.  There would, I suppose, be a problem where having enshrined the 2030 target in the legislation, if no carbon budget can get the Government to 2030 in a way that is acceptable to a majority of the Oireachtas.  It is up the Oireachtas then to change the target if it finds it is unacceptable.  That is not a satisfactory answer, however, and I cannot give the committee a money-back guarantee on this because I do not know.  We have not done the work so we do not know what major changes it will require in Irish society.  We, the experts, do not have to consider the political acceptability of it.  The Oireachtas must determine that.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the State being open to litigation.  Litigation can say the Government has got to have plans in place to do the job, and the climate action plan it brought in last year delivers on that.  If this ends up in the courts, however, then we have failed.</p><p>I will leave that to the lawyers.<br/><br/>On the 25 criteria, the first three or four are appropriate, as is the cost-effectiveness one.  De facto,<i></i>in making our recommendations, we have taken account of a range of other matters.  For example, the health co-benefits and biodiversity co-benefits of quite a number of the steps we have recommended, and that the Government is implementing through policy, will not only be good for climate change but also improve human health through reducing emissions in urban areas.  They could also be good for biodiversity.  While they have not been part of our obligation, we have considered them.<br/><br/>Once they have to be considered, that is, once legislation has to be defined, somebody could be subjected to judicial review.  Every one of them, therefore, has to be documented and it has to be shown that what the legislation requires has been done.  The inflexibility is posed by naming everything, rather than by setting out the key parameters for the council.  The parameters are much broader for the Minister, the Government and the Oireachtas.  They have to consider the acceptability and a range of other issues.  They should try to keep council focused in such a way that it will not end up in judicial review complications, and make it easier for us to provide our advice.  We are mindful, as I expect the next council will be, of the broader issues for society.  That is why, in our recommendations for major changes in agricultural policy, we are mindful that the political system has to get buy-in and implement them.  Perhaps we should not be considering the acceptability but we do so in our recommendations.</p></speech>

The understanding is that a zero-emission target effectively accommodates the fact that biomethane may not be zero but may come to a net zero.  That was a useful clarification.</p> <p>  Professor FitzGerald mentioned the minimum target of 2030.  I am a little concerned, however, that the council seems to be putting a great deal of its scientific input into that idea.  As I see it, that is a political commitment that reflects the science.  Through our hearings, the committee has an understanding that the new advisory council, which might be a little different from the previous one in this regard, will have a clear remit in respect of the science, and that the budgets will, as one of the primary goals, ensure that the temperature increase stays below 1.5&deg;C and that we meet the emission reduction targets.  One function, therefore, is the budget and how much we can afford while achieving those key goals.</p> <p>  The second aspect is the how.  That is the policy-inputting that Professor FitzGerald described, which might relate to sectoral plans or, as he mentioned, plans at local authority level.  Perhaps Professor FitzGerald will differentiate.  Does he think there might be a benefit in having scientific expertise that inputs into the how, along with other, wider expertise?  Perhaps some of those wider factors listed in the 25 criteria could also input into the policy, in regard to the how and the details of sectoral plans?

I wonder what Professor FitzGerald interprets cost effectiveness as because there are different meanings.  Is it about what is most economically advantageous, or the life-cycle costing, or the lowest cost or the price quality?  It is quite an ambiguous and wide term.  Professor FitzGerald might comment on my suggestion that the cost-effectiveness criterion might be more effective deciding how we achieve our goals rather than how much we achieve, and what he interprets cost effectiveness as.</p> <p>  The professor mentioned Government policy.  What areas did he mean?  Is it only environmental Government policy that he envisages having regard to or are there other areas of Government policy?  That question also relates to sectoral plans.</p> <p>  I might ask another question in my follow-up response.</p></speech>

While Ireland failed to meet its 2020 target, the EU as a whole will meet its 2020 target.  It seems that we have not yet considered it, but if the draft EU legislation proposed last month is implemented, it will provide a strong certainty that the EU as a whole will meet its 2030 target and its 2050 target because the mechanisms the EU is designing to do so will deliver with a high probability of success.  As for the science determining what the objectives should be for 2030, that is for the Oireachtas to determine if the Government wants to increase its ambition.  Deputy Bruton pointed out that we do not know what it will cost society - "cost" in a broad sense - and society will have to consider that target.  There is no correct answer in looking forward, or if there is, we do not know what it is.</p> <p>  On cost effectiveness, I have forgotten the precise formulation in the current Act under which we are operating but it was clear.  If we did not consider cost, we could outline any scheme, which might cost &euro;300 per tonne.  In seeking to change agriculture, we do not consider the cost to the agricultural community.  I do not think it makes sense to come up with policies that do not take account of the constraints of the cost of their implementation.  It is worth remembering that cost incorporates the just transition, that is, the cost to individuals in society as well as to society as a whole.  Economists talk about welfare effects, which are not necessarily the direct effects.  They include indirect effects on individuals.</p> <p>  I have mentioned the issue of Government policy.  My reading of where the Bill states that we must take into account Government policy was that we were to take account of the targets for 2030 and 2050 as defined in the legislation.  It may be that more than that is intended.</p> <p>  I hope my response was not too meandering.</p></speech>

My point was that one of the cost-effectiveness inputs to the policy is the how, that is, which approach we take, rather than the how much, which is the budget question.</p> <p>  Professor FitzGerald stated Ireland did not achieve its 2020 targets.  Given that Ireland has not reduced its emissions in recent years, will he highlight one or two things that could have been done differently in regard to the council's role and the wider governance structures that might have allowed Ireland to achieve the kinds of emission reductions that other countries have done?</p><p>Looking back to how the previous system operated, does Professor FitzGerald see anything that could have been done differently and could have contributed a greater emissions reduction?</p></speech>

That was the year in which the ESRI published the first work of mine on how we were going to deal with climate action.  It was when we started taking this issue seriously.  My recommendation at the time was to introduce a carbon tax and support the then EU proposals on carbon taxation.  However, Ireland was opposed to those proposals.  If they had been implemented then, we would be in a different place in regard to climate, not just in Ireland but in the whole of Europe, and we might have really succeeded.  There have been a lot of mistakes along the way.</p> <p>  Going back to when the Climate Change Advisory Council was established in 2016, it took some time before we formulated our ideas and it then took time to get a Government response.  The Climate Action (Amendment) Bill 2019 is one of the fruits of a lot of work by the Government and it reflects an increased urgency around climate issues in Irish society.  For the first five years of the 2010s, trying to get any attention on climate change was exceptionally difficult.  I say this as somebody who has been working in this area for 30 years.  However, I think there is now a more receptive audience among the public in Ireland for a commitment to take action.  It is true that things could have been done very differently in the past but we are where we are.</p></speech>

In responding to Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan's question on the role of local authorities, Professor FitzGerald elaborated on the adaptation side of their role.  Will he comment on the mitigation side?  I am thinking in particular of housing provision and transport planning, which are two of the big areas of climate challenge.</p></speech>

It is a matter for the local authorities to deliver development that will work for people by facilitating active modes of transport and making mass public transport more efficient and economically viable.  That is one area.  Another area that is really important concerns the housing stock.  This is an area in which Northern Ireland probably does things better.  The Northern Ireland Housing Executive manages the housing stock for the whole of the North, whereas, in this State, each local authority is responsible for its own area.  The State is the largest landlord in this country and it is landlords, not tenants, who have responsibility for upgrading and retrofitting their dwellings.  As such, local authorities have the responsibility to upgrade the 100,000 dwellings, or whatever number it is, in State ownership.  That is going to cost billions.  It is a huge task and it may be that we need a housing executive, similar to the body in the North, to undertake it.  The Northern Ireland Housing Executive has done a lot of stuff from which we could learn.  The Climate Change Advisory Council has already learned from some of that interesting work and we included that learning in the recommendations that were taken on board in the climate action plan.</p> <p>  Local authorities can provide leadership in this area.  To give an example, Kilkenny County Council, before upgrading a local authority estate, worked with the county engineer to source a builder, vet everything and ensure the thing was done right.  The private owners of the houses on the estate then asked about upgrading their own homes, having seen that the authority had worked out how to do it, got a good price from the builder and checked that everything was done properly.  Our recommendation, which was included in the budget, was to use the State's resources to prioritise the upgrading and retrofitting of local authority dwellings.  The local authorities are playing an important role in this area.  I was at a conference where representatives from Dublin City Council talked about finding different ways of financing the upgrading, which was innovative and interesting.  Local authorities need assistance and they need to learn from each other.  The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, where things are done at scale, is a useful model.  I was familiar with its work 15 years ago when I was a member of the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation.  I would like to invite the Northern Ireland Housing Executive people down to talk to us in the Climate Change Advisory Council to see what we can learn from them.  We tend to think about what the North can learn from the Republic.  In the case of the housing executive, we might learn from the North.</p></speech>

Transport accounts for 20% of our overall primary emissions and 56% or 58% of non-emissions trading system, ETS emissions.  Therefore, we must tackle transport.  I am wondering whether there is enough in the Bill in terms of leaning on local authorities and national bodies, including the National Transport Authority, to fundamentally change how transport works and tackle the problems effectively.  Does Professor FitzGerald have anything to say in this regard, specifically in reference to the provisions in the Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.59" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2020102800002#H00600"><p>The provision of public transport is, in effect, handled by the National Transport Authority.  Local authorities do not control it.  It is hugely important to make our cities - I say cities, not city - work in terms of public transport.  The planned changes in Cork, for instance, including the BusConnects initiative, are really important.  I am not sure climate action legislation is really the place for this.  We must have good planning for the provision of public transport and we must then implement those plans.  We have been weak on implementation in the past.  As a footnote, when I was recovering from chickenpox aged ten, my father gave me a map of Dublin and suggested that I design an underground transportation system for the city, which I went off and did.  Sixty years later, I am still waiting for it to be built.  I hope we see some progress in that regard as we look ahead.</p></speech>

It is important to bear in mind that transport is not just public transport but also private transport.  The roll-out of new infrastructure will serve both.  While we need to move to a public transport-leaning society, where people can rely on local public transport services, my concern is what is happening on the other side.  There are extensive plans for the roll-out of what is, in effect, car-centric infrastructure, which will, through the phenomenon of induced demand, make it a lot harder to bring about the modal shift that is required to reduce emissions in transport.  I have already used up all the time available to me but I would welcome a brief comment from Professor FitzGerald on this question.</p></speech>

It is all about making our cities work.  The current way of dealing with excess cars in the city is to make life hell for drivers.  There may be a more efficient way of charging.  I am also interested in integrating active modes of transport.  If one goes to Gent-Sint-Pieters station in Belgium, for example, Lund and Malm&ouml; stations in southern Sweden or the central station in Copenhagen, one will see massive bike parks nearby.  The first thing I did with my free travel pass was take a train from the M3 Parkway station near Dunboyne.  There was nobody on the train but I saw a vast number of cars in the car park.  I did not see many bicycles parked there.  Looking at ways of integrating the different modes of transport, which will be better for everybody, could be helpful.  It was one of the things we researched and there is a chapter on it in the report we published last month.</p><p>One thing which I have not considered but which came up in the research we commissioned was the use of bikes to access public transport.  We do not need to ban cars totally to make our cities work.  This depends on personal choices.  If people really need to bring their cars into the city, we must consider paid parking and finding a better way to ration road space.  We need the space for public transport first.  BusConnects is really important for Dublin. </p></speech>

The lack of interim targets makes it hard to judge whether we are on the right trajectory and whether we can take action to get back on track.  I would also like to ask Professor FitzGerald's opinion on the fact that the Bill will amend section 12 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 to provide that the annual report of the Climate Change Advisory Council is to be issued by 15 September of the previous year.  I know he has not had a chance to read the Bill, so he may want to reply in writing.  This can be compared with the British model, which names a date of 31 March.  Without the interim targets, the report of the Climate Change Advisory Council is being delayed.  There seems to be a real lag in progress on those targets.  Should we provide more resources to the Climate Change Advisory Council so it can file its reports in a more expeditious manner?</p></speech>

Our term of office ends in the middle of January and there will be a new council, which could have all new members.  It would not be feasible for that council to produce a report by March if it has entirely new members.  It would not say anything sensible.  The legislation may be framed on the basis that the new council may be able to do the job by September.  That issue could be addressed by naming a date in March of the year after the council is formed.  I do not see that as a huge constraint.  Releasing a report in September is not ideal timing.  July was a much better date, allowing for a much better chance of the report being accounted for in the budget.  I do not think the precise timing is hugely important, but March would not be feasible next year with a new council.  If the Oireachtas wants the report to be issued in March in future years, that should be specified.  It may not need to be specified in legislation.  A statutory instrument drafted by a Minister could be more flexible.</p></speech>

However, the draft heads of the Bill require the advisory council to present its report on 15 September of the previous year.  That would set that date as a continuing trend.  We could allow scope for the council to deliver its first report later in the year, but I am concerned about establishing an ongoing trend of waiting a full nine months.  That is written into the Bill.  Does Professor FitzGerald think that provision should be removed and the matter dealt with through a statutory instrument, with allowances made for the first year?</p></speech>

It allows more flexibility.  In the future there could be delays in appointing a council.  The Bill must include the really important things that will make a real difference.  We might then ask whether other issues need to be included in the Bill or should be included in secondary legislation.  We should ask what could go wrong if the date of the report is included in the Bill.  Governments will not amend the Bill to include a date of 31 March rather than 15 September.  That would be a waste of the Oireachtas's time.  The committee should think about what should be in primary legislation and what should be in secondary legislation.</p></speech>

He commented that one of the frustrations for the Climate Change Advisory Council was in securing access to modelling data in order to get a full picture.  He also noted that line Departments ought to participate more in the research that leads to the council's conclusions.  I could not agree with him more on that.  As a former Minister, I can say that one of the most frustrating things is the lack of understanding in some Departments of the scale of the challenges and the sort of changes needed in the sectors for which they are responsible.  I will not single out any one sector.  Does Professor FitzGerald see any way of embedding that thinking throughout the system?  Making Ministers accountable for their individual budgets and putting the Minister for Climate Action and Communication Networks in the hot seat is one way of doing that.  Does Professor FitzGerald have any suggestions as to how this type of thinking can be shared and embedded in institutions?</p></speech>

Our relations with the Department were not great.  Things have changed in the past 18 months and there is a willingness to give us access.  My frustration arose because I was doing the same kind of work at the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  I understand it.  Modelling is my first love.  Institutions need to work together.  When I was at the ESRI I participated in a very good group with departmental staff involved in this work between 2010 and 2012.  This work should be restarted.  That is the importance of the memorandum of understanding.  This is what the equivalent body in the UK has done.  It has had similar difficulties with bringing everybody together.</p> <p>  We are a small country and the expertise at our disposal is limited.  Making best use of it is important.  We may need ten or more experts on the Climate Change Advisory Council.  We draw up the carbon budget and it then goes to the Department.  The Department then has to hire ten similar people to understand the budget.  I recommend using a common team to do the research and then allowing the council to form its opinion.  We understand the research.  The Department knows where in the research the bodies are buried and can intervene if the Minister wants a different approach.  It can do this from a position of understanding the research.  If a body has not been part of the research it is difficult to get involved in it, even if it is well-documented.</p> <p>  I have seen a model of this approach between the ESRI, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank over 25 or 30 years.  Modelling was carried out jointly by the Department of Finance and the ESRI.  That is still the practice.  The Department of Finance uses the ESRI's model in preparing the budget.  This kind of model has worked in other areas.  Models in the climate science area do talk to each other.  There is a possible win-win outcome here.  It is really important that the Department is involved.  I carried out a series of studies on investment priorities for the Department of Finance over 25 years.  After the first 20 years I recommended that the Department deploy somebody to work with us on the project full-time so that the Department would understand our recommendations.  It might not accept them, but it would understand the science behind our conclusions. </p> <p>  Working together will make better use of expertise that is scarce  in Ireland and will help in policy-making.  The Department was concerned that it would infringe on our independence.  I am quite capable of telling the Department or the Government that I disagree with them, as is the council.  Doing the research jointly would not infringe on our independence.  Forming our conclusions is where we must be independent, and we are.</p></speech>

It sounds to me as if the Professor is concerned that it may become a little bit of an exercise in box-ticking.  I wonder would it be better, or complementary, to have expertise in some of those areas, for instance health, on the council.  There are obviously different ways in which one could go in order to bring about net zero emissions.  Health must be taken into account and different measures can be adopted based on the expertise on the council.  Does the Professor think that we could amend it to have expertise on the council and bring that to bear on everything the council is doing, rather than ticking a box to demonstrate that regard was had to a particular health policy?</p> <p>  The Scottish Act specifically mentions just transition and there is no mention in this Bill, as it stands, of just transition.  Does the Professor feel that it would be of benefit to bring that into the Bill?</p></speech>

There is a range of different issues that come up.  Mention of just transition should be considered though I am less concerned about the precise wording, although perhaps I should be more concerned because it is in legislation.</p> <p>  On the Senator's reference to the box-ticking exercise, my concern extends beyond just that.  It is an advisory council so it is different from a regulator but having been on two regulatory bodies, I know that all of the evidence and criteria set down in legislation have to be considered.  The council must also be able to show that those criteria have been considered or it will be judicially reviewed.  When I was on the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation, one had to hear all the evidence before one made one's decision.  When one is dealing with people who are part-time, giving a day or two to a council, setting in legislation that all of those issues must be considered becomes problematic.  The council will just be ticking boxes on all of those issues.  There are certain issues that are important, the first of which is getting to net zero emissions.  The second is doing it in a way that is acceptable to society in terms of its cost.  We then need to make sure that people are not left behind or particularly badly affected by it.  Those are important criteria.  Once one goes beyond that, it becomes a tick-box effort which has to be considered before we can make any recommendations.  That is problematic and I see a difficulty there.</p> <p>  On the Senator's point about expertise, we have a health expert on the adaptation committee.  We could not operate without a range of expertise, including engineering and so on, when it comes to adaptation.  The adaptation committee has a range of expertise.  The legislation specifies the number of people on the council.  If one decides to have an expert in all of these areas, I am not sure that will work as a council.  One wants a broad range of expertise and, as I set out, one needs a council that will actually work.  I have been particularly fortunate with my colleagues and we have worked well together, although we have not always agreed.  It is important to have diverse views or approaches on the council, rather than a single viewpoint.  We should be looking for a breadth of representation across gender and expertise, people who will have different views but will come together to make a cohesive recommendation.  That is important for a council.</p></speech>

We heard in our examination yesterday that the Scottish Act has minimum interim targets but also provides for those targets to be raised within the carbon budgets where, for example, scientific expertise suggests that they might not be achieving 1.5&deg;C limit and the evolution of science in that regard.  I know the Professor spoke to some of the other inputs and potential policy outputs, but could he indicate what scientific factors should be considered, either in terms of membership of the committee or the other scientific input?  The Professor mentioned the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, for example, and there are others that should be inputting into that evaluation of whether a budget is sufficient or needs to move above an interim target.  That was addressed interestingly in the Scottish legislation.</p> <p>  Also in the Scottish legislation, Ministers who do not take on the advice of the Scottish equivalent of the advisory council are required to give reasons and a rationale to explain why they did not.  Is that something useful that we should be replicating in this Bill so as to ensure that sweetness is not falling onto the desert air, or whatever it might be?  If advice is coming through, should we require a rationale as to why it was not followed?</p> <p>  My final point will build on the points made by Deputy Bruton and others about Departments.  One concern we have heard about the Bill is the lack of sanctions for Departments.  We know that only 1% of a shortfall in achievement can be reflected in the next budget period.  What are other appropriate sanctions for Departments or public bodies that fall short of their targets?  The Professor mentioned international expertise.  Could he comment more on what he sees there?</p></speech>

I know the Scottish approach is different, but I look at Denmark, New Zealand and France.  The expertise to define the target is for the Oireachtas to determine.  We have made a recommendation on the split target and discussed how it is defined in the Bill and that seems appropriate.  The current council works within the targets that are already enshrined in legislation.</p> <p>  It makes sense to require the Minister or the Government to explain why they are not going ahead with recommendations.  I do not think that is hugely onerous for a Government.  It puts the arguments for the Oireachtas to consider in a framed way.  The people of Ireland can also consider them.  Policy making in Ireland is a complicated process, as it should be, involving not only the Government, Oireachtas and experts, but also a range of civil society bodies.</p> <p>  On sanctions, we have a 2030 target.  If we do not meet it, what will the courts do?  The failure to meet the 2030 target will be due to the current Oireachtas and Government, the next Oireachtas and Government and a third Oireachtas and Government thereafter.  Do the courts lock up all the Ministers and Deputies?  The sanction is Oireachtas Members saying that they have failed.  I am not sure that looking for sanctions on Departments because they have failed can be implemented or makes sense.  Ultimately, if we do not make the 2030 target, it will be because the people of Ireland have not supported an Oireachtas that was prepared to make the necessary decisions.</p><p>I see this as a political process where the politicians deliver and, if they fail, it is for the electorate to say what it thinks about it.</p></speech>

That was what I was talking about with regard to sanctions.  As a Member of the Oireachtas who has had the unfortunate experience of calling out failure on multiple occasions and on multiple issues, it is not an adequate sanction from my perspective.  We are looking within the five-year budgets.  This is not the overall targets, but the budgets.  Perhaps it is a difference from the previous advisory council.  It is becoming clear there is an understanding now that there would be a strong scientific input, as the science is changing yearly in respect of what needs to be done within each year and each five-year period.  Within the budgets, what do we do if a specific Department has fallen far short while another Department is achieving its targets?  How do we reflect that or how might the advisory council want to reflect that going into the next five-year budget cycle?  This is separate from the overall target.</p></speech>

I have had a range of expertise.  When I was on the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation I was one of two external people from outside Northern Ireland.  There was a very good person from England on it.  I believe we made a significant contribution.  When the new Central Bank Commission was set up in October 2010 after the disaster, it included somebody who was not Irish and who worked in the commission and in the IMF whose advice was very valuable to us and to the then Governor and deputy governors.  He was only on it for one or two years.  On our council we have had Professor Ottmar Edenhofer, who is one of the leading environmental policy experts.  In Germany, he spent a great deal of time advising Chancellor Merkel and the current German Government.  Having his insights has influenced, for example, the carbon floor and what is done there.  He influenced me and the council.  In fact, a very good lecture which he gave at the International Energy Agency, IEA, last month is available on its website.  It is very important in terms of understanding the EU legislation and the political economy.  I found it valuable on three different boards or advisory bodies to have an outsider who brings a different point of view and different expertise.  That is my experience.</p> <p>  In terms of Departments that do not perform, it is up to the Government to deal with that.  The co-ordination in the Department of the Taoiseach, and the committee might have the person who is responsible for that giving evidence, may make a difference.  The Department of Finance has a great deal of clout, so when it says to another Department that it is cross and wants it to do something, that Department listens.  When the Department responsible for climate says it to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, those Departments are much less likely to listen.  That has been something of an issue until now.  Now there is, first, the involvement at the top of the Government and, second, the Department of the Taoiseach's co-ordinating role, which brings failures to the attention of the Taoiseach.  Those internal mechanisms and the climate action plan, the governance there and the reporting, were a major step forward.  In the future it is going to be far more obvious where there are failings than was the case in the past.</p></speech>

Will he comment on how economic thinking has been shifting with regard to the centrality of sustainable development and climate?  This really relates to the front-loading question.  How should or could action on climate change be reflected in our response to the Covid and Brexit crises?  We have large financial and economic policy instruments coming into play in respect of Covid and probably, unfortunately, in January in respect of Brexit.  How can we ensure the response there is also equipping us better for the transition we need in terms of climate change?</p></speech>

She had received lectures from Arthur Pigou, one of the great economic thinkers of the time.  He pointed out that having a carbon tax was the way to go in dealing with environmental issues where there is wider damage that is unpriced.  Economics for 100 years has said that this is the beginning.  However, one needs far more than that.  One needs major regulatory changes and so forth.  The economics thinking has evolved.  A guy called William Nordhaus won the Nobel Prize for economics last year or the year before and he was working on this in the 1970s.  He spotted the damage which the scientists said was being done to the climate and started working on it.  The economics of this has not changed dramatically over 50 years or a century.  The broad answers are unchanged.  The detail is different because people behave differently and if one does not take account of how people behave and what they hear, it will not work.  There is much interesting work being done on the details, but, although people might disagree, the broad parameters of environmental economics have not changed greatly.</p> <p>  At the detailed level in terms of Covid and the current crisis, I have written on this in terms of macroeconomics.  Households are saving like mad, not just in Ireland and across the EU but also in the United States until the stimulus was stopped there.  That might change after the election next week.  At the end of next year, we will, hopefully, have a vaccine and go back to normal.  The issue is what people do with their savings.  I want to visit my three children who are living abroad.  That is not good for climate change, but I want to see my children and grandchildren.  That is one thing, but there is a large amount of money there which could be used to retrofit houses.  Looking at an opportunity for ramping up in 2022 is one area.  The other area is State investment in areas that would be important in terms of the green future.  First, there would be enhanced EU funding for it, and we will have to expand the infrastructure.  Yes, there are things we can do post Covid at the detailed level.</p> <p>  Did the Senator have a second question that I have forgotten?</p></speech>

It seems that economics has not changed, but the climate has.  We might need to reverse that.  I appreciate the specific comments.  I mentioned Brexit as well, but Professor FitzGerald touched on the Covid issues.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Gerry Kiely, head of representation in Ireland for the European Commission, and Ms Noelle O'Connell, CEO of European Movement Ireland.  As we know, Ireland is not the only country grappling with Covid-19.  As many other member states face challenges in controlling the virus, this engagement seeks to inform us on the measures being taken at an EU level to assist member states in their efforts.</p> <p>  I will read a note on privilege before we begin.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise the witnesses, who are giving evidence from locations outside the parliamentary precincts, to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or not or the extent to which the evidence to be given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime.</p><p>If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I call Mr. Kiely to make an opening statement.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be here.  I will give as much of a summary as I can of the various EU actions that have taken place over the past six to eight months since the Covid crisis emerged.  I will be as brief as I can and I know the committee has much to get into the session.<br/><br/>During her state of the Union 2020 speech last month, President Ursula von der Leyen devoted her first words to pay tribute to all the caregivers, nurses, doctors and front-line workers in Europe, who have pulled us through this crisis to date and who continue to be our first line of response to the Covid-19 panic and pandemic.  The President said &ndash; and I agree - that we are inspired by their empathy, bravery and sense of duty.  She also said their stories reveal a lot about the state of our world and the state of our Union.  A virus a thousand times smaller than a grain of sand exposed how delicate life can be.  It laid bare the strains on our health systems and the limits of a model that values wealth above well-being.  People want to move out of this corona world, she said, and out of this fragility, out of uncertainty.  She stated they are ready for change and they are ready to move on.  She concluded that therefore this is the moment for Europe.<br/><br/>For a long time healthcare in the EU member states has been a national competence, whereas until recently the EU had very limited input.  This was also the case when the virus struck us and this also influenced how we could react in the EU.  The initial response in EU member states showed that we still have 27 sovereign member states that might share many areas of responsibility within the framework of our Union but which also maintain multiple areas of competence covered by their own decisions, and health is one of them.<br/><br/>When Covid-19 hit us, this became the moment for Europe and one, in my view, where we have risen to the occasion . EU member states&rsquo; health systems immediately went into overdrive to counter the contagion and support those affected.  However, member states also started closing borders, limiting the flow of essential goods.  Some started to compete with each other for the procurement of limited supplies of personal protective equipment, PPE, and medication.  In addition, the economic effects of lockdowns had to be met by national social security systems and national financial support to businesses and workers.<br/><br/>In recent months, we have rediscovered the value of what we hold in common.  As individuals, we have all sacrificed a piece of our personal liberty for the safety of others and as a Union, we all shared a part of our sovereignty for the common good.  We showed what is possible when we trust each other and trust our European institutions.  Working within its competences, and sometimes moving beyond into innovative areas, the EU has given a massive response to Covid-19.  I have already provided a separate summary overview of that response, which I will not repeat in detail here.  However, I would like to highlight a number of important elements.<br/><br/>The first is the response to Covid-19 by the EU with economic measures.  These include a massive recovery package of &euro;1.8 trillion that combines the EU budget for 2021 to 2027 and Next Generation EU.  Under the agreement, the Commission will be able to borrow up to &euro;750 billion on the markets.  A first successful EU bond issue of &euro;17 billion has just been oversubscribed 13 times over.<br/><br/>Additionally, there are economic measures that complement the European Central Bank&rsquo;s &euro;1.35 trillion pandemic emergency purchase programme, in addition to the &euro;120 billion programme decided earlier.  There has been a temporary relaxing of state aid rules so governments can provide liquidity to the economy.  We have also seen the triggering of the &quot;escape clause&quot; that allows maximum flexibility to our budgetary rules, which links to the earlier point on state aid, and there has been the Commission&rsquo;s temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency, SURE, which is designed to help people keep their jobs during the crisis.<br/><br/>There has also been financial support for hard-hit small and medium businesses.  The Commission tabled an investment initiative to provide member states with immediate liquidity, and it consists of unspent cohesion policy funds.  I do not know if Ireland got any of this because Ireland did not have any unspent cohesion funding.  To support farmers and the agriculture sector, the Commission has launched exceptional measures to support and stabilise agricultural markets.<br/><br/>To respond to Covid-19, the EU has set up support for research for treatment, diagnostics and vaccines.  The coronavirus global response pledging marathon raised &euro;16 billion in funds for universal access to treatments, tests and vaccines, of which &euro;1.4 billion was from the Commission.  The Commission has also mobilised more than &euro;660 million under Horizon 2020 to develop vaccines, new treatments, diagnostic tests and medical systems.  The Commission's vaccines strategy<b></b>was designed to accelerate the development and availability of vaccines.  It aims to secure the production of vaccines within the EU, ensure sufficient supplies for its member states through advance purchase agreements with vaccine producers, adapt the EU's regulatory framework to the current emergency and use the flexibility of our rules to speed up the development, authorisation and availability of vaccines.  So far, the Commission has concluded agreements on behalf of all EU member states with pharmaceutical companies for hundreds of millions of vaccine doses as soon as a vaccine is approved.  Separate from this, the Commission also presented a vaccination strategy<b></b>to help identify vulnerable groups that should benefit from vaccination.  The strategy also deals with vaccination services and infrastructure and vaccines deployment, as well as the availability and affordability of vaccines, and communication to ensure public confidence.<br/><br/>To respond to Covid-19 the EU has also provided support to the public health sector.  The Commission has allocated &euro;3 billion from the EU budget, matched by &euro;3 billion from member states, to fund the emergency support instrument and the rescEU's common stockpile of equipment to deal with the pandemic.  To aid the production and availability of personal protective equipment, the Commission is working closely with member states to assess the available stock of PPE in the EU, the production capacity and anticipated needs.  It is ensuring conformity assessment and market surveillance to increase the supply of PPE without compromising health and safety standards.  It is discussing with industry how to convert production lines to supply more PPE and providing manufacturers with guidance to increase production of PPE, hand sanitisers and disinfectants.<br/><br/>To respond to Covid-19 the EU has also addressed the issue of borders and mobility, including guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure availability of goods and essential services and creating so-called green lanes to ensure the flow of goods.  There have also been temporary restrictions on non-essential travel to the EU and guidance to ensure the free movement of workers, especially in the healthcare and food sectors.<br/><br/>Finally, to respond to Covid-19 the EU has engaged in activities to fight disinformation.  The Commission is in close contact with social media platforms regarding measures to promote authoritative content and to take down misleading, illegal and harmful content.  Many initiatives are being implemented and many of them are available to Ireland in support of the efforts of the Irish Government and Irish authorities to counter the pandemic but also to deal with its economic impact.  The pandemic is not over and a vaccine is not yet available, although there are some hopeful signs.  National competences and EU policies continue as they are, but given the range of responses from the EU to date and working closely together with all EU member states, we hope to meet the challenge and protect our citizens.<br/><br/>In the past six months, our health systems and workers have produced miracles.  Every country has worked to do its best for its citizens and Europe has done more together than ever before, and we achieved this without having full competences but rather through co-ordination and co-operation.  As President von der Leyen has said, it is crystal clear we need to build a stronger European health union.  The Commission wants to strengthen our crisis preparedness and management of cross-border health threats.  The Commission will propose to reinforce and empower the European Medicines Agency and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.<br/><br/>The Commission also wants to establish a European agency for biomedical advanced research and development.  We need strategic stockpiling to address supply chain dependencies, notably for pharmaceutical products.  In conclusion, it is clearer than ever before that we must discuss the question of health competences for the EU, a matter that saw strong support in the Eurobarometer published last week.</p><p>The Commission believes this is a suitable subject for the conference on the future of Europe, which we hope will kick off next month or in the near future.</p></speech>

I wish him and all committee members every success, particularly at this crucial juncture of Ireland&rsquo;s EU relationship.  The committee can be assured, as ever, of the ongoing engagement and support of its work by me and all of my colleagues in European Movement Ireland.</p> <p>  We are delighted to have this opportunity to meet the committee this morning on the critical topic of the EU&rsquo;s response to Covid-19.  We would be in a far worse condition if it were not for the Trojan and Herculean efforts of health workers across the EU.  I pay tribute to those working across the front line in this regard.</p> <p>  What would be the EU&rsquo;s report card to date?  As we know, this virus respects no borders.  Traditionally, the EU tended to fit crises into its entirely bureaucratic processes and treaty-based rules.  In other words, it tried to adapt crises to its way of working, rather than adapting to the crisis at hand.  Brussels and its related EU agencies have never been known for speed.  They tend to be more a marathon runner than a sprinter.  After a slow start, however, team EU got into a stronger stride after late March with regular policy initiatives to cope with the crisis, ranging from the repatriation of EU citizens abroad to protecting national health services from cyberattacks, mass procurement of protective medical equipment and directing EU funding towards vaccine research.</p> <p>  This coronavirus pandemic is not a normal crisis.  We are now seeing the EU and member states attempt to co-ordinate their responses collectively against the backdrop more broadly of this committee meeting taking place as Europe experiences a deadly second wave of the virus.  Curfews, restrictions and other measures are being implemented across member states to help control the spread of Covid-19.</p> <p>  This public health crisis requires a shared sense of purpose and, equally, a willingness by the EU, its institutions and member states to do new things.  Just this past weekend, the EU has delivered ventilators and other medical supplies from its rescEU reserve to Czechia, after that country requested help through the EU&rsquo;s civil protection mechanism, amid its rising number of coronavirus cases.  It is a practical example of how the EU has played a vital, yet often under-recognised, central role as the provider and co-ordinator of help to member states in how we respond to Covid-19. </p> <p>  It is largely member state governments which led the way with health policy remaining primarily a national competency by constituent member state national governments.  Several EU measures provide a flavour of some of the co-ordinated initiatives taken by various EU institutions in their attempts to alleviate the impacts of this pandemic on EU citizens.  In the early days of the pandemic, the European Commission invited all member states, as well as the UK, to lift customs duties and VAT on imports of necessary medical equipment during the crisis.  This covered protective equipment, testing kits and medical devices, such as ventilators, in order to help make it easier financially for member states to obtain this important equipment.  This measure has now been extended to the end of October 2020.</p> <p>  On vaccinations, AstraZeneca is to provide 300 million doses with an option for a further 100 million.  The European Commission is leading this charge on behalf of member states to secure safe and effective Covid-19 vaccinations.  AstraZeneca is better known for developing the Oxford vaccine, as has been widely reported in the media, with further welcome developments emerging last weekend about its potential results.</p> <p>  On research, Dublin-based firm Pintail is leading on the PORSAV project, along with Palliare, UCD and other partners in France and Poland.  Its purpose is to develop technology to control viral aerosols in Covid-19 and other diseases.  Another example, Cork-based company, BioPixS, is part of a consortium of six other partners across Spain, Italy and the Netherlands that are developing a portable platform for the assessment of microvascular health.</p> <p>  On Tuesday, 20 October, for the first time in its history, the EU borrowed from the international monetary markets and made history by attracting the highest ever demand recorded for a bond sale.  Investors placed bids for more than &euro;233 billion, which far exceeded the original &euro;17 billion worth of bonds on offer.  This sale is the first under the EU&rsquo;s SURE, Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency, programme and is available for member states which need to mobilise significant financial means to fight the negative economic and social consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <p>  Elsewhere, EU finance ministers had agreed on 20 March to suspend the Stability and Growth Pact, demonstrating an early flexibility and determination to grapple with the economic challenges presented by the pandemic.  The ECB decided in June to increase the pandemic emergency purchase programme from &euro;600 billion to &euro;1.35 trillion.  By doing so, the ECB, stated this &ldquo;will further ease the general monetary policy stance, supporting funding conditions in the real economy, especially for businesses and households&rsquo;&rsquo;.  This purchasing programme will continue until June 2021 in its current format.  In May, the European Investment Bank launched a &euro;25 billion European guarantee fund.</p> <p>  To further help member states respond to the pandemic, in March, the European Commission allowed for a temporary relaxation of state aid rules, which facilitated Ireland being able to designate &euro;15 million in financial assistance for five strategic maritime roll-on, roll-off routes for a period of up to three months.  These routes included those operated by Irish Ferries from Dublin to Cherbourg and Rosslare-Europort to Pembroke; by Stena Line from Rosslare-Europort to Cherbourg and Fishguard; and by Brittany Ferries from Rosslare-Europort to Bilbao.  These will be crucial as the Brexit clock continues to count down.  This is without even mentioning the &euro;750 billion Next Generation EU agreement.</p> <p>  The EU has repatriated over 82,000 EU citizens on flights from all over the world, including over 600 Irish people from the likes of India, Japan to Peru.  It has co-ordinated with Netflix, which temporarily lowered video quality across Europe to reduce strain on Internet service providers.  It has worked with member states to keep trade moving across borders by introducing green lanes at border crossings.  The EU has been that all-important co-ordinator between and for member states as they attempted to grapple with this pandemic.</p> <p>  Air travel is an example of this.  As an island nation, air travel is a key priority for Ireland to mitigate its peripherality to the EU.  However, Covid-19 has brought challenges.  Earlier this month, agreement was reached in the EU to adopt a common traffic light system for flights in terms of the impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector in Ireland.  The system aims to end a confusing patchwork of country by country restrictions with regions across the EU designated green, orange or red, based on the degree to which the virus is under control.  While individual EU member states are free to determine their own measures, the European Commission has encouraged all member states to be consistent.</p> <p>  While the traffic light system is an example that the EU can get things right, the European response to Covid-19 has also faltered at times.  The lack of solidarity shown to Italy, widely publicised in March, subsequently impacted people&rsquo;s opinion of the EU, as borne out in many polls.  Polling by Kantar, on behalf of the European Parliament in April and June, showed 39% of those surveyed were satisfied that EU member states had shown enough solidarity between them in fighting Covid-19.  Ireland actually had the highest levels of satisfaction with 64% with Luxemburg at the lowest, 19%.</p> <p>  From a European Movement Ireland's perspective, we posed a similar question in our annual Ireland in the EU poll by RED C, a poll published since 2013 in which people in Ireland are asked their opinions on various EU issues.  This year the fieldwork was carried out in mid to late March just as lockdowns were commencing across Europe.  On the statement that the EU has responded well to the coronavirus pandemic, respondents were equally split with 47% agreeing it had, 46% disagreeing while 7% did not know.</p><p>This response in Ireland is relatively high compared to other polling across the EU.  A March opinion poll for POLITICO found that 24% of respondents in Italy, 31% of respondents in France and 43% of respondents in Spain felt that the EU was helping them at that time, while that figure was just 8% in Greece in an April opinion poll.  Interestingly, as well, in Germany, a FORSA-AKTUELL poll in May asked respondents in whom they had confidence in crisis management, and only 37% of Germans replied that they had confidence in the EU.  The Romanian Institute for Evaluation and Strategy found in June that 40% of Romanians considered that the EU reacted weaker at first, but the response then got better during the crisis.  This summarises the perception of the EU&rsquo;s response to Covid-19; uncertain at the start, perhaps, but once it found its footing and pace, the EU was able to react more effectively on a range of issues. </p><p> At the same time, while people may have been somewhat negative regarding the EU&rsquo;s response to Covid-19, the Kantar polling highlighted that people were highly aware of what the EU has done.   In June, an average of 76% of people had heard, seen, or read about measures or actions initiated by the EU to respond to Covid-19, with Ireland ranked eighth at 79% awareness.  Interestingly, an SWG poll in May found that 69% of Italians had a positive opinion of the next generation EU plan from the European Commission, while in the Netherlands in June it was found that just 30% were in favour of it. </p><p> What, then, do people want from the EU in respect of dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic?  As I have highlighted, polling has underlined a key trend throughout the year of a desire among citizens across EU member states for greater collective action by the EU, its leaders and its institutions.  In that Kantar polling on behalf of the European Parliament, 68% of respondents agreed with the statement that the EU should have more competences to deal with crises, such as Covid-19.  The response to that statement in Ireland was 79% in favour, the sixth highest, with Portugal topping that poll at 87% in favour.  The Kantar poll for the European Parliament in October found that an absolute majority of Europeans continued to call for a larger EU budget to fight Covid-19, with more than half the respondents, 54%, saying that public health should be a spending priority for the EU budget, followed by 42% saying economic recovery and new opportunities for businesses, 37% saying climate change and environmental protection and 35% saying employment and social affairs. </p><p> Citizens continue to see the EU as part of the solution in this crisis, with 66% of respondents agreeing that the EU should have more competences to deal with it.  These findings remain consistent with the results from previous polling.  Indeed, as Mr. Kiely mentioned, the EU gaining competences in the area of health was an issue the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, mentioned in her September state of the Union address to the European Parliament.  This comes at a critical point, as the EU prepares to launch the conference on the future of Europe, which will provide an important forum of discussion with the public about crucial issues of importance for the EU&rsquo;s medium and long-term development, in areas such as economic and social system, sustainability, climate protection, innovation, digital transformation and the EU&rsquo;s core values.  It will also explore the lessons that Europe can learn from the pandemic and, judging by the recent polling data I have presented, there is a strong and urgent demand from EU citizens for that to happen.  This is something we in European Movement Ireland will be keenly monitoring and engaging with, and it is an issue which I look forward to engaging on with this committee later in the year. </p><p> As the EU and Ireland begin to focus our attention on where we want Europe to go in the decades ahead, I will finish by saying we cannot have that kind of pan-European conversation without being conscious of the challenges posed by the forces of populism, extremism and disinformation.  A loss of trust and the impact of these forces would have a profound and deeply negative impact on our communities, societies and politics, and for the whole European project. </p><p> I have outlined a brief overview of the EU&rsquo;s current report card in its efforts to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.  Some say the EU has evolved and developed based on responses to various crises, be that the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, as a response to food shortages after the Second World War or the Single Market and the euro coming after the economic shocks of the 1970s.  It is tempting to debate if there will be more Europe or less and more nationalism or globalism after the coronavirus crisis is over.  As we encounter the second wave of the virus across Europe, no one knows how it will continue to evolve, nor, therefore, how the EU may change because of it.  Just as we witnessed a Brexit bounce in support for the EU, this Covid-19 crisis has revealed that EU citizens have high expectations and demands of the EU.  Some of these are fair, but some, however, are arguably outside the EU&rsquo;s existing core competencies and capacities.</p><p> What we have seen, however, is that when Europe delivers, people recognise that and respond positively.  The challenge for the EU now, as member states grapple with a second wave of Covid-19, is to keep on delivering.  It will not be easy.  Recent weeks have shown us that the journey ahead remains difficult and uncertain.  We can be confident, however, that people across the EU want a better and stronger Europe that can respond to crises more effectively and, importantly, give us hope for a better future.</p></speech>

I will call members in order now, and I will take two at a time.  Deputies Howlin and Richmond have indicated.  I ask them to be specific regarding to whom they are directing questions.  I call Deputy Richmond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102800002#E00300"><p>I thank our witnesses for their enlightening presentations.  There is quite a bit of detail to go through.  I have two or three questions for Mr. Kiely, two for Ms O'Connell and then one question for both witnesses.  I will try to keep the questions as concise as possible.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Kiely give us some detail regarding how much PPE is in stock, or has been stockpiled?  Regarding cross-border co-operation, have the EU and the European commission played any specific role in that context?  We have seen reports of Germany taking in patients from other countries and Romanian medical staff going to Italy in the early part of the crisis.  I ask that question because cross-Border co-operation poses a very specific challenge on this island, where Northern Ireland is starting to run out of spaces for ICU patients.  Even though Northern Ireland is part of the UK, which has technically left the EU, we obviously have a moral obligation to provide support where we can and if possible.  What role is the EU playing in that area, if any?  My last question for Mr. Kiely concerns the &euro;750 billion European recovery fund.  Has any consideration been given at a European level for the non-Covid-19 aspects?  I refer to what impact Brexit might have on Ireland, for example, and how that might impinge on Ireland's ability to draw down other funds.</p> <p>  Turning to Ms O'Connell, she went into some detail on the traffic light system.  There has been much talk on that subject, but drawing on her engagement with and analysis of the situation across the EU, does Ms O'Connell think there has been real engagement by the member states in this traffic light system?  Has there been buy-in into that system, or is it just a conceptual idea at this stage?  My next question for Ms O'Connell leads into a question for both witnesses concerning citizens' demands.  I refer to the less than favourable impression of the EU's initial response to the pandemic, and how that has changed and progressed in recent months.  That leads us to the question of to what extent do health competences need to change.  Mr. Kiely finished his presentation very pertinently on this aspect and Ms O'Connell also referred to this matter.  </p> <p>  This topic feeds not just into this discussion about the pandemic, but also into the future work and discussions of this committee regarding the future of Europe and the conference on the future of Europe.  What capacity do the witnesses think there is for changing competences across the EU, bearing in mind the changes that might require a new treaty or treaty changes, and especially given our country's history with treaty changes in various referendums.  I have no great appetite to go out campaigning in a referendum any time soon.  I have no great appetite to go campaigning for anything at the moment, and that also presents its own difficulties.  That is something, however, we need to bear in mind more broadly, beyond the pandemic, when we talk about the future of our union.  The UK has left, but there are many changes and challenges about which we must question whether the treaties of the Union and the Union itself are up to scratch in dealing with.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.99" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102800002#E00400"><p>I will begin where Deputy Richmond ended, on the topic of health competencies.  That was the reason, I was going to say excuse, given for the slow initial response at EU level to the crisis.</p><p>From the data and polling Ms O'Connell presented, health competency has impacted to varying degrees but uniformly negatively on people's image of the union.  Even where there is no formal health competence, and as a former Minister for Health, I know there is no health council as such, there must be a provision for common action to face a common emergency.  We need to address that.  <br/><br/>These questions are mainly for Mr. Kiely.  We are now in the second wave of this pandemic.  Last night places such as Liege have been presented as the new epicentre.  Germany has said it will take some patients if the acute hospital system in Belgium is overwhelmed.  Who is co-ordinating these things now or is it <i>ad hoc</i>?  Is it for individual member states to act as good neighbours or is there now some sort of pan-European co-ordination on these matters?  <br/><br/>Ms O'Connell also mentioned the stability and growth pact relaxation or suspension.  As someone who had to grapple with the stability and growth pact in the last crisis, that is a welcome development, but how long will that last?  I am interested in Mr. Kiely's perspective.  We need to rebuild even after the virus is defeated.  That will mean economic supports and the capacity to do that might be outside the scope of the very narrow stability and growth pact we entered into.<br/><br/>One of the big issues around providing adequate health resources now and the future is staffing.  Ireland's issue is less the provision of ventilators but the staffing of ventilators.  The common practice is that every European country acts as an independent entity in the recruitment of health staff.  Is this something that must be examined from a European perspective?  We seem to cannibalise each other.  For example, the last time we went on a massive recruitment campaign for nurses, we looked at South Africa.  South Africa, being depleted of nurses, looked to Kenya which then looked to its neighbours.  It was always one wealthier country cannibalising the next down in the tier.  Do we need to have a pan-European staffing response?  Is there any scope in that?<br/><br/>I was interested in Mr. Kiely's comment on the establishment of new European agencies in the health sphere and biosciences.  What is the status of that?<br/><br/>Ms O'Connell referred to the relaxation of state aid rules in terms of domestic routes in advance of Brexit.  The relaxation of state aid rules are of little benefit if the domestic government does not take them on.  It is a discussion for a different forum.  We have gross incapacity in terms of direct links to continental Europe and being reassured by those who are already providing it is cold comfort for me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Kiely" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102800002#F00200"><p>I will try to answer to the extent I can.  I do not have a figure for the stockpile of PPE, and I am not sure anyone does.  It is a combination of things from the Commission's perspective, including the provision of money and the setting of standards.  Through the mechanism rescEU there is some EU stockpiles organised through member states.  Through the Commission, there are framework contracts through which member states can purchase equipment.  It is a combination of different actions to ensure an adequate supply of the appropriate equipment.  I am not sure a figure exists for any stockpile, and to the extent that there is one around member states, it would be changing.  I will look into it and if there is a figure I can come back with, I will do so.</p> <p>  Deputy Howlin mentioned cross-border co-operation.  Taking patients from hospital in one country to a hospital in another happened at the peak and is beginning to happen again.  That is primarily bilaterally.  It is also covered through rescEU.  There is also a co-ordination committee involving the institutions in all the member states who probably meet or are in contact daily on co-operation and co-ordination between the institutions and the member states.  It is a fluid situation.  As people have noted, the EU does not have competence so it is co-operation and co-ordination operation at the moment, which is working very well but it is not ideal.  </p> <p>  On the rescEU &euro;750 billion, there are also other funds.  This was put in place to help the economies in the context of Covid.  It is up to member states what actions they put forward and up to the institutions as to what they would accept would be covered, but there are many other funds. The structural funds have not gone away, nor has the Common Agricultural Policy fund.  We are looking down the road in the next month or two to the conclusion of Brexit.  Depending on the agreement, or absence thereof, there is a fund of &euro;5 billion.  Everyone recognises that if there is an impact from Brexit, Ireland is likely to be impacted more than others.  Ireland can tap into that.  The &euro;750 billion is additional to all the other funds.  If one adds up everything that has been done at EU and member state level in relation to Covid between state aid, monetary easing, funds, the EU budget etc., there is firepower in the order of &euro;3.5 trillion or &euro;4 trillion to deal with Covid and its economic and medical fallout.  The GDP is something like &euro;15 trillion.  Approximately  20% to 25% of EU's GDP has been put on the table for firepower.  Most of that is still a promise, it has not yet gone into the system but it will in the future and will inevitably have a big impact.  </p> <p>  Both Deputies mentioned health competence.  The Commission does not want to go down that road at the moment.  What we must deal with now is the crisis.  There is a general acceptance that while co-operation and co-ordination is working very well, the EU needs to have more competence in health.  We will have a conference on the future of Europe, hopefully in the next month or two, as soon as there is agreement between the institutions, and inevitably changing competence not only in health but in other areas will be a question for that conference.  Treaty change was raised.  Ireland is very concerned that there might be treaty change, and it is not alone in that.  Plenty can be done without any treaty change.  Take decisions on foreign affairs where many thought any decision to move away from unanimity would have to be done by treaty change when it is clear it does not have to be.  If there is unanimous agreement it can be done by qualified majority.  Treaty change is not inevitable but that is a question for the conference on the future of Europe.  </p> <p>  On who is co-ordinating action, that is the Commission but it is doing so in co-operation with the member states.  There is a committee and a council.  The Deputy spoke of recruitment and staffing.   It is not only about staffing but also about the provision of facilities, infrastructure etc., and getting ready for the application of vaccines if and when we have one.</p><p>The Commission put forward a health strategy fairly recently that covered many areas, which member states will have to implement.  As I stated, &euro;3 billion was put on the table to help the health systems in the member states.</p><p> On the establishment of new agencies, the Commission has announced its intention to move forward on that but we are at the very beginning.  This month, we will also make proposals with regard to the European Medicines Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to update and adapt them further, although I cannot say what will be in the proposals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.103" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noelle O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102800002#G00200"><p>Deputy Richmond asked about the traffic light system and whether there has been any real engagement.  It is fair to say, as both Mr. Kiely and I noted, that in the early days, with no guidance or co-ordinated response, member states acted in an ad hoc and disparate manner.  Various travel restrictions were introduced on an individual basis and there was a lack of co-ordination.  Now, however, with the guidance we hope the co-ordination will engender, the traffic light system will be welcomed by all member states once it proves practical and workable.  It is very difficult to talk about it against the backdrop of the second wave.  The challenges that many EU member state public health systems currently face are incredible.  Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that the traffic light system has been agreed to at Council level, so it has been agreed to by member state governments and leaders.  There is buy-in, therefore, and hopefully, once we navigate our way through this second wave, the practical impacts of this co-ordination at member state level will prove beneficial to all EU citizens.  That is the fervent hope and wish of us all.</p> <p>  We need to examine whether health competences need to change and whether that will lead to another EU referendum.  Deputy Howlin mentioned the fiscal stability treaty and the stability and growth pact.  Change needs to happen and we need to consider it but, as Mr. Kiely outlined, the EU can do a great deal more.  We may not necessarily need to go straight to a treaty change, although that is probably inevitable at some stage.  Judging by all the polling, including our European Movement Ireland-Red C polling, there is demand for greater co-ordinated and concerted activity and consistent engagement by the EU to mitigate the worst impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on our citizens.  When I was preparing for my presentation, I was struck by the relatively consistent level of support throughout member states for the EU to do more.  We have to consider this against the backdrop of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  This topic will, one hopes, be addressed there because we need to examine the medium and long-term future of the EU and the institutions, making it a more efficient, fairer and sustainable European Union that works for all its citizens.</p> <p>  Earlier this year in our Red C poll when we asked people in Ireland whether they believe their voices are heard as citizens of the EU, I was really disappointed with the results.  Only 33% agreed and felt their voices were heard as citizens of the EU, with the majority of 48% saying they did not.  Frankly, that is good enough and we need to work on it to ensure that, as part of the responses to the Covid pandemic, we will work to engage all citizens throughout the EU member states to work collectively and to ensure that people's concerns, views, opinions and perspectives are heard and taken into account in the outcomes and engagements of the Conference on the Future of Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1669" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102800002#G00300"><p>My questions are for both of our guests, whom I thank for their presentations and attendance.  The Commission stated yesterday that universal vaccination may not be available until 2022.  Why is this?  Perhaps Mr. Kiely will explain.  Is it that the Commission foresees supply constraints or is it just less optimistic about the speed of development and authorisation, based on safety procedures?</p> <p>  In regard to centralised purchasing capacity for member states, and in particular for smaller member states such as Ireland, are there any difficulties now in respect of personal protective equipment, PPE, drugs such as remdesivir and others, and ventilators and other oxygenation systems?  Is the Commission satisfied that any member state can have access to these supplies worldwide and that the EU is putting its collective weight behind making such purchases on behalf of member states when asked to do so?</p> <p>  My final question relates to public sector deficits in eurozone member states.  Is there a clear EU view on this?  Is somebody, whether the European Central Bank, ECB, or the Commission, keeping an eye on Italy, Ireland or wherever?  That applies to all member states and not just Ireland; I am not a masochist on this.  Is anybody checking to ensure there is a reasonable uniformity of approach to running deficits, or at least to the criteria justifying major member state deficits within the eurozone?</p></speech>

Mr. Kiely spoke about it being a moment for Europe and stated that Europe, and in particular the Commission, had risen to the occasion, while Ms O'Connell spoke about the EU being slow to start, not least in regard to a lack of solidarity shown to Italy.  Generally speaking, the EU was slow to start.  Initially, it was a case of every state for itself, but we are getting there and Mr. Kiely is probably correct that Europe has risen to the occasion, albeit only after some time.</p> <p>  My first question relates to the multiannual financial framework and the next generation EU.  Mr. Kiely might wish to respond.  Where are we with regard to agreeing to the next generation EU funds and the process of agreement throughout the EU institutions?  Is there a timeline for that?</p> <p>  New, additional funds were mentioned.  Has there been any indication as to how Ireland might draw down those potential funds?  There was much discussion at a European Council meeting of the breakdown of grants versus loans.  Borrowing on the international markets is cheap.  Are these potential new funds as good as they sound?  Has there been any indication that member states will draw them down?  Do they have weaknesses, given that states themselves can borrow them?  Mr. Kiely might comment on that and specifically in regard to Ireland.</p><p> On the issue of treaty change, many questions have been posed and answered already.  Ms O'Connell spoke about the rise of populism, extremism and disinformation.  We should be very careful about treaty change.  Deputy Richmond spoke about the difficulties in holding a referendum at this time, or at any stage in the future, with this rise in populism, extremism and disinformation.  This is just a comment.  We should try to work within the treaties to deal with this healthcare issue.  There will be a great deal of trouble regarding treaty change, particularly here in Ireland.  If we are talking about health, I can see a few issues emerging in such a referendum debate and I would not like to go down that road.  I am aware the Conference on the Future of Europe will deal with it but we need to work within the existing treaties.</p><p> Most of the questions have been posed and answered but I will comment on the common traffic light system.  It seems to me that is academic at the moment given that EU member states are in lockdown.  Ms O'Connell spoke about the second lockdown.  I believe such a system will be useful but not at the moment.  It is largely academic but I guess it will be useful as we come out of the second wave, with the numbers down, and out of lockdowns throughout the member states.  Most of that is commentary but I would like the question on the Multiannual Financial Framework and the next generation EU to be answered.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.108" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noelle O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102800002#H00300"><p>Most of the specific questions are more broadly for Mr. Kiely.  I will let him deal with all the difficult technical ones, if that is okay.  I thank Deputy Haughey.  In terms of some of the questions, the Stability and Growth Pact rules suspended the deals with deficit and the informal September Eurogroup meeting agreed to continue the suspension of the pact.  A review of the rules of the pact would obviously resume at the end of the year.  These issues continue to be monitored at the various Eurogroup meetings.  I trust that answers the question somewhat.</p> <p>  Deputy Haughey outlined succinctly some of the challenges that would arise in terms of any possible EU referendum, treaty change and some of the forces of populism and extremism.  We have seen only too well on this side of the Irish Sea the combination of more than 40 years of negative discourse and rhetoric and how that can lead to a certain result in a referendum.  There are certainly challenges but I do not see a demand across the EU member states for significant treaty change by the citizens.  </p> <p>  In terms of the traffic light system, the Deputy correctly outlined some of the challenges in terms of how we even consider travel between different EU member states.  For example, in some barrios in Madrid, if one lives in apartment No. 2 on one side of the street which is in a green zone one can travel freely within that area.  However, if one lives across the road in apartment No. 7 and that zone has been deemed red, one cannot travel as freely.  It seems very challenging to even consider international travel against the backdrop of the traffic light system, as the Deputy mentioned but let us not forget that one of the core fundamental principles of the EU is that freedom to move and to travel.  How we reconcile the challenges of safeguarding, upholding and maintaining public safety, public health, public well-being and the safety and security of all of our citizens against the backdrop of this is the overarching priority, with travel being secondary to that.  I will hand over to Mr. Kiely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.109" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Kiely" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102800002#H00400"><p>I thank Ms O'Connell and I thank the members for the questions, some of which Ms O'Connell has covered.  On the vaccine not being available until 2022, I do not think that was an announcement by the Commission but rather somebody talking about something that was said by somebody from the Commission.  Somebody heard someone else talking about something and so on.  It is not a question of the Commission knowing the vaccine will be delayed or whatever.  It is just the reality that if a vaccine is given the all-clear in the next weeks or whatever, and there are positive signs at the moment, it will take a long time to get up to speed in terms of producing the billions of doses that are needed.  As I mentioned earlier, the Commission has already invested hundreds of millions of euro with a number of companies that are showing promise in terms of vaccine developments to ensure the availability of 800 million to 900 million doses.  If they were all to come through, 800 million or 900 million doses have been contracted by the Commission for the EU.  Also, the Commission has been to the forefront in terms of a global vaccine strategy.  If somebody made this comment about 2022 it is purely a statement of fact.  I do not believe anyone is disputing the fact that if and when a vaccine is available it will come piecemeal.  Member states will have to decide on the priorities.  Will it be front-line workers, people with underlying problems, etc.?  The Commission has already put forward a paper on that in regard to its strategy on future vaccination.  As we speak, some of my lords and masters at the Commission are holding a press conference to talk about the need to move forward in terms of preparing the infrastructure for vaccination etc. because we do not wait until the vaccine is approved to start setting up the system to deliver it.</p> <p>  On centralised purchasing capacity, in March or April the Commission established what we call framework contracts on personal protective equipment, PPE.  All member states have access to purchasing the necessary PPE, ventilators or whatever under that.  I am not aware of any shortages but we do not have a second wave at the moment.  We are getting there but if the system was put under strain in the same way it was put under strain in the earlier months there might be shortages.  I do not know.  At the moment I am not aware of any shortages but I believe most member states are in a good position with regard to PPE.  It may not be the same when it comes to more sophisticated equipment like ventilators, etc. but at the moment the framework contracts and the firepower is there through the European Commission and all member states have access to that.</p> <p>  In terms of deficits, that is under constant review and supervision through the Eurogroup and by the European Commission.  We have what we call the semester reports under which the Commission produces a very detailed report on policies and developments in the member states every six months.  It is under surveillance.</p> <p>  On the Multiannual Financial Framework, MFF, next generation EU and where we are on the negotiations, it is advanced but it is currently at the stage of trialogue.  It always involves the Commission but the negotiations are primarily now between the Council and the Parliament with a view to reaching an agreement.  Parliament is asking for some changes to the agreement which was done at the Heads of State level.  The Heads of State are saying this is it.  There is also the question of how to interpret the rule of law and how it will play.  There is a certain degree of optimism in terms of a deadline, which is yesterday or as soon as possible.  We need it in place both for the next generation and for the budget because programmes have to be drawn up.  Theoretically, it should be implemented next year but it takes a long time for member states to draw up these programmes.  We need it approved as soon as possible but there is a certain degree of optimism.</p> <p>  On the breakdown between grants and loans, on the next generation it is more or less 50-50.  I believe the grants were &euro;320 billion.  Out of that, Ireland gets a little more than &euro;1 billion.</p><p>That is down to the fact that the criteria, the key used in distributing the grants, were based on GDP over recent years, unemployment and population.  Fortunately, Ireland has done very well on unemployment and GDP over recent years but, unfortunately, the result is that it does not get perhaps as big a share of these grants as would be hoped for.</p><p> On the loans side, it is the Commission that is borrowing with the backing of the EU.  That is a lot of firepower, so I think the Commission will always get a better interest rate than Ireland, even though Ireland can get a very good rate at present.  I think the last bond from the EU was subject to a negative interest rate.  Perhaps Ireland will want to go its own way - I do not know - but it certainly will be somewhat attractive to Ireland and attractive to some other member states to borrow through Next Generation EU.</p><p> The traffic light system is not academic.  It is very important to have such criteria to define regions as high-risk, low-risk, etc., but it is only one step in the whole process.  As I said, some of the Commissioners are, I think, giving a press conference at the moment.  Certainly, we are publishing material today from the European Commission on moving forward on a common approach on quarantine, more testing, faster testing, etc.  The traffic light system fits into this mosaic and is a very important part of it but on its own does not solve anything.  It is just one part of the process.</p></speech>

My questions are directed towards Mr. Kiely.  Senator McDowell has covered my first one somewhat.  When the vaccines become available, how does Mr. Kiely anticipate their being fairly distributed among member states over the next 18 to 24 months?</p> <p>  Can Mr. Kiely speak to the measures the EU is taking in conjunction with the online platforms to ensure that Covid fact-checking reaches wider audiences?  This is in reference to misinformation on Covid-19 being put into the public discourse.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1642" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102800002#J00300"><p>I thank both witnesses for their presentations and for coming before the committee.  I wish to touch on just three issues.  The first is the relaxation of state aid rules, which has been a topic of conversation here over many years in the context of the restrictions state aid places on the Government in supporting industry.  For how long do the witnesses see this relaxation being in place, and to what extent does it free up the Government to assist industry?  I ask this question with Ireland West Airport Knock in mind.  Support for the airport has been challenging to get because of the way in which it is constituted and because of state aid rules.  It is in such dire straits financially at the moment and is of such strategic importance to the north west.  It is based in County Mayo but services the entire north-west region.  If we were ever to lose that connectivity, that link and the airport itself, I think it would be devastating for the region.</p> <p>  My next question concerns Next Generation EU and the &euro;750 billion in additional funds that will be there to assist member states to cope with Covid-19 in addition to the new MFF.  It states on the Commission's website that this will be targeted at member states and sectors most affected by Covid-19.  Can the witnesses shed some light as to what the criteria will be or how it will be decided how these funds will be allocated and what Ireland as a member state can expect to receive from the fund?</p> <p>  Finally, I have a question about the issue of youth unemployment.  Our youth unemployment is currently at over 35% for those under the age of 25.  This is partially due to the fact that many young people are employed in those sectors worst hit by Covid-19: hospitality, tourism and retail.  Many of these younger people are working on zero-hour contracts, while others are in precarious employment, doing shift work or part-time work or working hours that change week on week, depending on the demands of business.  My concern and my fear, which I am sure is replicated in lots of other member states, is that many of those jobs will not return, certainly in the short term.  From a European Union perspective, what is happening at that level to address the issue of massive youth unemployment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Kiely" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102800002#J00400"><p>I thank the Members for their questions.  On vaccine distribution, the Commission has already put forward a paper to member states prompting discussion.  It remains to be seen, but as far as availability through a central body is concerned, whether a commission or some other body, it will be a function of population, front-line workers and priority needs.  We are not yet at the stage of saying X country will get Y number of vaccines, but there is a discussion taking place.  I suppose it will come down to some function of population, front-line workers, people in need, demographics, etc., at the beginning, until vaccine production ramps up.</p> <p>  The issue of fake news is not new.  The Commission and the European External Action Service, EEAS, have in place monitoring to address the question of fake news in general and have beefed up this in the context of Covid.</p> <p>  I do not know how long more the relaxation of state aid rules will stand.  Neither the Commission nor the member states have given any indication in that regard other than to say it is not a permanent arrangement.  Of course, before there was ever a relaxation due to Covid, member states were allowed to grant state aid under specific rules.</p> <p>  As for the Next Generation funds, the key for their allocation has been already agreed.  As I mentioned, this was done on the basis of population, GDP and unemployment over recent years for 70% of the grant part of Next Generation.  The grant part amounts to &euro;315 billion, 70% of which has been distributed to the member states.  Ireland got, I think, &euro;1.27 billion.  The 30% will be decided in 2022 or 2023, I think, on the basis of the impact of Covid.  As for the drawing down of that money, it is up to each member state to put forward its programme or plan.  Some member states have submitted draft plans already.  We have been asking for them since November.  The deadline for the plans is, I believe, next April.  The drawing down and spending of the money on each sector will be subject to discussion between the member state authorities and the Commission.  Subsequently, I believe those plans will have to be approved by the member states in a Council body.</p> <p>  Youth unemployment is a problem not just because of Covid; it has been a problem for decades and was a particular problem post the economic crash.  Many EU schemes focusing on youth unemployment are already in place.  In the future MFF, it was already foreseen that there would be a very strong emphasis on funding to deal with youth unemployment, whether through education, training, apprenticeships, etc.  As for the drawing down of the Next Generation EU funds, it is for the member states to determine where they will focus the spending of that money.  Certainly, youth unemployment is worse due to Covid.  There is no question about that, and I agree totally with Senator Chambers's comments.  It is not, however, a new development and the Commission has not just discovered it.  The focus has been there and, as I said, was very much reinforced in the MFF for the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noelle O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102800002#J00500"><p>I thank Mr. Kiely, Deputy Duffy and Senator Chambers.  I will not repeat Mr. Kiely's comments - he has dealt with many of the questions - but I will respond to Senator Chambers on the youth unemployment figures and the very stark reminder of the risk this coronavirus pandemic will potentially create a lockdown generation, as it has been called, with young people being disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.</p><p>What we have seen with the youth guarantee and a reinforced youth employment support package, which the European Parliament has supported, is an agreement to bring in measures to reinforce that youth guarantee and look at improving vocational education and training, a renewed impetus across member states for apprenticeships and additional measures to combat youth unemployment.  As we saw only last week, Eurofound, the EU agency in Loughlinstown, held a very timely conference following on from its cross-EU survey in terms of looking at the impact of Covid on young people, mental health and employment and education opportunities.  The EU is very much minded to introduce and implement measures to ensure the impact on young people is lessened.  </p><p> I mentioned disinformation waves in my address.  As Mr. Kiely noted, we saw the joint communication from the Commission and the high representative following on from the March Council summit about how EU institutions will work to target the disinformation waves that have hit Europe during the coronavirus pandemic while ensuring that, as democratic societies, we deal with that challenge.  In particular, the external action service has an "EU vs Disinformation" website, we have a rapid alert system that the European Parliament, the Council and other EU institutions and member states have set up in terms of using those established channels and looking at an EU integrated political crisis response to dealing with this in addition to partnering with international partners such as the World Health Organisation and the G7 rapid response mechanism because it is not simply a challenge facing the EU and its member states and institutions.  It is a global challenge and one on which the EU must continue to partner and collaborate with international institutions and fight back against this.  The EU has stepped up to the plate and has become more active and engaged on this issue, which we certainly welcome.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.116" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102800002#K00200"><p>I have a question regarding the national recovery and resilience plans member states are being asked to submit as part of their national reform plan, which is part of the semester.  Is that contingent on member states implementing the country-specific recommendations, CSRs, from last year or the previous year?  Is there a stick here as well as a carrot?</p> <p>  Ms O'Connell said that some member states were talking about increasing the budget.  Were they states that are mainly net contributors or were they those that were getting more from the budget?  It has always been the case that in general, citizens of member states that are net contributors do not see an increase in the EU budget as a positive measure.  </p> <p>  Ms O'Connell spoke about polls showing a majority of people being in favour of more competences to deal with crises.  This is largely because of the experience of Covid where people can see the value of co-ordinated action, be it around PPE, vaccines or research.  When it comes to expanding or increasing competences, a number of colleagues have already spoken about their aversion to treaty change and I must say that I agree.  In the area of health, however, there are real possibilities for what one might call competence creep, for example, the cross-border healthcare directive.  That came about because of the free movement of people and services.  The EU qualifications directive is, again, an important piece of legislation upon which we could build.  Horizon 2020 and the European reference frameworks for rare diseases and orphan drugs are other examples.  There is quite a lot on which we can build.  We can use certain treaty articles, particularly around free movement, that would allow us to expand our competences in this area.  After the last crisis, which was the financial crisis, we got banking union so after this crisis, we will probably find ways to expand EU competences.  In one of her first speeches, President von der Leyen spoke about the cancer strategy she wanted to implement.  Has there been any further talk about that or has Covid overtaken it?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1667" speakername="Vincent P Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102800002#K00300"><p>A more immediate and pressing spotlight is on the flu vaccine.  Admittedly there is an increase but the HSE underestimated the uptake of it.  In this EU state, we always suffer from overcrowding, particularly at the peak of winter.  I know it is a competence for member states but are the witnesses aware of the extent of this shortage and crisis and GPs' concern about their patients in other member states regarding the lack of forward planning to ensure there are sufficient quantities of flu vaccine to roll out?  It is not as bad with children but in the case of adults, the HSE has held its hands up in a few written circulars and said there is a shortage.  Is there anything the witnesses can do in their supportive co-ordinating role?</p> <p>  As the second wave rages in the EU - I am thinking of Belgium and many other countries - it leads me to think that it is the little things in life that create difficulties and divisions.  We are at one on the big things in life.  What is the extent of practical co-operation and consultation with the UK going forward into next year because this disease will be around for a while even when we get the vaccine?  I am talking about information, expert data sharing and tapping into practical teaming up with the UK as our nearest neighbour.  What is the extent of the formalised structures in place in a reciprocal arrangement with the UK as it is about to say farewell to the EU?  The pandemic is a bit like climate change.  It knows no borders and recognises no membership of unions.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Kiely" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102800002#K00400"><p>In response to Deputy Harkin, I am not sure why we might need a stick in terms of having countries present their national recovery and resilience plans.  The carrot is there for all countries.  Without a plan, a country gets no money and all countries are going to get money.  In Ireland's case, on the grants side, the figure is &euro;1.2 billion or &euro;1.3 billion.  I do not think we will have any difficulty getting the plans.</p><p>We may have some long, difficult discussions on their content but this is normal with all programmes.  Covid will have an impact for some time so we are not just talking about the &euro;750 billion.  The plans for future access to EU funding under the multi-annual financial framework, be they related to the Common Agricultural Policy, structural funds, cohesion funding or Horizon 2021-2027, will be influenced by Covid.  I do not believe the plans for accessing EU funds that will be put forward now will be totally different from those of the future so I do not see any difficulty.</p><p> On the cancer strategy, I will have to revert to the Deputy.  Covid is dominating everything for the moment, just as it is at member state level.  That does not mean all work has stopped in the Commission in other areas.  It is going on but it has not crossed my desk.  I am not aware of it but I will certainly be happy to check what is happening and revert to the Deputy.</p><p> Given that health is a member state competence, although it has almost become an EU competence because of Covid, but only in the area of Covid, it has not crossed my radar that a shortage of flu vaccine has been a problem in other member states.  If there is a shortage of the flu vaccine here, I am sure the problem will arise in other member states.</p><p> On co-operation with the UK, we are still in a transition phase.  The UK is participating at the EU committees as an observer.  There is full co-operation.  What form that co-operation will take in the future depends on what happens in the negotiations taking place this week and the kind of agreement we will have in the end.  Certainly, in the context of the pandemic, everyone would want co-operation to continue.</p></speech>

I concur with Deputy Harkin's comments.  May I turn to the carrot and stick and that old chestnut of the budget?  The Deputy referred to contributions by member states to the bigger EU budget.  The bigger question concerns whether we need to have a bigger budget.  From a European perspective, this is interesting.  The recent Eurobarometer survey considered whether the EU should have a bigger budget to overcome the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Interestingly, across the EU an average of 54% were in favour of greater contributions by member states to ensure the EU would have a larger budget.  It comes back to the question of solidarity and how enhanced solidarity can be effective in the EU in combating the effects of the coronavirus.  As Deputy Harkin will be well aware, there are different ends of the spectrum in terms of which countries favour larger contributions and which do not.  Ireland needs to be mindful of this.  In our annual poll, we asked whether EU countries, including Ireland, should contribute more to the EU budget.  This year, 41% disagreed and 35% agreed.  Interestingly, 24% said they did not know.  I am sure this will form part of a topic for the Conference on the Future of Europe.  I fully concur on the benefits of Horizon 2020 and I concur that cross-border health directives and the European Qualifications Framework are very much reflective of the positive benefits of an EU acting in solidarity and partnership.</p> <p>  On Senator Martin's questions on the winter flu vaccines of other member states, there is anecdotal evidence that some member states may have a tradition of citizens taking the flu jab regularly.  For example, more than 65% of UK senior citizens regularly get the flu jab whereas the figure for Poland is significantly lower.  It is probably a challenge to ensure an adequate supply.  As Mr. Kiely has outlined, that there are five or seven companies from which the European Commission has contractually considered taking hundreds of millions of potential vaccine doses comprises a welcome step in this regard.</p> <p>  As members well know, the challenges Brexit will pose on this island are significant but I hope collaboration and co-operation will still continue, but perhaps in a different format when the transition period ends at the end of this year.  I hope, however, that the new format will not lessen the impact of the strong bilateral relationships that exist between our two islands, particularly in terms of co-operation and collaboration.  Mr. Paul Reid of the HSE mentioned that the UK's National Health Service had sought assistance from Ireland to help with its testing.  That is really welcome and it is important that it continue. </p></speech>

I do not wish to repeat any of the questions asked by my colleagues.  It is very welcome to see the EU, in all its force, kicking in and supporting its member states in response to the pandemic.</p> <p>  There is an adage about never letting a crisis go to waste and using it as an opportunity.  Commissioner Margrethe Vestager announced some weeks ago that she has major reforms planned for December on making platforms responsible for the content individuals such as you and me post on them.  It is a question of ensuring very large technology companies do not take advantage of their size so their business models will perform better than those of competitors.</p> <p>  The report issued yesterday, Technology and Democracy, which is the understanding the influence of online activity on democracies across Europe and the rest of the world, indicates Facebook knows more about me than my husband of 25 years, which is a bit mad.  Are Ms Vestager's ambitions brave enough?  Will the member states support her?  Will her proposals be realised sooner rather than later?  Normally across the EU and its institutions, it takes ten years for a really good idea to be implemented.  I am really keen to see us use the opportunity arising from this crisis to get something positive out of it.</p></speech>

They both used phrases such as "air travel", "ports", "border", "mobility", "movement of goods and essential services", "green lanes" and "EU traffic light systems."  In a surreal way, therefore, we could be listening to a presentation on Brexit.  At this 11th hour, as the perfect storm of a deadly second wave of Covid intensifies and as the Brexit deadline of 1 January 2021 looms, can we separate the discussions on Covid-19 and Brexit?  Do they have to be considered in a more joined-up manner?  Ms O'Connell made a point about whether we can separate extremism, disinformation and populism from discussions on the pandemic.  That is the first question.</p> <p>  My second question is in a similar vein to that of Senator Doherty.  It concerns the opportunities that arise.  When we reflect on this crisis in 20 or 30 years, questions will be asked as to whether we responded quickly enough and whether interventions were made at an early juncture.  The sum of &euro;750 billion has been flagged for a considerable period.  Covid has been with us since March so we are four months from our first anniversary.  When will member states see some of the money?  I am aware that Mr. Kiely has answered that question already.  A more pertinent question is whether we could be more deliberate, efficient and reactive in spending the money.</p><p>In light of the work that Noelle and her team at European Movement Ireland, EMI, have done on research with regard to our citizens feeling their voices are not being heard, the longer we talk about money being available and not being drawn down or spent, it creates a weakness.</p><p> Mr. Kiely referred to a figure of &euro;5 billion flagged for Brexit.  With Ireland being the EU member state most exposed, is &euro;5 billion enough?  What assurances can the EU Commission give to ensure there can be a quicker turnaround in advancing payment to EU member states?</p></speech>

Never waste a good crisis is certainly one expression we have heard.  I could not possibly comment on Facebook knowing more about Senator Doherty than her husband.</p> <p>We have seen the importance of the role played by communication and social media platforms in the Covid crisis.  While they have misinformation and disinformation present, they equally provide sources of information, facts, engagement and dialogue.  The Vestager report is interesting on how these platforms are used.  I am aware it is one aspect the Commission will be looking at.  We will have to continue to engage with the social media platforms to have this important and timely conversation.</p> <p>   I shall now turn to the Chairman's questions.  As the Chairman has correctly said, it is impossible to divorce or dissociate the effects of the Covid pandemic from Brexit.  It is difficult to silo them and attempt to resolve them in isolation.  We have seen that Brexit has probably taken somewhat of a back seat as the Coronavirus pandemic focus has, understandably, driven efforts, conversations and attention.  There is a risk with that, as this committee is well aware.  The challenges facing Ireland are significant as we approach the end of the transition period.  Hopefully that radio silence is positive and welcome in terms of the possibility of some form of a deal being reached.  That will be welcome.</p> <p>  With regard to hindsight and looking back, the question arose as to whether the EU responded quickly enough.  I alluded to this in my remarks.  The EU is a little bit like a tanker.  It takes a lot of Croke Park football fields to turn it around to change course and direction.  It is probably more of a marathon runner than a sprinter.  In something as challenging as this Covid pandemic, the effects of which, sadly, will be with us for a while to come, it is encouraging and welcome to see that the EU has adapted and has gotten into its stride more effectively.  The member states have also begun to collaborate and co-ordinate more efficiently, thereby leading and lending to the greater effectiveness and efficacy of the European Union as a hugely important actor in combatting the worst effects of this pandemic for all of its citizens.</p></speech>

I certainly would not go so far as to say that one of my Commissioners will not be brave enough.  Ms Vestager has shown great bravery in dealing with these multinationals and no doubt she will continue to do so.  It remains to be seen whether member states will follow.  The Commission does not always get the support from member states that we feel we should get.</p> <p>  Senator Martin referred to the matter of disinformation.  In the text of my full submission I mentioned that the EU has dealt with more than 300 disinformation narratives on Covid and we are very active in that area.  We will continue to put pressure on social media platforms in all areas, and not just as far as Covid is concerned.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked if &euro;5 billion is enough for Brexit.  I am sure if it were &euro;10 billion people would say it is not enough.  It is what the heads of State have agreed; it is all there is available.  It is a lot of money.  The issue will be the share out, if and when.  Whether it will be necessary will depend, to a large extent, on the outcome of the negotiations.  In reality, whether it is enough or not, it is all that is available.  It remains to be seen, but I would expect that given Ireland is more exposed by Brexit than any other member state, Ireland will get fairly favourable treatment under that fund.</p> <p>  On when the money will be available, it will not be available from the Multiannual Financial Framework, MFF, before January next year irrespective of when there is an agreement, but from the Next Generation it can be available as soon as there is an agreement.  Money is already available, and I believe that Ireland has already tapped into it, although not from the Next Generation fund.  There is a &euro;100 billion fund called EU SURE, to deal with unemployment caused by Covid.  That can be tapped into and I believe Ireland has already tapped into it.  In the past six months the Commission has already emptied the drawers of all funds that were available and they were made available to all member states.  Anything that could be done in funding was done.  We cannot tap into anything until we have an agreement, which is why the Council and the Parliament need to get on with it and get an agreement as soon as possible.  Once that agreement is there, things will move very fast because there is recognition that the money needs to get out there to help the economy and to help the people who are impacted.</p></speech>

If they were not, which seems to be the case judging by the public statement from the HSE, can we write to the HSE to establish why they were not and whether there is a requirement for the HSE to have checks and balances to ensure the quality and safety of products?  I acknowledge that responsibility rests primarily with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine but this is &euro;9 million of defective products.  People have questions about procurement, which is ongoing with the HSE.  There is not a week when the Committee of Public Accounts is not made aware of a lack of compliance with procurement rules at the HSE.  This issue, however, is quite serious.  Can we further ask the HSE what steps it is taking to recoup the moneys?  We spent &euro;9 million on products that are not fit for purpose.  How will the State get the money back?</p> <p>  The other issue relates to the establishment of the CervicalCheck tribunal.  I am aware that meetings were held on Saturday and Monday with representatives of the 221+ group.  A commitment was given to that group that the tribunal would be paused, yet the statutory instrument, if I am reading it correctly, was signed on Friday night.  The members of the group are outraged and very concerned.  In fact, Vicky Phelan used the word "betrayed", which is a strong word but, obviously, that is how she feels.  We need to get to the bottom of this.  The Minister for Health will appear before the committee next week.  Can we put him on notice that this is an issue we want to be addressed?  He nonetheless needs to address it before the meeting.  This is an issue of public concern and the Minister has a duty to set the record straight.  We might also ask him, given that he signed the statutory instrument, whether he can revoke it.  I assume he can, which he should do if that is what the group wants.  I ask that we write to the Minister specifically on that.  Through the medium of this meeting and previously through social media platforms, I have called on him to clarify his position immediately .  That is important for the group in question.</p></speech>

I believe he will make an announcement concerning the criteria for medical card qualification, an issue on which John Wall has been very vocal.

No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, the evidence given is covered by a statutory nature.

Joining me today are Dr. Kevin Kelleher, assistant national director of public health, and Mr. Damien McCallion, national director of emergency management.</p> <p>  Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the HSE has worked tirelessly to build a robust testing and tracing infrastructure.  It is important to acknowledge the extent of what has been achieved.  To date, we have established a system that has enabled us to complete more than 1.54 million tests, identify 58,000 detected cases and complete more than one quarter of a million contact tracing calls.  Last week, we processed more than 115,000 tests, exceeding the capacity set out by 15%.</p> <p>  We all know that caution is required when making international comparisons, but as for how our testing numbers compare against those of our European neighbours, as reported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, we are ranked second among countries with a population of more than 2 million of the 28 European countries that the ECDC reports on.  We are outranked only by Denmark.  In addition, many countries do not test close contacts as a routine, such as the UK, the Netherlands and most recently Belgium, while some countries such as Germany, specifically in the Berlin region, Switzerland and the Netherlands have requested people to trace their own close contacts.</p> <p>  We remain agile in our approach when responding to the Covid-19 pandemic and have driven continual improvement within our systems and processes.  We have focused on turnaround times and, during the current peak in the pandemic, we have been achieving 95% of swabbing appointments on the same day or the next day, and more than 95% of results in less than 48 hours from the swabbing appointment, two thirds of which occur within 36 hours.  These metrics compare very well against those of our European colleagues.  Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark all work with 48 hours or less as a target from swabbing to result.  We are meeting all testing demand and are still working within our testing capacity.</p> <p>  Since the beginning of this pandemic, we have built up capacity at our testing centres and acute hospitals.  These services are stood up by healthcare professionals, community swabbers, the National Ambulance Service and Defence Forces personnel.  To ensure we have the required staff, we have engaged in a recruitment campaign for swabbers, contact tracers and public health doctors.  We continually assess the needs in the community and identify areas where improved access to local testing is needed.  In recent weeks, this has included a large-scale testing centre in Croke Park, a testing centre in Galway city and an additional pop-up centre in Cork city.  Capacity at our laboratories has also been increased, so that today we can process more than 120,000 tests per week, with our logistics team working to forecast demand accurately each week.</p> <p>  We have set up and are continuing to deliver numerous serial testing programmes.  This has included more than 291,000 tests for staff in residential care facilities, food production facilities and both residents and staff of direct provision centres.</p><p>These programmes have been set up in response to these settings being noted as at higher risk and their residents among the most vulnerable in our society.  We are one of the few countries to conduct and maintain serial testing throughout peak testing demand.</p><p> As well as caring for these high-risk groups, we have an enhanced pathway for schoolgoing children and staff in school settings, ensuring that once we are aware of a detected case associated with a school setting, it is managed by our public health departments and turned around in the most optimal time, recognising the high importance of keeping schools open.  There is a constant need to balance the demands between individuals feeling unwell in the community, outbreaks in congregated settings and testing in higher risk settings through serial testing programmes.</p><p> We have worked and will continue to work to ensure that our testing and contact tracing system is robust and performant.  However, the increase in demand and the number of detected cases in our community in October has challenged our systems, particularly our contact tracing service.  The rapid rise in the number of cases in early October exceeded the capacity of our contact tracing system as it was set up.  For context, six weeks ago we were making 8,500 calls a week but this increased last week to 38,000 and we struggled with this capacity.</p><p> In response to this, and in a continuing effort to maintain effective turnaround times for contact tracing for the population at large, we asked a limited number of people, 1,971, who received a positive result from 16 October to 18 October to notify their own close contacts and organise tests through their GPs.  This decision was taken to ensure that every person received information as quickly as possible, allowing them to be aware of their status and to take actions to care for themselves and to protect others from infection.  While clearly this was not ideal and we appreciate the impact on those affected, it was deemed the only viable option in order to deal with the most recent cases quickly and reset our system.  We apologise to the 1,971 people impacted and this week we will call everybody we missed to check that they have been able to identify their contacts and advise them to be tested.  Since Friday, 23 October, our contact tracing system has been back on track and achieving its metric of all close contacts being contacted within 24 hours of the notification of the positive case.</p><p> In order to ensure we will be able to address future demand, the HSE is continuing to recruit additional contact tracers.  More than 800 people have gone through our interview process, 274 new staff have been taken on board and a further 90 will join by the end of this week.  We will continue to bring in an additional 60 to 70 every week.  We plan to recruit 800 and then see if we need more.</p><p> As this pandemic develops, we continue to respond as effectively as possible while designing and implementing a long-term, sustainable test and trace operating model.  The Covid-19 disease does not follow any plan.  It is unpredictable and continues to challenge us all individually and equally challenge our testing and tracing service.  We continue to do our utmost in our response, ensuring sufficient testing capacity and optimal turnaround times, all in the interests of public health.</p></speech>

They are all very welcome.  They know the format of these meetings.  The various political groupings ask questions.  They have ten minutes each in the first round.  They are supposed to get their replies within those ten minutes, within reason.  The first group comprises Senators Kyne and Conway.</p></speech>

It is only fair that it should be put on the record that, on the whole, the HSE is doing a difficult job but it is well recognised among the public that the job is being done very well.  Ms O'Beirne and her team deserve to be commended on that.  I wish to put a number of questions to the witnesses.</p> <p>  In Ms O'Beirne's opening statement she spoke about the split between clinical expertise in the contact tracing structure and level 2, as she described it.  It is supposed to be a 40:60 split.  Is that split being achieved?  If so, are the clinical people all from the HSE or have any of them at this stage been recruited outside of the public health system?</p> <p>  I would be interested to know how the HSE's customer service engagement is going.  The HSE is obviously calling quite a number of people - I would think five on average for each positive case.  How are the public responding?  I get it that someone might be very upset to receive a call from one of the HSE's contact tracing people.  What is the proportion of, say, difficult or aggressive engagements?  Do the witnesses feel contact tracers are getting overwhelming co-operation or just average co-operation?  As far as Ms O'Beirne's team's experience with this is concerned, do the witnesses feel there is buy-in from the people getting these calls pointing out that they have been identified as close contacts?</p> <p>  Those are my first questions.  I will come back in later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102800002#B00400"><p>I thank Ms O'Beirne and her team.  As for the clinical side of things, I understand from an individual I know who does contact tracing for the HSE that the call one's are the calls to tell people they are positive.  Is it absolutely necessary for those calls to be made by a person with clinical experience?  I understand that part of the reason there were delays during the surge is that the HSE did not have enough clinical staff or staff with a clinical background.  Is it a clinical or a science background?  What are the specifics in that regard?  Is such a background an absolute requirement?  Why is it necessary?  Is it because someone may have a difficult question about Covid?  Could such a person be transferred over to somebody else?  Would that not speed up the process?</p> <p>  The second area I wish to speak about is the testing.  Are all speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and HSE dentists back in their old roles or are they still carrying out testing?  Is there a timeline for those very important service providers to be back in their front-line positions?  One of the main complaints I have received about the whole test and trace system is that front-line staff are being taken away from their important work to carry out this work.  I understand that at the start, when the HSE was under pressure, it may have been necessary to have all hands on deck and get people who were available, but speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and dentists are hugely important in their own right in the work they should be doing, and they should be back at their work.</p></speech>

Regarding the surveillance, I know that when the crash point happened recently enough, the HSE reduced the number of questions it asked when contacting people.  I am curious to know whether the HSE has gone back to normal in that regard.</p> <p>  How effective do the witnesses find the app?  Has the HSE done any quality tracking of it?  Is it synchronising as the HSE would like in terms of the physical contacts it is given?  Then there is the question of the app automatically activating.</p> <p>  Finally, the witnesses might give us a breakdown of what the testing has cost the taxpayer so far.</p></speech>

The witnesses have about five minutes to answer those ten questions, so I wish them the best of luck.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.146" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Beirne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102800002#B00700"><p>So far we have recruited 274 people, about 25% of whom have been clinical staff.  Overall, as we mentioned in our briefing note, we need about 40% of the team to be clinical to balance the teams that are non-clinical.  To respond to the question why they are clinical, our tracers speak to people about their illness and talk to them about their self-isolation and restricted movement, and it is very important that people understand what they need to do.  In addition, patients can be quite anxious when they receive the news, as Senator Conway mentioned, so it takes some time to talk them through what they need to do and to spend time with them gathering their close contacts and their information.  Our recruitment is ongoing and we keep the balance as we recruit to make sure we have enough on both sides, clinical and non-clinical.</p> <p>  We were asked a question about our experience with people on the phone and how they react.  Our tracers sometimes have difficult phone calls with people, particularly those who are close contacts.  They find being told very difficult because it means they need to restrict their movements for 14 days and also need to do tests.</p><p>Unlike a standard call centre call, these calls can take quite a long time and are really important.  A tracer could spend up to an hour trying to convince people to go for a test but they would generally be in the minority.  The vast majority of people are receptive to our tracers and would follow the public health advice and attend their test.  We have seen a much higher number of people turning up for their day one tests, more than 92% at the moment, and the day zero test is up in the 60s, which is much higher than it was in the summer.</p><p> The Senator also asked about reducing the questions.  As of this week, we are still operating on a reduced level of questions.  We will bring this back so over the next six weeks we will start to increase the number of questions we ask to increase the amount of retrospective tracing we do.  That will become very important when we have low levels of the disease.  Dr. Kelleher may wish to add something on that point.</p></speech>

Of course it would be better to have the full thing but we had to balance that with the need to ensure we contacted people as well.  It was a balance between the two and we struck an appropriate balance at that time.</p> <p>  I have done a number of the calls, not routinely but occasionally, and on the whole the vast majority of people are very engaged and understand what is going on and participate but occasionally some people find it very difficult.  I have not had any really difficult ones but some people have had some extremely difficult calls and that is a problem and a difficulty.  They are trying to help and yet they are getting a fair degree of abuse.  I have been in the centre when that has happened and one can see the person on our side of the call visibly wilting as a consequence of the call.  It is a difficult thing throughout this issue.</p> <p>  The app is a tool.  It is not anything other than a tool and it is to help us in our way of dealing with this.  My colleagues in public health use the information they get from the app to help them to control what is going on in the circumstances.  It becomes more important when it is involved in things like outside events, such as sporting events or things of that nature, and in schools.  We use it in those circumstances as a tool to make our assessment.  It is not an absolute statement of anything.  The reality is one could leave one's phone in one's jacket in a room with people walking in and out of the room.  Even though one might not be in the room, one would still get contacted, so we must bear these things in mind.  The app is there and it is very effective.  As always, we would absolutely suggest that more people should use the app and use it regularly.  The more people we can get using it, and using it regularly, the bigger the difference it will make because it gives a mindset to people about what they need to be doing, in that they are thinking about things as a result.</p> <p>  Mr. McCallion could take the question about the cost which I think is the only one we have left.</p></speech>

Around 118 are in contact tracing and the remainder are supporting the community swabbing sites.  As we recruit people into both centres we will bring staff back into their normal community roles.  Contact tracing has, as we said, recruited just under 280 staff so far and by next week there will be more than 350, so over time we will start to bring staff back to their normal roles.  We have reduced their roles within contact tracing already and as we faced the increases over the past number of weeks, we did not take more staff from front-line work.  We used staff from HR and environmental health to support us but we did not move back to the community staff.  Similarly with swabbing, they will also reduce as we bring in more community swabbers in the coming days and weeks.</p></speech>

The total cost of the spend on testing and tracing was of the order of &euro;163 million at the end of August.  That is split up between swabbing, labs and contact tracing which would have been a small cost to date but which will obviously increase as we bring more people in on a permanent basis.  As such, many of our costs involved reallocating people, people being seconded in or, as one of the members mentioned, in the initial response to the crisis, the reassignment of people from other duties, whereas now as we bring more people in on a full-time basis that cost will rise.  That is the expenditure this year to date in relation to the testing and tracing pathway.</p></speech>

Whatever deficiencies, or lack of capacity in, the system are certainly is not down to them.  It is a very difficult and challenging job so I take this opportunity to commend all those who are involved in that.</p> <p>  I want to unpack some of the numbers and, as I do so, I would say to Ms O'Beirne that I want precise answers to the questions because it is numbers I am looking for.  We have the context in both the opening statement and the briefing note given by the HSE.  When the briefing note from the HSE states that 581 staff are currently available to work on routine contact tracing, is that figure of 581 made up of people who are directly employed and still reassigned?  Does that 581 include the 274 new staff who have been onboarded, as it is called, as part of the recruitment target of 800?</p></speech>

It also includes 214 staff from the HSE and 93 who have come to support from other public sector bodies.</p></speech>

It is not just the staff Ms O'Beirne has detailed there but also the 300 to 400 staff in the public health departments around the country.  Both groups are involved in contact tracing.</p></speech>

If there are other people involved in tracing, the HSE officials should tell us and put it in the briefing notes they give us.  The note states: "We currently have a total of 581 staff available to work on routine contact tracing."  Therefore it is confirmed that 274 of those are people who have been recently recruited and 214 are HSE.  Does it also include the 160 environmental health officers or are they separate?</p></speech>

Why was that not done over the summer months?  In her opening statement Ms O'Beirne had to apologise to 1,961 people.  There was much commentary on whether the system was fit for purpose and whether we had used the summer months wisely.  We are now being told that 60 or 70 staff will be recruited per week.  Why only 60 or 70?  Why can that not be accelerated?  Leaving that aside though, why was this not done in the summer?</p><p>If we had all of those staff in place, it may well have been the case that the system may not have collapsed and the HSE would not have to come before the committee today to apologise to those people.  Why is recruitment only happening now?  Why were all of the additional staff who could have been employed during the summer months not put in place? </p><p> Does the HSE not accept that we are in the middle of a second wave?  The numbers are the highest they have been at any point in time.  They went down a little bit in recent days.  Over the past week we have seen cases in excess of 1,200 a day, the highest at any point in the pandemic.  Yet, we only have 581 people available for contact tracing, a figure that will increase to 800.  Why was recruitment not done during the summer months?  It is an obvious question that people will ask.</p></speech>

Those staff then returned to their roles.  There was a significant decline in cases.  In June and July, they had all returned and left us with a small number of staff.</p></speech>

The HSE planned to have 800 by the end of the year.  In my view, it should have at least 800 today but it does not.  Whether staff left for whatever reason is irrelevant from my perspective.  The HSE has to plan and make sure that we have a tracing regime that is fit for purpose.  If there will be 800 by the end of the year, why do we not have 800 today?  Why were staff not recruited during the summer months when we needed them as a second wave came?  We are in the middle of it now and we only have 591.  It is an obvious and direct question.  Why were the additional staff that were needed not hired earlier?  Why has the recruitment process only started over the past number of weeks?</p></speech>

Role descriptions had to be developed, approved and put out.  They went out over August with the bigger campaign beginning in September.  We received 2,500 applications.  We had to go through them, interview people and then go through standard compliance checking.  That is what has been going on over the past number of weeks and months to bring in the staff we have had.</p> <p>  It is not ideal that we did not have enough staff for the number of cases of the virus in the country.  In early October, cases increased from 544 to 1,000 overnight.  We missed all of the numbers in between.  There was a jump.  We moved from 8,500 calls six weeks ago to nearly 40,000 calls.  We had met demand, but it exceeded the capacity we had at that time.  We will continue to recruit and are working very hard on that.  Training and onboarding has to be done in a managed and quality assured way and everything requires clinical cover.</p></speech>

I will put my questions when I finish my point.</p> <p>  It is immaterial how many cases there were during the summer months because we know that lockdowns are used to reduce the numbers.  The time is then used to build up defences so that when the number of cases increases we have very robust testing and tracing that can then be used to hunt down and stay ahead of the virus.  That did not happen because we do not have the capacity today.  There are 581 today and the HSE hopes to have 800 by the end of the year.  Ms O'Beirne said that is not ideal.  That is an understatement in terms of how people will see it, especially the 1,900 people that the HSE had to apologise to.</p> <p>  I have practical questions on how this impacts people.  An elderly patient who is due for a scope in Bantry Hospital in County Cork contacted me.  He was told he had to go for a Covid test and had to travel to Cork city, a two-hour round trip.  Yet, there is a testing centre 4 km from him his home.  Why is this happening?  There are any number of examples where people had to travel far beyond where they live when there are testing centres close to them.</p> <p>  I received an email from a HSE official which confirmed to me that teachers and SNAs are being told to disable the Covid app when they go to work.  Are the witnesses aware of that?  Can they confirm whether and why it happens?</p></speech>

Most hospital also work with patients in terms of transport for procedures or pre-admission tests, if required.  I will be happy to follow up on the specifics behind the case in Cork University Hospital.  Each hospital makes those decisions locally in terms of patients and travel arrangements for testing.

What has it learned from the last phase?</p> <p>  I keep referencing the Spanish flu in terms of precedents.  I do not think we should forget about it.  There was a second wave in October and November and a third surge in March and April.  We may predict that.  It would be terrific if it did not happen, but that was the pattern 100 years ago.</p> <p>  What have the witnesses learned over the past number of months?

The topic most on our minds at the moment is the importance of staying ahead of the virus.  Overall, in terms of testing and tracing we are looking to gain a workforce of 3,000 or 4,000 between swabbing, laboratories and contact tracing.  As part of that, we have to build up the swabbing sites of which there are 37 at the moment.</p> <p>  In addition, we are working with the National Ambulance Service to build mobile sites that move at a fast pace and open up quickly.  They can do 300 or 400 tests at one time.  We have definitely learnt about the importance of pop-up sites.  We can open sites really quickly when there is particular demand in a small area.  That is something we will have a permanent infrastructure around and a response to in terms of adding additional swabbing capacity where we need to.</p></speech>

We believe that number will manage.</p> <p>  We need to bring forward a few other things with that, such as our technology roadmap to allow close contacts to organise their own tests.  That will be available within the next few weeks and will be important.

However, I am very concerned that we use the current period really well to prepare for and anticipate a third surge.  I assume the witnesses are likewise anticipating a third wave of infections.</p><p> My next question relates to the tracking system.  The level of testing now taking place is very impressive by any standards and the witnesses have my congratulations on that.  I thank them for bringing it up to that scale.  I understand that the HSE is employing people specifically to do the tracing work.  Tracking contacts and ensuring they isolate is a very important part of the response to Covid.  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p></speech>

The clear issue in this regard is to do with the level of socialisation.  As we can see, the number of contacts rose when we moved out of tighter restrictions.  We got it down to two or three but it then went up again as time moved on.  That is the crucial issue and the one thing that will always hit us in the context of capacity.  If we get to the point where we are back to the sorts of numbers we can cope with, which would be individuals having only three or four contacts each, then we would be in a good position.  However, if the contacts go up above five, six or ten, as they have done, that is when we have real problems and there are suddenly a massive number of calls to be made to contacts.  We have to look at how we go about keeping that number down into the future.  We can look at some of the measures that are being used elsewhere.  As Ms O'Beirne said, it could involve making use of technology which is being used in similar situations around the world.  We are trying to get to that point.  The big issue is that we need to make sure people understand the importance of adhering to certain rules.  The main thing they should do - this is the general message for people, as well as the specific message we are looking to put out -  is to reduce social contacts, particularly when they know they are ill.</p></speech>

I am sorry if I seem rude, which is not my intention, but we are very restricted as to time.  The HSE has a five-week window to get this right.

I do not think the airlines and airport authorities ever anticipated that the HSE or public health unit would cover the cost of operating, or take responsibility for operating, testing and tracing measures in an airport context.  I assume, based on the experience elsewhere in Europe, that this would be done privately and added on to the price of an airline ticket.  Do the witnesses have any views on the matter?</p></speech>

On one level, this is a policy decision.  Deputy Lahart is probably aware of the EU paper that has been published setting out proposals in this area.  We are working to ensure that whatever capacity is put into place in this sector does not impact on the overall public health provision.  That is a key consideration.  We will work closely with the Departments and aviation bodies to ensure that does not happen.  We believe a good outcome is possible given the co-operation we have had.</p> <p>  Second, we are looking at alternative testing methods as part of the work we are doing with NPHET.  That will take a little time and some of the early evidence shows there is still much to do.  We can see that from what is happening in most countries in Europe.  The polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test remains the standard method.  The airports are looking to offer that type of testing in line with some of the changes that are coming from the EU.  We are working with the relevant Departments in that regard.  Again, it is important to state that the messaging is vital in terms of ensuring that people are aware of the crucial importance of observing the public health advice.  Members may be aware of the recent case where a couple who returned from a trip abroad were responsible for a chain of infections that impacted more than 50 people.  We are working very closely with the Departments and airport authorities in this area.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their answers and apologise for bamboozling them with questions.  My final question is to ask them if they can characterise the nature of some of the difficult calls that have had to be dealt with by tracers.</p></speech>

It is a surprise and not what they wish to hear, particularly because of the implications of the requirement for 14 days of restricted movements.  There is a small cohort of parents who are refusing to have their children tested and who get very angry at any suggestion that such testing should be undertaken as a consequence of the tracking process.  I have been involved in these things for the past 30 years and it is very difficult to judge who is going to react badly until one gets into the call.  Sometimes people will come back on a subsequent call and be very annoyed about things.  They might ask why we telephoned them instead of writing to them and so on.  It is a very difficult process because it involves dealing with human nature and people have to just try to see their way through it.</p> <p>  As Ms O'Beirne said, the staff in our centres are doing exceptionally well and are spending a lot longer on calls than is absolutely necessary trying to help people to get through the process.  Equally, trying to get people to be open and honest with us about who their contacts are takes time.  It is not an easy process but people are making those efforts.  All we are asking is that people understand that we are just trying to do our job in the centres and trying to help people to control this disease.  It is not as if we are doing any of this out of any type of malice.  It is quite the opposite.  The process is difficult but we will make every effort to accommodate and work with people in those circumstances.</p></speech>

Dr. Kelleher's figure, 24 hours, about which I am not sure, is a day.  We are aware that the turnaround time from referral to a result is 2.2 days.  The most recent turnaround time from a result to tracing in the HSE's report for the past week is 3.8 days.  That gives a total of seven days from symptoms to contacts being traced.  All the indications are that the optimum time from symptoms to 80% of contacts being traced is four days.  On that basis, the performance falls very far short of what is required to ensure a testing and tracing system is effective.  I would like the witnesses' view on that.  Do they accept a period of four days is the optimum turnaround time from end to end?</p></speech>

The most recent metrics for the past couple of days indicate that in the community setting, which is where symptomatic people go to their general practitioner and have close contacts identified, the median end-to-end turnaround time for a negative result, or a "not detected" result, is two days.  The average is 2.4 days.  For a "detected" case, the median period is 2.3 days, and the average, or mean, is 2.8 days.  That is a for a complete end-to-end process, from the beginning of referral to the end of contact tracing.  The median figure for contact tracing in the past number of days is back down to one day.  That is the international metric and goal we have been seeking to achieve.  We are aware that in the most difficult week, the period rose above three days but it is now back to one day.  That is where we would really like to keep the contact tracing figure.  We have 91% of referrals in less than 24 hours, when one wants an appointment.  Some 95% of people have their swab result back in less than 48 hours, and all tracing is done in less than a day.  On the four days-----</p></speech>

The most recent figures indicate that 3.8 days is the median time for tracing: "All contact tracing is completed within 3.8 days (median) &ndash; including all complex cases".  I am just going by the figures the HSE is publishing on its own website.  The dashboard indicates the period from referral to the communication of a result is 2.2 days.  Ms O'Beirne is referring to an additional day for referral, which makes it seven days.</p></speech>

Mr. Reid was before us a number of weeks ago and asked about a pop-up centre in the part of Dublin that has the highest rate by far, Ballymun&ndash;Finglas, and the difficulties associated with accessing testing centres that are some distance from people's homes.  When can we expect to have a pop-up centre in Ballymun&ndash;Finglas?</p></speech>

We were given an undertaking in that regard.  I would appreciate it, therefore, if the witnesses could send me a note on when they propose to follow through on that undertaking to provide a pop-up centre in the Ballymun&ndash;Finglas area.</p> <p>  Can we have a schedule of staffing?  Many have referred to the fact that valuable time and opportunities were lost during the summer months.  We now have five weeks to get the testing and tracing system in place and operating properly.  Can the witnesses send us a schedule for the period between now and 1 December, when I hope the level 5 restrictions will be lifted?  Where does the HSE expect to be on 1 December in respect of both testing and tracing?  How many existing staff and other staff will be available on 1 December in each of the services?  Can the witnesses identify what element of these staff will be drawn from other front-line services?  Can the witnesses provide that detail for us?  I am not asking for it now.  I am looking for basic detail, in the form of a table or schedule of staffing, so we will know where we can expect to be on 1 December, when I hope we will be in a much better place than we are now.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions.  The second has largely been answered.  The first is on testing and tracing in schools.  Obviously, the imperative over the past couple of months has been to keep schools open for everybody involved.  In the State's primary and post-primary schools, there are 939,000 pupils and 66,000 staff, including teachers.  That is nearly 1 million people in the educational system, primary and post-primary.  As of 19 October, only 10,000 tests have been done in the school system.</p><p>That equates to 1% of the school population.  Are the witnesses absolutely confident in tracking and tracing in our schools at this time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.240" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kevin Kelleher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102800002#G00200"><p>When we are told of a case that involves either a child in school or it is clearly a member of staff at a school, the public health department immediately starts to assess with the individual or parents what is happening.  If necessary, and more often than not, they get in touch with the school to review the position within the school, doing what is now called a public health risk assessment to see what is necessary as a consequence of that case.</p> <p>  In some circumstances, because of what has happened, nothing needs to be done as the individual has not been in the school for the period in which he or she might have been infectious.  If something needs to be done, a review is done within the school of which people need to be identified and asked to restrict movements and be tested as a consequence.  That assessment is done with the school based on what happened in the school in those circumstances.  It often concentrates on the class that the individual was in or teaching or working with, and the consequence of working in that class.  Sometimes, this involves members of non-teaching staff who have virtually no contact with children or other members of staff.</p> <p>  The figure of 10,000-plus comprises the people who have been identified as being at risk as a consequence of those assessments.  It will carry on and we will keep doing it.  We are still doing things, even in the half-term, and we will start again in full flurry, I imagine, as schools start again next week.  We are doing this as effectively as possible in order to maintain schools being open so children can get their education.</p></speech>

They wrote about the SQ80, which I had never heard of before.  It describes 80% end-to-end turnaround from symptom development to testing being carried out and contact tracing being completed.  They argue that testing and tracing can be put right in six weeks.  The science behind it makes sense, although some of it goes over people's heads.  How confident are the witnesses and the HSE that the SQ80 can be done in four days?  In response to Deputy Shortall, the witnesses have said it is probably more than four days.  It is logistically difficult but Dr. Joyce and Professor McAuliffe argue it must be done or else the process is not fit for purpose.</p></speech>

Based on the article, the symptoms piece must be added.  From the communications perspective, the HSE is doing much work to continue to encourage people to come forward for tests as quickly as possible to GPs.  The tests are free and in many cases there is same-day testing, or it may go to the early part of the following day.  A test can be done quite fast, which is important, and achieving a completion rate of 91% in less than 24 hours within that overall metric is important, as is producing the result from laboratories.  Even through the peak we are delivering results in less than two days from the swabbing appointment.</p> <p>  It is continuous work in communications to ensure people come forward as quickly as possible and we work with GPs to support out-of-hours referrals as well, which is happening over the weekends and into the evenings.  This is to ensure that any time people are sick, whether on a Monday morning or Saturday evening, it is possible for them to contact a doctor and get themselves referred for a test in any of our sites that open 12 hours per day, seven days per week, to facilitate that.</p></speech>

The Government has in place an agreement with general practice that even if people are not in the general medical services, GMS, scheme, this is a totally free process.  The call and testing is totally free for the individual, regardless of GMS status.  Everybody can call up and there is no barrier whatever.  As the members quite rightly say, the big issue here is getting people to recognise this and come forward.  That is part of the public campaign and we have heard Dr. Holohan speaking about it, as well as the rest of us.  It is a very important matter.  The second part is trying to get people away from social contact once they have symptoms.  It is one of the most important parts of this process.</p></speech>

The website states something very different.  It states that from referral to result of test, it is 2.2 days, and for completion of tracing it is another 3.8 days.  That gives a total of six days plus one day from symptom to referral, meaning it is seven days.  Will the witness point us to the place we can find figures supporting her claim of 2.8 days for end-to-end testing and tracing?</p></speech>

I will ask a couple of questions on different topics.  Will Dr. Kelleher deal again with how people are contacted and the response tracers get?  In the past week, all of us, as public representatives, have received fairly nasty emails on various matters.  For example, I got one stating "I hope you die screaming" and another stating "You are nothing but scum, I hope you burn in hell".</p><p>What kind of reaction are staff getting?  Are they getting abusive reactions when they are contacted?  Is the case I am referring to an extreme one?</p><p> I raised an issue ten days ago about texting when people come in from abroad.  They fill out the locator form and get a text in the first day stating they must isolate for 14 days.  They then get a further text on the second day asking if they are in the location they said they would be.  If one replies "Yes", one gets a different text.  Then one gets a third text some time later which gives the impression that one does not have to comply with the 14-day requirement for self-isolation.</p><p> No one has confirmed to me who is sending out these texts.  The text itself does not state who sent it.  The Department of Transport has said it is not involved, as has the HSE and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We are now coming up to the Christmas period.  It must be ensured that whatever texts go out that it is clearly identified from where they are coming.  Has this issue been resolved?  No one has confirmed to me that it has.</p><p> Rapid turnaround antigen testing has been rolled out in some countries, particularly in schools.  Where does that stand here?  People with vitamin deficiencies seem to have a greater risk of contracting Covid, as well as finding it more difficult to deal with it.  Does the HSE intend to have a campaign to highlight this issue to ensure people can respond accordingly?</p></speech>

It is unpleasant.  Once or twice in my career I have been targeted in that way and it is not pleasant.<br/><br/>Regarding our staff, we have not quite got to that level, except on some of the social media which is not as personalised.  They deal with it and there are support systems in place to assist them.  It is a difficult issue.  It is not uncommon in health care that people react in a bad way because they have been given bad news.  It is part of our training to deal with it.  That is why we spoke earlier about the need to have clinicians around.  They are far more able to deal with it than some non-clinicians would be in those circumstances.  They are always around to support an individual and are on call if necessary.<br/><br/>There has been research going on around the world on vitamin deficiency.  It is not, however, as definitive, as people seem to think.  One issue which it is revealing is that, like with all diseases, if one is not in the best of health when one gets a disease, one will suffer worse from it.  A deficiency of certain vitamins, such as vitamin D, may have an impact.  We need more research on this.<br/><br/>Having said that, Ireland has a problem with vitamin D deficiency <i>per se</i>because of circumstances such as skin colour, lack of sun, etc.  It is an issue and there is a campaign trying to improve that.</p></speech>

The latter point is subject to review at EU level.</p> <p>  We have been monitoring the antigen testing for some time.  On the specificity and sensitivity of such tests, the performance of some of the early ones produced in the market has so far been poor.  In recent months, we have seen some improvement in the tests offered.</p> <p>  HIQA has just undertaken a health technology assessment of alternative testing to PCR.  It has asked the HSE to validate it in different sectors.  In simple terms, antigen tests, even the strongest ones, perform better in areas where there are symptomatic cases.  We have a high number of cases and we are currently verifying it in an outbreak setting.  In other words, if one has an outbreak, can it be used quickly to pull people out when PCR will take 24 hours to 48 hours to return?  It could be a useful tool in that regard.</p> <p>  I would be cautious, however, in the sense that the performance characteristics of many of the tests are poor.  On the back of HIQA's report, which was out last week, we have set up a group to look at the various settings to assess the performance of the test and how it could be used in conjunction with PCR.  There is a strong view that it will not replace the PCR test, the gold standard across Europe.  The WHO and the ECDC, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, have given strict guidance on its potential use.</p> <p>  Based on HIQA's report, we are validating it and we have a process under way on that.  We are working with the different sectors to see where it might have a value.  A small number of tests we believe would hit the appropriate level of performance that we could utilise.  We have our hands on one of those and we are negotiating on the other two for the purpose of this validation process.   We must run those through and see how they perform.</p> <p>  The clear recommendation from HIQA and the WHO is that it has to be run through a validation in one's own country in particular settings.  The claimed performance could vary wildly depending on the setting in which one tries it.  We have a team working on that currently.  It is one we are actively watching but it is too early to commit to its potential.</p> <p>  The WHO gave sanction for it to be used as an alternative in some developing countries which would not have access to PCR.  There are clear issues with the numbers one would miss.  If PCR is available, then it remains the standard to limit best the spread of the disease.</p></speech>

It is one of the most important things we need to make sure people understand.  Having these quick tests does not mean one no longer has to self-restrict.  If one has the symptoms or has been a close contact, it does not obviate from the need to carry on restricting one's movements as a consequence.  It is an important issue.  It makes no difference whatsoever.  We need people to understand that.  The test is not a magic bullet which gives someone freedom at all.  It is actually just an indication.  One is still bound by the public health advice to restrict one's movement for whatever period it is, depending on the circumstances.</p></speech>

Will the public hear any of the results from that?  It is a topic in which people are interested.  I know it is not the be-all and end-all but it has captured some of the public imagination.  Have the witnesses a timeline on it and will antigen testing end up being used?</p> <p>  There have been reports this morning about contact tracing staff being asked to bring in their own laptops.  While it has been reported they are not using it for any data, is this shortage of equipment having an impact on the work of the contact tracers?  Are they sharing equipment?  Are they able to do the work to the best of their ability?  If there is a shortage of equipment, what needs to be done to remedy it?</p><p>We have talked a lot about the phone calls.  I am interested in performance management.  We have heard that calls were taking up to an hour.  Is there a focus on the quality of calls and on output rather than quantity?  Are contact tracers trying to fly through as many calls as they can or is the emphasis on quality and trying to ensure that people have the information.  What are the targets and how is that managed?</p><p> Is there any support for contact tracing staff who are on those difficult calls and experience abusive situations?  It is very difficult for staff.  I hope this is not too common.  Is there someone they can talk to to decompress?  How is that managed?</p></speech>

I might not have explained it clearly.  HIQA provided a report on alternative testing, of which antigen was just one.  That report is in the public domain.  It made several observations but the bottom line was a request that the HSE undertake validation in different settings.  It is clear that antigen testing is not particularly strong and there is no evidence base relating to asymptomatic settings, which is the area where most people have caught it, in the public imagination.  It is important that we do that validation.  Prior to the HIQA report, we had already commenced the process on antigen testing.  HIQA engaged with us through that process, as with NPHET.  A lot of the early tests are very poor, there is no point in saying otherwise.  We have identified a number that we believe have stronger performance characteristics that are worth validating.  That is one reason until now there has been very limited progress in that area, not only in Ireland but elsewhere.  That is why countries are starting to look at how it can be deployed alongside the PCR testing.  As we move through validation in those areas we will start to see if those results give the basis for deployment.</p> <p>  I am optimistic about some sectors, and it would be invaluable for outbreaks such as in a home or setting when something is needed that can get people out quickly to prevent the spread of disease, where the PCR could take days.  It is early days and the group still has to do the work and run formal validations across the various settings where we might deploy it.  It is one on which we are actively working rather than monitoring when the tests were poorer earlier in the year.  We are much more confident now that it is worth looking at in more depth, which is what we are doing based on HIQA's advice.  The WHO has given strong advice on where it should and should not be used and where the validation in a country needs to be done to assess the role it should have.</p></speech>

At different points in the disease, we spend different amounts of time on the phone with individuals.  We did call people to discuss having a positive result.  It is a very difficult call for people to receive that news and understand how they should isolate and manage their illness.  Following that, there is another call with them to talk about their close contacts.  From a quality perspective, it is important to spend time with people trying to understand that and elicit information from them.  We make another call to close contacts which may be quite fast.  The person may already be aware if they are a family member or close contact, so they accept that and we arrange the test.  We do not tell people we call who the index case is, so in other calls there might be a lot of questions and we spend some time with them to encourage them to go for a test.  We do not have metrics where we tell our staff how many calls per hour they need to do.  We do training with them to understand that it is mostly about quality.  Having said that, we know how many calls we need to do.  We made 38,000 calls last week.  We must make sure that enough staff are on at varying points in the disease to be able to spend time with people on the phone and give them all the information they need for us to be able to contact their close contacts and get them organised for a test to reduce transmission.</p></speech>

We in public health would only have been involved after that had happened.  The vast majority of what people call "call ones" normally would have been done by a clinician who would have told a patient that they had X or Y and told them that they would get a call from public health as a consequence.  We have had to change that relationship entirely since Covid so that now we tell them, not through their clinician who normally is their GP or hospital consultant, but by someone in one of our centres.  That is a big change.</p> <p>  Clinicians are available at all times in the centres supporting contact tracers around how they deal with the calls and so on.  Someone will be available to one of the callers, so if they are not clinicians themselves or if they are clinicians who are not doctors, doctors are often available to get in touch and talk through an issue.  A level of support is always available and it can be escalated up the system.</p> <p>  Psychological support systems are also in place for members of staff who feel they have hit a wall in what is going on and they need support.  That is very clearly available to anyone.  People have needed that and we have sought to support people around those issues.</p></speech>

I have just come from the Committee on Transport and Communications Networks where we were briefed by Aer Lingus and Ryanair on the great need to move to rapid antigen testing at airports to get aeroplanes back in the sky and return aviation to some semblance of normality.  They will be briefed by others in the aviation sector later.  To date just over 250,000 people out of a population of 4.9 million in Ireland have been contact traced through the HSE's facilities.</p> <p>  Last year 38 million passengers came into Ireland.  Aviation is operating at 90% below its previous level.  If airports move to this model of testing, does Ireland have the public health capacity to facilitate that process or should it be done privately?</p></speech>

The testing itself, that is, swabbing and laboratory processing, can be done by private partners, but the contact tracing would remain within the public system.  Under the infectious diseases Act, the laboratories need to refer all positive cases to a public health department.  High numbers of tests from travellers coming into the country would impact us where there were positive cases.  Were someone to test positive and be in Ireland, we are responsible for contact tracing the individual.</p></speech>

How much more capacity is available for contact tracing?  The system is already hugely burdened.  Could it take on potentially millions more?  Does the public system have the potential capacity to take that on?</p></speech>

Were the numbers of international travellers to return to levels like 38 million, dealing with that would be extensive.  We have worked closely with the Departments of Transport and Health on what they do and so that their decisions have the least impact on the HSE and the work we are trying to do in controlling the disease.</p></speech>

Do we have any arrangements in place or planned for contact tracing to be possible with international partners if we have an influx of people for a sporting event or similar?  Do we have any capacity to take that on beyond our borders and beyond Northern Ireland as well?</p></speech>

We already have and are part of a number of arrangements within both the EU and the WHO to deal with that, so we already have in place systems that allow us, if somebody flies into Ireland now and has been off the flight for two or three days, to identify that he or she is positive.  We can go back with the airlines and others to identify potentially the people who might be at risk and then deal with that in those ways.  We are doing that at the moment for about four or five flights per day.  We are quite active on it.  It is part of the system-----</p></speech>

I am happy with Dr. Kelleher's answer.</p> <p>  A number of school principals have contacted me.  I was a schoolteacher until February.  Where a school has a confirmed Covid case, the principal is obliged to get in contact immediately with the HSE, and the HSE then takes on a communications co-ordinating role.  That sounds ideal, and this was designed initially in order that the principal would not be burdened with the huge task of doing a little contact tracing and speaking to classes and parents.  All of that is fine, but in reality it is taking in some instances 24 hours or longer for that whole communications chain to come full circle.  Meanwhile, the school principal is in the staff room facing down colleagues, knowing that there has been a Covid case in the school.  There are colleagues going home to elderly parents.  Children in the class could be unwell.  Within what kind of timeframes is the HSE doing the school communication turnaround?  The principals I have talked to and the Irish Primary Principals Network find it grossly inadequate and it is really putting pressure on the principals.  They are going around basically gagged for a 24-hour period knowing there is a heightened risk in their school but also knowing they cannot speak about it to others in their staff and school community.</p></speech>

Likewise, we aim to be able to speak to the principal on the day he or she gets in touch with us.  We are in daily communication with colleagues in the Department of Education.  I get involved in weekly meetings with the education stakeholders on this.  We are trying to enhance the systems we have in place over this half-term period-----</p></speech>

Finally, what software does the HSE put on the contact tracers' laptops to ensure they are compliant with the GDPR and other relevant data regulations?  They go home in the evening and use the same laptops for Facebook and other forms of personal use.  What software does the HSE put on the laptops brought from home to the contact tracing points?  What software does it give employees to ensure compliance with data regulations?</p></speech>

The application we use is all cloud-based, so nothing is held on the laptop itself.  The contact tracer accesses our Microsoft Dynamics CRM system, which is where all the data are held on who to call.  The issue that was mentioned in the newspapers today relates solely to one facility and to a small number of people who were asked to bring a personal laptop just for training.  They will not be rostered to do contact tracing until their HSE laptops have arrived.</p></speech>

Over recent months, there were obvious signs of an escalation in the incidence of the virus throughout the country.  What system did the HSE have to identify the cause of the escalation?  To what extent was the HSE in liaison with local communities or similar to identify, first of all, the main cause?  I know there has been a return to schools and a return to business.  That is one thing but, for example, I and many others were contacted by countless people who brought to our attention wide-scale non-adherence to the basic advice given.  In order to combat the virus, did the HSE consider any means or methods to address the staff requirements for combating large numbers of the public ignoring the need to wear masks, observe social distancing and hand hygiene and virtually everything else?  There were countless instances in many towns and villages throughout the country that would illustrate large numbers of people ignoring all the regulations, including going on holiday to some of the places that are known virus black spots and returning to the community.  What methodology was used to monitor that kind of activity in order to be able to prepare the HSE for the monitoring and the testing and tracing that would ultimately follow?</p></speech>

NPHET has consistently made the points the Deputy has made.  He will have heard the Chief Medical Officer, the deputy chief medical officer, our chief clinical officer here and other people talk repeatedly about asking people to do those things.  There are also issues, generally speaking, for the Government about how those regulations are governed.  The HSE is not directly involved in that but we have been speaking to people about how we do it.  As Deputy Durkan says, we have rightly been looking to see how we can deal with some of those issues.  We have pinpointed some of those events.  We have had discussions with organisations about this.  We are in regular discussions with other parts of government about these areas - I am involved with some, others are involved in others - trying to ensure that this is done.  It is interesting to note that we have seen a significant improvement on what happens in some of the industries we have been involved in.  The biggest issue, as the Deputy quite rightly says, is non-observance in general and in parts of society not following what we are asking people to do.  It is very difficult because that is the behavioural change we are trying to get in place to cope with the disease until we have some method of dealing with it that does not involve the significant behavioural changes we are asking for at the moment.</p></speech>

There is also a probability that we would have witnessed a wave regardless because that is the nature of the disease and how infectious diseases of this nature occur.  They go up and down in waves regardless.  The severity could possibly have arisen regardless.  We can see as a consequence of the imposition of level 5 now and level 3 previously that people's behaviour has altered and is making a change.  I totally agree with the Deputy.  It very much reflects what we in public health have been saying quite strongly, as has the HSE as an organisation and the Government.</p></speech>

We are looking at doing those things, but I hope that people have now seen the impact of what has happened and will reflect this knowledge in their behaviour.

I accept that we are in a very difficult situation at the moment.  We are seeing 1,000 cases a day, each one of which has numerous contacts.  Let us take a step back to last month before this recent surge.  A report, entitled COVID-19 Testing and Tracing: Roadmap to enhance capacity and turnaround, was published to great fanfare on 14 May.  One of the risks highlighted in the report was rapid scaling up of volumes of activity.  That was always a risk.  As a mitigating measure, the report recommended stress-testing current operations to provide resilience.  That was published on 14 May, long before the summer and the recent surge.</p> <p>  We heard in evidence this morning that the warning bells started ringing during the August bank holiday weekend.  On 23 September, I raised the specific issue of contact tracing with the Minister for Defence on the floor of the House.  He stated that the Defence Forces were waiting for a phone call from the HSE.  That was seven weeks after the warning bells had started to ring.  The documentation provided to us this morning states that the HSE has engaged with numerous public bodies, which have offered their support as part of the contact tracing effort.  It also makes it clear that the HSE received offers of support from other bodies rather than seeking support itself.  From the August bank holiday weekend on, which agencies and Departments that had previously provided contact tracers were contacted?  Were any of the contact tracers who had been trained up for the first wave of infection offered temporary, part-time or out-of-hours contracts under which they could work in the evenings or on the weekends?  Those contact tracers had built up the system's capacity. </p> <p>  I received an email at 12 noon today regarding a parliamentary question I tabled at the beginning of the month.  The email was dated last Thursday, 22 October, and was from Ms O'Beirne.  I had asked about the number of HSE staff that have been deployed to contact tracing.  The figures provided to me this morning indicate that 430 health and social care professionals were employed as contact tracers and testers last month.  Can someone explain to me why occupational therapists and physical therapists were involved in contact tracing and testing last month when there was no surge?  Why had efforts not been made to fill those positions with alternative staff before the surge?  If that had been done, those 450 staff members could have been recalled to deal with the present surge.  It seems that all the HSE staff currently involved in contact tracing are qualified medical professionals.  Are any administrative staff involved in contact tracing? </p> <p>  Ms O'Beirne stated in her evidence that the number of HSE staff involved in contact tracing will decrease as other staff are brought on stream.  I have been told by the CEO of the HSE and in replies to parliamentary questions that this will only happen after the full complement of 800 staff is recruited.  Based on this morning's evidence, it will be the week before Christmas before all of those staff are recruited.  This means that none of the HSE staff will return to their old posts until the new year.  Ms O'Beirne went on to say that once the 800 staff are recruited, a decision will be made on whether the number should increase to 1,000.  Can she clarify whether those staff members will be redeployed in advance of Christmas week?  Alternatively, will we have to wait until the 800 staff have been recruited, as was indicated in parliamentary replies I have received?</p></speech>

Since August, when we began to increase our staff numbers again, UCD was the first university with which we engaged for support.  The Revenue Commissioners also provided us with support, as did the Defence Forces through the Army bands.  We received support from our colleagues throughout the public service.  Those who had previously been involved, including university staff and employees who were working in front-line positions, did not return to contact tracing specifically.  The HSE staff members involved in contact tracing today include approximately 25 allied health professionals.  Some environmental health officers, who are also front-line staff, and human resources staff are supporting our contact tracing effort.  Those staff will return to their normal roles as we start to build up capacity through our new recruits.  Earlier I mentioned a figure of 274; that is the number of new recruits who are dedicated to contact tracing.  Another 80 or 90 are coming this week, which will bring the number to 350 next week.  We need to increase that number to have a dedicated workforce that is not required to do other things as part of its normal work.</p> <p>  Staff members are also involved in swabbing, which is a separate part of the process.  That part of the pathway has approximately 800 staff drawn from different professions throughout the HSE, particularly clinical staff.  That number will decrease as we hire more community swabbers in the coming weeks.  Our ultimate aim is a dedicated and stable testing and tracing workforce that is independent of front-line services and the HSE's other administrative and healthcare services.  That was part of our overall organisational design for testing and tracing.</p></speech>

The reply I received today contradicts it.  We have been told that 866 staff were employed in this role in September.  We are now hearing that there are 24 today.  There is utter confusion.</p></speech>

It is a separate part of the process.  However, it is true that 866 staff from the CHOs have been deployed solely to swabbing.  The contact tracing effort has a different staff complement.</p></speech>

This is part of the difficulty we have had.  We are getting information out of two sides of the HSE's mouth in relation to what is going on here.  I had this conversation privately with Dr. Kelleher, in that we cannot get clarity regarding the numbers involved here.  The HSE is saying that there are almost 900 staff, 430 of which are allied health professionals such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech therapists, carrying out swabbing today while nurses who have applied through Be on Call for Ireland who are capable and qualified to do this have not been taken on to fulfil the swabbing role.  Instead, we have the speech therapists, the occupational therapists and physiotherapists carrying out this role.  That is completely unacceptable.</p></speech>

Three and a half thousand applicants came through on that and the first 200 of those are in place.  We continue to recruit them at a rate of 90 to 100 per week.  They need training.  They are non-clinical staff trained into those roles.  They need training and they need clinical oversight in all the centres across the country.  Just like contact tracing, with the swabbing side we need to continue to recruit so that we have adequate staff who are independent of the community health services.</p></speech>

In speech and language therapy, prior to the pandemic one waited possibly up to two years for an assessment and possibly another two years to get supports.  Those waiting times have extended further because many of the staff have been seconded to track and trace and to other jobs.  I suppose that is where the frustration arises.  In the earlier days, it made sense but those people clearly need to be back in the services for which they are trained.  If possible, bring on those who responded to Be on Call for Ireland.  It was a great idea but it did not seem to be taken up.  There are others, we believe, who could be doing the job rather than those trained professionals who are clearly needed in other areas of the HSE.</p></speech>

First, in terms of the cancellations of tests, what figures have the witnesses on scheduled tests that were cancelled?  Were the people who cancelled the tests followed up on to reschedule the tests?  What percentage of those tested positive for Covid?  It would seem, if a test was cancelled or people did not show up for a test and it was rescheduled, that one is talking about another 24 to 48 hours.  If they were not self-isolating, we are looking at a dangerous situation.  The second question-----</p></speech>

They are travelling for anything up to six hours by bus, and many of them are elderly.  It is relation to cataract operations.  Maybe Mr. McCallion might deal with this issue.  My understanding is that there is a delay, certainly, in the south-south-west area, in getting appointments to be assessed.  Can we fast track that process by using the National Treatment Purchase Fund to refer people for consultations and then put them on the list for cataract procedures?  In the South Infirmary, there are only 133 cases waiting to be dealt with.  Some 90 of them are waiting less than three months.  The problem is that people are not getting on the list because they are not being assessed.  Can we deal with that issue at this stage?  Finally, would Mr. McCallion accept that travelling to Northern Ireland at this stage is a little unsafe and that people need to be advised of that?</p></speech>

Private laboratories that undertake PCR testing are obliged to report those to public health and to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC.  Positive results for PCR will come through in the HPSC figures that are reported regularly.  We get results as well from private hospitals.  Those numbers feed into our own system but, as I say, there is a legislative requirement under the infectious disease legislation for private laboratories.  We would be in contact with those we know on a regular basis to make sure that is happening in a timely manner for all the reasons the members have set out.</p> <p>  I will have to revert to the Deputy on the point about the specifics of the cataract procedures.  While I am familiar with the fact that people travel South to North, and, indeed, North to South, in terms of my other role, all I would say on its safety or otherwise is that people clearly should observe whatever the public health regulations are in the two jurisdictions at any point in time in terms of travel.  There are also people who, by nature of the jobs in healthcare or other settings, need to travel across the Border on a regular basis.  People should adhere to the regulations in the two jurisdictions at any point in time.  Equally, I recognise that there are significant numbers of people who travel across the Border every day and who, within those regulations, are entitled to do so.  That would include access to healthcare but also healthcare staff.  The numbers who travel across are big.  On the specific matter, maybe I could come back to Deputy Colm Burke.  If the Deputy can forward me some details, I can pick up the particular point about cataracts.  That is a broader issue than Covid and maybe we can link it to the acute hospitals.</p></speech>

The do-not-attend rate for the past number of days is at 15%.  We contact those individuals and offer them another test date.  We would not keep figures - we do not have the metrics - for those who had their test redone as to whether Covid was detected or not detected.  However, we have seen an improvement in the do-not-attend rate and people adhering to their appointment time.  Certainly, we have seen an improvement in the day seven testing also, which has risen to more than 90% over the past number of months.</p></speech>

I welcome our witnesses.  We are joined by Mr. Eddie Wilson, chief executive officer, of Ryanair.  I thank him for coming back before the committee a second time.  This is an extremely important issue.  We are also joined by Mr. Donal Moriarty, interim chief executive officer, and Mr. Reid Moody, chief strategy and planning officer, of Aer Lingus.  I thank them for being with us virtually today.</p><p>Before commencing, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference the witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and the statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to the identified person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Members are also reminded that committee meetings should conclude within two hours in any one day.  The committee is scheduled to sit twice today for a cumulative time of just under four hours.  Therefore, members are asked to rotate in and out of the meeting when they have finished asking their questions.  With this in mind, I propose Deputy Joe Carey to act as temporary Chair, as he did previously, for the part of today's meeting where I will be rotating out of the meeting to abide by the two-hour rule.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>I call Mr. Wilson to make his opening statement.<b></b></p></speech>

Unfortunately since we here on the last occasion on 7 October nothing has changed regarding aviation policy and the strangulation of this industry.  The green list system has been a complete and utter disaster for this economy and despite the promises that we are going to adopt a new system, nothing has happened.  We have cut ourselves off from Europe.  Before anyone comes back and talks about the traffic light system in terms of what other EU countries are doing, this morning in Germany, France, Sweden, Belgium and Spain, one can travel anywhere within the European Union.  There is no restriction on flights whatsoever.  A direct consequence of this strangulation of our industry is that the Ryanair bases in Cork and Shannon, which we had flagged explicitly based on this because we had no bookings, have now closed and the question is whether they will reopen next summer.  That could have been averted.  I find it extraordinary that after coming to this committee on the last occasion we did not get one call from either the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, or the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton.  The closure of our bases in Cork and Shannon could have been averted or minimised in some way.  We did not even get a telephone call from them.</p> <p>  The aviation task force has been reported on since 7 July, more than four months ago, and nothing has been done about it.</p><p>People from Ryanair, Aer Lingus, the airports and the leasing companies put in their good time last June and July to put together a report, and it is inexplicable that this Minister has done nothing about it whatsoever.</p><p> The market update that I gave the committee the last time I attended has deteriorated.  Airlines across Europe are in a bad place.  The two airlines that are represented at the committee today are well capitalised, but what is happening is that there will be smaller fleets within Europe next year.  Ireland is bottom of the list at the moment, because we are closed for business. Having lost this summer, for summer 2021, nothing has been done to attract business, on which 140,000 people in aviation and 325,000 people in tourism depend for their jobs.</p><p> We are calling on the Minister today to do some very simple things, and we have been doing so for months now.  The EU traffic light system must be implemented today.  We must stop waiting around.  There are already countries that are green and amber, and they should be opened straight away.  For example, the Greek Islands, the Canary Islands, Germany, Sweden, and parts of Italy could be open today.  We do not know what the delay is.  As it stands, Government policy is to say that nobody should fly anywhere in and off this small island economy.  A key part of this EU traffic light system is that there should be regionalisation, and unless the Government adopts it, it will be useless.  Countries should not be cut off in full, so that one can still fly to some places, for example, the Canary Islands, when one may not fly to Madrid, as it is part of Spain.</p><p> The aviation task force must be implemented.  Why is it still sitting there and why have the Minister for Transport and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, not done anything about it?</p><p> We want consultation.  There are many things happening at the moment on which none of the airlines and stakeholders are being consulted.  When has one ever heard of Ryanair, Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority all saying exactly the same thing?</p><p> This industry is in decline, and we lost this summer due to Government policy failures and advice not to travel.  I note that this morning NPHET stated that Christmas travel should be suspended.  I am sorry, but being worried is not good enough for us.  We need data, and there are no data that state that air travel is not safe.  It is the safest place where people can congregate, due to a combination of 100% compliance in the wearing of face masks, high efficiency particulate air filters being used, and policies and procedures from the European Centre of Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, being followed.</p><p> We need to get the balance right in this economy, which means that we need to be able to preserve jobs and protect those who are most vulnerable, and we should be able to do this.  NPHET got it wrong on care homes, meat factories, face masks, and on travel throughout this summer when it should have been concentrating on increasing capacity and getting a properly functioning track and trace system.</p><p> The two points I wish to make to the Minister are as follows.  The EU traffic light system must be implemented with regionalisation, and it must be done today.  We are closed when all the other economies within Europe are open.  Second, the Minister must implement the aviation task force, which has not been done to date.  This includes in particular the incentives to get airlines to return to Ireland, especially for summer 2021, including the specific recommendation for the rebate of airport charges for a period of three years, which would apply to all airlines within the industry.</p></speech>

Aer Lingus has previously outlined, both in July at the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response and again at our appearance before this committee on 7 October, the catastrophic effects that the Covid-19 pandemic continues to have on the global aviation sector.</p> <p>  The committee is aware of how important aviation is for the Irish economy and its prospects for future recovery.  The members all know that the international businesses that headquarter in Ireland, that manufacture in Ireland, that carry out critical research and development in Ireland, and that secure investment from their boards for Ireland do so because Ireland is a connected, progressive, business-friendly country.  Connectivity is key.  We are an island nation, and that connectivity can never be taken for granted.  It is a key element of foreign inward investment and in helping our domestic businesses to grow and develop.</p> <p>  Now is the time to put a framework in place so that all businesses can plan for 2021.  Fortunately, there are elements of that framework already in existence.  Crucially, we know that air travel is safe.  Aer Lingus and other airlines have put in place measures in line with European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, and ECDC guidelines that very effectively mitigate the risk of transmission during travel.  Indeed, a recent study by the International Air Transport Association, IATA, indicated that risk of transmission on board an aircraft is as low as one in 27 million.  Second, the traffic light system introduced by the European Council recently is an important step towards ensuring greater harmonisation for safer travel across Europe, and I will address that in more detail later.  Third, new and more effective means of testing are being used globally, and their introduction into this country can increase the level of safe international travel.</p> <p>  I now turn to the decision of the European Council on the traffic light system.  The decision at the European Council on 13 October aims to co-ordinate the approach to free movement in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  The wider aviation sector has been somewhat critical of the ultimate decision that emerged from the European Council.  The Council recommended a co-ordinated approach to free movement and set out some guidance for member states, but it falls considerably short of what was originally proposed by the European Commission on 4 September, which was to encourage a restart of travel through effective co-ordination and proportionate, predictable and non-discriminatory measures.</p> <p>  Despite this assessment of the European Council decision, Aer Lingus has constructively shared an implementation approach with Department of Transport that could support safely increasing international travel.  Although it has not yet been published, Aer Lingus understands that the Government approach to implementing the European traffic light system will involve a number of elements.  First, persons arriving from green list locations can enter the State without the requirement to restrict movement or undergo testing.  Second, people arriving from orange-listed locations should have the option to disapply the requirement to restrict movements if they have negative test result of an appropriate standard done pre-departure.  Third, people coming from red-listed countries should have the option to disapply the requirement to restrict movements following a negative test result taken five days after arrival.  We understand that that is the Government's proposal, although it has not been published yet.</p> <p>  We would describe the proposed approach as a fairly tentative and moderately positive step forward, but it urgently needs to evolve and move to something quite different.  Aer Lingus is actively engaging with the Government and will seek to influence the implementation of an appropriate solution before 8 November 2020, which I understand is the date the Government has in mind.</p> <p>  Aer Lingus notes that the intention is to allow travel from orange-coded countries and areas without a requirement to restrict movements on arrival if a pre-departure test is taken.  In our view, it is critical that if pre-departure tests are required for passengers travelling from orange-coded countries, it has to be based on a rapid, affordable antigen testing solution.  Only a rapid antigen testing solution will facilitate a meaningful increase in safe international travel.  For passengers coming from high-risk or red countries, the European Council decision specifically enables the replacement of quarantine and movement restrictions by the introduction of a testing regime.</p> <p>  Aer Lingus also welcomes the exemption in the European Council decision for passengers with an essential function from the requirement to undertake restricted movement or testing while exercising this essential function, and this includes those in critical occupations, students and persons travelling for imperative family or business reasons.  This exemption will allow passengers with an essential function to travel without restriction, be that a test or a movement restriction.</p> <p>  Aer Lingus believes that following the initial implementation of the measures, the fortnightly review process, which we understand the Government intends to apply, should quickly lead to a streamlining of the processes to allow a meaningful increase in safe international travel.  This streamlining should look like a limited form of random rapid testing for passengers arriving from higher risk orange-coded countries, and a pre-departure testing for countries classified as red.</p><p> Aer Lingus believes that through the adoption of a co-ordinated and multilayered risk mitigation approach the level of safe international travel can be increased.  The multiple layers involve pre-travel health declarations; mandatory use of face masks; enhanced cleaning on aircraft and in the airport environment; the use of state-of-the-art air filtration technology on board the aircraft; the use of the e-passenger locator forms, ePLF; the use of the Covid tracker app and its integration with similar apps in other countries; and agreed international travel protocols such as the European traffic light system.  It is based on this range of risk mitigation measures, which is already in place, that we believe aviation requires a screening standard of testing, not a diagnostic standard of testing.  In summary, Ireland must implement the European Council&rsquo;s decision in such a way that the traffic light system delivers a meaningful contribution to increasing safe international travel. </p><p> I will turn briefly to testing and rapid testing.  First, I draw the committee's attention to the International Air Transport Association, IATA, study which indicates that the risk of on-board transmission is one in 27 million.  So far in 2020, 1.2 billion passengers have travelled by air and IATA says there are only 44 cases of Covid-19 being transmitted on board an aircraft in that period of time.  Second, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, notes that in the current epidemiological situation it does not recommend that passengers should be systematically tested when crossing internal or external administrative borders.  I also point to the recent data released by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, on 21 October, which highlighted that four cases were reported in the previous 14 days that were travel related.  There were 80,000 passengers in that period of time, which represents 0.05% of cases in that period.  The evidence, therefore, is that international travel is simply not a vector of transmission for Covid-19.  Interestingly, the HPSC report published on 21 October has not been published since.  We believe the continued publication of the report would be a helpful statistic and it should continue.  I do not understand why it has been discontinued.</p><p> All this highlights the effectiveness of the measures introduced by the-----</p></speech>

Italy has recently introduced a testing requirement for arrivals from high-risk or red-coded countries that includes antigen testing as an appropriate standard.  On 18 October last, the French minister for transport announced plans to introduce rapid antigen testing at airports on departure to countries such as the US and on arrival from red-zone countries.  On 13 October, Germany's Robert Koch Institute, RKI, recommended antigen testing to complement existing molecular PCR tests.  Several European airports, including Milan, Rome, Frankfurt, Heathrow and Paris, are in the process of equipping themselves for antigen testing in the future.  Alitalia is already using it and Lufthansa has announced plans to do so.  Similarly, Austrian Airlines has recently announced a trial programme for antigen testing.  It is clear that antigen testing, at a screening standard, is becoming prevalent, and the solution in terms of facilitating international travel.</p> <p>  I will briefly mention regional operations, in Cork and Shannon airports in particular.  Aer Lingus has published its 2021 summer schedule, and there are extensive operations planned from both Cork and Shannon airports.  However, the easing of international travel restrictions is assumed in the publication of that summer schedule for 2021.  Urgent progress along the lines I have just outlined must be made in the appropriate introduction of a traffic light system and testing regime.  We have highlighted these issues repeatedly to this committee and to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response since July.  We have referred to the recommendations of the aviation recovery task force, published on 7 July, which have not been implemented.  In our view, all these changes must be implemented now.</p> <p>  I will conclude by referring to the Government's resilience and recovery plan.  It says that there is a need to keep airports and travel routes open and that Ireland depends on airports for supply chains and economic activity.  It says there is a need for travel for essential reasons, and that significant employment and other direct economic impacts result from aviation.  It also states that aviation&rsquo;s strategic importance underpins tourism and business generally, and that rebuilding the national economy has a critical dependence on aviation.  That is what the resilience and recovery plan says, but we do not have any evidence of policy decisions and actions being taken in pursuit of that plan.</p> <p>  Our economy needs certainty about connectivity.  This must be prioritised urgently for 2021.  Businesses and the economy in general are critically dependent on it.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to make these remarks.</p></speech>

You are probably aware that representatives of Rome airport will be appearing before the committee this afternoon to discuss rapid testing at the airports.  That should shed some light on the matter.</p> <p>  I now move to questions from the members.  Deputy Darren O'Rourke has seven minutes and he must abide by that.</p></speech>

I will start with a question for both Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  Since we last met there has been some progress on the traffic light system and some commitment regarding pre-departure testing, but not much movement.  However, there has been significant backward movement in the spread of Covid-19 across the Continent.  In a best case scenario and if everything Mr. Wilson and Mr. Moriarty prescribed this morning happened tomorrow, what will the aviation landscape resemble in the next six and 12 months in Ireland and across Europe, and further if they wish, and what are the implications for their operations in terms of staff and commitment to the sector in Ireland?</p></speech>

There are two distinct phases in this.  One must have a basis for travelling, and in Ireland we do not have that at present.  The Deputy is correct that the situation has got progressively worse in Europe.  However, at least most of those countries are well positioned for when confidence may return.  We have not even got to the starting blocks in Ireland because we are prevaricating all the time as to what we are going to do.  We must not forget that official Government policy for the citizens of this nation, since March, has been not to fly.  What it has done is put an anchor around the neck of airlines in and out of this country and this has resulted, unfortunately, in Cork and Shannon closing as Ryanair bases.  If there is going to be an upturn here, the real work starts in convincing people to travel.  It will be easier to convince people to travel on short haul rather than on long haul.  However, when that comes about, we will have to start that hard work, but there will be fewer aircraft and less capacity.</p></speech>

We can see this in other countries.  During the week, for example, the UK lifted its restrictions on the Canary Islands, Crete and Denmark, and bookings went up tenfold overnight.  People want to do the right thing and we have scared the life out of people to comply with stuff on an unscientific basis when it comes to air travel.  I believe if that were to change, then people will travel.  The difficulty for Ireland is that we are currently at the bottom of the queue because other countries are already encouraging airlines like Ryanair to put capacity in place for next summer, and we are still faffing around here.</p></speech>

We need to get to the first step, which is the implementation of the traffic light system in an appropriate way that facilitates international travel.  I agree with Mr. Wilson's comments.  The willingness of people to travel will be there but the toxicity in respect of travel has to be removed.  That toxicity and that narrative have been largely delivered by policy over the past seven or eight months.  That has to change fundamentally.  Second, the implementation of practical steps to facilitate travel has to happen.  The demand will follow, but it is entirely too premature for me to be talking about a best-case scenario when we have not got to that stage.</p></speech>

It does a disservice to the quality of the conversation we are having.  I think it should be recognised as such.</p></speech>

I shall now turn to my own questions, which I put to both witnesses.  Mr. Moriarty made reference earlier to what he believes the Government will implement under the new traffic light system from 8 November, namely, that persons arriving from green list countries could go unrestricted without undergoing any test, that arrivals from orange list locations should have the option to apply to have unrestricted movement if they have tested negative prior to departure and that passengers from red list countries could be restricted for five days but would have free movement on receiving a negative test result thereafter.

In our comments on the original drafting of the traffic light system, our preference was to see people from orange and green countries being allowed to travel unrestricted.  Anything is better than quarantine.  The logistics of testing, particularly at airports, mean that it is a non-starter.  People are not going to travel to airports for tests, especially if they have already paid their fares, on the basis that they may not be able to get on an aircraft.  People must look at the human behaviours.  Anything is better than the blanket ban we have at the moment.  While the traffic light system is really about not having the free movement of people in the European Union for work, visiting friends and relatives, etc., it is important to remember - sometimes we forget this - that regardless of the traffic light system and the testing scenarios, people in Germany, Italy, France and Spain will continue to travel because they have land borders.  It will not be a panacea.  Anything is better than a quarantine.</p></speech>

We have described it as an initial step, which is positive in that it provides a roadmap for the removal of the 14-day restriction on movements.  Our view is that it needs to evolve and that there is a need to establish rapid, affordable antigen testing as both the testing standard and the testing solution on a screening basis.  There is a further need to evolve to a limited form of random, rapid testing for passengers from higher-risk orange Covid countries and regions, and a pre-departure rapid test for those from red countries.  We believe that is the solution.  That testing standard needs to be on the basis of an antigen test.</p></speech>

Can the Chairman imagine that the second city in Ireland will have no Ryanair flights in or out, not just the based activity?  It is that bad.  As Mr. Moriarty said, if we have not got a basis to fly then nobody will book and if nobody is going to book, we cannot fly.  What I really worry about is that the Government will fudge this and try to implement some traffic light system that will put us at a disadvantage in terms of what other European countries are doing, and I do not have a lot of faith in that.</p></speech>

I would largely agree with Mr. Wilson regarding the regionalisation argument.  The Covid-19 figures are released around teatime every evening.  When the ECDC talks about regionalising risk, it seems, and I made this point yesterday, that it is looking at countries more than regions.  As far as I can see, there is only one region, which is Calabria, in the south of Italy, to which one can fly and Ryanair is certainly not flying from Shannon to Calabria.  If we were to look at the figures provided last night and if Tipperary and Wicklow had airports, their incidence rates have dropped below 150.  There is another metric where a region has to have a positivity rate of 4% or lower, but on that metric alone, if we looked at better regionalisation for collecting data, parts of Ireland would be creeping back to levels which would be deemed orange.  We need the European Commission and the Department of Transport to urgently clarify the regions Europe is using to designate those regions.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Moriarty to take up the point on which the Chairman concluded.  I hear what he is saying about the uncertainty relating to orange and red routes.  Both witnesses were very clear about that but how much of their decision to not fly from Shannon is based on the traffic light system and how much is based on a commercial decision?  Could they apportion that out?  There has been rigorous questioning from various members.  If we get to 8 November and other measures are brought in or we see commonality across members states, they are still saying that they will not be flying until next April.  How much of their decision on that would they apportion to corporate and commercial reasoning?</p></speech>

They are completely linked to the traffic light system and therefore the demand picture and, ultimately, the capacity that we will put on the network.  For the sequence to happen consumer confidence needs to be restored.  For that to happen, there needs to be adoption of the traffic light system in addition to full adoption of the aviation recovery task force recommendations.  If, as a result of that, confidence in the market starts to build, as Mr. Wilson said, we will look at the demand and adjust capacity in accordance with that demand but the sequence has to start and at the minute the sequence is not starting.</p></speech>

It is when the official Government policy of this country is not to demonise air travel and open it again in a responsible way.  We had a wasted summer here.  We have seen the casualties already in Cork and Shannon and in reduced traffic out of Dublin, which means people are not willing to travel when their Governments tell them not to do so.  We accept that where there are red countries, particularly within the EU, there will have to be some testing regime.  We will have to restore travel to green and amber countries, however, and then we would be of a mind to look at restoring those where there may well be some demand.  In the meantime, however, the tide is going out further all the time because other countries are looking for those aircraft and we are making decisions already for next summer.</p></speech>

Everyone accepts that.  We have all asked individual and collective questions on when we can get antigen testing in operation if that is up to specification so we do not take away from community testing.  Most people are in that scenario.  We accept how difficult it has been for the aviation sector and the absolute necessity to ensure we have an aviation sector when we get beyond this.</p> <p>  When we talk about the likes of Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Ireland at the minute, we are dealing with places that are either introducing new restrictions or have already done so on the basis that we have a huge amount of community transmission.  That will obviously impact flying now.  I accept we need the framework up and running.  The European Commission and the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, appeared before the committee yesterday.  There is talk, obviously, of these European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, and ECDC protocols which will be in operation and that would relate to testing.  There is no surety, however, that we have any level of agreement across Europe that we will have anything close to harmonisation.  That is before we talk about the difficulties here as regards Brexit and the fact we obviously must get an all-Ireland response but there also needs to be some element of a deal or harmonisation with the British Government, which is very difficult at the minute.  We all accept the Irish Government needs to move as soon as possible.  That is accepted.</p> <p>  When we talk about Aer Lingus and Ryanair we are dealing with two major airlines which have already spoken from the point of view of seeking to have this framework up and running.  They are not necessarily looking for State money at this point.  They are talking about rebates with regard to the future.  We hope that when we talk about travel next summer, we are also talking about a period when we will probably have the outworking of a vaccine.  None of this, however, is absolutely sure.</p> <p>  I want to put this question to Mr. Wilson.  We also had travel agents before the committee, particularly travel agents who have block booked and who stated they were having incredible difficulty in getting moneys back from Ryanair.  There is all this talk about dealing directly with customers but in some cases these were block bookings for school groups and such.  Could we get that sort of problem resolved?  I have a further question after that.</p></speech>

We all know there is a need for a framework.  Mr. Wilson has been incredibly clear that he needs the Government to move.  The first question is on the difficulty regarding harmonisation across Europe.</p> <p>  My second question concerns the travel agents we had in before the committee who spoke about the fact they and individual consumers have had incredible difficulty in getting money back for flights that did not fly at an earlier stage in the pandemic.</p></speech>

We are cutting ourselves off from the rest of Europe.  I do not think people here get it and it is going to get worse because there will be fewer airline seats in Europe when this comes back.  There are going to be fewer airline seats throughout the world.  Our policy at the moment is to wander around in the darkness and say we might be doing something and we are having an expert group and all sorts of things rather than doing something.</p> <p>  We need connectivity on this island for this economy and if we are not going to have it, we had better be honest with the 325,000 people in tourism for next summer.  They are going to lose next summer over complete inaction from this Minister.  This Minister has had a report.  He has all the answers in 12 recommendations and I do not know why he is not here today to say when he is going to implement them.  Is he going to be honest with the 140,000 people in this industry or the 325,000 people in the tourism industry who are likely to lose their jobs next year?  We will be able to put our aircraft elsewhere.  It is the most moveable of assets.  We do not want to do that.</p></speech>

When all the cancellations came through as a result of Covid-19, we put in a procedure because under law we have the liability to the passenger.  Passengers who bought their flights through travel agents, and in many cases have been ripped off by travel agents because they add on to our fares and the charges for seats and bags, can get their money back directly.  If the travel agents have a group of people, they can sign a waiver to say the travel agents can get it.  Many travel agents have availed of this but we have no commercial relationship with them.  The people who want their money back are getting their money back.  There is a process there and the travel agents need to engage with it and people will get their money back.  We have a responsibility to the passenger and not to the travel agent whom we have no commercial relationship with.</p></speech>

What information did Aer Lingus get with regard to the initial period when it would not sign the X and O forms for those people who were on the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS?

In the period since the TWSS was brought in and up to the point of its expiry on 31 August, we complied with the direction we got from the Department and from the Revenue Commissioners.  That included the way in which we were to complete the forms to which the Deputy refers.  We completed them in exactly the way we were directed to do so by the Department.</p></speech>

Today's news from Ryanair that it will not fly any flights from Shannon or Cork airports from 4 November until 12 December is extremely disappointing.  When Ryanair made this decision, had it communicated this decision to the Shannon Airport Authority and to Ryanair's workers?  Are there any circumstances under which Ryanair could review this position?</p><p>It is my understanding that last weekend there were more than 100 people on the Shannon to Stansted flight.  What makes it sustainable for Ryanair to fly that route?  That represents a significant improvement on the number of passengers travelling from Shannon to Stansted.  At what point does Ryanair say this is economical and it can fly?  This is going to have a major, devastating impact on the economy of the mid-west, from a business point of view in particular.</p></speech>

These additional cutbacks clearly do not affect those staff because these are flights that originate from London or other bases elsewhere.  It is entirely due to demand, however.  The reason there is no demand is that the Government is saying, "Don't fly".  The Government has not opened up the green list.  That is the only option.  Today it says all of Europe and the UK is closed.  One cannot operate an airline without passengers.  While there may well be some flights that are better booked than others, I can tell the Acting Chairman that the bookings out of Cork and Shannon are absolutely shocking.  If something is to be done for those airports, it needs to be done now by the Minister.  We put a lot of time into this.  We went down and met all of the politicians in Cork.  We met airport management and our staff.  We telegraphed this very clearly for more than six weeks and we did not get one phone call from the Government about what it could do to avert it.  We are still flailing around in the darkness as to what we are going to do.  One cannot run an airline without demand.  At its most basic, we are an island nation and we must be able to say to people that they will not be demonised for travelling.  We are responsible in this industry, we do everything that is risk-based and we are not going to make money-----</p></speech>

However, reading this morning's newspapers and NPHET's comments, which have no scientific basis, they are now saying people should not travel for that because they are very worried.  As I said earlier, being worried is not good enough; we want to see the data.  The data are there that airline travel itself is safe and we need a framework as to what countries and regions to balance the risk.  Life has to go on.  We have got to look after the most vulnerable and we have got to be able to have a functioning economy.  As an island economy without any connectivity, we do not have a lot of hope on that so I hope the Government will do something about this today.</p></speech>

He is working with Aer Lingus's parent group AIG at the moment and is a very proud son of Youghal.  I wish the new acting CEO the best of luck.</p> <p>  Mr. Wilson is probably aware that I gave a significant presentation at Cork Airport when he visited us about my concerns.  A reference we have heard a lot today from the representatives of the aviation sector is the toxicity around flying and people's attitude to it, particularly around short haul flights.  I am incredibly concerned about the attitude people have towards aviation because 120,000 jobs were fully supported by this industry prior to the onset of Covid-19.  The witnesses have said a great deal about demand and that is obviously king when it comes to providing flights out of Cork Airport, which is absolutely critical to the entire province of Munster.  Shannon Airport is very important as well.</p> <p>  I am very concerned to hear some of the statements made by Mr. Wilson regarding engagement by senior representatives from Government.  The representatives of the Government parties will feed that back.  It is not good enough because if what he is saying is true, it has cost jobs and flights out of Cork Airport, which I am incredibly concerned about.  I am also very concerned to hear that Aer Lingus will reduce its Cork to Heathrow capacity, which is the major link Cork has to airports internationally.  We are fighting hard to hold on to the flights we have left and it is important that the public understands just how serious this is.</p> <p>  My first question is for Aer Lingus.  When do Mr. Moriarty and Mr. Moody foresee some degree of normality returning to its transatlantic passenger traffic?  It is important.  There is a very problematic geopolitical situation there now but when do they see normality coming back to transatlantic travel, which is important to tourism in Ireland.</p></speech>

We would very much advocate that engagement happen with the US and Canadian authorities-----</p></speech>

We need to remember that Ireland is not in the Schengen area, so we have a slightly different regime with respect to traffic between Ireland and the US.  There needs to be bilateral engagement, therefore, between the Irish Government and the US authorities to establish a safe travel corridor.  The basis for doing so is similar to the one I outlined earlier, based upon a pre-departure test regime that facilitates traffic.  Ireland is somewhat uniquely positioned to benefit from the relationships we have with the US.  We have customs and border protection, CBP, facilities in Dublin and Shannon airports and that gives us a significant advantage in being able to have these safety and health technical conversations with the US authorities.</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Wilson might like to answer that one first.</p></speech>

We always hear about the data but travel has been demonised.  We were told throughout the summer that if people did not travel abroad, everything would be fine and, as we now know, it was driven by domestic factors and Government policy failures on track and trace and increasing capacity.  I would say to NPHET that if they are going to have an opinion on aviation, maybe they should look at what the experts outside this country say.</p><p>NPHET could look to what is being said by the US Department of Defense, the Boeing Company, the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC.  For some reason, however, it is ignoring all that.  We saw that on 1 July when people were advised not to travel, which was not in line with what the ECDC, which we are supposedly following, was saying.  As soon as the new traffic light system, or whatever derivative we have, was announced, people were already being told that they might not be able to come home for Christmas.  It is not clear why people would not be able to return from green countries or orange countries or whatever, but it seems to be to do with testing.  NPHET is dealing a death blow to the industry in Ireland while the rest of Europe looks to move on.  People sometimes forget that no airline in this country is State-owned.  Airlines are being bailed out throughout Europe and we will have to go to where we will get a return.  At the moment, Ireland is bottom of the list because aviation has been demonised, particularly by NPHET.  That body should stick to what it knows best.</p></speech>

These include health questionnaires, mandatory use of face masks, aircraft and airport cleaning, technology and so on.  The act of travel itself is safe.  We are suggesting, therefore, that a standard of testing needs to be introduced that is a screening standard, not a diagnostic standard.  That standard of testing should be applied on a pre-departure basis from orange-list and red-list countries.  By doing so, we believe that aviation can resume contributing to the Irish economy, which is urgently required, and it can be done safely.</p></speech>

There is a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>about this discussion because we had more or less the same conversation this day three weeks ago at a previous meeting of the committee.  Unfortunately, that meeting was followed by three further weeks of inaction on the part of the Government.  I am very interested in what the level of communication is between senior management at each of the two airlines represented today and the Minister or Minister of State.  Will the witnesses indicate how many conversations or meetings they have had in the past three weeks with the Minister, Minister of State or a senior official on their behalf?</p></speech>

As I recall, we spoke to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, shortly prior to our last appearance before the committee.  However, we are engaging with the Department of Transport at a senior level on a regular basis.  To be clear, we are proactively engaging with and making submissions to the Department as things develop.</p></speech>

We know that even if a plan were implemented next week that included rapid testing, locator forms and everything else, it would still require a number of months, if not longer, for the aviation industry to recover.  It is not a question of the aeroplanes going straight back up in the sky.  None of us is operating under that assumption.  However, I do not get a sense that there is any urgency from the Minister in tackling the issues or at least putting us on a path to recovery.  I am very concerned about that.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the importance of planning and scheduling of flights.  However, there has been no progress in this regard in the period from the meetings of the Covid committee in July, the meeting of this committee on 7 October, through to this meeting today.  If the Government continues to make no progress through November, December and into the start of next year, what plans are the witnesses putting in place in terms of their workforces?  I am not trying to create any extra fear because the workers are already very scared and uncertain about their future.  What kinds of implications will continuing Government inaction have for the airlines' ability to sustain their workforce at current levels?</p></speech>

We spoke to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on the evening after we last appeared before the committee, rather than just before it, as I stated.</p> <p>  To answer the question the Deputy just asked, we are communicating very regularly with our workforce.  We continue to emphasise the importance of the adoption by the State at a policy level of the traffic light system and a meaningful and appropriate implementation of that system.  We are planning our business and resources on that basis.  We have not engaged or communicated a detailed plan as to what would happen if that policy step and that implementation is not done.  We are emphasising today the critical importance of ensuring those steps are taken urgently.  Doing so will facilitate a recovery over time, a restoration of demand and, indeed, a restoration of confidence that it is, in fact, okay to travel.  That is the important first step.  As both Mr. Wilson and I have said, that first step has to be taken and then we can get into the phase of planning for what the future is going to look like.</p></speech>

We have more than 80 locations throughout Europe where our aircraft are based, similar to Cork and Shannon, and we must make commercial decisions about all of them.  This limping along is not going to do anything for anybody.  Life will be difficult enough as Europe works its ways through the current spike of infections and until confidence returns at some point with the introduction of a vaccine.  It is hard to get across how truly extraordinary it is that this country - an island nation that needs air connectivity more than most - instead of leading the pack in seeking to bring aviation back in a more expedited way, is actually at the bottom of the class in this regard.  I really do not understand it, especially when the answer is on the Minister's desk.  That solution would give us a fighting chance.  In its absence, things are going to get a lot of worse before they get better and I really fear for our tourism sector next summer.  If there are no aircraft coming into the country, there will be nobody coming here to fill the hotel rooms and visit the attractions.  We are making our decisions with that prospect in view and the Government needs to get to grips with it.  No other airlines are coming in.  Operators throughout Europe are getting much smaller and airports already realise they need to attract people for next summer.  Other countries are working on that but nothing is being done here in Ireland.  It is a shame.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.437" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eddie Wilson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020102800002#H01300"><p>I really do not want to be thinking about that.  Aviation is one of those industries where people can be more transferable.  They might not want to do it but pilots and cabin crew in Cork and Shannon may well move with their aircraft in the hope that things will come back.  The thing about aviation is that we have relatively small numbers of people for the movement of the aircraft.  Of course, there are significant implications for the wider economy, including people working at the airports, taxi drivers operating out of them, hotels, attractions and all of that.  I do not want to be thinking about job losses because we will continue to work with our people.  We have implemented agreements whereby we have not made anyone redundant among our crews in Cork, Shannon and Dublin.  We want to be able to bring them back.  If that means that those aircraft go elsewhere, then it may be an unpalatable solution for some of our people but they will be doing so in the hope that we would come back at some other stage.  In the short term, this is going to be disastrous for Ireland and I do not think people realise what is coming next summer.</p><p>We are going to miss the boat or the plane.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.439" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1609" speakername="Michael Lowry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020102800002#J00200"><p>I can feel the frustration.  Indeed, that is felt here at committee level as well on the basis that we seem to have made no progress since our last discussion.  The scenario that has been pointed out today is frank and forthright but very bleak.  We started this process in the past few days and the whole aviation scenario tends to look catastrophic.  We have a situation where the prospects for airlines are bleak and where Cork, Shannon and Knock airports are effectively wastelands and deserted as we speak.  Plus tourism is non-existent.  Both Aer Lingus and Ryanair bring many people to Ireland through the commercial and business sector so they have a good idea of their profile.  We all talk about tourism and the impact on the economy, which is correct.  Will the witnesses outline their assessment of the damage that has been, and is being, done to our business and corporate sector due to a lack of connectivity?</p> <p>  Have both airlines requested state aid from the Government?  Yesterday, we heard from a representative of the European Commission that he was not aware of any application for state aid being made on Ireland's behalf.  Aer Lingus and Ryanair mentioned on several occasions in the recent past that they must compete with other airlines in other countries that have the assistance and support of state aid within their jurisdiction.  Has the Government made an application?  Yesterday, I was gobsmacked to hear the representative of the European Commission say that there were a number of funds available to be accessed but he was not aware as to whether the Irish Department, Ministry or Government had made an application.  </p> <p>  Yesterday, a refund issue arose.  What is the refund position with both airlines?  We have had many complaints from consumers who are entitled and eligible for a refund.  The process seems extremely slow and the Irish Travel Agents Association has taken a huge amount of criticism as a result.  Will the witnesses update us?  What is their attitude to refunds?  How have the airlines approached that?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses agree we have no possibility of opening the airports and bringing people on to aircrafts unless we put a rapid testing system in place?  This is all about people having the confidence to board an aircraft and fly.  Obviously, the movement of people generates movement within the economy but, as things stand, we are at a complete standstill.  What is the view on rapid testing?  What is the level of communication between the airlines and the Dublin Airport Authority and the Department on rapid testing?  How do the witnesses see that progressing?</p> <p>  In terms of Christmas, I understood from the way we were moving yesterday and from the statements emanating from Government previously that we hoped for some happy reunions at Christmas.  Therefore, I hoped that we would have a co-ordinated policy, and that guidelines would be set out so people could understand the basis on which they could return home for Christmas.  However, yesterday, the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, and NPHET poured cold water on that.  There does not seem to be a co-ordinated approach of one voice and one action.  The policy is all over the shop and we seem to be making it up as we go along.  There is no place more impacted than the aviation industry because of a lack of direction and policy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.442" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Moriarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020102800002#J00500"><p>With respect to the first question from Deputy Lowry that related to the business community and the impact a lack of connectivity is having on it, increasingly, we are hearing voices from the business community expressing concern about the lack of connectivity.  I have heard it expressed best by some executives with significant investments in Ireland who expressed a wish to walk the land and review their investment in Ireland but that is not something they can do.  That not only impacts on the existing foreign direct investment in Ireland but also future investments that may or may not be made.  It is quite clear that Ireland is putting itself at a significant disadvantage by the policies it has adopted in preventing business traffic.</p> <p>  With respect to state aid and the appearance by Mr. Cornelis at the committee yesterday, I confirm that the aviation recovery task force made a number of recommendations but none of them has been implemented.  First, two of the recommendations related to the application of waivers or rebates with respect to airport and air navigation charges.  Second, the task force spoke about a stimulus package with respect to regional airports.  It is not clear to me whether they would constitute state aid or not but the State should consider implementing the recommendations, and if that requires an application to be lodged with the European Commission, then it should make it.  To be clear, Aer Lingus has not made any application to the State for state aid, on a direct basis.</p> <p>  With respect to the refund issue, Aer Lingus has received in excess of 2 million refund or voucher requests since the start of the crisis and that is driven by the unprecedented level of flight cancellations.  To date, we have processed 1.8 million refunds and vouchers, which is more than 90% of the requests we have received.  Of the remaining 10%, we are working through them.  Some of them are very challenging in terms of the complexity of the bookings.  We are working through them and are committed to getting those refunds to our customers.</p> <p>  With respect to rapid testing, and I am not sure whether the Acting Chairman heard my remarks earlier, Aer Lingus believes that a rapid, affordable testing solution, based on antigen testing, is critical in order to meaningfully increase the level of international travel, and safely doing so.  It is our view that that testing needs to be at a screening standard, not at a diagnostic standard.  The reason for that is that there are many other risk mitigations that make travel safe.</p> <p>  With respect to the comments on Christmas, I would agree that a lack of co-ordination and lack of a consistent and clear voice as to what the policy is has bedevilled aviation since March.  I am aware of the comments that have been referred to but the lack of consistency has been a feature of the crisis since the start.</p></speech>

Mr. Wilson, in his opening statement, referred to the decisions taken on the Cork and Shannon bases.  He said he was really disappointed that he had not heard from either the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, or the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, at the time.  He said the decision could have been averted had he had a conversation with either the Minister or Minister of State.  I ask him to quickly elaborate on that point.</p></speech>

We had that well signalled, in that if they had adopted the traffic light system, as initially put forward by the European Council of Ministers, which was the freedom of movement for green and amber countries.  We made our stance absolutely clear to this committee and the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  We wrote to the Minister on that basis on several occasions and yet we had no engagement whatsoever.</p><p>Honestly, I find it extraordinary to this day.  Imagine that a factory of that size owned by Pfizer or Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson in Cork closed down and the Minister for Health or the Minister with responsibility for industry and commerce did not contact the company.  We could have at least explored the options but we did not get that opportunity.</p></speech>

I raised the matter yesterday with representatives of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, but I would not mind hearing what it would mean for our guests' airlines.  We are fewer than 70 days away from the end of the transition period and we do not seem to have a proper legal framework to address what is next for the open skies agreement.  I have heard soundings from Ministers in London who have said they believe there will be an agreement.  I have concerns that at this stage we cannot see the agreement in its entirety and I am sure that the Government is looking to address those issues in the omnibus legislation.  It is a real concern that we are in the mouth of the end of the transition and still do not have a legal framework for the open skies agreement.  How will that have an impact our guests and their airlines?</p></speech>

The Senator may recall the last occasion when there was a hard stop in terms of imminent Brexit effects.  At that point, a contingency arrangement was put in place.  We would expect that in the event of the failure of trade discussions, such a contingency arrangement would also be put in place on this occasion.  That happened in preparation for the last expected hard stop to emerge from Brexit.</p></speech>

I expect that if we had people from the hospitality or retail sectors before us, we would hear similar passion about the reopening of their sectors.

Can our guests identify what other countries on a green or orange traffic light would allow travel into their countries without any restrictions?</p></speech>

I assume the Senator is referring to staff in Shannon Airport.  Throughout the crisis, we have tried to align working hours and pay with the amount of work that needs to be done.  We made some recent changes in respect of our staff at Shannon Airport by giving them an option to return to a work pool at 40% pay in preparation for a resumption of operations or a winter lay-off.  We put a similar arrangement in place for our cabin crew at Shannon.  We have also launched voluntary severance schemes and incentivised career break schemes for our cabin crew.  We have not taken the step of offering our staff to the HSE for the purpose of contact tracing.  To be honest, it is our assumption that there is sufficient availability within the public sector to provide that facility.</p></speech>

That has been our approach across our business regardless of location.  Employees in the form of fixed-term contractors have left our business and contractors who were due to join our business over the busy summer period ultimately did not do so.  We have engaged in consultation with our staff and their representatives on redundancies.  When we wrote to the Minister in that regard, we told him that we were looking at up to 500 redundancies.  Consultation and the deployment of schemes are ongoing, but we now anticipate that the number of redundancies will be approximately 250.  That figure is based on our assumptions about the recovery.  Our plan is to run a significant operation in summer 2021 from all of our bases.  In order to facilitate that, certain changes in policy and the implementation of the traffic light system have to take place.</p></speech>

In extraordinary times, however, it is possible to have state aid that is legal.  As set out in the task force's recommendations, Aer Lingus, Ryanair and any other airline that flies in and out of Ireland could access reduced rates of airport charges or rebates on same.  That would be fundamental in decisions to base aircraft in Ireland from next summer.  We urge the Minister to do something on that.</p> <p>  Regarding businesses that are involved, we carry a large number of people to and from the UK.  Many of them work in the NHS and so on.  They have been discommoded by travel bans.  One can only imagine what is going on in Pfizer and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson in Cork where they are battling to develop a vaccine but it looks like access out of Cork Airport is slowly being strangled.</p> <p>  Anyone who wanted a cash refund has got a cash refund.  It is accessible on the website.  One will find people who are noisy about this but who were not entitled to refunds.  If someone is entitled to a valid refund, he or she will get it.</p> <p>  Regarding travel agents, there is a process on our website.  We must be sure that the person is getting his or her money back because that is what we are obliged to do under EU Regulation 261/2004.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation understands that.</p> <p>  As to the question on Christmas, the Chief Medical Officer's decisions must be based on science.  Saying at this stage that we should not have travel, regardless of where people come from, is to take the same route we followed in the summer when we trashed the tourism industry and policy failures saw the rates of Covid-19 spiral due to domestic factors.  We must learn to live with this virus, restore our economy and protect the most vulnerable.  There must be a way of doing that as opposed to this continuous cycle of lockdown, which will get us nowhere.  We are very vulnerable as an economy.</p> <p>  I hope I answered all of the questions.</p></speech>

Perhaps they will prove us wrong but we need a track record as to whether it is going to work.  I keep coming back to this.  In other European countries at the moment, a person can fly without that.  We are an outlier and have been since the start of this.  We are now reaping that in places like Cork and Shannon Airports which really depend on high load factors.

In the week the new regime begins, it will withdraw from flights.  It is important it is said, and we heard it in the last comment, that this is based on a lack of bookings.  Two things are at play here.  There is the orange and red countries and the lack of uniformity.  That message rings loud and clear as does the need for testing.  The fact is that the same barriers make flying out of Dublin difficult.  Ryanair will still fly out of Dublin Airport but not out of Shannon and Cork Airports.  That point needs to be made loud, clear and several times.  The airlines are making this decision on a commercial basis, based on low booking rates for both of those airports.</p> <p>  In terms of flying at Christmas and putting on extra flights, I want to hear from both airlines about their short-term and medium-term commitments to getting planes flying out of Shannon Airport again.  Under what circumstances will they revise their spring and summer schedule?  I want to hear what both airlines can say to the staff they have based in Shannon Airport because I am aware they talk about good communications.  I have seen staff getting videos and Whatsapp messages.  They need to know, unequivocally, from both airlines what the coming months will be like for them as workers who work for those companies out of the Shannon base.  Will the airlines use staff based in their Dublin base to supplement what they are doing or to replace them if there are flights?  I am specifically talking about cabin crew.  I want to hear from both witnesses on that, please.</p></speech>

That is what we want to do.  I am aware I am reiterating what I said earlier but there are key things that must be done to enable that to happen successfully.  They are the policy change and the appropriate implementation of the traffic light system and the rapid antigen testing regime I outlined.</p> <p>  We have been communicating extensively with our colleagues based in Shannon Airport.  As the Deputy said, we are doing so by video message.  I do not really apologise for that.  It is entirely appropriate in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  We have also made significant changes recently in terms of pay through the introduction of 40% pay for availability to be in a work pool or winter leave, and we have introduced voluntary severance programmes.</p> <p>  We are, therefore, engaging extensively with our staff about all the options open to them and about the future in terms of our ambition.  As I said, our ambition is to maintain an employment relationship with as many of our employees as we possibly can and to do that we want to restore our operations to a sustainable level.  We need, however, the support of the State at a policy level to enable that to happen.</p></speech>

We spoke to them about the closures of those bases in recent weeks in terms of the winter schedule.  Our hope is that we will reopen those bases next summer, that is, from 1 April onwards.  What we need, however, is some basis for doing that and as a start we must be able to, at least, have a fighting chance before we get demand to recover.  Flights for Christmas will be there from 14 December onwards and we would hope that people will be back travelling by that time.</p> <p>  We are committed to Shannon and Cork Airports but the demand is just not there at the moment.  November is typically one of the worst months to try to stimulate people to travel and pricing is not going to do that.  It is the policy failures of this Government and it needs to rapidly do something about it before this situation gets worse.  It does not affect our colleagues there at the moment because, unfortunately, they have already been laid off and we would hope to have them back next summer.  I hope there is some action as a result of this meeting, in particular by the Minister, to adopt the aviation task force recommendations and put something in place for next summer to attract traffic back into Cork and Shannon Airports.</p></speech>

We have seen the closure of our base in Toulouse in France.  We have had a reduction in traffic and we ran a reduced schedule throughout the summer and this winter.  We recently announced that, and it is part of the further cutbacks coming in Cork and Shannon.  It is happening everywhere across Europe.</p> <p>  On refunds, anybody entitled to a cash refund can get that refund.  This can be done directly on the website.  The Deputy referred to the travel agents issue earlier and I have already answered that.</p></speech>

We ask that they bear with us until the new system for flights is introduced by the Government on 8 November.  Ryanair and Aer Lingus are very important to us because of the number of people they employ.  This is a national crisis and we hope the airlines, like everyone else, will play their part to ensure we can get flights back in the air in a safe way.

Members should be aware that the representatives from Aeroporti di Roma have informed us that they will leave the meeting after one hour.  I propose to reduce the time for questions from seven minutes to five minutes in that context.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Witnesses attending in the committee room are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they will have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything said at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  If statements are potentially defamatory, therefore, regarding an identified person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that the witnesses comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending the meeting remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses participating in this meeting from jurisdictions outside this State are also advised that they should be mindful of their domestic law and how that may apply to the evidence they give.  All witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding the identified person or entity, the witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are also reminded that committee meetings should conclude within two hours in any one day.  This committee is scheduled to sit twice today, and this is the second sitting, for a cumulative time of just under four hours.  Members, therefore, are asked to rotate in and out of the meeting when they have finished asking their questions.  With the indulgence of the other witnesses, in the context of Mr. Bassato having to go within an hour, I ask him to be the first to make a presentation.  Is that okay with Ms Considine?</p></speech>

We are very proud and happy to be part of this committee sitting.  I thank the members of the committee for inviting me to contribute to this session.  It is an honour for me to have the opportunity to share with the members of the committee the views of Aeroporti di Roma on the future of travel in the aviation sector.</p> <p>  The pandemic has posed an unprecedented challenge to airports, which have found themselves with a need to evolve their approach rapidly to comply with the paradigm shift in travel and tourism.  Aeroporti di Roma's primary commitment today is to create the necessary conditions to relaunch traffic in maximum safety.  We have been working relentlessly to implement effective protection measures and a strong prevention plan.  We installed multiple screening tools, engaged in a series of sanitation activities and supported the Italian health authorities' testing operations by establishing a testing area in the arrivals hall and a large drive-through testing facility at the long-term stay parking facility of the airport.  We are also, however, the first airport in Europe to have trialled a system of 100% Covid-tested flights, on the Rome-Milan route, in partnership with Alitalia and the health authorities of the Lazio region.</p> <p>  Our long-term goal in this respect is to use the expertise we developed to contribute to the creation and implementation of new global travel protocols, focusing on expanding the 100% Covid-tested flight system.  Indeed, we regard the use of large-scale pre-departure rapid testing as one of the safest alternatives to current restrictions on non-EU travel flows, especially in respect of mandatory self-quarantine, as well as a protocol that would simultaneously increase passengers&rsquo; confidence.  I am proud to say that the effectiveness of our health safety plan has been recognized by international bodies such as RINA, Airports Council International, ACI, and Skytrax, which rated Rome Fiumicino Airport with the highest score of five stars for its measures and protocols, as well as by primary international media that have endorsed the Covid-testing system available at Rome's airports.</p> <p>  To adapt to the new normal is a big challenge for all of us.  I am confident that with efforts and international co-operation, we will succeed.  I thank the committee for the time dedicated to me, and I remain available for any questions.</p></speech>

The prospects for the global aviation sector have worsened as the virus continues its hold on our people, our way of life and our economy.  The situation in which we now find ourselves as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic is a far cry from the positivity back in January, when we were anticipating growth across all our Shannon Group businesses, including the airport.</p> <p>  Since presenting to the joint committee on 7 October, the situation at Shannon Airport has deteriorated considerably, unfortunately.  On 15 October, Ryanair announced its decision to temporarily close its bases at Shannon and Cork airports for the winter period.  We have since moved into level 5 restrictions, and Ryanair has advised us that it has seen a total collapse in its forward bookings.  The airline now plans to cancel its flights from Shannon Airport for a month, from 14 November to 12 December.  This is really disappointing news for us and for the other airports affected.  As a result, we now expect passenger numbers to be down by more than 80% by the end of the year.</p> <p>  This is also very disheartening for our airport employees, who have worked hard to keep the airport operational throughout the pandemic.  There is genuine worry now among businesses in this region who rely on the connectivity that the airport provides and also for those involved in tourism who rely on inbound and outbound flights from Shannon Airport to make a living.  There is great disappointment among our loyal customers as well, whose continued support we depend on.  This latest announcement shows just how critical the situation has become, and how vulnerable the aviation sector is right now.</p><p>It copper-fastens the urgent need for targeted financial assistance to protect our airports, airlines and our air connectivity.  To put the situation in context, we have had no transatlantic services operating from Shannon since March of this year.  Two of our US carriers, Delta and United, have advised that they will not resume services into Shannon until 2022 at the earliest.  Aer Lingus has also suspended its transatlantic and Heathrow services.</p><p> It is ironic that we have just marked the 75th anniversary of the first ever scheduled commercial transatlantic passenger plane which landed at Shannon Airport on 24 October 1945.  As a result of that first transatlantic service, Shannon became the original airport gateway between the US and Europe, developing a strong transatlantic business and becoming the home to many global firsts for aviation.</p><p> All of this, unfortunately, is poles apart from where we find ourselves today.  It creates a determination and resolve, however, to restore our lost connectivity.  Since we last met, we welcomed the announcement in budget 2021 of &euro;5 million capital funding for Shannon Airport.  It will also provide for the extension of the employment wage subsidy scheme and the waiver on commercial rates.  However, in light of the group&rsquo;s revenues being down on average &euro;1.3 million a week since the onset of the pandemic, we urgently require further supports.</p><p> The aviation sector is in free fall.  As an island nation we need to connect to the rest of the world.  Our economy is dependent on a thriving aviation industry.  While recovery in the aviation sector is some time off, we must protect our nation&rsquo;s air connectivity and our vital airport infrastructure.  What we need now is a clear pathway to recovery for aviation, a robust system to allow us to get aviation moving.  We welcome the decision by the Government to implement the EU traffic light system.  There is still confusion, however, as to how it will be implemented which urgently needs to be addressed at EU level.  There needs to be one streamlined, harmonised system that is applied throughout Europe for it to work in a meaningful way.</p><p> The continuation of current travel restrictions is heavily impacting passenger numbers.  Testing instead of restriction on movements has to be the way forward.</p></speech>

We are ready to roll out a pre-departure Covid-19 testing regime at the airport once agreed testing protocols are in place.  Pre-departure testing is already proving effective in many other countries, a robust testing regime at airports can help to restore confidence and get aviation moving safely again.</p> <p>  Our economy is dependent on a thriving aviation industry and restoring air connectivity is now critical as we learn to co-exist with the virus.  In the meantime, we must protect our airports to ensure they can continue to do what they do best, namely, welcome passengers, play a crucial role in globalisation, connect cities and countries, foster economic activity and encourage international commerce and tourism, all of which generate employment in our regions.</p> <p>  While the latest news on the development of a vaccine is encouraging, we know recovery will take time.  It is important we plan now for the safe restoration of air services.  We urgently need to see the full implementation of the aviation recovery task force recommendations published on 7 July.  These call for supports for aviation and, particularly in the case of Shannon, support for regional airports, as well as rebuilding and international connectivity.  In the context of the devastating financial impact of this pandemic, there is an urgent need for Shannon Airport to be incorporated into the regional airports programme.  This would see the airport receive vitally needed operational, as well as capital expenditure, supports.</p> <p>  As I have outlined to the committee previously, businesses on the western seaboard which rely on air connectivity to sustain their operations need critical air services from Shannon Airport to the UK, US, and, particularly in the context of Brexit, to a central European hub.  None of these air services, however, will be viable until the markets recover which experts say could be as far out as 2024.  In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is ravaging the aviation sector across the globe, we are calling on the Government to provide financial supports for these vital air services until they can return to normal commercial levels of activity.  We are asking the Government to support us to ensure these routes are not lost to the region.</p> <p>  We have taken many short-term difficult decisions in Shannon Group to deal with Covid-19 in order to preserve our businesses for the future.  Shannon Airport is the hub which connects the region&rsquo;s people and industry with the world.  This will be needed more than ever as we recover from this crisis.  Shannon Airport is a valuable State asset which needs to be protected and supported.  We hope this will be provided for in the forthcoming national economic plan which we expect to be published next month.</p></speech>

I call on Mr. Philips, Dublin Airport Authority, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.588" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dalton Philips" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020102800002#BB00500"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to continue the discussion regarding the ongoing devastating impact of Covid-19 on the aviation sector.  Since my last appearance before the committee on 7 October, we have lost a further 1.5 million passengers, the population of Dublin, Cork and Limerick cities combined.</p> <p>  The European Commission has also adopted the framework for a common approach to travel within the EU.  The Government&rsquo;s decision to adopt that framework is the first step on a long road to rebuilding our connectivity.  Unfortunately, however, the final European framework did not go nearly as far as anticipated.  While we have this traffic light system in place, the road ahead for safely reopening European aviation is still littered with obstacles.  Of primary concern is the fact that EU member states will set their own testing and quarantine rules without harmonisation.  What we need is a system that delivers effective EU-wide co-ordination.</p> <p>  The Government has yet to formally announce how it will apply the new traffic light system in Ireland.  From comments made by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, when she addressed the committee last week, it appears that 14-day movement restrictions will continue to apply to passengers from red and amber countries.  This may be waived for those arriving from amber areas if they have a negative pre-departure test.  There is a suggestion that movement restrictions for those arriving from red areas may be reduced to five days if a person has a negative test five days after arrival in Ireland.</p> <p>  In contrast, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, has noted that travel restrictions are of &ldquo;questionable effectiveness&rdquo; when community transmission is ongoing, which is currently the case in most of Europe.  Accordingly, opportunities for any significant uplift in travel as a result of this system are likely to be extremely limited.  Red and amber zones currently account for about 98% of our potential passengers.  Travel restrictions will continue to apply to these passengers.  Even when case levels decrease in other European countries, travel to Ireland will remain closed off if quarantines continue to apply.  In our view, pre-departure testing for both orange and red zone locations would be a safer alternative as it would mean we could screen out a significant proportion of risk before a passenger arrives in Ireland.  This view is shared by all of Europe&rsquo;s airports and airlines.</p> <p>  A recent survey of consumers conducted for the International Air Transport Association, IATA, shows widespread support for testing rather than quarantines or movement restrictions.</p><p>Some 83% of consumers said they will not fly if they have to quarantine on arrival, but 88% said they are willing to be tested to facilitate travel.  Two thirds of European countries now offer testing at their airports.  As I noted previously, DAA had secured suppliers to deliver pre-departure testing facilities at our airports using PCR methodology as a first step.  Unfortunately, thus far the State has not provided DAA with the planning exemption required to establish these facilities, which has been granted to others, and we cannot therefore offer on-site testing at our airports at this point.  As there is market demand for pre-testing, we will share information on private sector providers via our websites and other channels, although our preference remains to offer pre-departure testing on site.  We will continue to engage with the relevant authorities on this.</p><p> We have spent months working on potential pre-departure testing at our airports in the belief that there would be a harmonised European system and that the Government would unequivocally support a pre-departure testing approach.  Unfortunately, this does not seem to be the emerging picture.  An outbound testing facility is required to support reciprocal arrangements in other countries and to facilitate reinstating Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity.  Ultimately, the slow turnaround time and the cost of PCR means that it will not represent a viable, long-term testing option.  To truly get people moving again we must look at rapid, affordable and scalable testing options such LAMP and antigen testing.  In this respect, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, recently published a report which advised NPHET to consider implementing such tests.  There is evidence to show that other countries are starting to embrace these technologies.  We have just heard about it from Rome.  Five airports are currently offering rapid testing, including Heathrow and Paris Charles De Gaulle.  Ironically, it appears that under the Government&rsquo;s planned application of the traffic light system, Ireland will accept a pre-departure antigen test if it is approved in another EU state, but will not endorse this system at home.</p><p> The view of the aviation industry is that without the traffic light model, EU member states should focus on pre-testing rather than other measures.  However, if we fail to also improve the delivery and cost effectiveness of the testing regime that underpins it, we will most certainly suffer further significant losses in services, as has been the unfortunate experience at Cork Airport recently and in what we have just heard from Ms Considine in Shannon.  In closing, Christmas is just 58 days away.  We want to welcome home our loved ones safely and to allow those living here who have not been able to see their families overseas to be reunited.  We appeal for the committee's support for the adoption of a rapid, affordable, scalable approach to pre-departure testing that will facilitate reinstating travel in the long-term economic and social interests of our country.</p></speech>

Before proceeding with questions from members, I have some questions.  Mr. Bassato, with regard to the rapid testing that has been introduced in Rome airport, according to your presentation there is a 30-minute turnaround.  What is the level of positive tests?  Who pays for the test?  Is it paid by the airport or through the ticket of the passenger?  Who carries out the test?  Are they employees of the airport or has the airport contracted it to a third party company?  Furthermore, did the airport require planning permission from the state authorities to establish such a facility?  How long did it take to establish it?  I understand it is applied to 100% of passengers on the Rome to Milan flight.  Perhaps, Mr. Bassato will give us an overall view.  It is something we are seeking to promote here, but you are doing it in real time at Rome airport today so perhaps you will describe exactly how it works.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ivan Bassato" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020102800002#CC00300"><p>Currently there are two large screening operations going on in Fiumicino airport and one in Ciampino airport.  We manage the two airports in Rome, Fiumicino, the biggest one, and the smallest, Ciampino.  There are two operations in Fiumicino and one in Ciampino.  The screening operation is directly managed by the health authorities of the region of Rome.  Healthcare operations in Italy are under the exclusive authority of the 20 regions of Italy.</p> <p>  The operation started on 16 August following an order of the national government of Italy to test the passengers arriving from countries within the European Union who were considered tourists.  The Italian rule now foresees that there are two different regimes.  There were no restrictions on intra-EU travel up to that date, at least between the lockdown and 12 August.  Then the government introduced restrictions, and I will discuss them in a few seconds.  The second part of the regime is for passengers coming from non-EU destinations outside the external border of the European Union.  In that case quarantine or self-isolation for 14 days and limitations and restrictions apply.  The passengers were mandated to test when they came to Italy from 12 August and we implemented that requirement on 16 August, four days later.  At that time the four countries within the Union that were considered highly at risk were Spain, Greece, Croatia and Malta.  That list changed following the evolution of the pandemic on the Continent.  Currently, there is a requirement for passengers to test before entering Italy - at the airport, where possible, or within 48 hours after entering Italy - if they are coming from the following European states: Spain, France, United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and Czech Republic.  All the remaining European Union member states, including Ireland, are not subject to the limitations at present upon entry into Italy.</p> <p>  The passengers have two options.  They are asked to test, negative or positive.  If they test negative obviously there is a certain course of action.  If they test positive there is another course of action.  They can choose between the two options - molecular or antigen testing before leaving their country of origin within a time limit of 72 hours.</p></speech>

I confirm it is a rapid antigen test.  It takes 30 minutes to provide a response once the nasal swab is taken.  I cannot provide results about the positivity rate because that is not in our responsibility or ownership.  They should be addressed to the regional health authorities in Rome.</p><p>It is provided for free to locals and foreigners.</p></speech>

We think it is a success and Alitalia shares this view.  We are discussing rolling out the project on other routes.

We are in discussion with several parties in the industry and the authorities to achieve this.</p></speech>

This is a significant issue which was outlined to us by Mr. Philips.  What is the issue around that?  Will Mr. Philips expand on the issue that means they are not able to avail of a fast-tracked planning process for Covid infrastructure at airports?</p></speech>

There are two routes to go in introducing pre-departure testing at the airports.  In either case, permission is required.  Statutory Instrument 93/2020 has been used, for example, in Croke Park.  We have not been able to avail of that yet although we urgently need to set up a pre-departure testing regime.  If we cannot get that, we would have to go the traditional planning route, which could take an inordinate period of time and is very costly.  We are urgently waiting to see if we can use the statutory instrument at the moment but we have had no joy.</p></speech>

It needs to be signed off by a Minister and at the moment there is a concern that we would be facilitating travel by having pre-departure testing but, as we know with the EU traffic light system, there will ultimately be reciprocity.  If one wants to go to 11 of the major countries in the EU at the moment, one needs a pre-departure test.  We are shutting ourselves off.</p></speech>

In terms of capital infrastructure projects ongoing at the airports or which had been planned in the next number of years, do the witnesses have any intentions to ask the Government for support with such projects, taking advantage of the quiet period with low levels of air traffic?</p></speech>

Ms Considine will speak for Shannon.  It is &euro;100 million plus in Dublin just to keep the lights on.  Cork is in a very severe situation and needs about &euro;70 million of capital over the next five years, which includes a total runway reconstruction.  At the moment, when we are losing &euro;1 million per day and running out of liquidity, we will have no option but to go back to the Government.  That is part of the aviation task force.</p></speech>

It is important that should happen.  Does Ms Considine have something to say on that?</p></speech>

As Mr. Philips said, we have critical maintenance work that needs to be done in the airport on an ongoing basis.  Our airport averages &euro;7 million to &euro;8 million per annum for maintenance, safety, security and regulatory work.  We included that in our budgets for next year and we welcomed the Government support of &euro;5 million towards the completion of those projects for 2021.  We have to put a level of matched funding against it and that is a challenge in the context of the significant losses we are incurring this year.  That is why, in addition to capital support, we have asked to be included in the regional airports programme, which will provide a level of operational funding as well.  Airports with fewer than 3 million passengers per year under EU state aid are entitled to get that support.  However, the State-owned airports of Shannon and Cork do not currently get Exchequer support.</p></speech>

There is a major requirement for the Department of Transport to act on that immediately in parallel with the Departments with responsibility for expenditure and capital investment.  I am sure other representatives will follow up on that.</p> <p>  I will make a final point to Ms Considine and Mr. Philips.  Transatlantic travel is important to the DAA and to Shannon Airport but it is also important we have political engagement with our respective colleagues in the US and Canada to get our transatlantic services resumed as quickly as possible.  It is disappointing to hear it will be 2022 before transatlantic flights depart from Shannon Airport again.  That needs to be expedited as much as possible if we see a recovery before then.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

Mr. Bassato has come through an experience that Ireland is struggling with.  I have a couple of questions which I hope he will be able to answer.  In terms of rapid antigen testing, what is the sample?  Is it a nasal swab, a throat swab or both?  Who are the manufacturers and suppliers of the rapid antigen tests?  What system is being used?  Does Mr. Bassato know about the performance of the test?  Does it meet the standard of clinical sensitivity of greater than 80%, which is a requirement set out in a recent report by our quality authority here?</p></speech>

In answer to the first question, the rapid test is an antigen test made on a nasal swab sample.  The name of the product chosen by the Italian health authorities is SD BIOSENSOR.  This is in use in Rome but it may be that in other locations in Italy, other products will be used.</p> <p>  Information regarding the clinical performance of the test is not available to the airport authorities.  I am sorry to say this again but it should be requested from the health authorities operating the testing.</p></speech>

The experience in Rome has been mainly of passengers arriving to Rome, following the regulations issued by the Italian Government.  We observed that the number of passengers coming from those countries subject to an obligatory test upon arrival has been declining.  On the Rome-Milan route, which we are testing only partially since 16 September, that is, almost a month and a half, there is stability in the number of passengers.</p></speech>

We had been planning with the authorities from early July until there was a mandatory requirement by the Government.  With the authorities, we did some planning and prepared different scenarios for the evolution of the pandemic.  When the order was introduced, it took four days.  The level of capital expenditure was low because we began in an area that was available in the arrival hall, on the ground floor of the terminal.  We dedicated about 1,000 sq. m to the operation.  Of course, social distancing was required in the area.</p> <p>  The level of capital expenditure for the testing machinery and kits is not known accurately but I would say it is also low because the rapid antigen technology does not require a big investment.</p></speech>

I echo a point made earlier by Mr. Philips.  We are entering a scenario whereby we will accept people coming into this country on the back of a negative rapid antigen test but we seem to be indicating it is not satisfactory for people departing the country.  There is an immediate contradiction in that position.</p></speech>

The system itself has not been implemented yet in the country but we started with a similar regime.  As I stated, the country experienced, in the first part of the summer of 2020, the importation of cases from abroad, in the first instance from countries far from the external border of the EU.  In August, there was a surge of cases among passengers - many were Italian - coming back from holidays in Spain, Greece, Croatia and Malta.  Some countries within the EU were identified as countries bearing a higher risk.  They were not coded at the time as red or amber.  I do not dispute that in the evolution of the legislation in Italy, the system based on the recommendations of the EU can be adopted by our Government.  We have set out six groups of countries, three of which involve EU member states and three of which do not.</p></speech>

Before entering the country, the requirement for testing applies to all means of transport, not only to air transport.  It applies to passengers coming by train or automobile.  Many airports, although not all of them, have screening operations on the way.  Not all involve antigen screening.  It is a question of which is most accessible to the passenger.  The utilisation of antigen testing is growing, however, and the level is much higher by comparison with two months ago, for example.</p></speech>

I have a brief question for Ms Considine on rebuilding confidence in the aviation sector and getting people to travel.  It is obvious that we need a testing regime of our own.  In her presentation, she confirmed that she has worked to apply such a system.  Could she expand on that and explain the extent to which she can roll out testing at Shannon Airport and the numbers that can be catered for if the system is rolled out across Ireland?  Does she envisage that it would be delivered by a private contractor?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.628" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Considine" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020102800002#EE01000"><p>On that query, we have engaged with a private commercial operator who is available to come on site to provide pre-departure Covid-19 testing.  Initially, it would be PCR testing, which is more expensive and takes longer, but subject to approval regarding the LAMP testing, there would be capability to do as envisaged.</p> <p>  We have also engaged with our planning authority, who advises us that it does not consider planning to be required for this because it is ancillary to the airport's activity.  In that regard, if there were agreed protocols on testing, we would be in a position to engage in implementation.  Unfortunately, because of the ongoing travel restrictions, we will not have any scheduled airline services here for a month or so.  That is very concerning.  Everything we can do now to restore confidence and to get people back travelling will be really important.  In the absence of that, however, the private operator would provide a service for other businesses in the region because we do not have enough volume at this stage to warrant an operator coming on site.  It is important, therefore, that the service be made available to other businesses in the region, and there is willingness to do that.  The service would be operated on site at the airport.</p></speech>

It is good to see representatives of Shannon, Cork and Dublin airports back before us.  I compliment them on the work they have done in the intervening period.  They have moved pretty fast in addressing the potential for testing.  They have provided many answers in advance of the questions being posed today, which is welcome.  We can rightly use a considerable amount of information from what we have heard about the situation in Rome.  Bearing in mind the earlier session with the airlines, what is coming across to us today, and certainly to me, is that one of the main issues is that no matter what we do, we cannot do so in isolation in Ireland.  We either move ahead or stall.  Acting in isolation is effectively not going to be of any great benefit because we need to see the harmonised approach at European level.  I suggest to the committee that we invite the Minister of State responsible for European affairs or the Minister for Foreign Affairs to our committee in due course to gain an understanding of the progress on achieving a harmonised approach before we conclude our work.</p> <p>  There has been talk of capital investment at Shannon Airport.  Operational investment will be required.  What is the current financial position?  What assistance will be needed in the medium term?  It is now quite clear, based on NPHET's advice, that there will not be a lot of activity between now and Christmas in the airports.  Ms Considine has already painted a fairly dark picture as to what the early part of next year will be like.  Can she outline the financial supports for the airport on which this committee might make recommendations?</p> <p>  Ms Considine has been working with the HSE on trying to find alternative employment for staff during this difficult period to help them to increase their incomes and pay their bills.  It is really important.  I thank her for the work she has done in this regard.  Has she any update on that?  </p> <p>  My next question is not relevant to my constituency but I am asking it because this is a transport committee.</p><p>Has the DAA looked at assisting staff who have had to take very significant drops in income?  Have the witnesses looked at helping them to augment or supplement that through them acting as contact tracers with the HSE?  </p></speech>

The real challenge for us is the level of operational losses and in the context of that, our immediate ask of Government, which we hope will be included in the national economic plan, is inclusion in the regional airports programme, which would see us benefit for operational funding to cover essential costs like the cost of providing fire service and security cover at the airport.  That would be an immediate ask of Government to help us survive this crisis so we can recover and rebuild.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to the ongoing dialogue with the HSE.  We have engaged with our employees, a number of whom, particularly those on continuing temporary lay-off or on a reduced working week, would be interested in taking up additional work as contact tracers.  We have passed that information to the HSE and are in ongoing discussions with it.  </p></speech>

We are having to say goodbye to over a quarter of our workforce.  Both Dublin and Cork have been heavily impacted.  We do not see the recovery happening until 2023 to 2024 and, therefore, at the moment, we have to say goodbye to people permanently.  We have a voluntary severance scheme in place.  Having said that, Senator Dooley's suggestion about seeing whether we can connect people who are departing with the HSE if they have the requisite skills is a good one and I will follow up on it.</p></speech>

I assume this probably gives us some element of solace of a possibility.  I agree with Senator Dooley that we probably do need a discussion with either the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs because we have had this discussion over the past two decades regarding harmonisation.  What we can do is get our own ducks in a row.  This committee will be discussing matters with NPHET and HIQA, particularly rapid testing, so we should build a conversation regarding the type of antigen testing that is being operated in Rome Airport.  We need to reach some kind of conclusion and put some kind of framework together.  I reiterate the point made by Deputy O'Rourke.  We need some sort of pre-departure testing system that operates from here rather than just to here.</p> <p>  I accept that the airports are having significant difficulties, which means significant worries for workers.  Could Mr. Philips address the proposal on new ways of working, which a number of craft workers have not accepted?  They are now on 60% time.  There is a belief among some of them that these are work practice changes and it is almost a case of "never waste an opportunity like this", namely, the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p> <p>  As some workers working in terminal 2 are on contracts that are not as good as those of people working in terminal 1, they have an issue with pay parity while accepting the difficulties faced by the DAA at this point in time.  We need an operating system across the board to get workers and management through this.  </p></speech>

The traffic is not coming back.  We have lost 25 years of traffic and are back at 1995 levels.  We are a commercial organisation that needs to fulfil a critical State role.  If we do not lower our cost base, we will hit a wall and go bust.  We are saying goodbye to about a quarter to a third of our workforce, somewhere between 750 and 850 people.  For those who remain, we are saying that we can guarantee their wages at 80% with a plan to get them back to 100%, which is unprecedented in the sector because, as we know, many people are on significantly lower levels than that.  We have balloted all our team members and 93% of the groups represented by ballots have voted in favour of the new work practices, which are very fair and in most cases, and I can use crafts as an example, have been in place for the past ten years.  We are dealing with a group of craft workers who, unfortunately, are not in favour of these new work practices, which a number of their colleagues have been operating for the past ten years.  I am talking about people in the same teams.  We are working through that and will continue to engage.  I am very closely involved here.  We do not want to see anybody suffer and I wish it was not the case.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's second question, we do have two people doing the same job in the same airport on different terms and conditions.  This disparity between those who came in on new market-based contracts and those with slightly older contracts has existed for nearly ten years.  It is something of which we are very aware.  Where we can look to bridge that gap, we try to do so but we cannot do it in all cases.  At the moment, it is particularly difficult.  </p></speech>

I imagine that this is a wider conversation that the DAA must have with regard to Government and being able to ensure we deliver when we have operational aviation, as we, hopefully, will have if we go down the road of vaccines and antigen testing.</p></speech>

Our north star in this regard is to have market-based salaries so we do not want to see anybody below the market but we have situations where, with similar-type roles, some people are being paid the equivalent in the market but others are being paid above the market rate.  This issue has been with us for a number of years.</p></speech>

We have two realities here.  We have the reality of what has been happening in this committee over the past two days with all the witnesses increasingly frustrated and understandably angry at the lack of progress and we have the reality of the Minister for Transport cycling to a Cabinet meeting today saying that he would love see airport testing take place.  It is incredible.  Based on everything we are hearing from witnesses, there is no urgency on the part of the Minister regarding this and he has not been taking the lead on this.  This needs to be hammered home by this committee.</p> <p>  I thank our guest from Rome Airport for his wonderful presentation, which is a template for our Government.  Our stakeholders are pushing this as hard this as possible.  I have a few questions for Mr. Philips.  There was a motion in 28 July 2020 in the D&aacute;il regarding the proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) (No. 3) Regulations 2020 concerning airport Covid temporary structures for passenger movement.  That was brought in on 28 July.  Can Mr. Philips speak to that?  Does he have any visibility on that?  I think he mentioned something to Deputy O'Connor.</p><p>There was no debate on it.  It seems like there was some movement from the Department in terms of providing an exemption for temporary structures for Covid testing.  That is the language used.</p></speech>

Due to social distancing, we have reduced the overall capacity of the terminal by 70% and we would need to have people outside.  We were aware of the planning exemption and were going to avail of it for things like temporary marquee structures.</p></speech>

We have obviously followed up on SI 93 of 2020 to determine whether we could move forward with the planning exemption to introduce a testing facility.  I was interested to hear Ms Considine from the Shannon Group say that through her planning authorities she thinks she will be able to get permission.  We are not able to get it at the moment.  Our only route at the moment is to go through the normal planning process which, as the Deputy knows, takes a huge amount of time.</p> <p>  On Deputy O'Rourke's point, we have to have pre-departure to get people out of the country.  We cannot let all the other European countries do the work to get people in.</p></speech>

There is pressure on all our international and regional airports.  We know Cork Airport is worth up to &euro;1 billion a year to the economy of Cork and the south.  What level of engagement has taken place between the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the DAA on Cork Airport, in particular?  I am very interested in the level of engagement with the Minister and senior officials on this.  It is one of my lines of consistent questioning.</p></speech>

We have engaged with the Minister of State with responsibility for aviation, Deputy Naughton, and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, through the DAA and directly.  We are very pleased with the &euro;5 million capital allocation, but our ask is united.  The committee has heard that from every airline and airport.  We have to get our act together on pre-departure testing.</p> <p>  Smaller airports will need financial, capital and regional supports.  Airports and airlines traditionally spend their time disagreeing and in conflict, but the industry is united.  It is on its knees and has had various announcements.  Ms Considine adverted to Ryanair announcing further cuts in the past few days.  If we do not get pre-departure testing soon, there will be very little aviation infrastructure available to return to. </p> <p>  We will need financial, capital and operational supports.  We have &euro;5 million in capital support and a substantial capital programme to get through in Cork, totalling &euro;70 million over the next number of years.  We built a new terminal in 2005 and have not really invested in capital since then because it was not needed, but the airport now needs a lot of airside infrastructure.  This year we will lose in excess of &euro;40 million in operating profits and &euro;20 million after depreciation.  We will need support.  I hope that answered Deputy Smith's question.</p></speech>

Nonetheless, there are some very important questions I would like to ask.  I would like to put a question to Ms Considine from Shannon Airport.  As a Clare Deputy, I recognise that today's news is a huge blow to everyone in the airport.  When did Ryanair and Aer Lingus communicate that they would not fly in and out of Shannon for a one month period and until April, respectively?  How recently was that communicated to the Shannon Group?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.650" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Considine" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020102800002#GG01100"><p>Ryanair informed us only in recent days that there has been a total collapse in bookings, in particular since the imposition of the level 5 restrictions last Wednesday.  This was very unfortunate and disappointing news.  We were just coming to terms with the closure of the base and the fact that the number of Ryanair flights per week had been reduced to eight.  To see those now being pulled for a month is disappointing.</p> <p>  We have been in ongoing dialogue with Aer Lingus.  I do not think there is any surprise in what it has said today.  It has constantly said that Heathrow would be the first route it would look to bring back.  We originally understood the date would be 7 December, but obviously given the ongoing restrictions, the confusion that surrounds the adoption of the European traffic light system and the lack of pre-departure testing, it has advised us that it will not restore the flight until the introduction of the summer schedule next year, which is usually the end of March or the beginning of April.  Transatlantic flights are on sale for the summer season next year.</p></speech>

I know the Shannon Group will play its part for the region, but it is very important that full clarity is brought to bear in that regard, in particular in the case of Aer Lingus whose departure from flying out of Shannon seems further off than its counterpart, Ryanair.</p> <p>  We sense the huge frustration from the airlines that there is not uniformity across the EU member states.  Mr. Eddie Wilson from Ryanair said Germany, Italy, France and Spain had good regimes that are very workable in terms of dealing with orange and red regions.  He felt that only those four member states out of 28 had good regimes in place.  I understand the situation.  In a vacuum of uniformity, there must be some departmental negotiation going on between the Department of Transport and the airports.  What kind of run-in time is needed for a pre-departure testing regime from it being announced politically to having it operational?</p></speech>

We need agreement around the protocols, what type of testing is acceptable and when it will be effective.  We hope that the Government announcement on 8 November will bring some clarity to that and we will be in a position to have the service available for passengers and other businesses in the region.</p></speech>

There is still huge uncertainty facing the sector.  We have heard from the IAA yesterday and the airlines have come before the committee.  They have all told us very honestly the flaws that they see in the traffic light system.</p> <p>  As someone who is heading Shannon Airport, is there anything Ms Considine feels can be done in terms of new policy or otherwise to instill public confidence in the sector?  We all understand the need for a testing regime.  Can anything else be done so that the committee could deliver a message to Government?</p></speech>

We need to remove restrictions and replace them with testing.  There have been significant discussions in the committee today.  There is a unanimous call that there should not be restrictions for green listed as well as amber and orange listed countries and that there be pre-departure testing for passengers coming in.  We would also need to reciprocate that from an Irish perspective.  That is why the airports have done a lot of work to ensure they would be able to put testing in place.  We also need an acceptance of the type of testing.</p><p>My understanding is that there is no acceptance of anything other than PCR testing, which obviously is the most expensive and takes the longest to deliver.  There are certain things that the Irish Government could do today to improve this.  For example, it could have clear communications, remove the ambiguity and try to restore some level of consumer confidence while we are living with this pandemic.</p></speech>

Maybe Mr. Philips could respond briefly.  He will not like what I have to say.  I understand the north runway at Dublin Airport is scheduled for completion in early 2021.  It is an awful lot of money to spend to increase Dublin Airport's dominance in the sector even further.  I note that Mr. Philips, by his own figures, estimates that it will increase connectivity by 34%.  It is retrograde, and I know that it was funded a number of years ago and is near completion.  Where is the DAA at in terms of delivering the additional dominance project beyond the Covid-19 pandemic?  I know that like every organisation, the DAA is facing an immediate crisis, but beyond the Covid pandemic, where is the project in terms of its delivery?  I would like Mr. Philips to explain that to us.  Coming from County Clare, I fear what it will bring.  I would appreciate it if he could update us on the status of the project.</p></speech>

I would say that neither Dublin Airport nor Cork Airport sets the market; passengers set the market.  Airlines choose where they will travel based on passenger demand.  Dublin Airport competes for routes against Manchester, Copenhagen and Vienna airports, for example, rather than against Shannon or Cork airports.  When a large airline has a new aircraft to deploy, it will deploy it between two points on a map.  If it thinks there is a market, it will deploy its aircraft to that end.  We will be competing against all these other airports to win that business.  We have to demonstrate for Dublin, and also for Ireland.  In many cases, we are represented with the Industrial Development Authority, Enterprise Ireland, Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  We go in as a bloc to say to Qatar Airways, for example, that it should put the aircraft on the Doha-Dublin route, rather than the Doha-Copenhagen route, because this is the size of the market.  A route lost to Dublin is a route lost to Ireland.  It is not an issue of whether it is Dublin Airport or Shannon Airport.  The airlines will choose where they go based on the demand.</p> <p>  On the question of the runway, we are near completion.  Dublin Airport has been operating at capacity for many years now.  We have the greatest admiration for what Ms Considine and the team do in Shannon Airport.  This is not about us winning a Doha flight from Qatar Airways in a competition between Dublin Airport and Shannon Airports - it is about us competing with airports like those in Copenhagen, Manchester or Vienna.</p></speech>

We have been challenging around the need to get something that is rapid and scalable, and not just PCR, but LAMP or antigen testing.</p></speech>

The second question is whether antigen or PCR testing should be used.  I am not a scientist, but it seems to me that the veracity of the testing of antigen is becoming so sophisticated that we can go with antigen testing, which is rapid and scalable.  The last question is what we should do with the amber and red countries.  Do we allow pre-departure for both, or just one?  They are three simple questions.  If we can do that, we can get the country open again.</p></speech>

We have a member of staff assigned to the overall DAA team on testing and we are sharing all of our data with Shannon Airport.

I compliment the committee because what we have heard today from our colleague in Rome gives us all very strong food for thought in terms of the direction in which we need to go.  I was particularly concerned about the presentation by the Ryanair CEO, Eddie Wilson, this morning, where he said that if something is to be done for Cork and Shannon, it must be done now.  He also spoke about the lack of communication with the airlines by the Ministers.  Would Ms Considine like to comment about the lack of communication the airlines say they have received from the Ministers?

I heard Mr. Wilson's comments on the lack of dialogue with Ministers.  For our part, we have been in ongoing discussions with the officials in the Department of Transport and with Oireachtas Members, and we have briefed both the Minister of State and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan.  They are all aware of the challenges we are facing in the business.  We have heard the industry and the airports collectively saying we all need to work together.  If we want to reopen aviation in a safe manner, we need to adopt the European traffic light system, it needs to be harmonised across Europe and we need to adopt pre-departure testing.  The most effective test would be the most cost-effective, which is antigen.  We have all flagged that if things are not done quickly, the risks are very severe for airports like ourselves.  Ryanair had flagged for a good while that the market had collapsed and that if we did not reopen aviation, these services were at risk.  Unfortunately, this has come to pass.</p></speech>

In fact, he went on to threaten next summer's business as well, which I found particular disconcerting in regard to Shannon.  I want to broaden out the conversation to ask Ms Considine about leverage.  What leverage does Shannon Airport have right now in this marketplace?  We are all horrified that there are going to be no flights out of Shannon for over a month, in effect.  However, while Aer Lingus has cut back services, it has kept a service from Cork and there are services from Dublin.  Why has Shannon been singled out as the airport that has no services for the next three months at a minimum?</p></speech>

We are in ongoing dialogue with it and it is a very important customer to us and services very important markets.  Transatlantic services are key for us and, obviously the Heathrow service is our main hub into Europe at the moment, before Brexit.  It is a really important customer and we have been in ongoing dialogue with it.  The reality is that Covid has decimated aviation and decimated demand.  The restrictions in place means people have been advised not to travel except for essential purposes, and we are not supposed to travel beyond 5 km from our home unless it is for essential work.  That is the reality.  The Government is advising people not to travel and, therefore, the demand has fallen through the floor and nobody is booking flights.  As a consequence, the airlines have made the very difficult decision to pull services.  This is devastating for us.  It is devastating for our employees and for the people of this region, who rely on the services.  That is why we all need to do everything we can to get aviation reopened in a safe manner.</p> <p>  We all know there will be a very slow recovery and that is why the measures we are calling for are so important until normal commercial activity resumes.  All the analysts say it probably will be 2024 before the market resumes at normal activity levels.  After that, they are talking about up to five or ten years before there is a full recovery in yield.  That is a real concern and is why supports are needed in the near term and medium term as we recover from this crisis. </p></speech>

I am not convinced that Shannon as a stand-alone airport has the leverage to win back that business in the difficult next three or four years.  It is striking to note that 96% of the airport growth prior to this crisis was all on the east coast.  I cannot understand how people in the mid-west can benefit from a model which puts Shannon in direct competition with Cork and Dublin.  Is it not time for a rethink?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.694" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Considine" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020102800002#JJ00900"><p>Obviously, aviation policy is that we have two State airport authorities.  For our part, we are very focused, as part of the Shannon Group, on driving not only passengers through the airport but growing the economy footprint of this region.  That is why we have invested almost &euro;130 million in the region.  This has not only addressed historic underinvestment in the airport but it has also brought new property solutions to the market and new investment to the region, which in turn supports services.  The committee will have heard others today say airlines need demand.  They will not just fly to a place; there has to be a reason to do it, so there needs to be economic activity and tourism in the region.  We are investing in driving our economic footprint and in tourism products and all of that in turn will support the airport.</p> <p>  It is a real chicken and egg situation.  The air services to the airport are a real selling point in trying to attract new industry into the region.  That is the starting point and we need to continue to invest in growing this region.  Prior to Covid, we were on a growth trajectory and we expected growth in the airport, growth in the commercial property business and growth in Shannon heritage business, and our aviation custom has grown from over 40 companies in the group in 2014 to over 80 today.  I cannot agree with the Senator that this has not worked.  We were on a growth trajectory but Covid has just decimated everything.  Our colleagues in Dublin and Cork say the same.  Traffic into the country is down 90% so we are all on our knees at this stage.</p></speech>

We heard earlier from the airlines and we are hearing now from those working in the airports and the aviation sector on the ground.  Something we heard a lot about today is demand, to which Ms Considine also referred.  An issue of great concern to me, and I hope to the witnesses as well, is the toxic aspect that has developed around aviation in Ireland, which has not happened in other European countries.  It is something we need to tackle.  I am sure the public at large will read what has been said here today by the representatives of the aviation industry in Ireland, and see the extraordinary measures they have taken to ensure that aviation is safe again and to ensure we can get planes back in the air and passengers through our airports.  That is the key message that needs to come out of today's meeting.</p> <p>  Another important message is that the Government must now realise, after hearing all the evidence given to this committee, that it has to take action to commence pre-departure testing and antigen testing.  I certainly will be talking to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Transport following the appearances at this committee.  This is critical and we need to champion it, as a country.</p><p>Ireland is incredibly dependent on the aviation sector for its economy and society.  As many as 140,000 jobs are supported by the aviation sector in Ireland, which means 140,000 incomes for families across the country.  It is time that people started to look with some degree of perspective at how important the sector is to this country.  We cannot afford to make any more mistakes.  I thank the witnesses for the information given but it is time for the Government to act.  I will allow in Deputy Crowe to conclude. </p></speech>

We will have a level of transit operations that goes through the airport.  We will also have general aviation.  We will facilitate the movement of aircraft in and out of our hangar facilities.  We have a large cluster of maintenance, repair and overhaul or MRO operators based around the airport so it is important that we maintain services for those because they are significant employers in the region.  We will have no scheduled traffic which is devastating for the airport and it is the first time that I can ever remember anything like this.  It is very concerning and that is why we need urgent action now.  We cannot afford to be back here in another month talking about the same stuff.  We need action now.</p></speech>

We had nine scheduled airlines and 51 scheduled routes in Cork.  Aer Lingus is continuing to operate into Heathrow and, periodically, into Amsterdam and have just indicated that they will continue to do so through the depths of whatever the crisis unfolds.</p> <p>  A new airline that we launched last year is KLM.  We have a very successful relationship with KLM into Amsterdam.  The Dutch royal family came over to be associated with the inaugural flight and presented us with some stuff.  KLM has agreed that it will continue to operate.  So we will have two scheduled airlines.  We also have search and rescue, transplants, general aviation, the Air Corps and so on.</p> <p>  In passenger terms, we will be down by 95% but we will be open with scheduled airlines and scheduled routes.     </p></speech>

Can Ms Considine state whether it has implications for the level of staffing with the Shannon Group?  So far, the Shannon Group have had to take measures as an airport authority.  We also know what Ryanair and Aer Lingus have had to do and the resistance with which that has been met by workers.  Has the Shannon Group, on foot of what we have heard today, considered altering the current staffing level at the airport?  Is there added cause for concern people should be made aware of right now?</p></speech>

We are evaluating it now.  As it will be very challenging for us to maintain 24-7 operations in light of the reduction in scheduled services, we are evaluating all of our options now.  First and foremost, we will engage with our own employees and will discuss it with them over the coming week.  That will be our priority.  We will be communicating with the airlines that continue to operate through the airport.</p> <p>  We have already taken difficult decisions and a number of measures.  We had to take them to manage our cost base and preserve liquidity since this crisis hit us.  Those measures are continuing. </p></speech>

The country has been shut down essentially because there is only a smattering of flights coming in and out.  We are down 95% and will continue at that level.  For the 140,000 people in the sector it is a hammer blow.  I see it as much wider than that, as I am sure the committee does, as a stranglehold on the overall economy and our ability to rebound in a post-Covid, post-Brexit world.</p></speech>

The Covid reaction has been driven on data, which is why this country is at level 5.  The data show, categorically, that the level of imported cases in totality is less than 2% of all cases and in respect of the 14-day average, less than 0.5% of all positive cases in the country are attributed to foreign travel.  The data do not support the stranglehold that is on the country today.  There are testing technologies, be it the polymerase chain reaction, PCR, or antigen tests that can be scaled and not just open up the aviation sector, devastating as it is for Cork and Shannon, but open up the country.</p></speech>

We are rapidly depleting our cash reserves.  If we do not open this country up we are going to be in a very severe state.  On a wider level, when Shannon or Cork loses a route, it will not come back next year when things get better because that asset is redeployed somewhere else in that airline's network or sold and bought by another airline but is used somewhere else.  It can take between four and six years to develop a route for Shannon, Cork and Dublin.</p> <p>  Yesterday, 19 people flew in on a flight from Dallas-Fort Worth on an American Airlines aircraft that probably cost &euro;150,000 just to fly the route that day.  That airline is ceasing operations and we will not get them back into this country in a hurry, which is a hammer blow for this country's links to the southern states of the US.</p></speech>

The committee can imagine how significant that is for an entity of our size.  We have put difficult measures in place to reduce the amount of cash burn and that has been hard.  It has been very difficult for staff who have had to take pain.  We initially reduced hours of operation and we need to look at that again, so it has been tough.  We have taken a number of measures to try to ensure we can trade our way through this but the longer it goes on, the more difficult it is and that is why operational support would be very important to us.  On reopening the country, as an industry we have stepped up to the plate.  We very quickly implemented all the measures to try to rebuild consumer confidence.  We have made the journey through the airport as contactless as possible.  We are, as an entity, advocating for pre-departure testing to restore confidence and working with the European traffic light system, and the committee has heard Mr. Philips talking about the decisions the Government needs to take.  We have stepped up to the plate, as an industry, we have done all we can.  We want to reopen aviation in a safe manner, we are very conscious of our public health obligations and we do not believe aviation is contributing to the spike in virus rates across the country that we are currently experiencing.  It is certainly not the cause of us moving to level 5 restrictions, so we need to have a grown-up conversation and decisions need to be taken quickly about reopening the country.</p></speech>

We have a massive ecosystem here where we were, and are, pioneers but we are definitely falling behind with testing.  We will destroy this great industry and that whole supply chain if we do not mobilise in terms of testing.  We have the largest low-cost carrier in Europe headquartered in Swords, and we have a really prestigious transatlantic carrier headquartered in Dublin as well.  Tourism is our biggest employer and aviation feeds tourism.  It used to be agriculture but tourism is now the biggest indigenous employer in Ireland.  This whole supply chain is being collapsed, and it is billions and billions of euro.</p> <p>  Rapid testing is the first piece on the road to recovery.  On the second question of cash burn, we have spoken about capex before.  We need to go into the regional airports capex scheme.  At Cork Airport, in operational expenditures we have burned &euro;14 million in cash before capex this year and probably a similar amount next year.</p></speech>

It is something I believe would have been the case heretofore, that is, this idea of losing a route and being unable to have it returned for probably three to five years.  Would Mr. Philips accept that this is a very untypical situation?  It is not as if an asset is being moved to another location.  The fact is there will be, as part of the recovery, more than an oversupply of aircraft dotted throughout the world, so as part of our recovery there will not be a shortage of aircraft, that is for sure.  If we can get a framework in place that gives confidence to airlines that we, as part of the European Union as a bloc, are serious about living with the effects of Covid and perhaps the aftereffects of it, does Mr. Philips believe that will be enough for the airline industry to come back more quickly on routes, since the supply of aircraft will not be the issue?  If anything, it will be the degree of confidence among the travelling public that will be the guiding light more so than the availability of aircraft.</p></speech>

The reality is that airlines' balance sheets have been stretched to enormous levels, so airlines are having to massively restructure their own businesses and downsize them.  What they are doing is getting rid of the aircraft.  A new route can cost about &euro;3 million per year to get up and running.  That is the sort of cash burn one loses when starting a new route.  When one starts a new route one does so with a long-term horizon and to be going back to airlines now and saying, "Invest &euro;3 million in a route to Cork, to Shannon or to Dublin" is going to be a really hard ask.  We are out of kilter with the rest of Europe because we are the most closed.  There is absolutely a balance-----</p></speech>

It has to be.  However, it feels that this is a sector that is being held to a different standard from the rest of the country.</p></speech>

I suspect they would make the point that some of the airlines made, namely, that there are no cases of transmission of the virus in a clothes shop, in the same way as Mr. Wilson sought to sort of portray the industry by saying that because it did not happen on a plane that it was not an issue.  However, decisions have to take more into account.</p></speech>

This morning I was talking to a supplier of very powerful antigen testing and the data are really very compelling.  I said, "I am not a scientist but surely when you share these data with NPHET it seems robust".  Antigen testing seems to be the way to open up the country safely.</p></speech>

Ms Considine will be familiar with some of the geography I talk about but if one lives in Tulla, as I do, and somebody else is living in Lissycasey in west County Clare, there are more than 5 km between us.  At the moment we are being told we cannot travel between those two locations so there is that difficulty with saying we should open up the air routes because that is what the sector wants.  One must balance public opinion and public acceptance of the restrictions which they are being asked to undertake as well.  I feel we should be at level 3 and not level 5 but that is a moot point now, and we have moved on from that.  There would be very considerable resistance among the public if a person had an issue going from Tulla to Lissycasey because it is outside the 5 km radius but could toddle down to the airport and head off to Spain for a week's holidays.  While Mr. Philips is putting forward a very good case for the next phase of recovery, and we should be doing the work now to understand what that framework should look like, in the current climate one could not run the two systems in parallel.</p></speech>

I totally understand the sentiment now that we are in level 5 but once we come out of level 5, we need to be ready to go.  We need to be pumped, primed and say "Let's go" but we are not.</p></speech>

We are looking at the short to medium term to have our ducks in a row when the suppression rates improve  and where NPHET is at a point where it is able to recommend to Government an easing of our domestic restrictions, so that there is some kind of parallel environment that says, "It is okay for me to visit Lizzie Casey again and it is okay to head to wherever in Europe has the same level of the virus as the broader region of Ireland".  I just wanted to put it in context.</p></speech>

If we had this framework and rapid antigen testing or whatever types of testing tomorrow, we still would not have a huge number of flights.  I accept that the aviation sector has an argument for what it terms the "lost period", but we are where we are at this point in time.  I believe there is a worry about getting harmonisation across Europe.  The witnesses have spoken on the difficulties the sector is having and about ensuring the sector has the capacity to operate afterwards.  There needs to be a straight conversation on what the sector is asking for now.  With the best will in the world, and even if all this was put in place, the sector will probably not experience significant travel until next summer.  Hopefully, that will be in a period when vaccines will start to roll out, combined with having proper antigen testing.</p></speech>

What is happening on 8 November so we can scale up for it and be ready?  We are 58 days away from Christmas.  That is the number one ask in the short term.  For the medium term we need liquidity support for the sector.  Cork Airport will just run out of cash and I am sure Ms Considine will be in the same situation at Shannon Airport, but I will let her speak on that.</p></speech>

Mr. Philips referred to the liquidity ask with regard to Dublin and Cork Airports.  I ask the same question of Ms Considine.</p> <p>  I want to also ask about the risks associated with flying.  Earlier we discussed the argument that the risk is minimal.  I believe it is a question of managing the risk.  There is far greater opportunity in having a frank conversation on it and saying there are risks associated with it.  That is why we have quarantines.  It is about managing those risks.  It is far better to be tested negative getting onto the plane than a one in 27 million chance of getting Covid while on the plane.  This stresses the need for testing.  How quickly could we deliver testing at the airport if we decided today that it was going to happen and if we decided on a methodology, perhaps PCR now and then moving to rapid antigen testing when people are satisfied that this is sufficient?  On the threshold of greater than 80% clinical sensitivity, I would make the point that there are many rapid antigen tests that meet this bar while sometimes PCR tests do not meet the bar.  This is what we are dealing with.  If these measures were to be implemented how quickly could testing be done at airports?  Will Ms Considine also comment on the liquidity demands of Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-28a.748" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Considine" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020102800002#MM01000"><p>I am happy to take the question.  Once we have clarity on the testing protocols we should be ready to go in a matter of days.  It is critical that we get clarity on the type of testing.  Ideally, we would all like the rapid antigen testing, but failing that we are ready to go with PCR testing.  It needs to be clarified quickly.  We have already talked at length on that today.</p> <p>  On the liquidity, our revenues are down on average &euro;1.3 million per week since the onset of the pandemic.  This is extremely significant for an entity of our size.  While we have taken measures to reduce costs and reserve liquidity, it is now critical in light of the slow recovery envisaged for the industry and given the recent announcements by Ryanair on closing its bases through the winter and Aer Lingus not resuming its services from Shannon until the summer schedule of next year.  At this stage we have only one confirmed US carrier for next year, which is American Airlines, but this is all dependent on how the virus evolves between now and then and where we are with the vaccine.  There is a huge number of variables and that is why we need clarity on the supports we are going to get from Government.  We hope that the national economic plan in November will address that.  It is really urgent that we are included in the regional airports' programme, which will provide operational funding as well as capital funding.  We need to continue to provide a level of operational facilities such as cargo movements, general aviation transits and a resumption of scheduled traffic, albeit we will not get back up to normal levels of activity.  To do all that there is a significant cost to keeping the airport open.  This is why operational funding will be very important to sustain us through this recovery.</p></speech>

On liquidity, the Cork Airport situation is acute.  Dublin Airport's situation is slightly different whereby we are using up all our capital reserves that we had put aside and apportioned for infrastructure development to help fuel Dublin's economy, and I would argue Ireland's economy.  All the money that was reserved for infrastructure is now being depleted on operating costs because we are losing &euro;1 million a day.  The challenge there is that we will need new infrastructure to bounce back out from Covid and Brexit.  That money is being wasted, or being used up, keeping the airport alive, so to speak.  We have shared all this with the Government.</p></speech>
