As I was saying, we were hoping to get representatives of St. Vincent's Holdings before the committee.  It was very short notice, but that is down to the timescale within which we were trying to work on this matter.</p><p>Two of the directors are away and another had a prior engagement.  I appreciate the witnesses coming in and giving their time today.</p><p> Today, we will meet representatives of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, SVHG, to continue our discussion on the proposed new national maternity hospital.  We are joined by Mr. James Menton, chair of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and founding partner of St. Vincent's Holdings, and Dr. John Holian, board member of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and chair of St. Vincent's University Hospital medical board.  I have probably pronounced his name wrongly.  We will hopefully sort it out during the meeting.  We are joined by Ms Imelda Reynolds, board member of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, Professor Janice Walshe, consultant oncologist, and Mr. Donal O'Raghallaigh, partner at McCann FitzGerald solicitors.  They are all very welcome to our meeting.</p><p> All members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p> I ask Mr. Menton to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Menton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to meet the committee this afternoon.  I act as chair of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and was a founding director of St. Vincent's Holdings.  I am joined today, as the Chair eloquently outlined, by Dr. John Holian, Ms Imelda Reynolds, Professor Janice Walshe and Mr. DonaI O'Raghallaigh.</p> <p>  Everyone at St. Vincent's Healthcare Group believes that Ireland is on the verge of an historic decision about the future of women's healthcare.  It is historic with regard to infrastructure development with all the positive and badly needed new facilities that will be delivered with it.  The relocation of the National Maternity Hospital to the Elm Park healthcare campus is a key part of the Government's maternity strategy.  We are proud to be a partner and play our part in what will be, when operational, a complete transformation of maternity and neonatal care, not only in Dublin but also as a national care centre.  From our perspective, the transformation of maternity care services, of which the proposed transfer of the National Maternity Hospital to our Elm Park campus is one part, coincides with and is in part facilitated by the complete transformation of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group after over 175 years of ownership by the Religious Sisters of Charity, RSC.  The April 2022 transfer of the RSC's St. Vincent's Healthcare Group shareholding to St. Vincent's Holdings, our new shareholder, was the last formal step in the reaching the board's objective of becoming a truly secular organisation free of any religious influence.  The board was determined to achieve this objective and we have done so.</p> <p>  St. Vincent's Holdings is the new owner of SVHG and is a registered Irish charity.  It is a not-for-profit company governed by Irish law.  It is not a public juridic body and there is no vehicle in the registered constitutions of either company by which any religious authority or control can be exerted.  That is a fact.  It is also a fact that the RSC transferred its shares to St. Vincent's Holdings without any conditions requiring the practice of any Catholic ethics or any other religious ethos.  SVHG is also a registered Irish charity.  It is a not-for-profit company governed by Irish law.  Our purpose and vision are to be a valuable part of an Irish healthcare system that achieves the best outcomes for patients and their families, to be known for the highest standards of patient care, clinical excellence, medical research and staff education, and to remain a voluntary, independent group that invests all our funds in the treatment and care of our patients.  As a not-for-profit company with charitable status, all our funds are reinvested in the treatment and care of our patients.</p> <p>  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is a secular organisation.  The hospital has no religious ethos.  Services have been and will continue to be delivered in accordance with best international medical practice, compliant with the laws of the Ireland and to people of all faiths and none.  Multiple protections are in place to ensure no religious authority or control can be exerted.  Our founding values are dignity, compassion, justice, equality and advocacy.  These values are found in many institutions across the world and cannot be interpreted as any attempt to directly or indirectly impose a Catholic ethos.  There were many references to our culture in committee meetings last week.  Culture in all three of our hospitals is driven by a single focus, namely, to provide the best possible care for all of our patients.</p> <p>  We were approached by Government to become a partner with it and the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, in the relocation of maternity services to the Elm Park campus.  The opportunity to assist in the provision of world-class maternity and neonatal healthcare, together with our long-standing working relationship with Holles Street, informed our decision to support and partner on this 21st century project.  The new national maternity hospital facility will be located in the centre of our campus and will be physically integrated with our university hospital to ensure the best and seamless care for high-risk and pregnant women.  The seamless care to national maternity hospital patients will be provided by ready access to over 250 consultants covering more than 50 healthcare specialties.  The lands at the Elm Park campus have been owned outright by St. Vincent's Healthcare Group for 20 years.  Two landowners, and thus two separate independent hospitals, would make it very difficult, if not impossible, to manage the Elm Park campus and would also present significant risks to patient care.  The Mulvey agreement, which was a mediation agreement between all three parties, noted this important principle.</p> <p>  The important decision about to be made about the building of the national maternity hospital on the Elm Park campus is a political decision but involves the essential co-operation and agreement of the two voluntary hospitals involved.  We hope our presence today will assist members as legislators.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has embarked on a new course.  It is lay and secular.  It is a healthcare organisation which will hopefully soon welcome the national maternity hospital to our Elm Park campus.  It is a place that culturally and ethically fully upholds the values and laws of our Republic.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#B00300"><p>I thank Mr. Menton for his opening statement and I welcome the witnesses.  I acknowledge the unambiguous clarity about church involvement.  It is clear from Mr. Menton's statement that he believes there is no religious involvement in the running of St. Vincent's now and there has not been for some time.  He stated that after 175 years of ownership by the Religious Sisters of Charity, the order announced that it was ceasing to own the hospital in 2017.  Was that cessation in anticipation of or part of the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital or had it been in the ether for some time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Menton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#B00400"><p>It was in the ether for over seven and a half years.  Colleagues and I engaged with the leadership team of the Religious Sisters of Charity to reach a mutually strategic outcome, where it ceased its involvement in Irish healthcare and we became a secular organisation, which was the board's objective.  That journey took seven and a half years and the final steps were concluded in April 2022.  It is important from the point of view of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group that, having regard to social and other change in modern Ireland in the 21st century, we become a secular organisation.  It is good for our organisation and it is good for our patients and their families.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#B00500"><p>When was there last involvement in the operations by the Religious Sisters of Charity?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Menton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#B00600"><p>That is so long ago that I cannot give a particular year.  The only contact is that, under the old constitutions, our former shareholders had the right to appoint two representatives to the board.  In 2017, when they announced that they were leaving healthcare in a slightly more formal way, those two representatives withdrew from the board.  Over the four years since then, in anticipation of the conclusion of the transfer of the shares, the board and our management teams have worked on the new constitutions of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group free of any Catholic ethos or ethical guidance from the Religious Sisters of Charity.  While the final step was concluded a few weeks ago - in April - the direction of travel was clear over the last years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#C00100"><p>Okay.  I thank Mr. Menton.  When was the last time the Department of Health, on behalf of Government, approached St. Vincent's about the purchase of the land?  When was it finally accepted that was not going to happen?  Does Mr. Menton know the date?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Menton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#C00200"><p>In 2017 we had correspondence with the then Secretary General of the Department of Health which followed a lot of engagement with the Department and its officials where we outlined four key principles that informed our decision-making in terms of our participation as a partner in this project.  The board's decision-making frame from the very beginning, quite apart from 2017 - it goes back probably ten years - was four things.  The first is there could be no impediment to the efficient and effective delivery of patient care and that in no way would the delivery of patient care on our campus be adversely affected; second was that our ability to develop our campus into the future would not be in any way impeded by the relocation of the maternity hospital to the Elm Park campus; third, that while we would be contributing other forms of consideration we would not be expected to make any financial contribution to the project cost; and fourth, we wanted an overarching system of clinical governance on the campus to ensure it was run to best international medical standards.  From that we had a partnership from the beginning.</p> <p>  We engaged in the Mulvey mediation that gave rise to the Mulvey agreement.  From our perspective, what we brought to this particular arrangement was a substantial site, access to an integrated care system by virtue of the fact the proposed hospital will be integrated with our university hospital, access to provide patients with not only the excellent medical care our partners in the NMH will bring when they relocate to the campus but access also to more than 250 of our consultant cohort and 50 specialties.  All that combines to ensure patient care for women in Ireland comes into the 21st century on a seamless basis.  Also, it was very important for obvious reasons that do not need to be stated that we evolved into a secular organisation free of any church influence or religious ethics, in the same way, ironically, that when Holles Street moves from its current constitutional framework to that of the NMH at Elm Park DAC, it will also leave behind any association with church influence in the form of the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin being, or being entitled to be, the chairman of Holles Street.  There is also other Catholic representation and former Catholic representation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#C00300"><p>I thank Mr. Menton for that.  The two issues I have outlined are two of the main sticking points in this whole debate.  As public representatives we receive correspondence and obviously there is much media focus on these two particular issues.  Is there anything additional Mr. Menton can provide as reassurance to satisfy the concerns people have about ownership and religious ethos?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Menton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#C00400"><p>Okay.  Maybe I will start that answer and Ms Reynolds and Mr. O'Raghallaigh might want to comment.  Indeed, all of us might want to comment.  In the first instance, the legal arrangement for the transfer of the shares was into St. Vincent's Holdings CLG, which is a not-for-profit registered charity under the laws of this country and its constitution is an Irish company under the laws of this country.  We were absolutely determined there would be no restrictions placed in the constitution of that company, or indeed in its now subsidiary, or proposed subsidiary, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, that would have any influence of Catholic ethics, the imposition of religious influence or Catholic ethics.  Anybody who has read those constitutions can clearly see that goal has been accomplished.  We also ensured specific parties bound under confidentiality agreements had access to our share purchase agreement and the other legal document indemnity which again contains no conditions of what I have just described.  Under our agreements the HSE and other stakeholders have had access to those documents and they have been reviewed by their lawyers before they gave consent to the transfer.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Raghallaigh might want to comment, as our adviser.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal O'Raghallaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#C00500"><p>Absolutely.  The share is transferred to SVH without any conditions, so there are no legal impositions or otherwise in relation to the ethos of the holding company.  That is as clearly as I can state it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#C00600"><p>Okay.  Does anyone else wish to reply?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Imelda Reynolds" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#C00700"><p>Only to confirm that is the case.  There are no conditions attached.  There is no hidden agenda.  There is nothing there behind the documents everyone has seen.  There were no conditions attaching to the shares transferring, so I can give that complete assurance.  When I joined the board in 2019 it was post the Mulvey agreement but it was very important for me personally that the direction and strategy for the group was to deliver on the Mulvey agreement, achieve the shareholding and develop a secular hospital, secular medical healthcare facilities, on the campus.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#C00800"><p>The term "clinically appropriate" has again been raised by many.  There have been discussions regarding a codicil or addendum.  Has the group had any involvement, sight of it or discussions on that over the past fortnight, since the Cabinet originally postponed the decision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Menton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#C00900"><p>No.  We have observed all the commentary and the concerns expressed about the clinical governance phrase in the various legal documents concerning the establishment of the new maternity hospital in Elm Park.  That phrase obviously does not feature in any of our documents to do with the new holding company or indeed the constitution of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  It is a NMH issue.  Having said that, and as everybody is aware, the Minister has accepted there are concerns about that phrase and he has committed to reflecting on those.  Originally, that phrase was requested by the HSE and was considered by the board of the NMH, ourselves and our legal advisers and we agreed to the insertion of the term into the various legal agreements.</p> <p>  I am not sure whether Mr. O'Raghallaigh wants to comment further on the legal aspects of the phrase.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal O'Raghallaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#C01000"><p>There has been quite a lot of commentary on the legal aspects.  As Mr. Menton has indicated, the Minister has indicated he has listened to concerns about it.  From our perspective, it has not been inserted at the behest of SVHG.  It was inserted by the Minister with a view to clarifying the protection of the NMH hospital that "clinically appropriate", as the Minister has enunciated it, will relate to the type of procedures you would find in a maternity hospital, as opposed to a broad range of procedures that you would find in other types of hospitals.  Personally, from a common-sense approach, that is how it reads but a concern has been raised and SVHG awaits any further comment on it from one of our partners, be it the NMH or the Minister, on it.</p></speech>

It is an issue that many people have raised.  I will go through in a few moments this arrangement that we have landed on.  Mr. Menton has spoken about the impossibility of managing what I assume he means to be a HSE hospital on the grounds of Elm Park where there is a private hospital and a voluntary hospital.  I am not sure that this really holds water when the national children's hospital and St. James's Hospital are co-located.  Whatever about the impossibility of that as Mr. Menton will see it - and I do not agree - we have ended up with a very convoluted and complicated company structure, which I might talk through with Mr. Menton shortly.  If there are no preconditions imposed on St. Vincent's Healthcare Group in relation to what it does with the land, if the group is the sole owners of the land, and if there is no legal impediment to the board making a decision, then there are obviously other reasons.  Is it the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group's right and the board's right to gift the land to the State if that is what it wants to do?</p></speech>

There are a couple of factors in relation to that.  One factor is that the group is a charity and must have regard to how it disposes of assets.</p></speech>

A charity cannot just give away property willy-nilly; that is for sure.  There is a consideration process on the disposal of land, whether that is by lease or by freehold, in relation to the purpose to which the land would be put.  Another consideration for the board is how it insures land, and what impact that has on its own assets that it needs to run the hospitals for charitable purposes.</p></speech>

However, these entities function as arms-length bodies with their own legal status and with capacity to transact business in accordance with their own constitutional arrangements.  Considerable public resources are provided to them for the provision of public health services, and the construction and maintenance of related facilities as required.  SVHG has pledged publicly-funded assets in return for bank finance for development of its private hospital. </blockquote> <p>Essentially, we have a leveraging of a public asset for a private hospital.  It goes on to state:</p> <blockquote> 	The situation illustrates a hazard that attaches to the provision of services through fully subvented, or nearly fully subvented, private institutions.  Their freedom to pursue their other objectives may be exercised in a way that does not protect the State's financial interest. </blockquote></speech>

I thank the group for coming in.  I said that I would do this.  This new company, the national maternity hospital DAC, is to be established that will have directors, we are told, from three different sources.  There will be three from the existing maternity hospital, three from St. Vincent's Hospital, and three public interest directors.  That is a subsidiary of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which effectively would be the landlord.  They will own the land and they will lease the land to the State.

As a political point, in 2017, St. Vincent's Hospital Group was not countenancing any sale or lease of part of the land or any separate ownership of a hospital on-site.  That goes to what the current Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has achieved.  The HSE actually owns the hospital and the land is being leased at &euro;10 per year for a total of 299 years, with the arguments of many being that this essentially involves ownership.</p><p>There is the question as to why this body cannot just gift the land.  There was an article in <i>The Currency</i>recently that covers much of this.  The witnesses might be familiar with it.  St. Vincent's hospital, as Deputy Cullinane indicates, offered its land as collateral when it borrowed to redevelop the private hospital in 2010.  That came to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It seems from the article written by Mr. Thomas Hubert in <i>The Currency</i>that if St. Vincent's Hospital Group gave the land under the new maternity hospital to the State, it would find itself in default of its loans and might become insolvent.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

That is clearly set out in the lease.  The protections afforded under a lease ownership arrangement, as opposed to a freehold ownership arrangement, are radically different.  We or Holles Street would have no protections in the absence of the current arrangements as to what that hospital would be used for.  The whole purpose of this relocation is that the building would house vastly improved maternity care integrated into a university hospital with access to many specialties and other consultants.  That is the whole point from our perspective of this partnership.</p></speech>

We have dealt with the Vatican papers.  One of the witnesses spoke about the model of the Bon Secours group, which was purchased by an international healthcare group.  Is that possible here?  Is it possible for an international healthcare group to view the entire St. Vincent's hospital campus, including a new national maternity hospital, as one structural entity?</p></speech>

We cannot sell St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  I will ask Mr. O'Raghallaigh to reaffirm that, as it is under our new constitution.</p></speech>

There are a number of protections as seen in the lease.  There is an obligation on St. Vincent's Healthcare Group not to permit a change of ownership in its shares without the consent of the HSE.  The SVH holdings company that took the shares from the Sisters of Charity cannot transfer that share.  That is regulated by the Charities Regulator, as is SVHG.  Everything is kind of locked in.  These include the SVHG shares in SV Holdings, which are locked into that company.  Within the SVHG, the movement of that share is double-locked with respect to a HSE consent.</p></speech>

It has first option, so if SVHG offered that portion - just the freehold of the NMH - to a party to sell, it must go through a process with the HSE to see if the executive wants to buy the freehold at that point.</p></speech>

Once the 299-year lease is granted to the HSE, the freehold that SVHG holds in the property is obviously subject to that lease.  We could say a virtual freehold is held by the HSE or an ownership is held by the HSE.  Creating security over that interest is subject to the lease.  The lease is protected and it is not a security that takes value from what is on the site.  It is a technical point for keeping the entirety of the campus under one ownership.</p></speech>

I may be wrong on this.</p><p>I can think of one other example in my constituency where the Sisters of Mercy did not give land away but sold it at below market value to a local sports club on the basis that it would never be developed residentially and that there would be recourse.  It just could not be done.  As a result, the order has no interest in the land and has essentially vacated it.  There is a similar example with the Carmelites.  That is also in my constituency.  There are examples.  I am not saying it is done philanthropically.  What Mr. Menton is saying, however, is that in the context of the holding company or the papers, there are no fingerprints or footprints of the Religious Sisters of Charity.  If things changed in a century, there would be no route back into this company for the Religious Sisters of Charity or any church-related organisation.</p></speech>

In the appendix to that report which was an investigation of the role of voluntary hospitals in the State in public healthcare there is clear documentation which illustrates the significant difference, for example, between the strategy pursued by the Mater and the Sisters of Mercy and ourselves in St. Vincent's and the Sisters of Charity.  Looking at the appendix, it is clear in relative terms that when you get to the net surplus of the disposal of assets, however that may arise, the proceeds go through a cascading but eventually go back to the Vatican.  That is the position in very simple terms.  No such construction has been put on the share purchase agreement of the other legal documentation in terms of the Sisters of Charity transferring their shares to SVHG.  I cannot speak for the motivation of the Sisters of Charity other than that it wanted to cease their involvement in Irish healthcare.  We want it to be a secular organisation to respond to the needs of our patients in modern Ireland.  There was a mutually inclusive objective there satisfied.  We have our motivation; they have theirs.  We did not question theirs and they did not question ours.  I can tell the Deputy categorically, however, that we, as a board, would never have accepted a situation where there was some legacy 100 or 150 years from now that would involve some form of mitigation of the objective of becoming a secular organisation.</p></speech>

It is important to note that there are multiple examples of shared campuses for different purposes, including health and other services, where there would be a management company that deals with the interface issues.  In Texas there is an example of multiple hospitals sharing the same campus but they are all independent facilities.  I cannot help thinking that when you look at all the detail involved in this and while there are many concerns, what this boils down is an issue of land value.  There is no getting away from that.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions for Mr. Menton.  In 2020, SVHG had total liabilities of &euro;450 million.  Of that, more than &euro;370 million was long-term debt.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>

The long lease to the HSE is under that.  All that receiver can sell is the freehold interest subject to the lease.  Thankfully, in landlord and tenant law, the leasehold is protected.  It is an interest in property that does not rely on what occurs at the prehold level.  It is a separate interest that is recognised and that interest would remain intact.</p></speech>

The interest that is demised is the land and the buildings that are built on it.  All of the economic interest is down with the tenant.  That is a good marketable title, as the Deputy will have heard from several people during the course of last week.  The value of the freehold, therefore, is &euro;10 per year provided that is the rent it receives.  That is the value of the freehold unless the rent increases because of the charity law purpose.

They will understand from our perspective that we in the Opposition have mainly been asking for a discussion around this deal for two years now, which we are only getting in the last two weeks.  It is really unsatisfactory for us.  Again, I will appeal publicly to the Government to delay this and give us more time because we are being pushed into a position of having to accept much information and many facts without having the time to drill down into them.  We are also being hamstrung in the sorts of asks we can make on the witnesses.</p> <p>  One of the things in which I am interested, and I do not want Mr. Menton or anyone else to take anything personal out of my line of questioning, is when Mr. Menton talked about the hospital evolving into a secular hospital.  I am interested in that path of evolution.  I want to ask Mr. Menton a couple of questions around it.  Like other Catholic organisations, the membership of the Sisters of Charity would have been falling consistently over decades now.  Was it not inevitable that it would be pulling back from direct involvement because there are too few of them?  I believe previous constitutions allowed for the Sisters of Charity or its nominees to make appointments and carry out functions on the boards.  Rather than it just being about getting the national maternity hospital done, was it not inevitable that it was going to fade away because of that evolutionary process?</p></speech>

There are two aspects to what is under discussion here.  Obviously, the national maternity hospital project is the main business of the day but I think the Deputy raises a very interesting point.  If we had never been asked by the Government or other stakeholders to partner on the national maternity hospital project, I do not have a scintilla of doubt in my mind that we would have a new holding company with the same constitutions and same share purchase agreement with the share indemnity.  The Deputy's point is well made.  Demographically, it was withdrawing.</p></speech>

Its membership is not stupid.  History was taking its course in that the order was not going to be around forever in sufficient numbers.  Mr. Menton started working in St. Vincent's Healthcare Group in 2014, is that correct?</p></speech>

My appointment in 2010 predated the departure of the Religious Sisters of Charity by several years.  Although it is possible to argue that, in theory, a Catholic ethos obtained until their departure, that is not what applied in practice.  The ethos that applied then and still applies now, as seen in our mission statement, revolves around our core values of dignity, compassion, respect, quality and advocacy, while striving to maintain excellence in clinical care, research and medical education.  These are the values we would expect of any major academic medical institution, whether here or elsewhere in the world.  While I fully understand the genuine concerns people have, the assertion that St. Vincent's hospital or the new national maternity hospital at Elm Park might be vulnerable to influence of a Catholic nature does not relate to a hospital I recognise, nor one in which I would wish to work.  Personally, and I speak on behalf of the medical board of St. Vincent's, which includes more than 250 physicians, I have never had to explain or justify a clinical decision to a religious person or body.  The culture at St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital is, very simply, one committed to offering excellence in clinical care to our patients and their families and that is why we see this venture as a necessary step, but also as a natural step given the close collaborative links that exist between our two institutions in allowing us to deliver state-of-the-art medical care in a world-class facility.</p></speech>

I have a very complex patient group, given I am an oncologist who deals mainly with breast cancer, so I encounter many young women who have developed cancer.  We have a significant body of those patients in St. Vincent's hospital for a range of reasons, including the fact we have significant expertise.  We have always enjoyed a tight relationship with Holles Street in managing the many concerns they have.</p><p>What I can say categorically is that I have never had representation from the religious order, whether directly or indirectly, in terms of trying to influence any of my decisions in that regard.</p></speech>

The answer is "No", they have not been denied.  We know that terminations have taken place on the St. Vincent's campus.  If the committee would indulge me for a moment, I will outline how this would generally happen.  Let us say that a patient comes to me and is diagnosed with cancer during her pregnancy.  I will then lift the phone to the obstetrician who has a specific interest in that and gain information as to where the procedure will be performed.  The registration of terminations of pregnancy is completed centrally for patient confidentiality reasons and we know that the vast majority of those terminations are completed before 12 weeks' gestation.  In terms of where the termination will take place, that is very much guided by the consultant obstetrician.  The more complex terminations will take place in our hospital because they require the multidisciplinary involvement of different physicians.  To answer the Deputy's question, there has never been any interference in that regard since that legal framework was available to us to allow us to complete those procedures, as is entirely appropriate for a very vulnerable patient population.</p></speech>

Like Dr. Walshe, I have often had to have difficult conversations with patients about the potentially devastating impact of their kidney disease on a longed-for pregnancy or the implications of a pregnancy for their kidney disease.  Where termination may be appropriate, it is often best clinical practice to provide that termination in the site that has adequate and specialist resources.  The point I am making is that although the perception out there might be that the number of terminations that have occurred in St. Vincent's up until this point has been relatively few, one must bear in mind where patient care is best served and where the specialists are at present.  Once that specialist care is available in St. Vincent's, Dr. Walshe and I, along with our colleagues look forward to being able to offer that service on site in much more seamless and integrated fashion than the way we do currently.</p> <p>  It is not a matter of sending somebody to Holles Street because of philosophical or theological reasons.  It is purely because that is where it is best resourced at present.  That is where the midwives are and where the appropriate counselling and aftercare can occur.</p></speech>

In other words, is it certain that the entire complex or part of the complex cannot be sold off separately to an entity that might be in conflict with what they are hoping to do?</p></speech>

I am seeking clarity on an issue.  In 2011 the HSE found that the SVHG sought funding for a private development.  This came to light through the Committee of Public Accounts.  It seems that security for the loan was some form of charge or lien over all of the land there, including the public hospital.  The HSE found that while technically no rules were broken, it was not appropriate to be using State assets to fund a private institution.  This is not so much a question about the fear that this could happen again because things have changed and the rules are much more stringent now but regarding the land that is currently in question, which is part of the overall land bank, is that still the subject of some form of charge or lien as security for the bank debt?  Is this particular piece of land involved in that?  One of the conditions of the bank debt is that the debtor shall not sell, gift or dispose of any assets against which the debt is secured.  Can the representatives of St. Vincent's clarify whether there is any lien on this particular piece of land.  If so, how would that affect the new hospital?</p></speech>

That deals with the security interest.  The creation of the lease protects the tenant interest under the lease.  There is a due diligence point that we have agreed to on that with the HSE.</p></speech>

Okay, that is fine.</p> <p>  As the names of the parties involved are very similar, I ask the witnesses to clarify another issue for me.  SVHG owns the land and St. Vincent's Holdings is holding the shares.  Who is it that the Minister would have to approach to request that the State be given the land?  Who exactly is it that he would have to go to or is there no way to do it because it is tied up in a variety of different things?</p></speech>

That has been the case in terms of the negotiations around perfecting the partnership model to construct this maternity hospital, going back to the completion of the Mulvey mediation and the publication of the Mulvey report.  Obviously, there have been ongoing discussions subsequent to that.  The board was approached by the Department of Health to expand the lease period from 99 years to 150 years and then from 150 years to 299 years.</p><p>Our view as a board was that, so long as we had a lease ownership model, which thus enabled the State to effectively own the building it was financing - and I, like any other taxpayer, want our taxpayers' interests to be protected - but, at the same time, afforded protections to us and Holles Street as partners in this framework, that was the-----</p></speech>

Will Mr. Menton clarify a point in the significant amount of documentation we have read?  I do not have the exact reference written down, so I beg the committee's forgiveness.  For the first 20 years, if the land were to be sold at any point, the HSE would have first refusal.  That is written into the lease.  Then, after 30 years, if that first refusal clause - I do not know if that is the exact term as I am not a legal person - ceases and if the land is sold, first refusal does not have to be offered to the HSE and the interest can be sold to anyone.</p></speech>

As for a right of first refusal within the first 20 or 30 years, I will double-check that but I think the Senator is right about the 30 years, if the property were to be sold within that short period.</p></speech>

There is always a concern in putting a right out to somebody to acquire an interest in one's property for such a long period.  There was a lot of discussion about this.

I think Professor Walshe outlined the position of women seeking terminations within St. Vincent's currently.  While we are discussing it here and it can be discussed in very abstract terms, I think Professor Walshe brought it back succinctly to what we are talking about.  We are talking about people who are very sick and who are going through a very traumatic time.   We are trying to achieve a gold standard in patient care for women in Ireland after historic underinvestments and historic and multiple traumas on women in this country.  We are trying to move away from that.  I feel that this plan is a step in that direction.</p> <p>  Mr. Menton mentioned in his opening statement that if the freehold were sold, it would create significant risks to patient care.

One is the need to have seamless integrated patient care on the same campus between the new maternity hospital facility and the physical interconnection between that facility and the current university hospital, which allows clinicians such as Dr. Walshe and Dr. Holian and their 248 other colleagues in 50 specialties to address very quickly acute medical needs without reference to anything other than the primacy of the need of the patient, in very simple terms.  Maybe Dr. Holian would like to explain the position on the ground.</p></speech>

The removal of those operational barriers might not seem as obvious but are very important from a clinical perspective.  These often cause confusion and unnecessary delays that have meant clinical risk.  Our goal is to be able to offer the whole suite of services that St. Vincent's enjoys on its campus currently, be that interventional radiology, urology, haematology, nephrology or whatever else.  This integration component allows us, without fear or favour, to bring the doctor to the patient rather than the patient to the doctor and to maintain that patient focus, which is what we are all about.</p></speech>

Perhaps the two lawyers before us might outline how easy it would be to find a banker or another lender to grant a mortgage secured on a freehold that is subject to a 299-year lease that has a rent of &euro;10 per year?  Can they foresee a circumstance where any bank would lend in those circumstances?</p></speech>

It is really that it is just part of the larger site and it would be part of that that it would be included but obviously with the carve out of the long lease in favour of the HSE.  So it is really just as part of the campus.  It would not on its own be of any interest.</p></speech>

Where the lease has been gifted to the HSE as part of that, that we are satisfied that meets the requirement that it is pursuant to charitable objectives to ultimately build the hospital.  As one of the witnesses touched on last week, there is provision in the lease to reflect a charitable law piece that in the event the property is no longer used for a charitable purpose, a market rent for the site, disregarding the buildings and it is only a market rent on the site, would be payable so there would be some return for the charitable purpose.</p></speech>

I believe it was mentioned by one of the speakers today that this related to ensuring that this would be a maternity hospital.  However, as there is language which refers to "legally permissible healthcare services, including research, by a maternity, gynaecology, obstetrics and neonatal hospital", there is a line within permitted use that makes it very clear what kind of hospital it is.  The question has been what exactly does the phrase "clinically appropriate" add.  As an example of the interpretative dangers, we have had one legal advice, I think to the NMH, that they had first heard it as "all clinically appropriate and legally permissible healthcare services" and others have said "all clinically appropriate and legally permissible".  It is an example of an ambiguous sentence.  I mean the sentence could be seen as giving a double test of "clinically appropriate" and "legally permissible".  Crucially, it places that test in legal documents such as leases and, thereby, effectively gives a responsibility to the landlord, the tenant, and the boards of both the landlord and the tenant in terms of interpretation.</p> <p>  I apologise in advance if I am incorrect about the following but I have heard, during the course of this meeting even, that Mulvey has said that it could be removed.  I know that the National Maternity Hospital has said that it should be removed or defined and, similarly, the Government has indicated that it is looking in that regard.  I require a clear answer as to whether St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is open to the removal of the phrase, "clinically appropriate" even, as we have just heard, that clinical decisions are made on the ground to an extent by the Master due to the Hippocratic oath and all of that, so why are we putting the phrase into a document that requires board interpretation?</p></speech>

I am interested in hearing the position of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  At this moment there have been calls for the phrase to be defined and removed.  What is the group's position on both aspects?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-16a.384" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Menton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051600002#M00100"><p>Our position is clear in the sense that we are more than happy to engage with our partners - the Department of Health, the Minister and Holles Street - to get a solution that is satisfactory and addresses the concerns that have been raised.  We have a very open mind as to whether it could be deleted, could be defined or could stay.</p></speech>

We then come to another question of interpretation.  In his opening statement, Mr. Menton indicated that the values of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group could not be interpreted as relating to a different ethos but values are, of course, interpreted.  That is the nature and it is the job.  I note that Professor Deirdre Madden and others specifically stated that boards do have an impact on ethos.  One of the ways they do so is through how values are interpreted.  One of the values listed by the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is human dignity.  In fact, it is the number one value listed.  There are multiple interpretations of that in the world.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights talks about human beings who are born, so from the point of birth, being free and equal in dignity.  The Dignitas Humanae Institute in Rome, which has a universal declaration on human dignity, states that human dignity applies to every single human being without exception from conception until natural death, and that the most effective means of safeguarding this recognition is through the active participation of the Christian faith in the public square.  Those are two interpretations of human dignity.  I could give multiple examples but I will only give two due to time limitations.  What is the interpretation of human dignity by the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group?  Another of its values relates to the voice of the voiceless.  Is that speaking on behalf of women or what is the interpretation of that?</p></speech>

We did not get much of a sense of how the voice of the voiceless argument might be interpreted.  That is fine.  It is another example of why removing "clinically appropriate" might be useful.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses think it is a little excessive to have three members of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group on the board of this new entity?  It is the landlord.  It has all the powers that pertain to the landlord and now it will also have three members on the board but, in particular, a rotating chairmanship.  Is a rotating chairmanship really appropriate?  We have been told it is to ensure seamless measures in terms of employment and to mind the interests of the group's other properties on the campus.  Chairmanship is the most senior role on the board of the national maternity hospital.  Why would St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, as landlord, also seek chairmanship on a rotating basis?  Is that something the group would be open not to do?</p></speech>

I would appreciate a response on the issue of the chairmanship.  On the 30-year option for the State, why not 70 years?  We have been told 70 years is the expected lifespan of the first hospital, so why not have 70 years in terms of that first lifetime?  Would that not give some more security to the State that it could buy the freehold?  Any of the reasons that were outlined as a concern in terms of selling the freehold to the State would surely apply to selling it to somebody else.</p></speech>

Some of the clarity that was brought to the discussion by the clinicians is very welcome.  It is important, however, to put on record that the number of terminations that have taken place in St. Vincent's between 2016 and 2021 is fewer than five, that is, anywhere between zero and four.  That information came in reply to a parliamentary question last October.</p> <p>  Furthermore, Senator Clifford Lee spoke about contraception.  In the same reply, it was stated clearly by Mr. Paul Gallagher, the head of nursing and midwifery, that sterilisation takes place in St. Vincent's when clinically required, which is important, and that sterilisation as an exclusive procedure is not available in St. Vincent's.  It is important to put that on record as well.  I will give the clinicians a moment to respond to those figures.  The remainder of my questions will be for Mr. Menton.</p></speech>

I put it to Mr. Menton that the lenders and bankers had a view as to whether the site should have been gifted to the State.

In our loan arrangements with it we have been compliant in performance, in terms of capital repayments and meeting our interest bills, like any other borrower.  The reference made to the variation in covenants goes back to the fact those variations relate to covenants written in 2010.  Then we had the recession.  As part of the process we need to technically revise those waivers on a periodic basis.  As Deputy Shortall alluded to, the next revision is in approximately three or four months' time.</p></speech>

Our job is to ask questions on behalf of the public.  Unfortunately, the public does not have the option to come in here and put questions to the witnesses.  As others have said, this is not in any way personal.  We have a duty of care to ask the questions.

One of the witnesses before the committee last Thursday has now decided to describe freehold and leasehold as freehold being like owning a car and leasehold like owning a caravan.  Therefore, when someone owns a caravan they cannot set out the direction they go in.  Taking this, it means there are now more than 300,000 people living in houses who technically, in accordance with this interpretation, are living in caravans.  Will the witnesses set out the difference with regard to a leasehold?  As I understand it, a leasehold is a separate legal entity from a freehold.  In other words, there is a freehold legal entity and a leasehold legal entity.  The leasehold is taken from the freehold interest.  Therefore, someone with a leasehold interest of 299 years has full control of the property.</p><p>I think there is a misinterpretation out there on that.  For instance, the person goes on to state: "Another control lost over the asset through the leases&rsquo; terms, which would not apply if the state owned the freehold, is that St Vincent&rsquo;s can mortgage the new NMH building."  That is what is up there.  That is in writing.  This is from a legal adviser who was here with us last Thursday.  It is important that we clarify what is the legal interest.  The HSE is getting a 299-year lease.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

For argument&rsquo;s sake, if the Government decided tomorrow that it would not proceed and that it wants the freehold interest and, therefore, St. Vincent's decides not to enter into negotiations and this goes down the CPO route, what then would be the reaction of St. Vincent's Hospital to that proposal?</p></speech>

It would set the project back ten years-plus.  It would be an extraordinarily negative development in everybody's agreed objective to improve maternity care for women in Ireland.  Without prejudice to a full consideration and discussion at a board level, my personal reaction as a director is that we would seek to the challenge the CPO because we would like to keep the integrity of our campus.</p></speech>

I do not disagree with that.  It also said there would be a legislative piece to seek to remedy that.  Where a body is seeking to CPO, it is not just about what powers it has and it also has to show that the CPO is proportionate.  I think it would be a difficult point for the HSE, where it is being gifted a 300-year lease of a site, to show that it is proportionate for the State to exercise a compulsory power to acquire freehold.  It would be hard for the State to justify.</p></speech>

The word &ldquo;demise&rdquo; is set out in the lease and it clearly sets out that SVHG is demising the leasehold interest for 299 years to the HSE.  When the legal expert was asked by another Deputy does St. Vincent's still retain ownership of the building, the answer was that, yes, it does.  Mr. O&rsquo;Raghallaigh might translate into layman's terms the word &ldquo;demise&rdquo;.  As I understand it, it means that we are transferring control for 299 years.  Would that be a correct interpretation?</p></speech>

The freeholder is stepping away from the property for the 299 years.  If we take the freehold here, the depth of enjoyment of the property is there, this is the lease, and the freeholder has stepped away by granting the lease, although there are covenants in the lease for the tenant to continue to enjoy the property.  It is subject to the lease but, effectively, for as long as the tenant complies with the lease, it has the lands for the 299 years.</p></speech>

All of the various legal points that have been validly raised are just to ensure that happens and that the building will be used for the healthcare purpose for which it is being constructed and funded by the taxpayer.</p></speech>

Before I do so, I make the point that it has been a long negotiation between our guests and the HSE and the Government.  What were the main stumbling blocks?  Was it the issue of freehold and the land?  In his opening statement, Mr. Menton made the point that ownership of Elm Park campus lands is essential to ensuring ongoing provision of best hospital care and so on.  Was that the stumbling block all along or was it other issues?</p></speech>

From our perspective, it was to protect our ability to provide services to our patients.   There was a multiplicity of issues around that.  I compliment Kieran Mulvey on the mediation and his report.  Although there are legal agreements about various matters, the reality is that if the Government gives the go-ahead, the Mulvey report will be essentially implemented in full, save for a rebalancing of representation on the board.  The original Mulvey report called for four board representatives from St. Vincent's, four from the Holles Street Trust and one independent expert.  That has been rebalanced in the past year such that there will be three, three and three.  Each partner will have three representatives.  The Mulvey report also referred to a lien over the building.  To answer the Chairman's point directly, that certainly has consumed quite a lot of discussion in the context of giving effect to the protection of the State's interest.</p></speech>

There have been many occasions when I have been called upon by my colleagues in Holles Street to give a clinically urgent opinion in the setting of a high-risk pregnancy.  At times, it is extraordinarily challenging for me to make it from St. Vincent's to Holles Street in a timeframe that the patient deserves.  Removing not just the physical impediments but also the operational impediments that ownership alludes to will ensure that our focus, which is on delivering effective and timely patient care, is remedied.</p></speech>

The Minister is obliged to get those.  There were more than 6,500 terminations in 2020, 2,414 of those were in Dublin and only 1.8% of those took place in a hospital setting, which leaves approximately 10% of those, the figure Mr. Menton mentioned, having taken place in St. Vincent's.  Given that it is not really a public or private maternity hospital in that sense, it sounds reasonable that 10% of the terminations that took place in a hospital setting took place in St. Vincent's.</p></speech>

There was a discussion earlier, and I cannot remember who asked the question, as to whether a member of the board would ever approach a clinician about his or her decision and the response was categorically, no, that would not happen.  Could Mr. Menton envisage a situation where a clinician would approach the board about its decision given the very limited laws we have around abortion?  For example, in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality, if an infant can survive more than 28 days outside the womb, the abortion should not be allowed.  It would be illegal.  The clinician who might carry it out, if he or she thought that infant would not survive more than two months, would be subject to the possibility of prosecution and a jail sentence.</p><p>Can Mr. Menton envisage any situation where a clinician might approach the board and that somewhere in the back of all this - particularly with Mr. Menton's appointment given that the nuns trusted him so much - would be a Catholic head that would be saying, "Well what do we do here?"  </p></speech>

I acknowledge that the various religious institutions of all shades of opinion have in the past gifted hospital, sports facilities, schools and other facilities to a fair extent.  Is such a gift subject to taxation?  Is it subject to a particular issue and hence the necessity to have a nominal payment or otherwise?  We are aware that, for instance, in family property there are strict rules in gifting to members of the family and associates.  Would that apply in this case?</p></speech>

In the case of this particular share transfer, the indemnity was the benefit that passed.  There has to be the offer, the acceptance and then the benefit that accrues.  That is what happened in this situation.  That is just trying to make it very simplistic for this.</p></speech>

It is in our interests that the taxpayer is protected because we want the building to be there.  Maybe its useful life is only 70 or 75 years; the lease is much longer than that.  However, it is not unreasonable to assume that after 75 years the building would need to be remodelled, rejuvenated.  That would be a matter of negotiation between the three parties in the same way as it has been, albeit for a longer period of time.  I hope the next negotiation will be much shorter.</p></speech>

As it seems in the lease there is simply a requirement that there would be maternity hospitals and that if there is not a maternity hospital, there is a return to the &euro;850,000 rent, which is the actual rent that is waived and reduced to &euro;10.  We mentioned earlier when that might apply.  Permitted use is one of the forfeiture events whereby the site would be given back or St. Vincent's Healthcare Group may reclaim the site as was mentioned.  Of course, permitted use includes the undefined phrase "clinically appropriate".</p> <p>  Mr. Menton mentioned the idea of a negotiation in 75 years' time.  I would like to be clear about what would happen.  Is it the case that either the State would build a new hospital that St. Vincent's Healthcare Group would be happy with or it would return to market rent for the remaining 210 years?  I ask Mr. Menton to confirm in terms of permitted use this is another 75 years.  He mentioned that in 100 years the national maternity hospital might want to move on.  After 170 years, the Religious Sisters of Charity have moved their model on.  What is the exit mechanism for the State if in 75 years, the State decides it wants to leave?  As I see it at the moment it only has an option to leave in the case of the insolvency St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.</p></speech>

The original lease term was 99 years with an option for an extra 50 years.  We were then approached by the Government to extend the lease for a further period of time, which we did.</p></speech>

I know the Senator asked about the 70 years a few times last week and so let me answer it.  At 70 years, it would be up to the State to decide if it is going to rebuild.  That will be the State's decision.  There is not a compulsion on the State pursuant to the lease to rebuild at the end of the life cycle of the building, but it has an obligation to continue to use it as a hospital.  So, that would be the State's decision.</p></speech>

He mentioned that significant risk to patient care was being given as the reason.  I am not clear why that would not be the case with a HSE or other hospital that had a co-operation agreement.  We were told it was about the distance, but a publicly owned hospital built on that site would be a situation.  We heard it was about doctors co-operating, but we heard they already co-operate between the National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  We heard that it was about not wanting two systems of governance.  Are we saying that there are not two systems of governance and that St. Vincent's Healthcare Group's is the only system of governance?  I am not clear about the reason.  Is it that the price of co-operation is St. Vincent's Healthcare Group?  I do not see why it cannot co-operate with a public or separate voluntary hospital.  Is it that St. Vincent's Healthcare Group does not want to?  Is it a price of co-operation that it would be involved in the governance of this new entity?</p></speech>

Will Mr. Menton explain what that indemnity involves?</p> <p>  Is the  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group guaranteeing that it will continue to offer the suite of services that it currently offers on the site?  The whole reason for the move is that there will be co-location and everything will be offered.  Is there a guarantee that oncology or other services will not be removed at some point?  That would somewhat undermine the State&rsquo;s commitment to the move.</p></speech>

As regards how those claims are addressed, most of them relate to the insurance policies the group has in place.  The hospital has been trading in its own name rather than that of the congregation for more than 20 years, so the risk is considered minimal.</p></speech>
