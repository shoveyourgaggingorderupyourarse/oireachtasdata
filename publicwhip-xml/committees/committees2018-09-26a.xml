    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018092600002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the joint committee for the invitation to attend.  The Department of Communications, Climate and Environment has been following the proceedings of the committee with a degree of interest in recent weeks.  I am pleased to be the first Secretary General to be invited to appear before the committee.</p> <p>  Addressing climate change, whether through decarbonisation of the economy or preparing to adapt to the impacts of climate change, is one of the most significant challenges facing the country.  It is a complex whole-of-government and society issue, with long-term impacts that require policy solutions in the near term.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, have acknowledged that Ireland is playing catch-up on its international and EU obligations.  Figures published in May this year by the Environmental Protection Agency project that Ireland&rsquo;s non-emissions trading system, ETS, emissions may be no lower than 1% below 2005 levels by 2020 in the context of a targeted 20% reduction.  These disappointing figures are nonetheless a snapshot reflecting the extent of policy implementation at a particular point in time.  Importantly, they do not include any projected benefit from the significant investment of almost &euro;22 billion in climate action which will be made in the next decade under the national development plan.</p> <p>  I wish to address the complex sectoral challenges involved, as well as outlining progress in several other areas.  On the plus side, we are making progress in the area of renewable electricity.  Ireland is recognised as a world leader because of its success in integrating intermittent renewable energy generation with an isolated electricity grid.  Preliminary SEAI figures show that at the end of 2017 we generated just over 30% of our electricity consumption from renewable sources, up from 26% in 2015 and 4.25% in 1997, the base year for the renewable energy directive.  EirGrid grid management programmes are recognised as being at the leading edge of global research in this area.  We have an ambition to achieve a figure of at least 55% for renewable electricity on the grid by 2030.  The recently approved renewable electricity support scheme will help to deliver on that ambition.</p> <p>  The structure of Ireland&rsquo;s economy, involving dispersed population settlement, car-based commuting and the central role of agriculture in the rural economy, requires the Government to balance economic and societal objectives with the imperative to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>We have not yet managed to decouple economic growth from growth in emissions in the transport and agriculture sectors which dominate non-ETS emissions, accounting for 75% of emissions in 2020.  The EPA&rsquo;s 2018 reports on greenhouse gas emission projections show continued growth in emissions in these sectors to 2030 in the absence of further measures being taken.<br/><br/>The policy framework to set Ireland on a path towards achieving its near-term targets, as well as its long-term - 2050 - decarbonisation objectives, is set out in the national mitigation plan which was published in 2017.  It provides a framework to guide Government investment decisions on measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from four key sectors: electricity generation; the built environment; transport; and agriculture, forestry and land use.  The plan sets out 106 actions and 60 measures to reduce our emissions.  It is a living document which is being updated on an ongoing basis as analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  The next update on the plan will be published as part of the 2018 annual transition statement later this year.  Implementation of the national mitigation plan in this manner means that we are making continual, incremental inroads into addressing these long-term challenges.<br/><br/>It is worth highlighting some of the measures included in the national mitigation plan that are being actively addressed.  They include<b></b>carbon pricing measures through the emissions trading scheme, ETS, for power generation and large industry, with a carbon tax being applied to other sectors; existing support schemes for renewable energy deployment; an ongoing programme of energy efficiency retrofits for the existing housing stock; implementation of the Near Zero Energy Building standards, nZEB, for new residential and commercial buildings; implementation of the public sector energy efficiency strategy which targets a 33% efficiency improvement by 2020; strengthening of the biofuels obligation scheme, with the rate of biofuels in the national fuel mix to increase to 10% from 1 January 2019; implementation of a range of agri-envionment schemes through the Rural Development Programme 2014 to 2020, including the beef data and genomics programme, the knowledge transfer programme, GLAS, green, low-carbon agri-environment scheme and the organic farming scheme; and the forestry programme, with an ambition to increase national forest cover from the current figure of 11% to 18% by the middle of the century.<br/><br/>The committee will be familiar with the headline commitments on climate action contained in the national development plan.  They build on existing national mitigation plan commitments and, with almost 20% of total NDP funding for the period 2018 to 2027 to be spent by the State and State companies on climate related measures, represent a significant step-change in our approach, both in terms of scale of ambition and the funding needed to meet the climate challenge.  Key initiatives in the national development plan include: energy efficiency upgrades of 45,000 homes per annum from 2021 and providing support for a major roll-out of heat pump technologies; delivering energy upgrades to BER B level in all public buildings and a minimum of one third of commercial buildings; implementing the new renewable electricity support scheme to deliver an additional 3,000 to 4,500 MW of renewable energy, with the initial focus on shovel ready projects which could contribute to meeting our 2020 renewable energy targets; the roll-out of the support scheme for renewable heat and national smart metering programme; transitioning the Moneypoint plant away from coal by the middle of the next decade; having at least 500,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030, with additional charging infrastructure to cater for planned growth; a &euro;500 million climate action fund to leverage investment by public and private bodies in innovative climate action measures; and public transport investments, with &euro;8.6 billion in funding in the next decade under national strategic outcome 4 of the national development plan.  The combined effect of existing national mitigation plan measures and new NDP commitments is contributing to containing pre-2020 emissions at lower levels than otherwise would be the case and will also take us some way toward meeting our 2030 targets. <br/><br/>The preparation of a national energy and climate plan, covering the period 2021 to 2030, is one of the key provisions of the recently agreed EU regulation on the governance of the energy union.  It is an overarching, consolidating regulation that will streamline a large number of energy and climate planning and reporting requirements.  The national energy and climate plan, NECP, will include trajectories for national emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency and outline the measures required to achieve these trajectories.  The first draft must be submitted to the European Commission by 31 December, with the final version due by 31 December 2019.  We will commence preliminary consultation on the NECP within the next few weeks, or earlier, the findings of which will inform the initial draft NECP, with at least one further consultation on the draft plan during 2019.  Ireland&rsquo;s NECP will set out our proposed contribution to EU level targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency which will be informed both by our NDP commitments and our ambition to largely decarbonise the energy system by 2040.  <br/><br/>In the electricity sector we will see the deployment of additional technologies in the next decade, with solar and offshore wind energy, in particular, playing an increasing role.  We will further decarbonise the sector by ceasing to use coal and peat in electricity generation.  In the transport sector we will increase our use of sustainable biofuels, move to electrify the car fleet and deploy renewable gas and compressed natural gas solutions for the heavier commercial fleet.  In the heating-cooling sector we will significantly increase the use of heat pumps and sustainable biomass in the commercial sector.  By combining these actions with a robust energy efficiency programme at domestic and commercial levels, we will significantly reduce emissions from the energy sector.<br/><br/>A separate requirement of the governance regulation is the preparation by each member state of a new long-term low emissions strategy.  Each strategy must be prepared by the start of 2020, have at least a 30-year time horizon and contribute to long-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the European Union in accordance with the Paris Agreement.  The strategy will further elaborate on sectoral pathways for Ireland to meet its long-term decarbonisation objectives to 2050.<br/><br/>We need to consider how we respond to the impacts of climate change.  No matter how successful our mitigation efforts prove to be, we are already locked into a scenario where globally we know that we are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.  Observations show that Ireland&rsquo;s climate is also changing and the observed scale and rate of change are consistent with regional and global trends.  Earlier this year the Minister published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory national adaptation framework which aims to reduce the vulnerability of our environment, society and economy to the impacts of climate change and thus increase our overall climate resilience. <br/><br/>The national adaptation framework identifies 12 key sectors within the remit of seven Departments where sectoral adaptation plans are to be prepared for submission to the Government for approval by 13 December.  Each local authority will also be developing its own adaptation strategies under the national framework.  Building capacity within both central and local government administrations to engage with climate adaptation is very important, particularly at regional and local level.  In that regard, in January the Minister announced the establishment of four climate action regional offices to co-ordinate and drive climate action at local level and committed &euro;10 million to support their work.  Furthermore, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is continuing to support the ongoing development of a climate information platform  - Climate Ireland - which is providing hands on training and guidance for the regional teams being established within these offices.  In addition, the Department continues to support the EPA's climate change research programme which plays a critical role in informing our responses to adaptation. <br/><br/>The Minister and the Government have welcomed the report and recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  Many of the assembly's recommendations on climate action are already being implemented by the Government.  For example, on public sector leadership, the public sector energy efficiency strategy requires public bodies to implement the Nearly Zero Energy Building ,nZEB, standard two years in advance of the private sector and provides a framework for investment in public buildings retrofits - recommendation No. 2.  The new renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, provides for communities to develop their own renewable electricity projects and for developer-led projects to offer investment opportunities to local citizens and communities - recommendation No. 6.  In relation to sustainable mobility, strategic outcome 4 of the national development plan commits to investing &euro;8.6 billion in the next ten years.  Capital funding for cycling and walking infrastructure will increase threefold between 2018 and 2021, with over &euro;110 million allocated for urban cycling and walking infrastructure in the main cities - recommendation No. 8.  A strong package of measures to support the roll-out of electric vehicles is now in place, supporting the NDP objective of having at least 500,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030 - recommendation No. 9.  The Minister is promoting strong action at EU level and in Ireland to address food waste - recommendation No. 12 - and reduce packaging, in particular plastics - ancillary recommendation No. 2.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is implementing the Nearly Zero Energy Building, nZEB, standard for new residential and commercial buildings - ancillary recommendation No. 4 which will come into force from 1 January 2019. <br/><br/>Much of the discussion in and on the work of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly has focused on the need to recognise the economic and social, in addition to the environmental, opportunities provided by the low carbon transition.  The imperative to take advantage of these opportunities is also made explicit in both the national policy position and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.</p><p>There is now <font color="#2F2F2F">a large body of international and local evidence that examines the potential gains for the economy in taking strong action to develop the low carbon economy.  The Government's support for energy efficiency measures in our building stock is supported by detailed analysis, commissioned by SEAI, that evidences not only savings but also employment gains, market and supply chain development opportunities and macro-economic benefits that can be achieved from energy efficiency investments.  In 2017 alone, Exchequer investments of </font>&euro;70 million in building energy upgrades supported more than 2,000 jobs across Ireland.  Elsewhere, the development of the bioeconomy and the development of a stronger emphasis on value-added, sustainable food production presents real long-term economic opportunities for Ireland's agriculture and food sectors, which will have the potential for real improvements in the emissions profile of the sector over the longer term.<br/><br/>Ireland's publicly funded research is also recognising these opportunities.  The recently concluded refresh of our national research priorities has added energy, climate action and sustainability as one of six overall themes for the 2018-23 period. This will comprise the two broad pillars of research - decarbonising the energy system and sustainable living. <br/><br/>The Citizens' Assembly also demonstrates that individual citizens can produce very clear recommendations when provided with an opportunity to reflect and consider in detail a specific societal change.  It also underlines that Ireland will not achieve its climate objectives through Government action alone and engagement with wider society on an ongoing basis will be essential.  This is a model that the Department intends to develop further through initiatives under the national dialogue on climate action, which was launched by the Minister last year, to deliver on the objective of broad societal engagement in the low-carbon transition.  On 23 June, a first regional gathering, under the auspices of the dialogue, took place in Athlone.  Further regional gatherings are being planned and details will be announced by the Department in the near future. <br/><br/><b></b>In conclusion, the Government is already implementing many of the recommendations made by the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly and considering the best way to follow through on others.  We are implementing long-term climate mitigation and adaptation strategies through the national mitigation plan, the national adaptation framework and the national development plan and will be streamlining our EU climate and energy reporting via the national energy and climate plan, NECP.  Citizens are being consulted on how best to tackle climate change through the national dialogue on climate action.  We will launch a consultation on the NECP very shortly.  We have a long way to go and huge challenges ahead. We also have to see and grasp the huge opportunities that exist if we embrace a low carbon future. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter O'Shea" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018092600002#D00300"><p>I thank the committee for affording us an opportunity to brief members on our views on these matters.</p> <p>  Climate change is one of the biggest challenges that face humanity and globally there is a critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to protect future generations.  This need is acknowledged in a range of international agreements and national policy documents that set out ambitious targets to restrict global warming and eliminate greenhouse gases.</p> <p>  The ESB welcomes the work done by the Citizens' Assembly in terms of its consideration of climate change.  We greatly welcome the establishment of a dedicated committee to consider climate action.  We are particularly encouraged by the fact that the Citizens' Assembly fully accepts that climate change is real and has sought for it to be at the centre of policy-making in Ireland.  For this, the organisers of the Citizens' Assembly should be highly commended.  The challenge for us in the ESB is to lead that transition where we can but in the most cost-effective manner for the customer and we stand ready to do so.</p> <p>  When considering climate change and how Ireland can adapt and mitigate its impacts, it is very important that we consider actions in terms of greenhouse gas emission reductions.  While there is significant discussion of renewables targets, renewables are but one means to decarbonise.  To this end, focus must be first and foremost on greenhouse gas emission reductions to ensure a policy focus that delivers the most cost effective solution.</p> <p>  It is instructive to consider the make up of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions by reference to a CO2 equivalence.  In the most recent data for 2016 produced by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, it has shown that total greenhouse gas emissions were just over 61.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalence, that agriculture is responsible for close to a third of those emissions and that electricity generation, transport and heat are responsible for around a fifth each.  By 2050, Ireland will need to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sectors, which is heat, transport and power generation, by up to 95% to play its part in the global action against climate change.</p> <p>  The key narrative of the decarbonisation journey in Ireland to date has been the increase in renewable electricity.  In 2016, renewable electricity accounted for over 27% of electricity demand in Ireland.  In our view this number is on a trajectory to hit 40% by 2020, driven primarily by wind generation.  Ireland is recognised as being at the cutting edge of integrating intermittent renewables on to a small island system.  We should be very proud of that achievement.</p> <p>  More renewable electricity will be required but ESB believes that action is required in other areas.  We have given significant consideration to how Ireland might decarbonise.  In late 2017, we published a report in conjunction with international consultants, Poyry, entitled Ireland's Low Carbon Future - Dimensions of a Solution.  I have a copy of the report if members wish to read it.  The report considered broader energy emissions in an holistic manner, namely all of the emissions generated by heat, transport and electricity.  The report set out a series of low regret recommendations that were informed by international precedent across the various energy sectors.  These recommendations form a key part of ESB's own Brighter Future strategy.</p> <p>  The key tenet of the joint report is the increased electrification of heat and transport that must be underpinned by the decarbonisation of electricity through zero or close to zero carbon technologies.  To achieve this we must consider the following three dimensions.</p> <p>  First, we need to get ready now for a transport modal evolution where a significant portion of the vehicle fleet transitions from internal combustion engines, ICE, to electric motor propelled vehicles.  To achieve this we need to put in place a comprehensive network of public charging infrastructure.  We also need to prioritise the electrification of public transport and increase the use of electrified rail freight.  Since the charging infrastructure must be in place to provide public confidence in purchasing an electric vehicle, we believe that State support is required for this infrastructure as has been the case in many other jurisdictions.  We will be putting forward our case for support in due course through initiatives like the climate action fund.</p> <p>  Second, we need to decarbonise Ireland's heating requirements through a variety of measures.  Existing housing and commercial stock should have an energy efficiency retrofit to significantly reduce energy consumption on the basis that using less energy in the first place reduces the decarbonisation problem.  Retrofit programmes represent huge opportunities for new employment right across Ireland and have enormous benefits in terms of Ireland's balance of payments.  All of the 500,000 expected new houses in the coming decades should have a heat pump installed rather than a fossil fuel burner, especially as the cost implications for new homes are negligible.  The same applies to new commercial buildings.  Existing fossil fuel heat sources should be replaced by electric heat pumps where possible.  Otherwise, biomass or biogas should be considered.  However, we need to note that both fuel source quantities are constrained by the availability of raw material.</p> <p>  Third, in order to underpin the scale of electrification required we need to decarbonise the electricity system.  Undoubtedly, renewable technologies like onshore and offshore wind and solar photovoltaic, PV, will play a massive role as will storage and interconnection with other markets.  However, even with significant renewables, Ireland will still need a backbone of dispatchable generation to meet the demands of society when its neither windy nor sunny.  Unlike many other electricity systems around the world, Ireland does not have significant hydro power potential, biomass is a limited resource for many reasons and we have an outright ban on nuclear generation.  ESB is of the view that carbon capture and storage, CCS, technology will be required in Ireland given the lack of alternatives to complement renewables.  We believe Ireland needs to act now to consider CCS in a specific Irish context.  We would greatly welcome the establishment of a dedicated Government-led working group to fully explore this option.</p></speech>

We work with the Government, homeowners, businesses and communities<b></b>to achieve this by providing expertise, capital funding, educational programmes, policy advice, research and demonstration support for new technologies.  A part of SEAI's remit is to contribute to the evidence base for policy making in Ireland.  This is supported by research, development and demonstration, RDD, statistics and modelling functions.  We use a broad range of data sources, including data collected from the programmes delivered by SEAI.  We administer the national energy modelling framework as part of our statutory functions.  We execute this in partnership with a range of domestic organisations, Departments and State agencies with expertise in the Irish economy and energy sector, and with international organisations such as the European Commission, the International Energy Agency and EUROSTAT.</p><p>Our modelling function is central to the preparation of the national energy and climate plan, NECP.  SEAI has direct experience of incentivising and delivering measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the residential, commercial, public, industrial sand transport sectors.  In a separate advisory note to the committee, we outline a summary of some of the key measures we are delivering that align with the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  I will highlight a short selection of these key opportunities now.</p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s public sector building stock represents a significant opportunity for the Government to take a leadership role in our low carbon transition.  By the end of 2017, the public sector in Ireland had reached a level of 20% energy savings from energy efficiency, meeting the overall 2020 national target.  However, further work needs to be done to reach the 33% efficiency improvements savings target, as was set by the Government for the public sector, beyond the national target.  To facilitate this, SEAI has run an award winning public sector programme for a number of years, funded by the Department of Community, Climate Action and Environment.  The programme delivers material impact through capital projects, mentoring on energy management systems and capacity building within State bodies, such as the HSE, OPW, local authorities and the Department of Education and Skills.  The programme includes a strong monitoring and reporting mechanism requiring all public bodies and schools to engage with their energy performance annually and work towards the 33% target.  The programme has a strong focus on capacity building within State entities to make sustainable energy practices the norm in the Irish public sector.  SEAI is developing a long-term pipeline of projects to assure high impact and cost-effective delivery of sustainable energy retrofits.  This aggregation model will also allow non-Exchequer funding to be brought to bear, as volume increases to meet Ireland&rsquo;s ambition.  SEAI is currently working with State bodies to pursue non-Exchequer finance alternatives.</p><p> There is also a clear opportunity to deliver significant upgrades of homes through State-owned housing.  The use of this stock as an exemplar of a national Government-led programme, represents an immediate opportunity to meet our residential retrofit targets.</p><p> Delivering actions that connect citizens to the need to act is also vitally important.   In 2017, SEAI commissioned an assessment of models to support community ownership of renewable energy in Ireland to recognise the importance of community participation in the transition to a low-carbon society.  This has supported development of options to provide for community renewable energy development and deployment, via the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS.</p><p> In addition to this input to the RESS development process, SEAI has been supporting microgeneration technologies through programmes delivered on behalf of Government for several years.  In 2018, SEAI removed supported for new fossil fuel boilers and added grants for heat pumps, solar PV, and domestic battery storage.  As EU Clean Energy Package starts to facilitate the generation, export and receipt of a market price for microgeneration export, the evidence base provided by these pilot programmes nationwide will help to de-risk this transition.  With this evidence base, Ireland should be able to deliver the best-fit market mechanism at optimal cost to the exchequer and high value to the consumer.</p><p> In further support of communities over the last three years, SEAI has grown the sustainable energy communities network, which today boasts more than 200 communities spread across the country.  We provide technical mentoring and advice for communities to develop their own energy masterplan.  This process identifies the opportunities for them as they determine their own low carbon transition, including the potential for renewable energy.  Through the renewable electricity support scheme and by looking at other market constraints, it is essential that communities are empowered to invest in renewable energy projects where these are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.  SEAI will continue to work with the various Departments and regulatory bodies to help to ensure that this becomes a reality.</p><p> SEAI delivers Ireland&rsquo;s grants for new electric vehicle, EV, purchases and for home chargers with funding from Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We are also engaged with the motor industry in delivering roadshows at various events and locations to increase the level of test-driving and user experience.  Through the latter half of 2018 we will finalise a fleet replacement programme, which supports public and private sector businesses to test a range of EVs alongside their existing fleet to consider switching to EVs.</p><p> Our data show that in 2018 EV sales in Ireland will likely double as a result of the various incentives, including the grants, toll charges, benefit-in-kind, and fleet and taxi purchase scheme.  As adoption of EVs grows, it is increasingly important that the charging infrastructure meets demand.  In our role supporting the low emission vehicles task force, co-chaired by Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, SEAI will be central to the provision of this infrastructure and a transition to lower emission vehicles.</p><p> Price signals that drive low-carbon investment and behaviour are key.  An extension to the carbon tax could play a crucial role in reducing energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, especially if a long-term trajectory is sent as a clear market signal.  In many countries, the ring-fencing of carbon tax for climate mitigation activities can help to finance cost effective sustainable energy interventions.  It can also links the taxation more directly to heightened awareness of its need and impact.</p><p> There is a much longer list of actions than I have had time to mention here, and many of these are detailed in the Government's national development plan and highlighted in other Government policy papers and include opportunities for: district heating; decarbonising gas; electrifying heat and transport and activities to further decarbonise electricity, transport and heat; and promote energy efficiency.  All of these are required to achieve our goals.</p><p> The Department has highlighted already the importance of the upcoming national energy and climate plan, NECP.  To highlight SEAI's contribution to the plan, in its review of national energy and climate plans, the European Commission will consider member states' NECP commitments against the outputs from a new EU model.  SEAI is supporting the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and liaising with EU officials to ensure that that model is based on the latest available data for Ireland.  Further to these inputs, SEAI provides a central supporting role to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, via development of energy projections for Ireland to 2030 and 2040, as part of our statutory authority to produce the national energy statistics and national energy projections.  These will meet many of the analytical requirements of the NECP.  The scenarios are being developed in consultation with the Department and other key stakeholders.  We are further supporting the Department across wider policy development in research, development and deployment, and innovation on sustainable energy activities.</p><p> The EU's recent suite of legislation, including the governance regulation, mandate minimum levels of effort for member states to adhere to, in terms of emissions reductions across the economy.  Member states are, however, fully entitled to design more ambitious plans.  This is crucial, as it is currently unclear as to whether the EU targets are ambitious enough to deliver on its commitments under the Paris Agreement.  Against this backdrop SEAI is grateful for the support and resources committed to us via Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We are committed to supporting this committee, and wider Government, to transform Ireland into a society based on sustainable energy, technology and practices. I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I propose that Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy takes Senator Mulherin's place.  Then we will have Senator O'Sullivan, Deputy Dooley, Senator Marshall and Deputy Stanley.  We will have our ten-minute slots at the beginning.  Deputy Stanley will be the first speaker in our five-minute slots.</p> <p>  I will start with my own questions.  I will begin with the Department.  Reference was made to the national development plan and the measures over the next ten years that will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  No analysis has been done on this.  When will that analysis take place?  Does the Department believe we will reach our 2030 targets based on the national development plan?</p> <p>  As regards the burning of peat for electricity, as we know that has a significant impact on our carbon emissions.  There are also sustainability questions that arise from importing biomass fuel, depending on where it is coming from.  Should we not have strict sustainability criteria on the importation of biomass and what would the Department's views be on that?</p> <p>  This committee is going to visit the Tipperary Energy Agency in the coming weeks.  We will see community-owned wind farms.  We will hear from the community which has solar panels and which is working collectively at community level on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  There is clear expert evidence that community and citizen participation works in relation to our energy transition.  What is the Department doing?  What initiatives and supports are there in order to roll this out across the country?  This is an example that is clearly working very well.  We need to hear concrete proposals from the Department on what it is doing to help us reach our targets.</p> <p>  What discussions has the Department had with the ESB in facilitating citizen participation and allowing people to sell their surplus energy on to the grid?</p> <p>  On offshore electricity generation as part of the solution, we heard last week that there are a number of issues around planning, regulation and licensing in building offshore wind farms.</p><p>Where do we stand in the context of dealing with those challenges?  What is the capacity of the grid?  Will it be capable of taking that energy on, distributing it throughout the State and feeding it on into Europe?<br/><br/>The committee was told last week that the Department of Education and Skills has advised that heat pumps are unsuitable for new schools and that any unused energy generated from solar panels had to be spilled.  It was stated previously that schools were ideal for solar and PV panels because they could export excess energy to the grid when closed at weekends and during the summer, thus generating money for the schools themselves.  What is the situation with regard to Government policy on microgeneration?  Is there a need for a more joined up approach from Departments <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>our public buildings and the supports available through the RESS?<br/><br/>I ask Mr. Griffin to start with those questions and I will then bring in my colleagues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018092600002#F00200"><p>I have given the committee a sense of the range of measures that are set out in the NDP.  Any fair observer would say that the plan is very ambitious in terms of what the Government wants to do on the climate front, particularly in the context of renewable energy.  One can see a very significant step change in investment in comparison with previous years.  The figures show that we were moving from a period of significant underinvestment, for a range of reasons, in climate action and renewable energy into a space where &euro;1 in &euro;5 to be invested under the NDP will be spent on climate action measures.</p> <p>  In the national mitigation plan, NMP, which preceded the NDP, we carried out a detailed analysis of the contribution towards our carbon reduction targets of various national mitigation measures, where that data was available.  The next big step for us is the development of the national energy and climate plan, NECP.  That will require us to look at the targets we have agreed at EU level, like the 32% renewable energy target which is EU wide, the 32.5% energy efficiency target, the 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the non-ETS sector target and other sub-targets which do not get as much attention or prominence, such as the target for interconnection.  We then need to set out in great detail for the European Commission how the totality of existing measures and measures yet to be identified, designed and put in place will assist in the achievement of the various targets.  That work has started and we expect the first consultation on the NECP to go out in the next week or two.  The Department is already engaged in some of the preliminary drafting work.  We circulated a document to the committee in the last day or two on the role of technical research and modelling, TRAM, in modelling the impact of the various measures.  All of that work will be fed into the NECP.</p> <p>  On the issue of peat and its sustainability in the context of electricity generation, the Minister has stated on numerous occasions in the House that, as per the NDP, our intention is to get out of peat no later than 2030.  Our intention is to get out of coal-based generation at the Moneypoint plant no later than 2025.  In that context, a lot of in-depth analysis is ongoing in the Department and in the ESB, as the plant owner, as to how we can achieve that.  The Department is acutely conscious of the fact that saying something like "getting out of peat" needs to be understood in the context of the importance of the plants to the midlands.  There is a commitment in the NMP to prepare a report on a just transition and how we manage the situation whereby 4,000 people in the midlands are directly or indirectly supported by Bord na M&oacute;na's activities.  That work is ongoing.  The other important point about Bord na M&oacute;na, as an entity, is that it has already made significant progress in decarbonisation of energy generation in the plants for which it is responsible.  By 2024, approximately 85% of the electricity generated by Bord na M&oacute;na will be renewable, through a combination of co-firing at the three existing plants, two of which are owned by the ESB.  There has also been a very significant investment by Bord na M&oacute;na in wind energy and  the company is moving into the solar energy space as well.  Bord na M&oacute;na is very conscious of the need to get the transition right, not just from the point of view of environmental sustainability but also to ensure that the company remains a very significant part of the midlands.</p> <p>  On microgeneration, we did some initial survey work on the existing scheme which is run by the ESB, the only supplier in the market to offer a microgeneration scheme.  The Minister launched a new scheme in the summer which supports investment in solar PV and battery storage up to a maximum of &euro;3,800, that is, up to &euro;2,800 for the solar PV and &euro;1,000 for battery.  We have said that we will review this scheme within a reasonable timeframe to see how it is functioning.  The scheme is for self-consumption at the moment but we are giving thought to the potential impact of allowing the spilling of that electricity onto the grid, how that might be managed from an electricity supply perspective and how it might impact the PSO and so on.  There is a bit of work to be done on that before we embark on a more extensive microgeneration programme.  We are also conscious of the fact that the second renewable energy directive, which was just negotiated at EU level, is very clear that the community has to be at the heart of it.  Effecting transformational change of the type that we have to achieve over the next few decades cannot be done without community involvement at all levels.  This means that we must involve communities in the decision making process and make sure that communities are more actively engaged.  Obviously, from a generation perspective, microgeneration is part of that.  We have also written into the RESS provisions a requirement for community involvement in renewable electricity schemes.  A developer would be required, for example, to allocate a certain proportion of the scheme for community involvement.  There will also be the traditional community contributions that we expect developers to continue to make.  We would also expect in the auctions that we will be running over future years that a component will be available for communities to bid into.  Obviously, we have to look at how that bidding in is financed and how we can support communities in that way.</p> <p>  In terms of the planning regulations and licensing, work is ongoing, led by Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, on the development of a marine area and foreshore (amendment) Bill.  That will provide the licensing and regulatory framework to allow offshore as distinct from foreshore developments to take place.  There is already a mechanism in place to consent schemes within the foreshore area.</p> <p>  Reference was made to grid capacity.  When one looks at the demand scenarios, even the low-carbon scenario prepared by Eirgrid looking out to 2030, the reality is that we will need to continue to invest in grid, whether that is through reinforcements or additional grid capacity.</p><p> We also need to develop our grid connections to the European Union.  We have one that is beyond the feasibility study at this stage, the Celtic interconnector between Ireland and France, which is approximately 700 km in length and about &euro;1 billion in cost.  That will make a real difference in terms of the connectivity we will require.  A private sector company is promoting a Greenlink project, which will introduce a further grid connection between Ireland and Wales.  We already have the existing 500 MW grid connection between Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p><p> That is a quick run through of the questions the Chairman posed.  There is a final point but while I am not sure if I am in a position to answer it; the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, witnesses may be able to do so.  It is on the issue of the schools.  I do not want to land the SEAI in this-----</p></speech>

The general underlying principle with heat pumps is that the building itself must be energy efficient in the first instance to make them economically viable.  It is not a blanket statement that they are not suitable; it is just that certain building stock may not be suitable.  Having said that, the SEAI is actively engaged with the Department of Education and Skills, and we are engaged in a Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment-funded programme, which will provide &euro;14 million over three years, to do deep retrofits of 30 schools, and I believe heat pumps will feature in those.</p></speech>

However, in instances, and we are supporting them through our community scheme and in the case of the schools programme, we are supporting PV where the occupancy extends into later in the evening or the school is used extensively during the summer when there is a higher level of availability of solar energy.  It is not a blanket fit, so to speak, but the Department of Education and Skills has strong guidelines on this and it is not always suitable.</p></speech>

Reference was made to needing Government support to roll that out.  Can the witnesses explain why it would need that?  If we are to have this transition whereby electricity will replace petrol and diesel for cars, that would be a very positive business model for the ESB.  Can they explain the reason the ESB would need Government intervention supports to roll out infrastructure for electric vehicles?</p></speech>

If we are to move from the current internal combustion engine-driven transport system to charging systems, we currently have approximately 1,100 public charging points across Ireland.  We have more in Northern Ireland.  We put them in place on foot of a scheme agreed with the regulator.  As we look forward, there are more organisations than the ESB looking to put in place new charging mechanisms but to do so on a commercial basis, we have to get a return on the asset.  If we look, for example, at some of the businesses we are doing in Great Britain now, we are engaged in both London and in Coventry in what are effectively local authority-run schemes where bids are made and, on foot of winning a bid, the company builds the charging points.  It is all about the economics of it.  We do not make money from the electricity being provided from the unit to any great extent, and the unit is quite capital intensive.</p> <p>  We welcome the availability of moneys from the climate action fund to ensure we can put in place a more comprehensive scheme of charges into the future.</p></speech>

I have a question for Mr. Griffin on recommendation 1 of the Citizens' Assembly regarding a single organisation responsible for ensuring that we achieve our targets.  The committee has been receiving different views on that and there seems to be an emerging view that across Departments at a very senior level, a committee of Secretaries General being answerable to the Taoiseach's office would be a good model to pursue.  I note that the national adaptation framework has seven Ministers who will produce sectoral adaption plans by next year.  What are Mr. Griffin's views on that?</p> <p>  My other question concerns getting information to the citizen.  We have heard about the terrific work of the Tipperary Energy Agency and a number of other agencies across the country that are doing work, but it is clearly not in every county.  I note the Department has four climate action regional offices.  Will they be operating in each local authority or will it be more regional, such as at the regional assembly level?</p> <p>  Also, is the proposal that I and many others have made on communicating to the citizen via RT&Eacute; and Met &Eacute;ireann one of which Mr. Griffin's Department would approve, considering RT&Eacute; comes under his Department's remit?  Met &Eacute;ireann is under the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government but I have no doubt it is something he could work on across Departments.</p><p> On the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, and communities developing the renewable electricity projects, is this something the Department sees farmers being able to avail of, because many of them are interested in the PV potential there?  Will European models, for example, enable them to connect to the grid, supply their own electricity and then sell it?  Is that something the Department envisages coming in under that particular scheme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.52" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018092600002#H00200"><p>On the first question, it would be helpful to set out the structures that are in place to manage this across Government in order to give a clear sense of the level of join-up in place across Departments at official level and at Government level in dealing with this issue.  In 2016, when the Government was formed, it took the view that we should have a climate action and energy Department, which is why my Department inherited the climate functions from the Custom House in 2016, and we have managed both policy agendas since then.  There is Oireachtas oversight through the annual transition statement process, and since last year each sectoral Minister for each sector is required to brief the Oireachtas on progress in his or her own area.<br/><br/>On the delivery of the national mitigation plan and the national adaptation framework, there is a high-level steering group chaired by the Minister which has the senior officials from the relevant Departments feeding into it.  There is Cabinet-level oversight by a Cabinet committee, which has been quite active this year in looking at the climate issue.  As one would expect, there is Cabinet consideration of this matter from time to time, and we have been to Cabinet on a number of climate and energy-related issues during 2018.  The Cabinet committee is fed by a senior officials' group, and the representation is generally at Assistant Secretary level.  Therefore, Mr. Michael Manley is a regular attendee at that, along with Mr. Brian Carroll, the Assistant Secretary in the climate area.<br/><br/>A new innovation, for want of a better term, is the Project Ireland 2040 delivery group, which is a group comprising the relevant Secretaries General who have responsibility for areas mandated in the national development plan.  I sit on it, and it is chaired by Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and co-chaired by Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It includes the Secretaries General of the Department of Health, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the Department of Education and Skills.  There is a good cross-spectrum, therefore, of Departments that are tasked with delivering significant outcomes under the national development plan, not least climate-related outcomes.  The group generally meets once a month and reports to Government on a regular basis.  The first report was last week.<br/><br/>From my perspective as a Secretary General of a Department, big-ticket items that arise in the climate or energy area, whether they be new policy, policy development, a commitment of money or discussions about Estimates which affect this in particular, all come through me.  We have a good framework in place to manage what needs to be managed on this front.  In truth, I am not sure of the value of a new independent body.  There is already another independent body out there.  The committee has already Professor John FitzGerald, who is the chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council.  He calls it straight, and he was straight with the committee on what he thought was going well and not so well with our climate agenda.  We are obviously cognisant of that, and we listen closely to what the advisory council says.  Ms Laura Burke is an <i>ex-officio</i>member, as is Mr. Jim Gannon, the head of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and other eminent members are well equipped to assess the issue and make recommendations, as they have done on a number of occasions.  On that issue, I think we are well geared up.<br/><br/>I will ask Dr. John O'Neill to talk about the climate action regional offices because he has been heavily involved in the national adaptation area for some time now, and was instrumental in setting up the offices.  I will ask Mr. Manley to comment on the RESS scheme and, in particular, the community dimension.</p></speech>

We have a national steering committee in place with all the sectors, that is, all the Departments which can interact on that, and it met only yesterday, in fact.  It meets quite frequently, and the whole idea is to have that cross-sectoral interaction at the sectoral level.  Taking the governance point a bit further, the local authorities are also represented on that group, as are the regional assemblies.  As Mr. Griffin mentioned in his opening statement, the Minister made &euro;10 million available this year to set up four regional climate action offices, which were set up on a regional basis initially to deal with the climate risks.  Cork County Council is dealing with the south west, while Mayo County Council is dealing with the north-west region.  Dublin City Council is co-ordinating for the Dublin region, while Kildare County Council is controlling the midlands.  The role of those regional offices is to co-ordinate activity on the climate action agenda with all the local authorities in their respective regions.</p> <p>  The initial focus of these offices is on adaptation.  Not only do the sectors have to do their own sectoral plans for adaptation by September next year, but the local authorities have the same deadline.  The idea behind the local authority offices is to put some capacity building at the local and regional level.  It has been mentioned several times as part of the overall climate action agenda.  It will span not just the adaptation side but will include the mitigation side as well.</p></speech>

It is on the question that was raised about the role of Met &Eacute;ireann and RT&Eacute;.  The best way to frame it is that Met &Eacute;ireann is heavily involved in the analysis and support of much of this work, particularly on the adaptation side.  It was involved in the national adaptation steering group and contributed to the development of the national adaptation framework, which was published some time ago.  It also sits on the steering group for the climate action regional offices.  It is involved in the climate information platform, Climate Ireland, which I mentioned in my opening statement.  It is also centrally involved from a long-term adaptation perspective with its climatological analysis, forecasts and so on, and it is establishing the national flood forecast and warning service.  It is usually involved in the space, therefore.</p> <p>  On RT&Eacute; and the role it could have in public awareness, we would need to think about what we want the organisation to do.  If we go out with a communications campaign, it would need to be well structured.  Off the top of my head, I see value in a programme like "Nationwide" being involved in this space, and there are obviously other environmental programmes on RT&Eacute; such as "Ear to the Ground".</p></speech>

There may be value in the forecast saying something on this issue from time to time as part of the public-facing role of Met &Eacute;ireann, and we will take the matter up with it.</p><p>Our biggest area of focus in terms of public awareness to date has been around the national dialogue on climate action and how we get that bottom-up, local and regional engagement and engage citizens at all levels in ensuring that they contribute to the process of achieving that transformational change we will require over the next few decades.  I will ask Mr. Manley to talk about the renewable electricity scheme, RES, and micro generation.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.59" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Manley" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018092600002#J00200"><p>In respect of micro generation, our system of energy, particularly electricity, is changing significantly.  Twenty years ago, a monolithic ESB did all the generation, transmission and retailing.  Unbundling and bringing in new actors in the supply and generation of electricity have been the key issues over the past 20 years.  The next step is in the clean energy package.  It involves bringing the citizen and community into that space.  It will require an enormous amount of work.  We are looking at it on a number of different levels.  In the RESS, we are looking at the scale production of energy and trying to find a way to put communities into commercial projects.  The RES provides for mandatory participation and systems to do that.  That is on a commercial scale.  There will be smaller schemes that we envisage will be community-led.  We are looking at how we can support those and how we can look at models of giving early support finance so people can come together, get their ideas together and work them out.  How can we put expert supports in there because very few communities anywhere in the country would be able to say "what about design, construction and finance?" and ask how to take long-term finance on board?</p> <p>  Micro generation is on a smaller scale.  This is where people can put solar panels on their roof and spill it in.  This raises significant questions about equity.  Italy had significant problems this summer.  There was not that much electricity demand on sunny Sunday afternoons, there was a lot of solar power, it was spilling into the grid, commercial generators were losing revenue and they were looking to see to how they recover that.  These are not insurmountable things.  We must try to design a market that accommodates all of that.  We will not be recalcitrant.  We talk about a clean energy package and it tends to be focused on the renewable and efficiency objectives but there are four market instruments as well which, hopefully, will come to the Council this December.  Article 16 of the electricity market directive states that communities are entitled to own, establish or lease community networks and autonomously manage them.  Article 21 states that communities are entitled to generate renewable energy, including their own consumption, and store and sell their excess production of renewable electricity.  Article 22 states they are entitled to generate, consume, store and sell renewable energy.  We must legislatively bring those into operation in Ireland.  The deadline is 2021.  It will change profoundly how we do things.  The steps we are taking at the moment are only a start.  Many people are happy to get grant support for micro generation while others want to be much more actively involved in the market.  We want to design a market that welcomes those who want to be active in the market and the many citizens who are quite happy not to be involved.  The European consumer bodies have been very active at this level and have pointed out that consumers are busy people.  They are trying to get to work, care for children, get child care and do all the things they want to do.  Some will be very interested while others will not so that will be a pretty complex market.  </p> <p>  With regard to the question about farmers getting involved, there will no badges saying that farmers need not apply.  Is a farmer developing on their own land a commercial developer and, therefore, in the commercial pot or are they working with their community so there is broader support and, therefore, they are in a community project?  We have met some of the community groups and had this discussion with them.  When is community commercial?  If a number of businesses come together, is that a community or a commercial project?  We must work these things out.  </p></speech>

Could they elaborate on that?</p></speech>

The different parts of the technology have been tried and tested.  There are 3,000 km of carbon network in the US.  It has not had the same push over in the past ten-odd years.  We feel it is a technology that needs some further support.  When one looks across the various road maps across Europe, one can see that generally carbon capture and storage features heavily in each of them as a means of ensuring that carbon is prevented from going into the atmosphere and that we can continue to run the system through a combination of renewables and thermal plant.</p></speech>

Battery technology is advancing steadily.  The energy density of batteries is increasing day by day and week by week and that is what is putting the real emphasis on electrification of transport and electric vehicles.  These are limited enough in terms of the actual storage an individual device can provide but when one uses the law of large numbers and put a lot of them together, one starts to get to something that is useful.  I told this committee 18 months ago that if we were to store one day's worth of electricity in Ireland in the Turlough Hill-type power plants for when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine, we would have to build 60 new Turlough Hills.  This constitutes massive storage capability but also a level of implementation that is not credible right now.  Equally, were we to store one day's worth of electricity in batteries, if one takes the Tesla Powerwell that is currently available commercially and is a 10 kW-hour battery, one would need something like 14 million of them on houses in Ireland so this is six or seven batteries on the side of every house.  Again, this says to me that there is something that can certainly contribute but it probably cannot achieve a full day's worth of energy storage.  The challenges are real, which is why the we in the ESB would say that when we look at the technologies, we should not discount any of them because the challenge is so big that we have to get to the end of this and all of these technologies have a part to play.</p></speech>

In our networks business, someone can turn up, notify and fit their micro generation installation.  They can turn up and fit up to 3.6 kW on a domestic premises.  I will give the Deputy an indication of what 3.6 kW is.  It is around 12 solar panels.  If one goes to three-phase supply, it is larger at about 10 kW, which is about 40 solar panels.  In Europe, three-phase supply is brought closer to domestic premises than happens in Ireland or the UK so the capacity is lower but we will be well beyond the requirements of the new renewables directive in terms of people being able to just turn up and connect their plant to the system.  That is the technical piece.</p> <p>  When we look at the commercial side of it, we think that when the smart metering scheme is put in place, it will be a game changer because we will be measuring electricity imports and exports from each individual home and we can work out the value of it.  The RESS package at European level will require a value to be placed on that and payments to the customer.  Over the past couple of years in advance of that, we have run two pilot schemes.  One is in our supply business, Electric Ireland, where we have offered a tariff of ten cent per unit to existing customers.  We have had to stop offering that.  It is not available to new customers but we have maintained it for the eighth year in a row.  To the best of my knowledge, we are the only electricity supplier that has offered that to its customer base and that pays the customer from electricity billed from solar panels or any other local micro generation.  In our networks business, we offer a package to install the kit and provide an import-export meter.  On top of that, we offered ten cent per unit of electricity generated from it.  In the networks business, that cost was effectively socialised across all customers for a period but, again, it was a pilot to see how the network would operate under these conditions.  It has not been continued because we have done the learning from it.  ESB is at the forefront of looking to do these sort of initiatives.  Electric Ireland offers a package for existing customers whereby we will give an interest-free loan to install some of these capabilities.  Again, it has been taken up in reasonable numbers.</p></speech>

I am always reminded of the mobile phone and how 25 to 30 years ago, people carried a large battery cell phone around with them and how it is such a small device now.  We should embrace the challenge, particularly with regard to renewable energy and having a healthy environment in which to live.</p><p> I have a number of questions for Mr. Mark Griffin.  What does he envisage to be the role of this committee in the development of the national energy and climate action plan?  He said there would be consultation.</p><p> Last week we had an amazing presentation from Ms Marie Donnelly.  One point that stood out concerned the capacity of offshore wind and the facility at Porto, off the coast of Portugal.  It is a floating device.  It is clear from everyone we hear from that Ireland, as an island nation, has tremendous capacity.  We should be very ambitious in this field.  If we get it right, not only will we mitigate but we could also be supplying the rest of Europe.</p><p> I have a number of questions.  What do the delegates believe is a realistic projection for the future of renewable energy in the next two decades in Ireland?  What source of renewable energy would be best for us to use here?</p><p> I am a member of the Green Party.  My colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, introduced the Community Energy (Co-ownership) Bill in the D&aacute;il in November.  The focus of the Green Party is on community energy and community access to energy.  What is the position on community co-operatives being able to generate and have access to the grid, not only to supply energy to their own community but also to supply further afield in order to generate funding that would stay in the community.  I refer to rural areas and areas around the country in general.</p><p> I speak to farmers in the south east fairly regularly.  I am from Waterford.  There is definitely a blockage in terms of gaining access to the grid.  Farmers cannot gain access to it.  I am curious about this.  If a farmer were to put 25 acres under solar PV panels, what would it deliver for him on the farm?  What would it deliver for the community?  What could a farmer with 25 acres earn?  Farmers are under pressure and need to have other sources of income.</p><p> Will there be a bigger role for new technologies such as ocean and tidal technology in the next 20 years or so?  What problems will there be regarding their access to the grid?</p><p> Mr. Griffin said the national mitigation plan will be updated with carbon-pricing measures through the emissions trading scheme for power generation.  Could he clarify what he means by this?  Are changes foreseen to the emissions trading scheme, such as measures to increase the permit price?  Will it continue to be business as usual in this regard?</p><p> With regard to Moneypoint, I have a few questions.  It was mentioned that there are plans to close it around 2025.  What is the position on those plans?  What provision is being made for the staff?  This was asked earlier.</p><p> With regard to biomass, can the delegates assure me that biomass will not play a significant role in the 55% renewable energy target for 2030?</p></speech>

I will answer some of the questions and ask colleagues to join in.  On the first point, on the role of the committee in the development of the national energy and climate action plan, it is very clearly stitched into the terms of reference that it has an important role.  It all depends on the timing of the committee's report.  There will clearly be views expressed based on what the members have heard and their opinions on potentially new measures that might be inserted into the plan or matters that absolutely need to be considered.  The suite of hearings the committee has already had, and those to come, will place members in a strong position to offer opinions on many points that might feature in the action plan.  Maybe it will be the report itself that we will consider as part of an input to the national energy and climate action plan because it constitutes a de facto consultation.</p> <p>  On the Senator's point on offshore energy, I apologise to the Chairman because she also raised it in her opening remarks.  Will offshore wind play a role?  The short answer is that it will.  It is more complicated to determine when.  We prepared an offshore renewable energy development plan in 2014.  It set out that there was potential for approximately 4,500 MW of offshore wind energy and approximately 1,500 MW of wave and tidal energy.  Wave and tidal energy is further down the road and requires a significant amount of further research and development, some of which we are funding in the Department.</p> <p>  The offshore energy technologies are well developed.  Mr. Manley had an opportunity in recent weeks to visit a fixed offshore wind energy scheme being run by SSE in Wick, off the coast of Scotland in the far north.  Statoil has six demonstration turbines, using floating technology.  One of the challenges we face when looking at the next renewable energy strategy is the trade-off between what constitutes the most cost-effective technology and developing a diverse pool.  We will need to achieve the latter.  It is clear from the figures that onshore wind generation is still the cheapest.  When one looks at the costs per megawatt hour in 2017, one sees that the figure for large onshore wind is about &euro;89.  The large offshore wind figure is about &euro;129.  Therefore, we have to balance the need to diversify the portfolio with the impact on the consumer.  We expect that, over a relatively small number of years, the costs will come down.  We have been seeing very substantial reductions in the cost of solar in the past few years.  We believe offshore wind generation is likely to form a considerable component of the renewable energy portfolio, perhaps in five, ten or 15 years.  As the Deputy said, there is great potential.  Ireland has 900,000 sq. km offshore, which is ten times the size of our island land mass.  There is massive potential in this regard.  All of these factors are knitted in.  It is unfortunate that EirGrid representatives are not with us today.  Having significant levels of offshore wind energy generation probably requires a fairly fundamental redesign of the grid.  Do we run it across the country?  Do we run it offshore?  Are we to generate offshore wind energy solely for our own consumption or should we be looking to export?  What does that mean in terms of the volume of offshore wind energy one would want to bring into the system?  How should the grid be structured to sell the energy to other administrations?</p> <p>  With regard to the cost of community energy and access, I will ask Mr. Manley to answer.  Our colleagues in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland might have views on the issue also.</p> <p>  I will ask the ESB representatives to talk about Moneypoint because it is clearly doing a lot of work on that issue.</p><p>A review of the emission trading system, ETS, was undertaken as part of the climate suite over the past year or 18 months.  That review has been completed.  It has done a number of things and I will ask Mr. Maughan to come in on that.  Maybe Mr. Manley could answer first, then Mr. Maughan and then the ESB can talk about Moneypoint.</p></speech>

On the question of grid, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities has recently published enduring connection policy 1, ECP-1.  The "1" is important.  That report is focused on the short term and 2020 targets.  The question of our future approach to how we allocate grid and how we deal with the community group and how we diversify across sectors will be key.  There is a massive amount of solar energy out there, more than we could take.  It would also be highly peak and would not be dispatchable 24-7, 365 days a year.  We will get a better sense from the first renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auction of where solar is at in terms of the price mix.</p> <p>  To pick up the Secretary General's point, we must balance the participation by keeping the system stable and functioning but also keeping it price competitive.</p> <p>  The offshore option is quite expensive.  The UK commissioned its largest offshore wind farm three weeks ago at a cost of &pound;140 to &pound;150 per megawatt hour.  That is a staggering number.  All kinds of promises are coming forward of reductions and falls in prices, but at the moment we have not seen those numbers coming to the market.  The UK prices are steep.</p> <p>  I am not sure I am giving the Senator a full answer.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities would have to look at how it revises the grid access policy so that we deal with smaller, more community based developers.  Again, the question will arise as to what is community.  Is it a farmer with 30 acres, or is it a group of people coming together in an area and aggregating what they can bring to the system?</p></speech>

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, can answer a little further, but we already have more than 200 sustainable energy communities.  Of those, 55 are developing large macro plans, looking at all the things they can do, including generation, efficiency, management and self-consumption.  The target of the SEAI is to grow that number to 500.  In many ways, that is taking the Tipperary energy model and growing it out.  Communities are going to need trusted intermediaries which they can go to and who talk with authority about energy issues and give advice.  Then again, that will have to be paid for, so how can that be structured into the system that pays for all the energy costs?</p></speech>

The Department's mitigation plan was a reaffirmation of the Government's commitment to carbon pricing as a core policy measure within climate policy.  There are two sides to carbon pricing: the emissions trading scheme, which is an EU level measure and, separately, there is carbon tax which is a national, domestic measure in the rest of the economy.</p> <p>  As the Secretary General mentioned, the ETS has recently undergone reform at EU level and a new directive was put in place earlier this year.  Member states have until autumn of next year to transpose that into domestic legislation.  As was mentioned, that reform is already starting to see some impact on prices within the ETS.  The participants in the scheme are starting to look towards the constraints that they will face over the next decade and that is staring to push prices up which, from a climate point of view, is a positive movement.</p> <p>  Overall, at EU level, the directive requires the ETS sector to reduce emissions by 43% on 2005 levels by 2030, so it is ambitious and a steep curve that the sector must achieve between now and 2030.</p> <p>  There is a separate commitment or measure in relation to carbon tax, which is a domestic measure, and I think the committee has already heard evidence on this point from both the advisory council and the ESRI.  The ESRI mentioned that it has done work for the Department of Finance over the last year on foot of a commitment in the mitigation plan to look at the potential impacts on increasing carbon tax.  Clearly the outcome of that work is a question for the budget and so the Department is not in a position to say anything about that today as it is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  That is giving effect to the commitment in the mitigation plan that was taken up by the Department of Finance when the plan was published last year.</p></speech>

As Mr. Manley said, the enduring connection policy is in place.  My understanding is that it was open for months and several gigawatts of new plants sought to connect in that period across a couple of hundred applications.  The issue is that grid capacity is scarce and that is why there will be difficulties in different areas.  From the ESB perspective, it tries to lead the demand, if it can, and build out capacity in advance of the requirement but there will always be difficult points where more people want to access the grid system than there is availability.  That is for the system operators in ESB Networks, and more so EirGrid, to objectively decide how they allocate that capacity.</p></speech>

The context is clear.  Moneypoint will transition away from coal by 2025.  That is policy, and that is what we are working towards.  It is complex because Moneypoint is the largest store of energy on this island.  The site can hold three months of energy on the island and it is, by a long way, the largest store of energy.  If there is a disruption in gas or anything like that, Moneypoint would be hugely valuable.  We need to factor that into our thinking in terms of the exact timing of it coming off the system.  It also is capable of providing 20% of our total amount.  More importantly, as a synchronous plants on the system, a plant which is synchronised with the frequency of the transmission system, it is very important in terms of acting as a counterbalance for the amount of intermittent power on the system.  One cannot run the system 100% on wind.  One needs some inertia on the system from big power plants.  That is the technology as it exists right now.  That might change in years to come.  It is a complex question as to when it comes off and how to choose the best time for it to come off.  The context of it is 2025 when it transitions away from coal.</p> <p>  There are options like maintaining a coal capability in the event that it might be needed but not plan to run it.  That is not a great option but it is an option nonetheless.  Could gas be put into the plant and replace it with gas plants?  What about a biomass plant?  The biggest coal plant in Great Britain, Drax power station, has converted to biomass.  There are many issues with that.  Could wind be put, either onshore or offshore, on the site?  The ESB is working through all those options now and talking to people down at the site.  It is not an easy question to address.</p> <p>  We are entering a new market structure on 1 October.  The Integrated Single Electricity Market, ISEM, goes live between Ireland and Great Britain from 1 October.  The first question we must ask of the old market participants, and not just the ESB, is what is the need for a new plant in that market?  Is there a need for a new plant and what does one do with Moneypoint in that context?</p> <p>  Those are the things that the ESB is considering right now.  It is not a simple question, but we have a period now to make sure we get it right because it is of huge importance to Ireland as well as the ESB.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1439" speakername="Ian Marshall" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018092600002#L01000"><p>I thank the witnesses for their thoroughly enjoyable presentations.  Like some of my colleagues, I would like to reference Ms Marie Donnelly's presentation last week which was really informative and it is certainly worth reading.</p> <p>  On the information provided by Mr. Griffin, obviously it is not going to be one solution that solves these problems, but it will be a combination of things and it is a case of trying to prioritise and put money where it is most wisely invested.  It is an approach of carrot and stick.</p> <p>  I was going to ask a question on investment in research and development in wave and tidal technology but it was touched on briefly.  We live on an island and it is not something that is researched and invested in heavily in other parts of the world because they do not have the access to tidal occurrence the way we have.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Shea made the point that close to one third of emissions are from agriculture.  Agriculture and agrifood are very close to my heart.</p><p>We must identify that agriculture is one of the villains of the piece, but it is also one of the few industries that can be part of the solution to the problem.  Its ability to sequester carbon is often overlooked.  Windmills, solar panels and other things cannot sequester carbon but agriculture can.</p><p> I was going to ask specifically about biomass, on which probably there is a difference of opinion.  There was reference to the nature of farm businesses and small isolated individual SMEs.  Has enough work been done on the potential of biomass?  Bearing in mind that we live in a temperate climate, with good access to water, we have an ability to grow the biomass sector.  We are well positioned to grow feed stock which can often be an alternative income source for a small farm business.  We are certainly well placed to do so, but sometimes biomass is overlooked.  We are doing some work in looking at products such as hemp that produce oil, protein and fibre.  We are also looking at biopolymers from hemp which can bioremediate and decontaminate soil.  Moreover, if one gives a small family farm an alternative crop to grow, all of a sudden there are social goods.  It is something we need to factor in.  </p><p> I am due to attend a meeting tonight which will look at the calculations for emissions from agriculture and whether we have them right.  It is often easy to jump at the easiest fix and if agriculture is a big offender, legislate hard against it.</p><p> On Mr. Sheer's piece, I will make two points.  I do not want to go over ground we have already covered.  Obviously, community ownership is key.  We are lagging light years behind our European counterparts in pursuing initiatives to encourage SME businesses to generate and sell power to their neighbours or adjacent businesses.  It is something about which I have always shouted and I am encouraged that the European Union has now referenced it and is making a point about it.  How do we use it as a catalyst?  There is probably a collegiate spirit and we merely need to put measures in place to make it happen.</p><p> On electric vehicles, when one lives in a rural environment, one does not have access to charging points.  It is a big problem.  The problem one will encounter is that as the uptake increases of electric vehicles, the first difficulty which will lead to it being dead in the water will be presented by access to charging points.  It is all well and good when one's life and work are based in Dublin, but in rural areas one has large distances to cover to access charging points.  Having enough of them is key.  In the past few days at a charging point I saw two or three vehicles waiting to use it.  If we do not provide adequate charging points, it will kill off the industry.</p><p> It is honourable and creditable that the intention is to move away from peat by 2030 and coal by 2025.  The Bord na M&oacute;na ambition to reach a figure of 75% for renewables by 2024 is creditable.  However, I am genuinely concerned about the commitment to deal with the 4,000 people in the midlands whose lives will be adversely affected.  I refer to the businesses and families who currently derive their income from the peat industry.  I am interested in learning more about what the transition will look like and the alternative business propositions for the people concerned.  It is one thing to say there will be a transition and a cessation of burning peat, but we have a responsibility to offer the people concerned alternatives and a long-term vision or strategy for a different business.</p></speech>

Through our community energy network of 200 member communities we are funding energy master plans which are looking at the options available.</p> <p>  Renewable energy is not an option for all.  It is about efficiency in the use of renewables and looking at the make-up of communities and what their particular energy needs are.  Through our smart grid programme we are funding research into the development of micro-grids.  It is looking at the legal, technical and economic complexities and all aspects of what it is to have many micro-generators in one area feeding in to the grid to meet needs in the area.  That option is being considered.  That supplements what Mr. Manley stated.</p> <p>  On electric vehicles, Senator Ian Marshall's observations are absolutely correct.  In some respects, they are not for everyone.  Certainly, they are more suited to the needs of an urban than a rural driver.  That is mostly related to the limitations on the range of the batteries.  Having said that - I am picking up on Senator Grace O'Sullivan's analogy with the mobile phone - electric vehicles bring with them a change of culture.  Charging will take place mainly at night in a driveway.  Rural dwellers have a advantage over many urban dwellers who live in terraced houses, etc.  SEAI is providing a grant, not only for new EV purchases but also for home charging points, both for new and second-hand purchases.  This means that motorists will be able to charge their cars at home at night while the car is idle.  The range of most new vehicles is heading towards 200 km or 250 km, although it might profess otherwise on the data sheet.  While electric vehicles are not compatible with everyone's life at present, they are increasingly becoming compatible.  In the note we provided for the committee we acknowledge that as the demand for electric vehicles grows - there has been a doubling of sales so far this year - infrastructure will have to be provided to meet it.  Much like the telephone networks, it will be an iterative process, but we see advances all the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.84" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018092600002#M00400"><p>I will continue on the electric vehicle theme, on which SEAI has started the discussion.  We have in place a low emissions vehicle task force which has done a considerable amount of work in that area.  There is a range of supports in place, with which the committee is probably familiar.  They include VRT relief of &euro;5,000, a purchase grant of &euro;5,000 for electric vehicles, a new grant of &euro;600 that we introduced at the start of the year to support the installation of a home charger, a benefit-in-kind rate of zero per cent for battery electric vehicles, a low motor tax rate, a grant of up to &euro;7,000 to support the use of electric vehicles which has been taken up by a number of taxi, hackney and limousine operators and a discount on tolls of 50% for BEVs and 25% for PHEVs.  There is a considerable amount of work ongoing in that space.  We are very conscious that moving from having 6,000 electric vehicles on the road to 500,000 by 2030 will require a further major transformation.  There is a lot of work to be done by the group in looking at issues such as the building regulations, the planning regulations and how, for example, one can attach an EV charging point to street lighting, etc.</p> <p>  On the home charger grant, to reflect the level of enthusiasm since the scheme was introduced, we have approved 740 applications.  Payment is pending in 209 cases, while 498 grants have been paid.  Therefore, there have been approximately 1,500 applications under a scheme that was introduced in January or February this year.  We have paid 21 grants to the NTA for use of electric vehicles in the taxi, hackney and limousine sector.</p> <p>  The point that charging infrastructure is critical is correct.  We understand a decision is likely to issue from the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities that will confirm in more detail the role of the ESB in respect of existing e-car infrastructure and provide greater clarity on how it will manage a programme of scale.  We have made provision in the &euro;500 million climate action fund for organisations to bid for EV charging infrastructure and expect a number of such applications in the first tranche.</p> <p>  Going back to the first point raised by the Senator on research and development, we have invested &euro;31 million in the ocean energy sector since 2013.  It has funded a number of schemes in counties Mayo, Galway and Cork, including the Galway Bay test site, the Atlantic marine renewable energy test site in County Mayo and the tank scale site in County Cork.</p><p>We have a further &euro;4.75 million to be spent on ocean energy research in 2018.  If one broadens it out into the research programmes more generally, the SEAI has done a lot of research on the prototype development scheme.  There is a new behavioural economics unit in place in the SEAI, which will be really important in creating the shift and dealing with some of the inertia that exists in terms of moving to some of the new technologies.  We have an internal energy research budget ourselves and we fund a substantial research programme for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  We are not short of money.  We remain very committed to ensuring that we are at the cutting edge.  We work very closely with academic institutions on the research agenda generally.</p><p> On Bord na M&oacute;na and the just transition, I know for a fact that the new chair and CEO are acutely conscious of that and they either have or will shortly bring to the board a proposal for what Bord na M&oacute;na might look like in 2030 when it is shifting out of the peat business in the coming years.  If he is looking at the transmission of this meeting, Tom Donnellan, the CEO, probably will not thank me for saying it but Bord na M&oacute;na is hugely involved in that process.  As an organisation that will be very deeply affected by the carbon transition, it might be no harm to ask Bord na M&oacute;na in for a chat to see what it is doing because there is a lot of creative thinking about how to harness the natural resources and use people who have been involved in energy in the midlands to see how the organisation might look in the next decade, post a transition to a lower-carbon Bord na M&oacute;na.</p><p> On the biomass issue, Bord na M&oacute;na is very involved in investigating how to increase the indigenous biomass supply.  It is looking at agricrops, principally willow, forestry by-products, including thinnings and branch pulpwood, as the main sources of biomass material.  All the biomass used by Bord na M&oacute;na is fully in compliance with EU sustainability standards.  The pressure remains to get the supply chain right and how one builds a domestic biomass capacity to ensure that in time, one is not reliant on imports because the imports themselves have a carbon impact.  Bord na M&oacute;na is looking at a whole suite of issues.</p><p> We have our own bioenergy plan.  Deputies Eamon Ryan and Catherine Martin tabled a number of parliamentary questions in recent days as to where we stand on that.  Mr. Manley will speak a little about it.  There has been a number of very significant developments on the biomass and bioenergy front since that plan was originally conceived.  We want to ensure that the plan that emerges ultimately makes sense, as it will have to be part of the feed-in to the national energy and climate plan.</p><p> Another big thing that is happening in terms of biomass and renewable heat is the SSRH.  I am not sure what the acronym stands for.</p></speech>

We have Government approval for it now and we published the first part of it, which is a grant scheme, at the start of September.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.88" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter O'Shea" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018092600002#N00400"><p>I will speak briefly on transport.  The ESB's ecar business is responsible for operating, developing and rolling out the ecar charging network.  Its analysis from operating the network in recent years indicates that the vast majority of charging for electric vehicles will be done at home rather than at public charging points.  However, there is a really big caveat in that regard, because in order to build confidence among the public that they will not get caught with range anxiety, we need to have the charging network.  That goes back to the question from the Chair at the very outset, in the sense that a lot of the chargers are required to be there but they might not be used on a 100% basis.</p> <p>  In terms of biomass and biofuels generally, we see biofuels as having an important part to play within the energy mix in Ireland in the years to come.  The development of both biogas and biomass has attractions for the agriculture sector.  I note, however, that when one sees the word "bio" in front of fuel, it means it will be scarce because of the development around it.  One positive thing from Europe with the new renewable package is that there have been questions and concerns about whether biomass is genuinely renewable.  The latest directives in Europe put very strict sustainability criteria against biomass to ensure it is genuinely renewable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.89" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018092600002#N00500"><p>I welcome the witnesses from the ESB, the Department and the SEAI.  Mr. Griffin mentioned that communities have to be at the heart of it.  I come from the midlands and I agree that we need wind energy but question the approach of the Government and companies driving the wind farm industry in my area.  We must take a responsible approach but the opposite has been the case in the Department's approach.  There has been a failure to bring forward guidelines for wind farms or to put any kind of regulatory framework in place for the location of wind farms.  In the meantime, the wind farm industry has been allowed to steamroll over communities and to drop large turbines, up to 170 m in height, right around counties such as Laois and Offaly.  From what Mr. Griffin said today I welcome the fact that communities will be at the heart of it.  It is good news if we are going to change that approach.  I will leave the committee happy this evening.  Could Mr. Griffin elaborate on the issue?</p> <p>  In terms of the midlands and the just transition, as a former employee of Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB I have a particular interest in the issue, as do many people in my constituency who work in both companies.  I am genuinely concerned about the situation.  I do not see even an outline plan in place for what will happen after 2030.  It is almost 2019 now.  Mr. Griffin should not take what I said about the wind farm guidelines personally, but the Department has failed.  Four Ministers have also failed in that regard.  We are on the fifth Minister now.  I do not know whether the failure lies with the Ministers or the civil servants or if it is a combination of both.  Could Mr. Griffin outline why we cannot have wind farm guidelines?  My view is we do not have them because somebody wants to allow wind farm developers to put wind farms in place and then to close the door once the horse has bolted.  That is what it looks like and that is how communities and county councillors see it in areas that are affected.  It is not just councillors from the party I represent, Sinn F&eacute;in, but those from all parties.</p> <p>  In terms of peat and 2030, I do not see any plan in place.  I pass the power station in Edenderry almost on a weekly basis.  The same is true of west Offaly, Ferbane and Lanesborough.  I do not see any plan to create a biomass industry for those power stations.  There are limitations.  Reference was made to the scarcity of biofuels.  We must be careful with them.  We do have potential for biogas.  The ESB mentioned that.  I understand it is starting to look seriously at the option now.  We have a significant agriculture sector, which is not a bad thing, but we also have a significant amount of agricultural waste and that is a problem.  From talking to people who have developed plants, in particular the one in Nurney, I believe we have an opportunity for jobs, to reduce greenhouse gas emission and to get money into rural communities.  This could be a win-win situation if we develop the biogas industry.</p> <p>  To go back to power stations and the transition, we accept that the willow scheme was not a success.  There is a lot of marginal land in areas around the power stations.</p><p>What trials are being done in, for example, north Offaly where there is a large amount of marginal land?  I have heard references in this meeting and other meetings of this committee to people being retrained to work in other parts of the energy sector.  A person who is 45 or 50 years of age and has been driving a tractor for Bord na M&oacute;na for the last 20 years may not be up for being retrained for retrofit work on housing schemes and so on.  It may not be easy to do that.  My view - I said this to Bord na M&oacute;na - is that the transition is not happening at sufficient speed.</p><p> On electric vehicles, as mentioned already the anxiety is around range.  For people living in rural areas, the electric car is not an option at this point.  Also, I would not be happy to charge an electric vehicle at night if I thought that the energy being used to do it was coming from the interconnector from Britain, generated by nuclear power or by coal from Moneypoint because that could make things worse.  There are a number of parts to this puzzle.  There is no point in everybody driving around in electric vehicles if the energy being used to power them is being generated by dirty coal or nuclear power.  I ask the witnesses to address that issue in terms of the transition.  Another serious concern is that the charging network does not yet exist.  The ESB is currently providing it free of charge but that cannot continue because it is a commercial semi-State company.  I ask the witnesses for the SEAI and the Department to set out the plan for a comprehensive electric vehicle charging system throughout the State because we need a plan if this is to work.  </p><p>On schools and farm buildings, three years ago my parliamentary assistant and I went to see the co-operative wind farm model in Templederry, County Tipperary.  On the journey there we noted as we passed the valley that a large agricultural shed, covering approximately an acre and a half, was being erected.  We stopped to take a closer look.  I recall saying to my assistant that the shed presented a great opportunity for a solar panel.  I am sure some Department provided grant aid for that shed, which is fine.  I have no problem with that.  There are many new schools in my constituency, for which I have already credited the Government.  Almost every school in Portlaoise is new and all of them have large south facing flat roofs, particularly Scoil Bhr&iacute;de which opened recently, but not one of them has a solar panel.  Where is the joined up thinking from Government?  Is it that Ministers are not knocking heads or that the Secretaries Generals of Departments are not communicating?  What is happening?  I have heard it said that we will be generating power when it is not needed.  Over the next six months, from winter to spring, all of our schools will require heating.  If we install solar panels on school roofs and there is a spillover during the summer, we can turn them off.  There are solar panels on buildings in India and Spain where the sun beams at between 40o to 45o Celsius and they are able to manage it.  They use this power to heat water and so on during the day and it can be banked and used in other ways.  If it can be done in those countries, where it is about twice or three times as hot as it is here, surely we can do it here where we have a moderate climate.  I do not buy the excuse that we would be generating power that is not needed. Why are we not putting solar panels on our school roofs?  </p><p> I met the IFA today at its annual lobby, as I am sure did all members here.  For the first time ever, one of the issues on its shortlist of requests which it puts to Deputies at budget time was support for renewable energy.  It has moved on this issue.  That is a step in the right direction.  What is happening at departmental and SEAI level?   I ask that the ESB witness address the issue of charging points.</p></speech>

We have been trying to reach a resolution on this matter for a long time.  It is a commitment of the programme for Government in 2016.  In June of last year, we agreed and published a new approach in terms of wind energy development.  This involves a more stringent noise limit consistent with World Health Organization standards and a more robust noise monitoring regime to ensure compliance with the standards.  We will move from a guideline setback distance of 500 m to a visual amenity setback of four times the turbine height between a wind turbine and the nearest residential property, subject to a mandatory minimum.  This is a move from a guideline to a mandatory requirement.  It also involves the elimination of shadow flicker and the introduction of new obligations in regard to engagement with local communities on the provision of community benefit.  The hard part was getting to a point where we believed we had a suite of measures in place that would address the concerns that local communities expressed around shadow flicker, noise and setback and amenity impact.  While this work was ongoing, a European Court of Justice decision issued stating that a strategic environmental assessment, SEA, would be required for the amendments to the 2006 guidelines.  We had not anticipated that an SEA would be required but we expect this work to be completed in 2019 and the new guidelines will be in place at that point.</p> <p>  I assure the Deputy that there was no conspiracy on the part of the Department or the Minister.  There are many matters about which the Minister expresses frustration to officials in the Department.  This is one he comes back to time and again because he struggles to understand why it is taking so long to finalise.  As I said, we now have agreed guidelines that we believe will work and allay the concerns of local communities.  The commitment to the model exists.  The next step is to complete the SEA process, which is being conducted by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  That Department, which has responsibility for the wind energy guidelines, is moving that process through the system as quickly as possible.  The advantage of an SEA process is that it will give the public a further opportunity for input.  I appreciate and fully accept the Deputy's frustration.  We know it is an issue for local communities throughout the country.  I reiterate that there is no attempt on our part to make this process any longer or any more onerous that it has been thus far.  </p> <p>  On the transition in regard to Lough Ree, west Offaly and Edenderry, I know from conversations with the chairman and the CEO of Bord na M&oacute;na that they are working to find a model for the company that will work post 2030 and, as mentioned by the Deputy, takes account of the fact that there are people who drive a truck who do not necessarily want and are not in a position to be retrained.  A huge amount of work has been already done.  I am not clear where Bord na M&oacute;na is at in terms of its internal processes.  I do not know if the board or staff have been briefed.  In terms of just transition, this is an area that is deeply affected.</p><p>In terms of the economic development of the midlands, the company is important to the region.  It is a clear example of an organisation that is thinking hard about the effect of a just transition, whether it can expand further into those sectors in which it is currently involved that are not peat or carbon related, and what new initiatives it can pursue using existing natural resources.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.96" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter O'Shea" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018092600002#P00300"><p>A question was asked about the electricity used to power an EV's battery.  I put together some numbers last year that I shared with several people, and I would be happy to share them with the committee as well.  With the current electricity mix of 27% renewable power and the remainder gas and coal, how efficient is it in terms of carbon produced per kilometre to drive an EV compared with a vehicle that has an internal combustion engine?  The numbers show that it is almost twice as efficient.  As the 27% figure grows to 40% by 2020, the ratio gets even better.  As we move to a fully decarbonised electricity system, the ratio falls away because the battery's power has become fully decarbonised.</p> <p>  The same numbers apply to electric heating.  If someone installs a heat pump, it will be just short of twice as efficient carbon-wise with the current electricity mix.  There are a range of reasons behind that, but it is important to reflect on the fact that the power going into the batteries or heat pumps makes them a more efficient carbon answer than the existing fossil fuel alternative.</p></speech>

That figure might be substantially greater when driving in a rural environment.  As Mr. O'Shea stated, there is a significant saving on energy with the current electricity mix.</p> <p>  Regarding solar panels in schools, the Deputy dismissed the occupancy issue, but a fact of schools is that they have high occupancy levels from September through to May or June.  During July and August, they are at virtually zero occupancy.  Many schools have no occupancy at night.</p></speech>

Separately, the building regulations will shortly be subject to revision and the concept of near-zero energy buildings will formally be introduced as part of the energy performance of buildings directive.  Under its principle of cost optimality, a full cost-benefit analysis is done of what is the best technology to bring a building to virtually zero energy use and zero carbon emissions.  Depending on a building's use, it results in certain prioritisations.  This applies not just to schools, but to all commercial buildings.  The prioritisation will decide the best mix of technologies and how to make buildings more efficient.</p> <p>  More so than other technologies, it is relatively easy to retrofit buildings with PV panels if the business case improves, but it is not always the case that it is commercially sensible to invest in PV for schools.  No different than any other large property owner, the Department of Education and Skills has to make decisions about how to use its budget sensibly.</p></speech>

No more than anything else, it is a commercial enterprise.  What is being sought is what is referred to as a tariff, that is, a price.  Opposed to the commercial price of electricity, some people will need a support price.  We will see more in that regard after the outcome of the next renewable energy auction scheme when questions about how solar feeds into this situation, how much of it will be commercial and utility scale and how much will be small scale have become evident.  When I spoke earlier, I referred primarily to wind power in the context of microgeneration and community generation.  Solar will have a role in that regard as well.</p> <p>  Other than planning regulations, there is nothing stopping anyone from putting panels on roofs.  If someone wants to have the capacity to sell that power into the market, though, a major market redesign will be required because our market is not configured to facilitate that currently.</p></speech>

The gist of what he was saying is that there is not a need for an additional body.  How do the existing bodies entice or mandate actions?  Is their work made available to the public?  How can that information be accessed?  I am unsure about whether it is available, but perhaps it is.  What powers do those bodies have and what can they do?</p> <p>  What is the Department specifically doing to ensure Ireland meets its 2020 or 2030 targets?  We have heard much about what the EU is doing, has planned and is putting in place, but we have not heard anything concrete about what is happening in Ireland.  What can the Department with responsibility for climate action do legislatively to make changes happen, for example, to make offshore wind energy generation possible?  I do not want to know what the Department with responsibility for the environment or whatever is doing, I want to know what Mr. Griffin's Department can do.</p> <p>  Mr. Griffin stated, "The structure of Ireland's economy, involving dispersed population settlement, car-based commuting and the central role of agriculture in the rural economy, requires the Government to balance economic and societal objectives with the imperative to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions."  Will he expand on that point and explain what he means?  How will rural Ireland fit into the climate change agenda that he mentioned?  There is no mention of rural Ireland in any of the outcomes.</p> <p>  My question for the ESB may have been answered.  It stated that there is no barrier to the connection of a single house's renewable power to the grid.  Later, however, it stated that there is by indicating that there is no tariff.  What is the situation?  I had another question for the ESB, but I cannot remember it.</p></speech>

As for the arrangements that are in place, I mentioned a group of senior officials on infrastructure and climate action, a Cabinet committee on infrastructure and climate action, and the high-level group that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, chairs.  This group specifically monitors delivery of the national mitigation plan and looks at what is happening in the national adaptation framework, at progress being made on the 12 sectoral plans spread across several Departments, and considers inputs from the Climate Change Advisory Council as well as inputs from the Departments at various stages of the year in relation to resource requirements.  For climate action, we fed into the development of the national development plan which has been approved by Government as the key underpinning document for delivering a substantial investment under the national development plan of approximately &euro;22 billion in climate measures and approximately &euro;8.6 billion in sustainable development.</p><p> We work closely across Government.  There is a myth that has permeated that Departments operate in silos, but that is not the case at all.  We work closely with colleagues at all levels in our organisations to ensure what the Government commits to achieving under a programme for Government, a national plan or a national mitigation plan, is delivered.  I struggle to see what a new or existing independent body would do over and above the structures that are there and that are clearly mandated by Government, which we are accountable to Government for delivering on.</p></speech>

Until last year, one Minister reported on behalf all Ministers, but all Ministers with responsibilities for sectors are now required to report to the Oireachtas on an annual basis.</p></speech>

My colleague was good enough to prompt me on the last bit.  What we can do is set out for the committee what the governance structures are.  We will make an assessment of our view of how that covers the basis that was in the first recommendation from the Citizens' Assembly.</p> <p>  On the 2020 and 2030 targets, we have published our national mitigation plan, which sets out 60 measures, 40 of which are under development.  We can provide the committee with a copy of that as well, which may be helpful.  The national development plan, already in the public domain, sets out the range of climate and energy measures that will be delivered over the period of the national development plan.</p> <p>  On energy efficiency and renewable energy in relation to the transport and agriculture sectors, all of that is there.  The legislation is again a function of Government, which approved a general scheme of a Bill and mandated the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to bring forward the legislation, and I understand it was the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny in the Oireachtas at some point.  We are in dialogue with that Department about progressing the Bill to the next Stages.  We are also a member of the marine planning group chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, which looks at the general issue of how our marine sector can contribute to Ireland's economic development, and the Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill is a point of discussion at that committee from time to time.  We input to that process as well.</p> <p>  What we need to do to meet the various targets for 2020 and 2030, and how we will do it - building on the national mitigation and the national development plans - will be set out in the national energy and climate plan to be finalised by the end of next year.</p></speech>

This offshore wind issue has been ongoing since approximately 2014, and the legislation needs to be updated.  As the Department with responsibility for climate change, does it see that as a problem in dealing with climate change issues?  We are now in 2018, which is four or five years down the line, and it will be another couple of years before it will be dealt with.  Does the Department see that as an issue?  I am not asking Mr. Griffin to call his colleagues in the Department into disrepute but I ask if he sees it as a problem.</p></speech>

It is a number of years off because of the cost of the technology, rather than whether a consenting process is in place.  There are a number of schemes that have already consented, which got consent under existing foreshore legislation.  There is nothing to prevent them from a consenting process moving forward, but I pointed out earlier there is still a significant difference between the cost of the megawatt-hour support that is required for onshore wind as compared with offshore wind, but we expect it to converge somewhat over the next number of years.</p></speech>

If one looks at Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions, approximately 28% of our emissions is from the emissions trading system, ETS, sector while approximately 72% is from the non-ETS sector.  The rest of the EU, by comparison, breaks down as approximately 45% and 55%, respectively.  If one does a deeper dive, looking at the non-ETS sector, which is the bit with which we struggle most, approximately 46% of the emissions in Ireland was from agriculture, according to the 2015 figures.  In the EU 28, the non-ETS sector makes up approximately 18% from agriculture.</p><p>We have a very different challenge to address in terms of how we deal with rural Ireland, with the agricultural sector and with that sort of trade-off between addressing the climate challenges and the whole issue of food security, the impact on rural Ireland and jobs in rural Ireland, which is obviously something the Government has to reflect on.</p></speech>

The first element was the microgenerators, which are small generators, typically up to 6 kW on a single phase.  That is equivalent to probably 20 solar panels, that fall under our notify and fit scheme.  One has to notify ESB that one intends to install these.  There will be an interaction with the ESB around standards, and ensuring that the scheme is okay.  It is not an interaction as to whether the capacity is there, typically, to take that. </p> <p>  Where there is scarce capacity for larger windfarms or larger solar farms, that goes through the standard enduring connection process that I mentioned earlier.  It is in that standard enduring connection process that there may be scarcity in terms of the capacity available on the system.  We try to build out the system in advance, to ensure that the capacity is there but in some circumstances, if one has a number of generators looking to connect at a particular location, that capacity might be scarce.  That is typically when one is talking in megawatt numbers.  In the first scheme one is talking in kilowatt numbers, in the second scheme one is talking in megawatt numbers.</p></speech>

There will be investments in energy efficiency on commercial and public building stock and supports for changing from oil-fired boilers.  There are all of the renewable energy supports with the transport investment and so on.  What we will do now as part of the work feeding into the national energy and climate plan is take that detailed assessment that Mr. Scheer and the people working with him in the SEAI and the transport research and modelling group, TRAM, have done and see exactly where that level of investment positions us in terms of meeting our 2020 targets.  The whole purpose of the national energy and climate plan is to look at sensible things that have been included in the national mitigation plan, at self-evident measures that have been included in the national development plan which would give a very significant carbon reduction dividend, and then make that assessment as to what additional mitigation measures may need to be included to ensure that the target that we have set for 2030 is achievable.</p></speech>

I believe the prudent course is, as we have set out, to assess the impact of the national development plan measures and the flexibilities that are included in the effort-sharing regulation and the impact of each individual measure in the national mitigation plan and then draw conclusion as to whether that will fully meet the 2030 target - I do not expect it will.  We will see then what additional measures we need to bring forward, whether it is in the nature of further investment, or regulation, or taxation to plug the gaps that will arise on the various targets we have set out.</p></speech>

We are going to need a hell of a bigger boat to tackle climate change, and Mr. Griffin has a critical position in that regard.  Our job is to help him in this way.  I agree with Mr. Griffin's own Minister when he says that the mitigation plan is not working and is a failure.  The national development plan is facing entirely in the wrong direction in that there are plans for some 65 major new motorway and national roads; allowing peat to be burned until 2030 is a climate crime; agriculture emissions are rising under that plan; there are no plans or legislation for plastics recycling or the development of a circular economy; and, there is no forestry plan.  I could go on to each and every sector.  I have a real problem with where we are.  The question is that none of us would want to start from here.  I ask the question because I believe that there should be an honest assessment of the national development plan and a realisation it is not fit for purpose in climate targets.  It is going to have to change as part of our submission to the national energy climate action plan, the first draft of which has to be done by Christmas.  We have a role in that and we want to open it up and see what we can do to help.  Can Mr. Griffin present this committee a copy of the first report of the Project Ireland 2040 delivery group issued to Government last week?  Could we have access to that report?</p></speech>

The important thing is that when the national development plan was published, we had not yet finished the negotiations on the renewable energy directive.  We were still in trilogue with the European Parliament on targets.</p></speech>

In each of those European packages, I saw the files coming from Brussels, and in each case we were fighting it, which makes me believe that Europe is not going to be easy for us in this whole process.  We are going to have a tough job to explain to the Commission what we are doing.  If Mr. Griffin's Department would like to see the circular economy developing maybe his Department might stop fighting the waste reduction Bill, which I think helps us, and has been sitting there for the last year.</p><p>I will ask one other question.

I will respond to the Deputy's point, because I do not think it was a fair reflection of what the Department was doing at EU level.  In discussions at EU level, we have always made the point that what emerges has to be fair, achievable, affordable and cost effective.  That is a duty-----</p></speech>

I could go through each file and paper line by line and show the amendments that we tried to make.  They were all seen in the European climate community as regressive and gave Ireland the same reputation as Poland.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach himself said when he spoke to the European Parliament at the start of the year that we were a laggard.  The definition of laggard means slow progress.  I am not denying that there has been slow progress but there is a whole range of reasons why progress has been slow over the last number of years.  When we set our targets in 2009 it was just ahead of the biggest economic recession that this State experienced.  Unemployment went from just over 4% to 15.6% and GDP plummeted.  It is important to make these points because members are making sweeping statements.  We had to ensure that when we came out of the processes on effort sharing regulation, that the demands on the Irish economy and the Irish people were fair, achievable, affordable and cost effective.</p></speech>

My perspective is that this can be good for the Irish economy.  This is not easy and other countries are not that good either.  It is a difficult process.  I have a question for the ESB.  The Government's package is a good one and this national climate and energy plan structure is right because it says we have to think 30 years in advance.  We have to think big and that we will be doing 20 GW of offshore and 5 GW of interconnection.  A million homes are going to have to be retrofitted and we are going to have to spend &euro;5 billion on social homes.  It is that kind of big thinking.  We have to stop thinking about whether we can do just about the minimum so that we can get away with scraping in.  To back up what I have been saying, according to Professor John FitzGerald, who is a fair and neutral observer, we are completely off course and heading rapidly in the wrong direction.  Between now and Christmas is when we need to turn the entire thinking with a Whitaker-Lemass moment.  To be honest, I did not hear or feel it here today.  I hope we can work together during the next three months to turn it into an ambition that we then can turn into a reality.  There are all sorts of uncertainties, and Mr. Griffin has a tough job, but we should be ambitious.</p></speech>

When I talk about how we position the negotiations at EU level I think we were being fair - recognising where we are starting from.  That does not mean in 2030 that I want to see Ireland again saying that we have not achieved a target.  I can assure members that there is a huge commitment at Government level to ensure that what we have agreed to EU level, both on renewable energy and effort sharing regulation and ETS, will be delivered.  We have some of the building blocks in place such as the national mitigation plan, the national adaptation framework and the national development plan.  The circular economy will plug into this now that we have a better understanding of what is emerging from that.  We will be tested rigorously on this and not just at national level by the Oireachtas but by the European Commission.  We also will be rigorously tested to ensure that what we produce in the national energy and climate plan can deliver by 2030.  If we look at the way that it is structured, we will be reviewed regularly on progress on renewable energy and energy efficiency and climate targets by the European Commission.  There are measures in there to make sure that if we do not comply, then we will suffer accordingly.</p></speech>

It is difficult to predict what is going to happen in 2050 and that is what we are trying to do here.  I would love the ESB to present other experts.  I acknowledge the P&ouml;yry consultancy produced this report and is very credible, but what energy expert believes that biomass in power generation is going to be the real future?  That is particularly the case in recent years when the cost of alternative renewables have plummeted.  It is all about interconnection - which was not mentioned - and storage.  I would love to see carbon capture and storage, CCS, happening but look at the cost of renewables plummeting.  CCS is not happening anywhere at scale.  Will the ESB present some other energy experts who think that biomass in power generation makes sense for Ireland?  I would love to compare that with some of the international think tanks that I could bring in that would say that is cuckoo.</p> <p>  The ESB stated that State intervention and support was needed for power stations for EV vehicles.  I agree fully with that.  How much would Mr. O'Shea spend on that?  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, is next door.  I am going to go into him now.  How much should I be asking for and what should he spend that on?</p></speech>

It is a number of small tens of millions to deal with the fast-charging networks.  That is where I would spend it - on the motorways and the main thoroughfares.  As I mentioned earlier, analysis from our EV business unit, ecars, indicates that the vast majority of charging will be done at home rather than on journeys.  I would spend it on the fast-charging network on motorways but I would also spend it on revamping the existing set of public chargers.  It is a relatively small expenditure in the overall scale of discussing billions of euro of transition costs across the entire energy sector.  This is a small piece of it.</p></speech>

Our analysis indicates that we need to maintain some form of balancing power on the system to balance out renewables.  Our 2050 position is that we see renewables grow to 50% by the middle of the next decade and, beyond that, up to around 65% or 70% when we get towards the 2040 and 2050 mark.  Many of the roadmaps we have looked at - I will refer to Mr. John Lawlor on UCC - but I am pretty sure that the UCC roadmap has biomass as a key part-----</p></speech>

UCC is expert in this area and that roadmap has biomass in it.  Are there issues with biomass?  Yes, there are.  There is no doubt about that.  From the perspective of Ireland Inc. and the options we have, we are not going to have nuclear and there are issues with biomass but it will contribute somewhat, although it will not deliver the balance of power that we need.  That is where we come to CCS as being a technology which has not had the investment we would like to have seen happening over the past ten years or so.  We think that increasingly, it will be required because there will be a requirement to have relatively large-scale high-inertia plant on the system to balance out the intermittent renewables.  Technology could change.  There might be major advances in power electronics that would allow a larger scale of intermittent sources of power on the system but that is not where we are right now.</p> <p>  There was a question in this committee 18 months ago about what our long-term ambition might be.  The chief executive of EirGrid mentioned 75% a level of intermittency to which he could see a pathway.  At that time, 18 months ago, EirGrid was at 60% and has since got up to 65%.  He said we could see a pathway to 75% but could not see a pathway beyond that at that point.  It has now gone as far as 65%.  We need to get to 75% to deliver an average of 50% of renewables on the system.  It is a big requirement.  We are at the leading edge of this in Ireland, and are very proud of that, but there is a requirement for us to look at how are we going to make up the last leg of this race.  We think Ireland, uniquely, has a requirement for CCS compared with the rest of Europe.  As we do not have large-scale hydro or nuclear power, we do not have the options other European countries have. </p></speech>

I was in and out because it is a busy day on a Wednesday.</p><p>I apologise if some of the questions have been asked.  Last week, I asked around retrofitting.  Does the current quality of retrofitting match European standards and is it future-proofed so we do not have to redo the project?  What are the present standards around new builds in the context of climate proofing?</p><p> On a question for the Department on public buildings, what spark can it deliver to try to future-proof all capital investment around climate change?  As the Chair mentioned, new schools are being built that will probably require retrofitting and there is an acceleration of capital investment.  When will the Department be able to tell the Oireachtas that it is climate-proofing everything that is happening around public investment?  Is a legislative framework required for that, given it is a complex piece?  It has to happen if we are to flip the balance around this.  The expected continuous capital investment will require proper climate-proofing.  The witnesses might answer those questions.</p></speech>

To date, through our schemes, some 360,000 homes have been retrofitted and the State has invested &euro;460 million in those retrofits.  On a scale, this would be deemed to be from shallow to moderate retrofit, given most of the schemes have taken a relatively piecemeal approach - it could be anything like an attic insulation or wall insulation, or combinations thereof.</p> <p>  More recently, we introduced a deep retrofit scheme that is looking at precisely the measure referred to by Deputy Chambers, which is how to take the home as a holistic energy system, look at its precise needs and decide what is the most appropriate solution.  We are investigating how to bring homes up to an A3 rating or better from what can be a poor starting point such as a G rating.  It requires a significant investment and can range from &euro;5,000, &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 all the way up to between &euro;50,000 and &euro;70,000 for deep retrofit.  We are supporting that currently with grant schemes offering in the region of 50%.  We have 36 projects approved so far and these will demonstrate what is possible.  However, it is not only the technical solution that it is necessary to unlock.  First, there is the willingness of people to make that investment, and we are doing this analysis through our behavioural economics team to discover the triggers for people to make this investment, rather than making the investment in, say, aesthetic aspects of their home or holidays or cars, given there are always competing priorities.  The other point is to look at how this is financed.  If it was to proceed, the State would have to invest in all those homes at a cost of &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 each.  We need to look at how to unlock low interest finance for those who can afford to finance this sort of activity.  We are engaged in a number of pilot programmes with the banks and credit unions to find what are the trusted lenders in this sphere.</p> <p>  Of course, what this also points to is there is no silver bullet.  Had that silver bullet been around, I presume Mr. Griffin and many others would have liked to have had it many moons ago, but there is none.  It will be a case of trying to find the many combinations that work in different environments.  All along, we will have to be conscious of the energy poor sector, those who are incapable of affording this, who will have to be brought along.  That will probably have to be 100% subvented by the State, as it currently is.</p></speech>

Where are we on that?  I believe that will be the thing that will flip the domestic behavioural economics whereby the home or a group of homes within an estate can become an export unit.  This would say to people that not only would they have no bill, but they would be able to export onto a grid.</p></speech>

It should be said that the new regulations coming in next year not only bring in near zero as an energy performance requirement for new build - Ireland's building regulations have been advanced all along - but they also bring in the requirement that if a person is renovating more than 25% of a building, they will have to move it to at least a B rating.  That means that as soon a people attack a house for renovations, for example, to put on a conservatory, develop an attic or build over a garage, they are starting to get into the space where the entire home has to be treated as an energy system.  In time, it will come to a point where people will be chasing additional sources of income through being energy positive but, in the first case, the incentive is to get the builds down to a near zero rating.  Moving a person to a point where they ask whether they are prepared to invest that level of money and wait 20 or 30 years for the payback, if they are not getting incentives, is a harder nut to crack.</p></speech>

When Ms Marie Donnelly was before the committee last week, she talked about dealing with the problem of new houses and said we must "stop the leak".  I would like to reiterate that point.  We are putting carbon into new houses at a time when we do not need to because the energy efficiency of those new houses is so good that they definitely do not need anything other than a heat pump to heat them.</p> <p>  In respect of being able to have houses that can export excess generation onto the grid, commercially, ESB is the only supplier we know of that provides any sort of scheme that does that, although it is currently closed.  I would like to make clear, however, that ESB receives no money for the generation that it pays people to provide it.  It is a service we provide.  We pay people but we get no money back.  The systems in place are not in place for us to get paid for that electricity.  Under the renewable electricity directive, there is an obligation that we all must end up putting in place systems that will allow parties who export their excess electricity onto the grid to be paid a reasonable rate.  That puts a timeline on a solution to this problem being found, which I believe is by the end of 2020, when the directive comes into force and into national legislation.  That will effectively put a timeline on resolution of this problem because we will have to have our systems in place to facilitate that.  It is clear that smart meters will be a key element in the delivery and in terms of paying people appropriately for their excess generation.</p></speech>

Mr. Manley will talk about what we are doing in respect of energy efficiency in the public sector, and there are a lot of good things to say about that.  There is then the flip side to that, which has more to do with the adaptation end and how we climate proof infrastructure.  I will ask Dr. O'Neill to comment on that.</p></speech>

We are currently at about 20% and we are making good progress.  One of the things the Department has been concerned about is putting energy efficiency centre stage in public bodies.  Understandably, people in the justice sector are concerned about justice rather than the buildings they occupy, and the same goes for education and healthcare.</p><p> Last year, the Government approved a new programme on public sector energy efficiency.  A large part of the programme focuses on governance and making sure that everybody in the public sector has an energy performance officer and reports regularly on what is being achieved.  That is part of the governance, the structure and the reporting but we also matched that with funding.  Between last year and this year we have provided &euro;14 million to the Office of Public Works, OPW, which is again looking at pilot projects.  I am sorry to keep using the term "pilot project" because I know it sounds like one is sampling.  The reality is we are testing many new techniques for our building supply chains and building experiences.  Traditional building methodologies were very forgiving.  If a door was a little too wide the surrounding lintel was so strong that it held up everything.  Many of the new technologies are very technically specific.  They must be installed and maintained expertly.  Building that capacity within the system is really important.  That is why there has been a heavy focus on the pilot phase, certainly in 2017-18 and possibly into next year.</p><p> We are on a good trajectory.  There is a specific provision in the national development plan for public buildings but I forgot to bring a copy with me.  I cannot remember the number but I have no problem relaying it to the clerk of the committee.  There is a reorientation.  In fact, the Government has endorsed a new strategy whereby every single body must report on where it is at.  The Secretary General has found the relevant page, which states there will be investment in energy efficiency of existing commercial and public building stock with a target of all public buildings and at least one third of total commercial premises being upgraded to building energy rating, BER, of B over the life cycle of the plan.</p></speech>

It was just to talk about the other side of what Mr. Griffin said in terms of climate proofing from the adaptation side.  That is a key challenge for the sectors.  We mentioned that we have 12 sectors under seven Departments.  On the energy and the gas network side, the issue is not only decarbonisation but also how to make infrastructure climate resilient into the future in terms of the impacts of climate change.  All sectors, including transport and agriculture, must think about this, as must the local authorities in terms of the plans they will have.  There is that kind of drip-down from the national side to the regional and local sides.  Every decision must take climate resilience into consideration.</p></speech>

The Department is investing in trying to roll out more charge stations across the city, which is welcome.  On the issue of pipeline battery technology, in ten years the battery capacity of an electric car will probably be greater than the current combustion model.  Do we need to run an economic model on our investment in the battery points?  Most people will probably utilise more energy efficient battery charging at home.  Should we try to incentivise home charging as much as charging points for electric cars?  It is important that we encourage the purchase of electric cars.  However, within ten to 15 years the fuel station will be in big trouble but so will the electric charge points on which we will probably spend a significant amount of money.</p></speech>

I apologise in advance if I repeat some of the questions.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about the new nearly zero energy building standard that will apply from the end of the year.  It is necessary to build large numbers of houses and we have plans to do so.  This is the topic of conversation every day.   How much per unit will achieving the new building standard add to the cost of building the various types of housing, from private dwellings such as four-bedroom semi-detached houses to social housing?  What additional costs must we budget for to ensure we meet the new standard?</p> <p>  Many people have retrofitted and made their houses more energy efficient.  In terms of carbon taxes, what will happen to households that have heavily invested in making their houses more carbon efficient and less reliant on carbon?  Some people may consider going off grid and becoming self-sufficient rather than taking electricity from the national grid.  There are different ways to become self-sufficient, including installing solar panels.  Maybe this is a policy matter but how should all of this play into how carbon taxes are applied?  Will a PSO levy be universally applied to electricity bills?  There is scope to incentivise people and reward people.</p> <p>  As we heard, people will seek to borrow money to adapt their homes.  Low-cost loans to help people to make their houses or properties more energy efficient were mentioned.  Sums of &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000 were mentioned.  I am not sure whether these would be needed for domestic or commercial buildings.  These are very stark realities.  The fact that new builds and major renovations are to be hit by this requirement and an additional cost will be news to many people.  I am not saying the new building standard has not been talked about.  However, the message on energy efficiency and climate change is sometimes unclear or people just do not hear it.</p> <p>  Mr. Griffin highlighted the progress the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is making in investing in upgrading local authority housing stock.  As we discussed with Professor John Fitzgerald, these upgrades simply involve the installation of more efficient oil boilers and households will be stuck with them for the next 15 or 20 years.  People who live in a local authority house are not presented with a choice of heating systems.  The choice is made for them, yet they must pay in the form of carbon tax on coal or whatever else.  The Department has already spent a substantial amount on these upgrades.  Are they good value for money?  Does the energy rating of homes improve following the upgrades?  What is the average energy rating of houses that have been upgraded by the local authorities?   </p> <p>  The SEAI has spent a significant amount on grants to people seeking to improve the energy rating of their houses.  How many homes have a BER A?  I am sorry but I did not hear the figures given for the number of houses that have been grant-aided and the number of additional units.  How much did that cost?</p> <p>  I have raised the issue of land use for some time, certainly as far back as Mr. Pat Rabbitte's time as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  On the one hand, we had the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine setting out its 2025 targets, while, on the other, we had the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, of which Mr. Griffin is Secretary General, talking about energy crops, carbon sequestration and all of that sort of thing.  The problem was that there did not appear to be any formal engagement between Departments on the issue of land use.  We have only a limited amount of land and there must be agreement on how best to use it.  The Departments must interact to some degree on their plans.  What have they agreed?  How does the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment view the targets set out in Food Wise 2025?</p><p>We are being told that land use is an issue or a problem.  On the agriculture side we are even told - we had a man from An Taisce before the committee - that reclaiming certain land can release excess carbon so, where farmers are trying to make land more productive, they should not.  There are an awful lot of gaps between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the witnesses' Department in respect of this issue.  These gaps need to be filled in order to give a clearer picture of what we are doing and what direction we are going in.  The question is really what has been done formally.   What agreements and so on are in place between the Departments?  I asked the question of both the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the then Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, at the time.  I continued to ask it over a period of time and an answer was never given.  </p><p> On the issue of renewable electricity on the grid - this question is particularly for the ESB and I am sure the Department also has an interest in it - there is no doubt that there are serious challenges around transmission.  There has been talk here of offshore wind and so on but even in parts of the country in which there is onshore wind there is no proper grid.  It is very piecemeal.  For example, Grid West was abandoned.  There were issues around Grid West and I would suggest that there are issues around the fact that, at the time, the State or Government and EirGrid would not contemplate undergrounding.  I know EirGrid is mandated to deliver grid in the most efficient and cheapest way but the reality is that it has cost so much and there has been so much delay in realising the build-out of transmission that this should be taken into account.  How are the issues around grid going to be overcome?  </p><p> If we were to go with offshore wind, we have a SEAI wave energy test site in my own county and, although that technology is probably a bit more into the future, there is obviously potential for offshore wind there as well.  We have no transmission capacity or grid, other than to Bellacorick where there is a former peat-burning power station.  There is no grid whatsover so any electricity generated there will be on the distribution line, or whatever way it is done.  The concerns of communities have not been tackled.  I address this to the ESB in particular as this is its sphere or area.  What is the way forward on this?  I know there is always talk about rewarding communities - and I know Eirgrid is charged with rolling out the transmission infrastructure - but surely undergrounding has to be looked at further.  Equally I understand that electricity could be brought around offshore even though I know this will all add to the cost.</p></speech>

The transition to a low-carbon economy is not going to be cheap.  Part of the issue we have to think about in the centre, and about which we are thinking already, is how one engages with communities to explain this.  There will be a cost involved but there will be benefits in the long term in terms of health, the environment, social issues, the economy, jobs and all that kind of stuff.  There is certainly a job of work to be done in the centre and at local and regional level to explain that.  I think the national dialogue on climate action will have a role in that respect.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned Food Wise 2025.  Again, the committee will have my colleagues from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine before it shortly enough.  We are, and have been, working very closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine around bioenergy, biomass, carbon sequestration, and energy crops.  We are trying to align what sometimes appear to be policy tensions between the targets under Food Wise 2025 and the things we need to do to try to decarbonise a lot of sectors that are in the non-emissions trading scheme, ETS, sector.  My Department is represented on the Food Wise 2025 high-level implementation group at assistant secretary level.  We have an assistant secretary from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine represented on the group on climate action chaired by the Minister, Deputy Naughten.  We are teasing out issues around the other things we need to do, looking at everything we have done across all the sectors and the commitments that exist and being aware of the pressures in particular sectors, to ensure that commitments we have entered into will be met absolutely by 2030.  </p> <p>  I might ask Mr. Maughan to say something about carbon tax and the point the Senator made about how people investing in energy improvements will be taken into account in the design of a carbon tax system.  When Mr. Maughan is done perhaps the SEAI could comment on the nearly zero energy building, NZEB, standard, what it entails, and the costs involved.  </p></speech>

From that point of view carbon tax is a price signal to householders and to other consumers in the economy to say that we want them to consume less fossil fuels in their day-to-day activities, in how they heat their homes and in how they drive their cars.  It will be of benefit to the consumer who decides to invest in a deep retrofit of his or her house because he or she will ultimately end up paying less in carbon tax because of the fact that he or she will be consuming less fossil fuels.  That is the very simple answer.</p> <p>  Obviously there is a separate question in terms of where the carbon tax will go over time, about which I spoke briefly earlier.  There is a question and the committee has already heard advice on where the carbon tax might need to go in the medium term to make sure the signal to householders and other consumers is strong enough to create that incentive in the economy.  The committee has also discussed this issue with the advisory council.  The two types of interventions - if I can call them that - travel in parallel.  They affect the decision-making process for consumers, householders and firms when they come to make these types of interventions and investments in upgrading their homes and replacing their vehicles and so on.

With regard to the nearly zero energy building, NZEB, regulations and how much they are likely to add to the cost of a unit, I cannot say that specifically because that matter would be dealt with by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  What I can explain is that the principle underlying the NZEB regulations, which is set out across the EU under the energy performance in building directive, is that, based on an econometric model, the additional costs of the works involved in achieving near zero energy performance are recovered over the period of ownership of the property.  It pays for itself.  It does have an added cost but it pays for itself in the reduced energy requirement.</p></speech>

It is taking an existing building and upgrading its performance as a housing system.  That could cost between &euro;50,000 and &euro;70,000 to achieve.  This is to get a building to an A rating.</p><p> I also mentioned that under the building regulations people doing renovations that impact more than 25% of the property have do energy efficiency works.  This requires them to bring it up only to a B rating.  The step between a B rating and an A rating is substantial.  I have referenced a number of parts of this, including a deep retrofit pilot and the requirements under the building regulations.  One is with regard to achieving an A rating and the other to achieving a B rating.</p></speech>

I understand well Mr. Halpin saying that over time these measures pay for themselves, but the problem is people must have the money upfront to pay for them and this is a challenge.  It cannot be sneezed at.</p></speech>

I said I have no sense of what the additional costs are and I do not know their order of magnitude.  That is a matter for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We do not own or apply the building regulations.  It is a matter for the Department.  The &euro;40,000 amount is for retrofitting, which is upgrading a house when undertaking renovations.  I have no sense of the additional cost between building a house under the existing building regulations, which would have a high energy performance, and building one under the nearly zero energy building standard, nZEB, that will be introduced under the new regulations next year.  To use the figure of &euro;40,000 as an impact on affordability is to conflate two points.</p></speech>

With regard to the separate issue of retrofitting, a deep retrofit is likely to cost &euro;40,000, &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000.

The Senator asked about the design of the new market and asked whether people who want to be energy islands and opt out would be faced with a charge.  This question will have to be addressed.  Last year, Storm Ophelia cost &euro;30 million.  If the 20 of us in this room decided we wanted to be energy islands and opted out, it would mean 20 fewer people paying the cost of that &euro;30 million.  Last week, 186,000 homes and businesses were disconnected because of a storm.  The ESB had 2,000 staff out and 500 contractors.  I do not know what the cost of that will be but it will be a cost to the system.  It is not a reason to fail to do it but it is one of the complexities to be dealt with in doing it.</p></speech>

It will be so busy, critical and central that the old argument that it would not be used is nonsense and out of date.  It is a question of how we cope with the needs and demands of the system.  This is the skill.  This is the industrial revolution in front of us, with regard to EirGrid and the ESB.  We are good at it and it should not stop us using solar energy.</p></speech>

We have seen it in numerous cases.  I hope the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, consultation on community engagement will be successful in terms of renewables.  If it is, it might help us develop a model in other areas.  There are many cases where it is quicker to build a factory than to build the capacity to get there.  There is a balance between having capacity leading demand and demand leading capacity.  There are cost implications in all of this.  The Senator mentioned transmission and undergrounding.  EirGrid had an issue to consider, but it is more complex than just the cost.  If a line goes underground it may be a DC line rather than an AC line and that would change the characteristics of the system.  It is a very complex area.</p></speech>

The technology is being changed, and there are certain limitations on the DC technology, but EirGrid tried to pursue certain policies on Grid West and other projects, including the North-South interconnector, and where are we?  We have nothing.  We still have deficiencies in the transmission and in our single electricity market.</p></speech>

There were lot of votes in the Seanad at the beginning of the meeting.  I caught up with the submissions as the meeting went on.  Most of the questions I had in mind have been covered but I have two technical questions for the ESB.  Its representatives said it pays 10 cent per unit for the surplus produced by solar panels but it cannot charge for this.  Where does it go?  If it can be recorded and it is going onto the grid, is it not being used and put on a consumer's bill?</p> <p>  I do not want to sound sarcastic but the ESB is the face of electricity and there is a lot of talk about electrical vehicles.  How much of its own fleet is electric?  Does it have any plans to electrify its fleet?</p></speech>

It is not that it does not go through the meters.  Everything is still accounted for through the meters at everybody's residences.  This is why I did not want to get into the technicalities.  What happens is the assumed losses on the system are reduced.  Generators generate electricity and in the old days it went from big generators through the transmission system and the distribution system and into people's houses.  The process of sending the electricity and transporting it creates losses.  Producing electricity in the system creates minus losses.  This is how it is treated in the system.</p></speech>

I will have to come back to the committee with the numbers as I do not have them with me.  We see EVs as being very important as we move into the future.  In our new office that we are building on Fitzwilliam Street, for example, there will be only 50 car parking spaces and each will be EV-proofed from day one in 2021.  I will come back to the committee with the actual numbers.   One of the constraints we face is that many of our vehicles are heavy vehicles.  The electrification of vehicles is currently focused on smaller and medium-sized vehicles while the trucks we need to carry equipment out to network locations are less amenable to electrification at the moment.</p> <p>  In response to an earlier comment by Deputy Jack Chambers, there are two big trends when it comes to the battery technology used for vehicle electrification.  The first is that the energy density of batteries is moving in an upward direction and the second is that the cost of those batteries is moving in a downward direction.  It is the coming together of those two trends that makes us believe the electrification of transport is definitely the future.  The electrification of vans and lorries will come into range once these trends are sufficiently strong and this will allow the ESB and other companies with large numbers of such vehicles to move our fleets onto electric vehicles.</p></speech>

The Bill covers a number of patient safety priorities, including mandatory open disclosure of serious, reportable patient safety incidents, the notification of reportable incidents to the regulator, the use of clinical audit to improve patient care and outcomes and the extension of HIQA's remit to private hospitals.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I would like to welcome Dr. Tony Holohan, chief medical officer; Mr. David Keating, head of patient safety and advocacy policy unit; and Ms Elizabeth Adams, patient safety and advocacy officer of the Department of Health.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>I wish to advise the witnesses that any opening statements they make to the committee may be published on the committee's website after the meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I now ask Dr. Holohan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.294" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018092600002#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to come before you today on the legislative provisions proposed within the general scheme of the Patient Safety Bill.  I will keep this statement short and I am happy, as we all are, to reply to any questions.</p> <p>  As the Chairman has said, I am joined by Mr. David Keating and Ms Elizabeth Adams from the patient safety, policy and advocacy unit in the Department of Health.</p> <p>  The Government directed the Department to undertake the development of the Patient Safety Bill in May of this year.  This Bill incorporates the patient safety elements of the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill which introduces a requirement for external notification of patient safety incidents to the appropriate regulator and to the State Claims Agency.  It also empowers the Minister for Health to issue guidance with respect to clinical audit and extends the remit of HIQA to private hospitals on top of HIQA's existing statutory powers.</p> <p>  These elements in fact previously underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in January 2016 when consideration was given to the full Health Information and Patient Safety Bill.  In addition, the Patient Safety Bill now also provides for mandatory open disclosure of serious reportable events.  That is the added part since the pre-legislative scrutiny in January 2016.  As such, this legislation complements the measures contained within the justice legislation, the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, which was passed by the Houses last year and which provides protections from liability for clinicians engaging with open disclosure and important elements of that were commenced in the early part of this week.</p> <p>  I wish to alert the committee to an additional aspect that has emerged since the Government approved the Bill.  Earlier this month, the High Court overruled the Minister's decision to require HIQA to undertake a section 9(2) investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mrs. Malak Thawley at the National Maternity Hospital in May 2016.  This judgment has revealed that there may be a need to enhance powers in relation to section 9 of the Health Act 2007.  This may require amending legislation.  While the Department is still in the process of considering how best to address this, it might be that some modifying provisions will be brought forward within this Bill and that is under consideration.</p> <p>  I now turn to the primary elements of the Bill before us, beginning with open disclosure.  Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from things that go wrong is the bedrock of making services safer.  In line with the long-standing approach of the Department on this issue, open disclosure should be an open and consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what happened, keeping patients informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent recurrence of adverse events.</p> <p>  I would like to recall that, last year, the Houses of the Oireachtas provided protections, as I have briefly mentioned, from liability for clinicians making a disclosure through the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act of 2017.  During the passage of that Act, a number of Deputies sought to amend the legislation to provide for a mandatory approach.  As that legislation was extremely broad and applicable to a wide variety of health and social care settings, it was ultimately decided by the Oireachtas not to be the appropriate vehicle for mandatory open disclosure.  The Minister for Health did, however, undertake to bring forward legislation to provide for a mandatory duty to disclose at an early opportunity and hence the Bill that we have before the committee today for its consideration.</p> <p>  It should be noted that, with the commencement of part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, the regulations arising from it and their provision for a framework to support openness, transparency, timely disclosure and an apology for unintended or unanticipated injury have come into effect earlier this week.</p> <p>  Mandatory open disclosure is about building patient and public trust in the health system.  The recently published report of Dr. Scally's scoping inquiry provides a clear analysis of the system failures that occurred in CervicalCheck, based on patient and family accounts of their experiences.  We must now ensure that the learning from this report is used to drive the changes we want to see so as to ensure that patient safety is a primary element driving and shaping policy for the health service.</p> <p>  I would like to reassure the committee that the Department has taken close note of Dr. Scally's findings and, in particular, regarding the primacy of the right of patients to have full knowledge as to their healthcare as and when they wish.  While the current approach to disclosure within the health service has had positive impacts within and across the service, the Scally report has identified significant issues which now need to be remedied and this Patient Safety Bill, while in development prior to the receipt of the Scally report, will now be one of the primary means for responding to important aspects of his report and will provide the legislative underpinning for mandatory open disclosure.</p> <p>  Fundamentally, the Bill will introduce a requirement for disclosure of serious patient safety incidents.  The definition of a serious patient safety incident includes the death of an individual; a permanent lessening of bodily, sensory, motor, physical or intellectual functions; and, harm which is not severe but which otherwise results in, for example, an increase in the requirement for treatment or a requirement for treatment to prevent death or injury.</p> <p>  The Minister for Health will prescribe the specific incidents to be disclosed in secondary legislation under the powers conferred upon him in this legislation.  This definition is in line with recent legislative definitions incorporated in Scotland in their Act of 2016 which, in turn, builds on the duty of candour arrangements in operation in England since 2015.</p> <p>  The Bill provides the legislative framework for a number of recommendations of the Scally report on placing a statutory duty of candour on individual healthcare professionals and healthcare organisations.</p><p>The Bill provides that it shall be an offence for a health service provider to fail to make a mandatory open disclosure or notify a reportable incident to the external authority.  A registered health service provider guilty of an offence will be subject to penalties in the form of a fine or imprisonment.  It is similar to the approach of the UK, where the duty of candour regulation seeks to hold providers and directors to account.  It is a mechanism to hold the owner, management or board of an organisation to account and ensure that the individuals at the top of the organisation are invested in quality and patient safety.</p><p> Regarding individual health practitioners, the policy is to distinguish between genuine unintentional acts of omission or commission that can lead to harm and the much rarer acts of wilful negligence or deliberate breach of acceptable practice.  In the drafting of the Bill, the inclusion of a defence will also be incorporated.</p><p> In terms of the notification of reportable patient safety incidents, the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance - the so-called Madden commission report - recommended that provision should be made for the mandatory reporting to the appropriate regulatory body of adverse events that resulted in death or serious harm.  The commission also recommended that provision be made on a voluntary basis for other less serious, as it were, adverse events and "near misses".  The commission concluded that a mandatory system would improve patient safety and ensure greater accountability by requiring specific reports of serious injury to be made by healthcare organisations, with disseminating lessons to be learned throughout the health system.  The Bill provides for mandatory notification of serious patient safety incidents to a number of bodies, including the State Claims Agency, HIQA and the Mental Health Commission, depending on the nature of the incident.</p><p> Regarding clinical audit, it would be helpful in the first instance to give some definition of what we mean.  In this context, clinical audit is a clinically-led quality improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and outcomes through systematic review of care against explicit standards and acting to improve that care where these standards are identified as not having been met.  Defining clinical audit in legislation recognises the need to have a standard definition and associated methodology to ensure that there is consistency of approach across the health system.  The Madden commission advocated building a positive culture of participation in clinical audit that would benefit patients and the health services as a whole, and recommended that legislation be introduced providing for: exemptions from freedom of information, FoI, legislation for records arising from clinical audit activities and related activities; and protections for these records from admissibility as evidence in civil proceedings.  It was envisaged that certain legal privileges would be granted if guidance on governance, methodology and clinical standards for clinical audit was followed by the individuals undertaking the clinical audit activities.  This Bill will enable the Minister to issue such guidance, subject to public consultation.  Where clinical audit is carried out in accordance with that guidance and aggregate results are published, any record created solely for the purpose of the clinical audit will not be admissible as evidence in civil proceedings and the FoI legislation will not apply to that specific record.  This part of the Bill will therefore support those who use clinical audit to improve the quality of care provided.</p><p> Of course, such protections do not exempt healthcare organisations or health professionals from their responsibilities where a serious patient safety incident has been discovered during the audit process.  Where any serious patient safety incident is so discovered, mandatory open disclosure would clearly apply.  The governance framework, methodology and reporting of clinical audit will all be incorporated into the Minister's guidance on clinical audit that will be developed by the national clinical effectiveness committee, which operates to and through the Department.</p><p> The Oireachtas committee will recall that we appeared before it recently when it examined the patient safety (licensing) Bill, which will provide HIQA with full regulatory responsibility for all hospitals, public and private.  In advance of that, the Bill before us today will provide for the extension of HIQA's existing powers in respect of the setting of standards, monitoring of compliance and undertaking of investigations to the private hospital sector.  It is a step along the road towards licensing.  Extending these powers will ensure that all defined private and public health service activities will be subject to the same standards and be monitored by the same authority, with the exception of those that fall under the remit of the Mental Health Commission.</p><p> In conclusion, I would recall that the scoping inquiry - the Scally report - has identified what those involved in a patient safety incident want: to be told what happened and why, that is, the truth; for someone who was involved to say he or she is sorry and to mean it; and to be assured that this will not happen again to anyone else.  Through this legislation and other policy and legislative steps that the Department is taking, that is exactly what we are trying to achieve.</p><p> We are happy to take whatever questions members might have.</p></speech>

The voluntary system, as provided for in the civil liability legislation, and the mandatory system to be provided for in this Bill will sit alongside and complement each other.  Voluntary disclosure and the protection it offers are about the totality of patient safety incidents.  Even though we say "voluntary disclosure", we do not mean "optional".  Rather, we mean that disclosure should take place in every situation, in the right way and according to the kinds of issue that I referenced at the end of my opening statement.  We are trying to determine what the evidence tells us about the best means of achieving the greatest likelihood of that happening in every situation.  In policy terms, our approach is to have a combination of supports that give assurances to practitioners that, if they do the right thing and do it in the right way, protections will be offered along the lines I have described - we can set them out in more detail - from FoI, admissibility and so on.  This is meant to encourage them to do the right thing, but will be complemented by an absolute requirement that makes mandatory the reporting of serious patient safety incidents as opposed to every patient safety incident.  There is a difference in nature and number between serious patient safety incidents and all patient safety incidents.  The two approaches are not at variance.  It is not a switch from one position to another.  They will sit in legislative and policy terms alongside each other and complement each other.</p></speech>

The piece we have added to this legislation since it was before the committee in 2016 is the requirement that, for a specified number of serious patient safety incidents, it will be mandatory to report those to the patient.  It was already our provision for that to be mandatory in terms of reporting to HIQA and the State Claims Agency and it is the same list, but we have added an absolute requirement of open disclosure to the patient as well.  This is in addition to the supports we have in terms of voluntary open disclosure.</p> <p>  Many comparisons have been drawn between policy, legislation and practice in Ireland and the duty of candour in the UK.  Clearly, the UK is ahead of us - it is ahead of the rest of the world - in its legislative provisions.  There is value in that for us from a learning point of view.  The UK's duty of candour provisions do not extend beyond requirements on organisations.  Our requirements extend not only to organisations and the duty on people who have corporate responsibilities within health service organisations, but also to practitioners.  When this legislation is enacted, there will be a duty of open disclosure on organisations and practitioners, which goes considerably further than the UK's duty of candour.</p></speech>

They are to increase the Minister's power to direct investigations.</p><p>This relates to the tragic case of Ms Thawley in the National Maternity Hospital.  Dr. Holohan referred in his opening statement to the interesting judgment in that case.  In his legal judgment, the judge said he was not satisfied that section 9 was complied with and directed that no section 9 investigation should be undertaken.  He was scathing about the Minister.  He said that the Minister was "irrational and unreasonable" and that the Minister's assertions stood up to no analysis.  He said it was clear that the findings, recommendations and conclusions of the National Maternity Hospital's report were not properly considered by the Minister.  It appears from the judge's scathing report that the Minister has failed entirely in his duty in this case.  I am concerned that it is recommended to give such a Minister even more powers.  I ask Dr. Holohan to comment on that.</p></speech>

To be clear, nothing in what we are proposing in the legislation at the moment addresses this question.  I am simply saying that this is now a very relevant issue in the context of the legislation.  We think that when we have completed our consideration of the judgment to which the Deputy is referring - we are looking at what it means for our arrangements, such as our capacity to respond to patient safety incidents of whatever form and in whatever way - we might conclude that some additional legislation, which might include additions to the legislation here, might be necessary.  That is all I am signalling.</p> <p>  I will comment on the substance of the point the Deputy is making.  He is factually correct in his references to the terminology that was used in the judgment.  I will outline my sense of how I would characterise it.  The Minister has said in his public statements on this matter that he fully respects the decision of the court in all of this, as indeed does the Department.  It means that the Minister's sole investigative power which is set out in legislation - the section 9 power - is rendered inoperable, in effect, from our point of view.  I am giving the Deputy my assessment of things as they stand, rather than a legal judgment.  We are going through the process of analysing the judgment properly.  The conditions we would have to satisfy to activate the Minister's section 9 power would almost require us to have the outcome of an investigation available to us before commencing the investigation.</p></speech>

The way I would characterise this - I am not a legal person and I am not paraphrasing legally - is that the bar in respect of section 9 is so high that it is almost impossible to reach.  It is significant from a patient safety point of view that a Minister is in the situation our Minister is now in.  He is unable to operate or act, in legal terms, on the significant concerns he still holds regarding a particular patient safety incident.  I am not getting ahead of where we will end up when I say that this might well lead the Minister to conclude that he needs additional powers and an additional ability to act in the public interest in situations where he has genuine concerns about patient safety.</p></speech>

It is a very welcome change, but it could be a very scary change.  A breakdown in the information flow between treating clinicians and the women who were affected was essentially at the heart of the CervicalCheck scandal.  For a variety of reasons, the treating clinicians refused to share the audit results with the women involved, or did not feel comfortable doing so.  We heard from Dr. Scally that international evidence suggests that this can be partly attributed to reputational damage for the hospital or acute setting, to damage to staff, and to legal risks or concerns and so forth.</p> <p>  Given that the provisions of last year's Bill and the proposals in this Bill represent a move towards a change in the culture so that mandatory disclosure by clinicians is required under law, is Dr. Holohan satisfied that the supports which will be needed by those clinicians will be in place so that mandatory disclosure can be done in the right way?  In a briefing on the day his report was launched, Dr. Scally made the point to us that mandatory disclosure can be very damaging if it is done in the wrong way.  Is Dr. Holohan satisfied that the legal protections are in place, that the training will be in place and that all the other supports which are required for mandatory disclosure to work properly will also be included as we require our clinicians to disclose?</p></speech>

I am not yet satisfied about that.  The Scally report sets out some very important findings and highlights some very significant deficiencies in a number of respects.  The Deputy has referenced some of the areas in question, such as training.  The report brings it right back to the very point the Deputy has made about culture.  Ultimately, this is about changing the culture.  Things like training and changes in legislation, policy and practice contribute to that culture.  Ultimately, this is about the difficult job of changing the culture.  Dr. Scally has left us with a set of 50 recommendations.  The Minister has publicly made clear his intention regarding the recommendation on implementation.  It is intended that we will frame an implementation plan within three months of publication and bring that plan back to the Government, with all the implications that would have, including some of the things referred to by the Deputy.  Perhaps it would also include a need for some additional legislative measures.  I would not rule that out.  The process is under way.  It is happening under the auspices of the CervicalCheck steering committee, which includes patients, patient organisations, the HSE, some clinical organisations, the Department and others.  The committee is overseeing the whole process of implementation planning.  It will present, through the Minister, a plan for approval by the Cabinet by the end of the year.  It is only when we have implemented that plan, the totality of what it provides for or implies in terms of legislation and resources and the pathway it lays out, that we will be able to say that we have assurance in respect of the things Dr. Scally has found.  We are at the start of that journey.</p></speech>

Given that the Oireachtas is proposing it will be an offence under law for doctors, nurses and allied health professionals not to disclose, those clinicians who are watching this space will want to know that the necessary legal protections and training will be in place as this becomes their legal responsibility.  Can Dr. Holohan give a commitment to the clinicians who are watching this legislation unfold that adequate legal protections and training will be in place for them at the time when mandatory disclosure will be a legal requirement for them?  Is it the case that the law is going to require them to mandatorily disclose before we have all the adequate supports in place for that to happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018092600002#H01200"><p>It is proposed that this will be an offence in cases of serious patient safety incidents as set out in the Schedule.  Clearly, the intention will be to have appropriate education and training in place.  That does not just fall to the Department or the HSE.  The training bodies themselves will have a significant role.  For that reason, among other reasons, I engaged the leadership of the various medical colleges last week.  We continue to commit to work with them to try to determine together what needs to happen.  Regardless of how one might characterise what has happened in recent months, my personal view - and no criticism is implied here - is that it has first and foremost led to an erosion of societal trust in the profession.  In some quarters, there has been a questioning of the extent to which the profession fully subscribes to some of the ethical principles of openness, trust, honesty, disclosure and so on.  While it is clear that the Government and the health service have to do a major job of work to rectify much of that, in my view there is also a need for the profession to find a means of engaging directly with society to address these questions.  This process should not be mediated through a Minister or through the HSE.  It is necessary for the standing of a profession that has been questioned, at least in some quarters.</p><p>I think we all hold the view that the vast majority of health professionals fully uphold the standards about which we are speaking.  We have, however, been through a process whereby people have been, not unreasonably, questioning these things.  It is important that the profession finds a way of addressing some of that.  Part of the discussion has also led us to the question of how we, together, can support one another to achieve some of those objectives.  If the colleges and other leaders within the profession are bringing forward leadership proposals in terms of their requirements in respect of education and training not just for the legislation, but for any other aspect of the response to what has happened and what is laid out in Dr. Scally's report, how can we best support those proposals?  This is not something we can do separately.  My own strong sense is that - and this is why we have a CervicalCheck committee organised in the way it is - it is only through patients, patient organisations, professional organisations, the HSE, the Department and others working together to the same common objective that we will achieve what Deputy Donnelly is describing.</p></speech>

Those agencies are the ones which will be in receipt of the reportable incident.  Will we have a very tight definition of what constitutes a reportable incident?  With regard to who has ownership of the information, there is potential for two or possibly three of those agencies to be holding information at the same time.  Who has ultimate responsibility for the safeguarding of that information?  Where will it be stored?  Who has responsibility for acting on it?  With regard to the agencies, and to HIQA in particular, is it envisaged that the powers HIQA has under the 2007 Act will be enhanced or improved in any way to ensure that it can fully comply?  There is a lot about monitoring but there is little about - and I hesitate to use the word but Dr. Holohan knows what I mean - enforcement.  Will HIQA have any powers or will it simply record?  If it is just going to be a recording and reporting mechanism with no follow-up the best use will not be gotten out of it.  As I understand it, the named agencies will be setting standards.  Who will be enforcing them?  How is that going to happen?  My reading is that there is going to be a fairly significant increase in the workload of the agencies involved.  That is appropriate, obviously, but if they were here they would tell Dr. Holohan that they are stretched already.  I can see he is smiling because of course they would say that but, as it goes, they are.  Is it envisaged that additional resources-----</p></speech>

My colleagues may wish to come in and supplement some of what I might say.  There will be a tight definition and, ultimately, a list of those.  The list will be subject to change.  The Deputy may be aware that there is already a list in operation on an administrative basis within the HSE.  It has a governance mandate from the top of the HSE but it does not have legal standing as things stand.  It would be something along the lines of that list and would not be terribly dissimilar to those that exist in other jurisdictions.  My strong sense is that we would need a process to continue in order to advise on changes that would need to be made to that list on an annual basis.  Things could get added or taken away but there would be a very clear list and definition of each reportable incident.</p> <p>  On the powers and the powers HIQA has under the 2007 Act, what we are proposing as our direction of travel in respect of licences will add substantially to the potential powers of enforcement that HIQA would have that would be relevant in this context.

It is a longer process so we expect this to be drafted and enforced before that.  From our point of view that is the logical step.  We are moving in the direction of a full licensing system so the step of extending the existing powers to bring in more private providers - and I will come back to the Deputy's question on that - is a step along the way to ultimately having a fully licensed arrangement where, at least from the licensing point of view, it will not matter if the provider is in the ownership of the State or in the ownership of some other organisation in terms of the standards that have to apply and the protections for the patients using those services.</p></speech>

To deal with the Deputy's question in relation to cosmetic surgery providers, the definition of what would come under this provision will include private hospitals and other activities of a kind one would expect to see happening in hospital-type environments.  For example, the use of general anaesthesia would be the kind of thing that would ultimately determine the requirement for a licence in full licensing terms.  We would not see this just applying to buildings.  It covers activities and the nature of the risk that attaches to those activities more than anything else.</p></speech>

Many of the audits we could be talking about would be systematic audits that are ongoing and designed into the system on a continuing basis.  An example might be - dare I say it? - the audit process around screening.  This is designed to give assurance to individuals that if they participate in the audit they will not be contributing to their own risk and liability in the conduct of that audit.  It is to give them that assurance and to encourage people into the safe space.  I think I have covered everything.  Mr. Keating might come in on the resources.</p></speech>

Is there going to be a link-up between them?  The last thing we want is for four agencies which all have the same piece of information to be looking at the other agencies and thinking that it is the other agencies' job to deal with it rather than their own.  Where the information is stored is as important as identifying who will be acting on it.  It is not the intention of the Bill - and we could perhaps make it a bit stronger - to ensure that this does not happen but there has to be some responsibility attached to the legislation beyond only the responsibility to store information in line with the GDPR.  It also has to include a responsibility to ensure that information is acted on so that people do not look to their left or right and think that, even though they have the information, another body also does and then assume that the other body is acting on it.  We saw that with CervicalCheck.  There were people who should have been advising but who were looking at it and saying that they did not think it was definitively their job to deal with it and then putting it to one side.</p><p>It is not just a matter of taking responsibility for storing the information but also for acting on it.  Perhaps we could do a bit of work on tightening that up.</p></speech>

We have strengthened some provisions in the Department and the patient safety office in respect of what we call patient safety surveillance because of what we uncovered in Portlaoise.  I refer to the deaths of the four babies that came to public notice in the early part of 2014.  When we had an opportunity to ask a number of agencies, each of which had a different relationship with the hospital, whether they had a concern, it became clear that there were a number of pieces of a jigsaw that had not been put together.  Therefore, our intention in creating a patient safety surveillance function is to try to put all the information on one table so there is as much early warning as possible.  As the Deputy rightly said, there is little point in having one organisation understanding something if another that could act does not have access to the information.  We are committed to addressing this.</p> <p>  Mr. Keating might speak about resources.</p></speech>

As Dr. Holohan said, we are travelling in a certain direction with HIQA in that it is going to be moving towards licensing.  It is taking on other roles in respect of undertaking a national patient experience survey.  It is the competent authority for ionising radiation.  This year an additional 47 posts have been sanctioned, or will be sanctioned by the end of the year.  There has been an increase of approximately &euro;3.4 million over the 2018 budget.  We are currently considering what the 2019 budget might be.</p></speech>

From a legislative point of view, we will be debating a lot of terminology and definitions.  That will come out in the wash.  Some work probably needs to be done in this regard.</p> <p>  I have a general concern.  The legislation will have to be drafted in such a way that makes it flexible enough to be adaptable from a ministerial point of view.  It will change all the time.  The witnesses should bear that in mind.  It is an important point because definitions and terminology will change.  Court cases will arise that will have consequences.  We need to bear this in mind in the drafting of the legislation to allow for direct ministerial powers to make changes quickly.</p> <p>  The real issue, the real nut, concerns how the legislation will be implemented, reporting back and the volume of resources.  How will we ensure that the organisations across the health service will be resourced to deal with this?  Is there a plan in place?  Dr. Holohan might answer that first.  I will come back to my other questions.</p></speech>

A large part of that will fall into the work we will do after the Scally inquiry.  As I am sure the Deputy has seen, the recommendations in the Scally report and the findings cover three separate chapters that deal with different aspects of open disclosure as it applies to different parts of the system.  Dr. Scally has certainly more than ten specific recommendations that relate to open disclosure.  There is a substantial job now happening on open disclosure preparation.  It will include revisions of the policies.  We have gone a step into the specifics of how we might consider doing that, bearing in mind what the Minister announced in the very early days after the publication of the Scally report.  A big job of work will have to be undertaken.  It will include planning for whatever resources will be needed and go beyond some of the organisations mentioned in the report.  Disclosure is a reality for some organisations and will be very-----</p></speech>

We will not be implementing this on the back of the Scally report.  It is specific.  I have read the Scally report and know the recommendations inside out.  Of course, it is a kick up the backside to say we have to go in a certain direction but that is what it is.  This is a mammoth task.  It has to be done pretty quickly.  How are we to resource the organisations to do it, even from an administration perspective alone?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct, however, that the broader requirements in terms of reporting and auditing will present a substantial implementation challenge.  We will do as we do with every Act.  Our implementation planning is done for the most part but not only with the HSE and in parallel with the process of drafting so we will have prepared the ground as best we can to try to enable the effective implementation of the legislation when commenced.</p></speech>

It is a priority for us as a country.  I am not confident that the resources will be in place to implement the legislation.  This is not a reflection on anyone.  I am not confident that from an organisational point of view, the work can be done in the time required.  There will also be a significant cost.  It will all require resources and staff time.  It will create different pathways for managing information and it will create electronic and technical requirements.  There is an overlap with GDPR.  A range of issues will arise.  It will take time and resources, and there will be costs.  I want to feel confident that will we will be able to deliver.  Will we?</p></speech>

The general approach is what we have been trying to do.  One will see it if one looks back through the HSE service plans for recent years.  It involves trying to ensure the so-called patient safety programme, which runs right through the organisation from the top and should be running down into the CHO areas and local hospital groups, results in the putting of warm bodies and real capacity into enabling the implementation of a range of patient safety measures, including the one in question.</p></speech>

The pathway essentially comprises the capacity needed at national level, which we have, and the capacity needed at the level of each individual group.  I have said to this committee before that the most important place to put our capacity, in terms of people working on patient safety, is at the front line.  One needs to have people who have expertise in these areas working on implementation.</p> <p>  I cannot tell the Deputy that the level of resources and capacity we have in this regard are sufficient for the plans we have, which is why we have an ongoing process of planning.  Ultimately, that finds expression in the context of the Estimates each year.  Each year, we have to make a case overall for whatever public funding is available to support implementation, not just of this measure but of everything else that has to happen through the health system.  It is a matter of trying to ensure that adequate priority is given to this in line with all the competing interests.</p></speech>

The health budget is under serious stress and we all know this.  We have to get real.  If we want to implement this, which we do and which we have to, we must acknowledge it will come and there will be a significant cost.

The drafting of this part needs a lot of thinking.</p> <p>  Dr. Holohan said the patient safety Bill will provide for mandatory notification of serious patient safety incidents to the appropriate authority, and the State Claims Agency, HIQA and the Mental Health Commission are mentioned.

If, as Dr Holohan said, with regard to the recent High Court ruling, that the Minister's request was overruled, does he believe the Bill is moot from the outset?  Does strengthening the ability to compel open disclosure need to be considered?  I note Dr. Holohan's comments on the empathy of professionals with patients and their families.  How can this be measured?  Would it require training?  Dr. Holohan advised that the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 was too broad to ensure a mandatory approach that would capture all social care settings.  Will the Bill achieve this objective?  In light of the Scally report, does the Bill go far enough to ensure complete transparency?  Dr. Holohan advised that the approach here will be similar to the duty of candour applied in the UK.  Does the Bill equal that approach?  It appears that issues relating to clinical audit remain unclear.  Will the definition of a clinical audit be in place prior to the implementation of this legislation?</p></speech>

Disclosure is something that happens in the privacy of a consulting room or clinic, and there is not a window into this.  We are in the process of building intelligence capacity through the so-called patient experience survey.  Mr. Keating referenced this in passing earlier.  I am not saying it will provide the entire answer to the question.  It is a survey of hospitals in the first instance and it is more limited than we want it to be ultimately.  We want to extend it to maternity hospitals and other healthcare settings.  It gets into a substantial amount of detail with patients as to a wide range of their experiences.  The second report will be published in the coming weeks.  The first report, published in autumn last year, showed, for example, that the quality of information given to people at the point of discharge and the understanding with which people left hospitals or healthcare institutions was very poor.  I imagine the issues that reflect on disclosures and the quality of those disclosures might be something we can include and we will be able to make inferences through it.  We also have HIQA.  It will be empowered to inspect, have standards relating to open disclosure and will be in a position to report on this.  It is a good question and one we need to keep in mind because what we are trying to do is improve the quality of the disclosure engagements that take place.</p> <p>  In the context of the Scally report and transparency, we cannot say yet - because of the process of implementation planning we are going through - that all of the legislative requirements we may need to respond to all of his recommendations are contained in this.  We are open to the possibility that as we do this work over the coming weeks, and we will be back to the Government with the Minister bringing his proposed implementation plan in December, that there may well be identified some additional requirement for us to add to this list of measures and to the provisions in the Bill.  I am not saying "Yea" or "Nay", I am just not ruling it out.  Our minds are open to that possibility.  What I am saying is I cannot not sit here and state this is sufficient and we need to do nothing more with it.</p> <p>  With regard to equivalence with the duty of candour, our provisions will go beyond the duty of candour in the sense they will apply not only to organisations and the duty on an organisation to make arrangements for disclosure to happen in the same way that is provided for in law in the UK but also to individual practitioners, and there will be penalties in respect of them.  We will go further than the UK.  Ms Adams will answer the question on the definition of clinical audit.</p></speech>

At present, the Department is commissioning an international study to look at the definition of "clinical audit" throughout the world in order that we can absolutely get that definition right.  There are many definitions in the system that are fairly confusing so it will be important to have one clear clinical audit definition that is recognised.</p><p>That is the real starting point.  That will give the Minister the power to be able to develop the guidance he has discussed.  It will be a structured guidance that will sit under the definition of "clinical audit".  It will be really helpful across the system for clinicians.  I am glad to report we have started that work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018092600002#M00200"><p>I thank our guests for their presentation.  The first issue I wish to raise is open disclosure and the Medical Council.  Where will practitioners stand with regard to when a complaint is filed with the Medical Council and the information given in that open disclosure?  It does not appear to be mentioned in the legislation.  What is the clinician's situation where that occurs?  What information is there from that open disclosure?  Likewise, Dr. Holohan mentioned, in the context of the clinical audit, that it cannot be used in any proceedings.  What about matters that come before the Medical Council where there is a clinical audit?  Will that information be made available to the Medical Council?</p><p>The second issue relates to where a death occurs in a hospital and the medical and nursing staff are upfront that they are unsure as to what actually occurred, they want to have a review of the procedure the patient went through and there are delays in carrying out that review.  What process will be put in place?  One of the problems that occurs is that the family of the patient who has died believe that because there is a delay something is being hidden.  This arises time and again.  What process is being put in place to ensure a review is carried out in a timely manner when the practitioners and the nursing staff cannot give an explanation for what has occurred?</p><p>The third issue is inquests.  I have raised this with Ministers previously.  There is no legal duty on a coroner to hold an inquest within a specific period, and sometimes information relating to the autopsy might not be available until the inquest is held.  I am aware of a case where a person died in a hospital and 18 months later an inquest had still not been held.  What process is being put in place in that regard?  Are we going to amend legislation to require coroners to hold inquests?  In fairness, the vast majority of coroners will carry them out in a timely manner once all the information becomes available to them, but there is still no legislative requirement on them to hold an inquest within a particular period of time.  When there is a death families can be convinced that some information is deliberatively being withheld from them.  That must be clarified.</p><p>The other issue I wish to raise is accountability.  We talk about medical practitioners and nursing staff being accountable but there is no process in place for accountability by management in the hospital structure.  For example, when was the last time a senior official in a hospital structure or agency was brought before an inquiry?  I have never heard of it happening.  In some of the issues that arise medical practitioners and nurses identify to management that there is a shortfall in the support they require to provide a service.  It is in writing and is sent repeatedly, yet 12 or 18 months or two or three years later nothing has changed.  Nobody is held accountable for that.  Portlaoise was mentioned earlier.  One of the issues there was that the number of deliveries doubled in a short period, but additional staff were not provided even though the medical and nursing staff requested them.  I did not hear of any management personnel suffering the consequences in any way of not taking action.</p><p>I very much welcome this Bill but there has to be a <i>quid pro quo</i>in respect of the accountability of management, and I do not see that happening in the HSE.  I am aware of an incident in the last two weeks where 12 people were to meet to make a decision on one person.  This issue has been ongoing for over three years.  Then an individual in the HSE sent an email two days before the meeting to say that the person was now moving to a new job in the HSE and would not be at the meeting.  The meeting had to be cancelled.  The family ended up having to face a battle to resolve an issue relating to one person.  I support this legislation but I also want a <i>quid pro quo</i>of accountability by management because I do not believe we are getting it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.382" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018092600002#M00300"><p>On the Senator's first question, the provisions of the Civil Liability Act will give the same protections in respect of the information as will apply for their admissibility to the Medical Council.  The information gathered and recorded in that way is protected from those types of processes, and those types of assurances can be given to our practitioners in that regard.</p> <p>  Regarding the question about the death in a hospital, I realise it was not specifically about maternity but arising from some of the work that has been done on our response to what happened at Holles Street and the death of Malak Thawley there would be an automatic requirement for an external investigation to be conducted in every situation where there is a maternal death in a maternity hospital.  That has not been the standard heretofore but it will be a practice for the future.  As regards the process that will apply in respect of deaths in hospitals, I will make a number of comments although I do not wish to give a long-winded response.  Work has been under way to try to develop standards for patient safety incidents that give us a much clearer sense of the type of response that is necessary in response to the type of incident, to ensure we get a proper proportional response and that people are not left for long periods of time as the Senator described.  When people are looking for information following the death of a loved one in extreme situations we must see expeditious inquiry and expeditious responses.  That is part of the intention of having a more appropriate set of standards that operates in the same way across the health system.  The reality is that, heretofore, in some parts of the system the response is better than in other parts of it and there must be a much more standard approach to that.  Part of that ultimately will be the backstop the licensing legislation will give us to be able to ensure proper enforcement of those arrangements within the health care system.</p> <p>  I am not sidestepping the Senator's point about inquests because I understand what he stated regarding variable practices, and no criticism of coroners is intended, in the speed at which coronial investigations take place depending on the part of the country in which one lives.  They generate important information from a patient safety point of view.  From our perspective, to have a means of being able to see in a more agile way the outcome of coronial processes and the intelligence that comes from the investigation of those deaths would be one of the things we would like to happen.  The coronial process is under the Department of Justice and Equality.  We have worked and will continue to work with that Department to ensure that as it examines policy and legislation in that area our perspectives are provided on what we would like to see happening there.</p> <p>  With regard to accountability, there are two dimensions to this.  I will make a distinction between organisational accountability and professional accountability.  The Senator's point about the need to have a system of professional accountability for managers is well made.  We have a system of professional accountability for the great majority of the health care professions.  Within their individual professional line there is a means of setting standards, expectations, fitness to practice arrangements, in some cases competence assurance and so forth.  That is the system of professional accountability.  It should complement, but is distinct from, what must then also exist within an organisation which is that individuals are held to account within that organisation for their performance whatever their background, be they managers or professionals.</p><p>It may well be the case in the context of a practitioner or person who has a system of professional accountability that there are questions of performance that do not give rise to questions of competence - and are therefore questions for their regulators - but might still fall short of an appropriate standard of performance.  That should apply across the board.  Much work has been done within the HSE around the development of the so-called accountability framework, which the committee has probably heard about from the HSE.  However, the point in ensuring that the HSE's system of accountability is more responsive and reflective of the totality of staff in the HSE is one that I would accept.  The HSE has a disciplinary code and set of requirements in relation to that which it must operate itself in response to an incident if it seeks to take disciplinary action.  That is a different set of arrangements to what the Senator is describing which is a set of professional standards and a professional accountability line for people in management positions, which does exist in other jurisdictions.  </p></speech>

There is a section within the Scally report which deals with the issue of governance.  While the medical practitioners on the front line are being held accountable, no one who was involved in management and governance is being held accountable on CervicalCheck.  That is one issue I want to raise.  I welcome this legislation but in the HSE I have seen where people are in charge of a particular area who we then find have moved on to other areas.  I am seriously questioning accountability.  Dr. Scally highlighted it in his report, which referred to a total lack of governance, but no one is going to be held accountable for that lack of governance because it came in under the HSE.</p></speech>

That is a very basic level of accountability and something that must be addressed.  I do not want anyone to take any implications from what I am saying in terms of anything I am hinting at, I am not hinting at anything.  It may well be the case that the HSE, which is independent and separate from the Department and Government and the Minister in so doing, is operating its own disciplinary code in respect of what happened.  That is still open to the HSE and I am not making any inference by saying that.  At this point, I would not draw the conclusion that nothing has happened for anybody in the HSE as a consequence of what has happened and what has been found.  Dr. Scally has only just produced his report.  It is entirely possible that the HSE may well see the need to address issues of accountability for individuals in line with its own existing disciplinary code.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the emergence of a two-tier reporting system.  I refer to page 8.  I do not understand why there is not one system of logging errors.  Going back to the Scally report, it reminds me of where there was a cancer registry and the CervicalCheck list.  I wonder why we would have more than one list for logging errors.  An error that could technically be seen as being of no harm could be extremely harmful for a particular patient.  In the case of someone who is given the wrong antibiotic, it might cause no harm to that person but if he or she was allergic to it, it could kill him or her.  There being more than one list to log incidents concerns me.</p> <p> I refer to the emergence of a seven-day period of reporting.  Why seven days?  I speak from my own clinical time and if something is not acted on for seven days, there is a chance that the same error will happen again and again.  Who came up with seven days?  It seems too long.  I cannot understand why a period of 24 to 36 hours would not be reasonable where an incident occurs.  It is not comparable, but in the private sector, if one was in a factory and glass got into baby food, a week would not be acceptable.  I see this seven days as cushioning for people who do not work as efficiently as people in the private sector.  I do not think that seven days is acceptable.  It will lead to potential further errors, which could result in a list sitting there forever with nothing being done.</p> <p>  Page 13 refers to a "provider" and states "Notifications must be made within seven days of the provider becoming aware of the incident."  I might be wrong but my understanding is that "provider" does not refer to the doctor or whoever, but to the hospital.  Page 4 states that a health services provider " means ... a person, other than a health practitioner," so technically, if a doctor made a mistake on day one and then it was reported on day six, are we then talking about day 13, which is with seven days on top?  Does Dr. Holohan get me?  Am I wrong?  Could we be talking about 13 days from the incident before any action is taken?</p></speech>

I understand entirely where we are coming from but I am concerned that the focus is on the professional not on the patient.  If everything is all open and accountable why would the information not be admissible in court?  It is holding onto the past rather than looking towards the future.</p> <p>  Dr. Holohan referred to the erosion of societal trust.  It is worth mentioning that here.  I am very much pro-patient safety and open disclosure; the world and Ireland have changed in relation to the relationship between doctor and patient.  There was a time when one trusted the doctor down the road implicitly.  Such doctors would diagnose a person's pregnancy, weigh the babies when they were brought in and they were part of one's life.  That relationship has been destroyed over time for whatever reasons.  We are trying to apply open disclosure as though the relationship with the doctor was the same.  However, if one considers a doctor with whom a patient may have only dealt once, that patient might be more likely to make a complaint against such a doctor compared with the general practitioner that he or she might have dealt with for 15 years.  We must be conscious that the relationships have changed over time.  While patient safety is to the fore in this, we must also consider our medical practitioners and that they are not overly exposed as a consequence of the throughput and the transient nature of care now.</p><p>To come back to the incidents that happen, I know from working in this area in the UK that there is an idea that an IT system would be the alert system, but I cannot see why it would not be a mobile phone.  If an incident happens on one ward - it could easily be a dispensing error by the pharmacy - it would seem logical that the alert would go throughout the hospital in real time.  As for the idea that somebody sits down at the end of the day and logs errors into a system, and it sits on this endless list and nothing is done, anything we are doing here has to be in real time.<br/><br/>Following on from that, what sort of person will be in charge of this in an organisation?  Will it be a manager or a doctor?  Who will be responsible for making sure the list is filled in at the end of the day and whose responsibility will it be to triage what is serious or potentially serious?  If that person makes the wrong call and something that is serious is treated as minor or <i>vice versa</i>, whose responsibility is it and is there any protection for the health care professional or doctor in that case?<br/><br/>I have a fear that with seven days to log an error, or potentially longer, we could end up with a list of errors but no actions, no reflection and no change.  I know of other jurisdictions which have tried to bring in a regularised form of reporting errors and it has led to an endless list sitting on the system, when it is really only a log and has very little purpose apart from administration.  Dr. Holohan might deal with those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-26a.393" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018092600002#O00200"><p>I will deal with that last part first as it may address a number of the Deputy's questions.  I take the point completely.  Where the Deputy describes the creation of the list, that is exactly the culture we are trying to avoid.  In some parts, it might be the culture we already have, where it is seen that the response to the patient safety incident is the filling out of the form, and once the form is filled out, the duty is discharged and that is the end of the matter.  Although I do not want to keep going back to the Portlaoise example, that was absolutely the case in Portlaoise.  Nobody was looking at the pile but once they looked at the pile, the patterns were obvious.  Clearly, it is the use of the information that is important, and its value lies only in whether it is used to create appropriate intelligence.  There will need to be people who have appropriate patient safety expertise leading the implementation of that within the front line of the health services.  However, that is not to say there is not a requirement in terms of reporting and the integrity and accuracy of the information.  That responsibility has to reside with the clinical service, which has to take ultimate responsibility for the accurate reporting of the information.  That is the kind of culture that is needed and that by reporting something, they are not dispensing with their responsibility to deal with whatever the information relates to.</p> <p>  With regard to the seven days, an obvious point to make is that it is a maximum, not a minimum.  It is not setting the minium allowable period that has to elapse but the maximum, and it may well be, for the reasons the Deputy describes, much more appropriate that something happens within minutes or hours, depending on the nature of the incident.  The seven days relates to the requirement on the provider around the notification to the State Claims Agency, not around the response capacity and certainly not around open disclosure, so the open disclosure engagement is not framed.  That should be determined by the nature of the clinical circumstances.</p> <p>  Obviously, what we want to see happening is that, when the information becomes available and within the earliest possible time, the information is imparted properly by the appropriate clinical team, and there is appropriate training and so on to support people in doing that.  As I have said before in this committee, this really only applies when something goes wrong.  However, that is a much more frequent occurrence than people might imagine and, in general, the evidence is that up to 10% of hospital admissions have some form of iatrogenic or health service induced harm in respect of patients, so this is not an uncommon experience.  There is really only one opportunity to put that right, which is the earliest engagement that happens between the clinical team and the patient or the family of the patient.  We have to try to maintain trust and confidence.  The moment that is eroded, for whatever reason, no amount of after-the-fact engagement can restore what has been lost.  While I do not want to presume, I think that is the spirit in which the question was asked.</p></speech>

In the practical sense, I have this vision of a hospital situation where nobody dies but errors are made over a day, and then it is day six, and that one had better sit down at one's desk and fill in all one's errors. Then, a bundle of error pages gets handed to the next person, who puts them into the computer.  I see that as a list that is not going to be actioned and, within that time period, another incident could happen.  If a doctor makes a mistake on day one and makes the same mistake again on day five, how do we look at that family and say, "We said seven days", when, if we had said four days, the person would be alive?  I do not understand the seven days and think it is inefficient.</p></speech>

I am fully respectful that the seven days feels very long but the priority for us in considering it was to get the information to the patient first so that, with immediate effect, the practitioner can do the mandatory open disclosure with the patient.  That is the priority and the primary purpose.  After that, the reporting out to HIQA and other bodies is secondary, as was the intent.  Nonetheless, we take the Deputy's point with regard to the information becoming a list and all of that.</p></speech>

Nonetheless, it is a reality in clinical practice that people will look at the circumstances that have arisen in the past number of months and decide that the easiest thing is not to be involved in audit, as that is the safest way for them to avoid all of this trouble.  That is exactly the kind of response we do not want to see, even if we understand it.  We want people to participate in audit and to investigate what they are doing.  The purpose here is to try to create as much protection for them and to try to give them as much encouragement as possible.  That is the spirit of where we are coming from.  We want to try to address some of the known impediments to people's participation in audit, for example, the culture of fear.  Whether it is justified fear or not is another matter, but it is real fear that stops them from participating.  We hope that can be addressed through some kinds of assurances.  In particular, this legislation will, hopefully, give more assurance that we can increase the expectation that clinical audit is happening as an embedded part of the delivery of health care, which is not the case at present.</p></speech>

Is there not scope on an individual basis, when it comes to a hospital group or a trust, that the doctor would be told that if they were coming to work there, part of the contract is that they must sign up to the internal auditing process?  Is that not a step in the right direction.  I understand the point.  If it is made more likely that people get in trouble by being on a list, they will not bother.  However, I am slightly uncomfortable with the ethos of this.</p></speech>

There are provisions, for example, within the consultant contract, in respect of clinical audit.  While those are all necessary, they are individually not sufficient to enable us to have the kind of environment we want in terms of having routine clinical audit happening everywhere it should be happening.  That is why we are trying to do things through the national clinical effectiveness committee and trying to have a nationally organised system with a set of clear standards, and with this legislation creating a requirement on the Minister to produce standards that we can assess, and we can then mandate and prioritise audit.</p><p>If, for example, we have a national stroke audit happening across all our stroke services, we know it is happening to a standard, we can rely on its finding, we have given protections for individuals involved in the way that we have described, we have contractual arrangements that require people to be involved and the implementation levers, if I can put it that way, are all pointing in the same direction, then we can ensure the greatest likelihood of having full participation in a full national stroke audit.  I am merely using stroke as an example.</p></speech>

An explanatory note in the general scheme of Patient Safety Bill 2018, states, "Through Ministerial regulations, those "reportable incidents" which must be reported to the relevant reporting authority [...]" and it refers to a "detailed listing".  I am uncomfortable with two lists.  Who is the person who decides what is reportable and what is not?  There is a blurring of the lines.  I cannot understand why all incidents are not reportable in the same way and that they do not all enter the same database.  Maybe I am misinterpreting this.</p> <p>  On page 8, where it refers to private healthcare providers, it states, "Private providers of mental health services will be required to notify the Mental Health Commission".  How are they to notify it?  Is it by email or letter?  Would it be more logical, a bit like the yellow card system with adverse drug reactions, that there would be only one system and everyone logs on with his or her number and fills in the boxes?  Has the Department any comment on why there is more than one list?</p></speech>

When we originally were drafting this, we were not sure whether or not there would be a requirement to have a separate list for reporting incidents out as opposed to when we brought in the mandatory open disclosure.  We are now in the position that we are clear that it is the one list whether one is to report out those mandatory open disclosures.  We needed to get some advice on drafting and how that would go, and then what the Minister could do.  It is clearly one list.</p></speech>

Is there a danger that patients may be over-investigated or over-treated to ensure that absolutely nothing is missed because the fear of not doing so may leave one open to litigation or to being found to be acting irresponsibly?</p></speech>

The literature points to a situation whereby when disclosure happens in the way that I am describing where trust and confidence is maintained, it reduces the likelihood of litigation.  There are examples in jurisdictions where mandatory notification has been introduced where they have been able to demonstrate that there has been a reduction in the activity in terms of litigation.</p> <p>  Certainly, one of the fears is that individuals may feel that by making a disclosure they are contributing in some way to their own legal risk, etc., and that is part of the reason for the protection here.  It may almost be counterintuitive that a full implementation of an open disclosure with the balance between what we have struck here - mandatory in some cases but voluntary protections in the majority - is all aimed at ensuring that it is not optional and that it happens in every circumstance, and if it happens in every circumstance that it might contribute to a reduction in the likelihood of medical legal cases.</p></speech>

It would be an issue here with open disclosure that there was a delay in diagnosis and one would have to mandatorily disclose that there was a delay in diagnosis.  There might be pressures on the clinicians to engage in defensive medicine to ensure that there is absolutely no way that they can be left open to the accusation of a late diagnosis.</p></speech>

These kinds of circumstances can lead sometimes to not easily foreseeable and sometimes unforeseen consequences in terms of medical practice.  Without going into the details of cytology, we are moving into a different technology now in terms of the early identification of pre-invasive cervical cancer but if one looks across medical practice, there are many testings that base themselves on observer interpretation of what has been seen.  Radiology is a practice.  Pathology itself is a practice.  Our entire diagnostic activity is heavily dependent on those.  If we move the dial even a few degrees towards more conservative calling on the part of practitioners, we will subject large numbers of people to unnecessary further investigations, unnecessary treatment, etc.  I have a genuine concern about that.  It is easiest for a practitioner to not err and to be sure that he or she calls it in a more conservative way, if that makes sense, and leads to all sorts of consequences for patients and patient harm.  That is something that, collectively, we must be conscious of.</p></speech>

I am joined by my officials, Mr. Donal Kerr and Mr. Patrick McCabe.  The purpose of the motion is to seek approval of the Oireachtas to exercise Ireland&rsquo;s options under the 21st protocol annexed to the Lisbon treaty in respect of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the internal security fund.</p> <p>  Events of the last few years unfortunately demonstrate that security threats have intensified and diversified across the European Union.  The nature of these threats has not remained static but has evolved.  We see today that the threats European citizens face are increasingly cross-border in nature, meaning that member states must co-operate.  The European budget can support member states as we work to keep our citizens safe and, together, build a Union that is resilient to future security challenges and is better equipped to respond to emergencies that may arise.</p> <p>  The continued attractiveness of the EU as a politically and economically stable place in which to live, travel and do business depends greatly on its reputation as a genuine area of freedom, security and justice.  Among many other things, this requires that we minimise the threats from terrorism and serious cross-border criminality, including the scourge of terrorism, the ongoing menace of organised crime and the new frontier of cybercrime, which can have potentially devastating consequences for businesses, individuals and IT security.  Ireland has always been, and will continue to be, an enthusiastic and proactive supporter of co-operation in these areas.</p> <p>  The objectives of the internal security fund are based on the scope of its predecessor instruments, namely, the security and safeguarding liberties programme in the period from 2007 to 2013; the instrument for police co-operation, preventing and combating crime and crisis management, ISF-P, which was established by Regulation (EU) No. 513/2014 and formed part of the internal security fund in the period from 2014 to 2020; and the drugs policy part of the justice programme established by Regulation (EU) No. 1382/2013 in the period from 2014 to 2020.  All of these imperatives require financial support for the development of closer co-operation between law enforcement authorities, and for the exchange of personnel, ideas and best practice.</p> <p>  Ireland participates in the current ISF regulation, ISF-P, for the period from 2014 to 2020.  The current ISF fund has enabled high-volume investments, especially in IT systems, from which Ireland has benefitted, for example, Ireland&rsquo;s connection to the fixed Interpol network database, FIND, for linked member countries to access Interpol&rsquo;s global databases.  Under the current ISF, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acts as both the responsible authority and the audit authority.  My Department regularly reviews expenditure under the current ISF fund in Ireland through the ISF monitoring committee.  The monitoring committee is comprised of officials from both my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and works to ensure that Ireland achieves the maximum benefit from our allocated funding in full compliance with European Union law.</p> <p>  I will briefly describe the main features of the proposal.  The future ISF structure will contain a single general objective, which will be to contribute to ensuring a high level of security in the Union. in particular by tackling terrorism and radicalisation, serious and organised crime and cybercrime and by assisting and protecting victims of crime.  This reflects the Union's security policy.  The overall objective is supplemented by the following three important horizontal objectives: to increase the exchange of information among member states' law enforcement and other competent authorities and other relevant Union bodies as well as with third countries and international organisations; to intensify cross-border joint operations among member states' law enforcement and other competent authorities in respect of serious and organised crime with a cross-border dimension; and to support efforts at strengthening the capabilities in combating and preventing crime, including terrorism in particular, through increased co-operation between public authorities, civil society and private partners across the member states.</p> <p>  These are important objectives for all member states and the Union as a whole.  Ireland welcomes the commitment to enhancing the safety of all citizens by improving the capacity of member states to engage in active co-operation.  Reflecting the increased threats faced by European citizens and the attendant increased need for member states to work collectively to fight such threats, an important development in the proposal for the future ISF is the Commission&rsquo;s intention to multiply Union funding for internal security by a factor of 1.8.  The financial envelope of the internal security fund in the period from 2021 to 2027 will be &euro;2.5 billion in current prices.  This increase in funding is welcome and demonstrates the Union's determination to be a place of safety and security for all Europeans.</p> <p>  The main challenge the proposal aims to address is the need for greater flexibility in managing the future fund, along with tools to ensure that funding is steered towards EU priorities and actions with a significant added value to the Union.  The funding is implemented through shared management by the member states and direct-indirect management by the Commission.  A new thematic facility comprising &euro;1 billion will be allocated periodically allowing the funds, at the initiative of the Commission, to support targeted actions by member states and allow for a rapid response to immediate security challenges or emergencies.  The programming of actions under the thematic facility would be implemented through annual and multiannual work programmes adopted by the Commission implementing decision.  This new thematic facility will make it possible to address new priorities or take urgent action and to implement them through the delivery mode that is best placed to achieve the policy objective as time progresses during the funds period from 2021 to 2027.</p> <p>  Allocations under the future internal security fund will be based on a 60% to 40% split.  Some 50%, or &euro;1.25 billion, will be allocated to member states initially, with a later mid-term allocation of 10% or &euro;250 million.  The remaining 40% - &euro;1 billion - will be assigned to the new thematic facility.  Each member state will receive a one-time fixed amount of &euro;5 million to ensure a critical mass at the start of the programming period, plus an amount varying according to a distribution key weighted on the following criteria: 45% in inverse proportion to gross domestic product; 40% in proportion to the size of the population of the member state; and 15% in proportion to the size of its territory.</p> <p>  Importantly, this proposal also sets out the general principles that expenditure under the ISF must be consistent with EU policies and priorities, must be implemented in close co-operation between the Commission and the member states, and must be subject to sound financial management.  The proposal also contain provisions on management and control of the fund.  The proposal makes provision for the inclusion of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training, CEPOL, and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, EMCDDA, in the process of developing of member states' national programmes, and for these agencies' participation in monitoring and evaluation tasks under the proposal.  Member states will be required to submit annual performance reports from 2023 onward.  I am confident these measures and others to be further set out by the Commission in implementing acts will ensure that the future ISF achieves its objectives and delivers the maximum benefit for European citizens.</p> <p>  This proposal, while largely technical in nature, provides an effective foundation for the internal security fund for the period from 2021 to 2027.</p><p>This is, of course, welcome.  The proposal does not present any particular policy issue for Ireland and the Office of the Attorney General advises that it sees no legal impediment to opting in.  I am strongly of the view that Ireland should participate in the adoption and application of each of these proposed measures.  In doing so, Ireland will be in a position to benefit from financial assistance in pursuit of the various forms of police co-operation to which the proposed measures relate.  Our participation in the adoption of the measure would give Ireland a say in the final content, including on particular budgetary allocations within and between each measure.  Opting in at this point does not necessarily imply that all elements of the proposal are acceptable to Ireland.  Rather, it is a simple acknowledgement that we support the substance of the proposals and wish to participate in their negotiation and adoption.  Opting in now will lend weight to any policy position we adopt during the negotiation process and allow us to maximise our influence over the final shape of each regulation.  I hope the committee can support the exercise of Ireland's opt-in in respect of the proposed regulation.</p></speech>

Co-operation on security and tackling crime internationally is important.  However, this is a substantial fund and one which is different in a number of respects from the 2014 to 2020 programme.  I have a number of questions, which I ask the Minister to answer as briefly as he can, and I may then offer some observations.  What is the expected State financial contribution approximately to the new programme?</p></speech>

As such, it is difficult to specify what the Irish contribution to this fund will be as we are benefitting.  The fund will be drawn down by Ireland.  As our contribution must be seen as part of our overall EU contribution, it is not possible to identify how much we will contribute to the particular scheme or programme.  Rather, we will draw down a benefit, which will total of &euro;9 million over nine programmes.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister does not have it right now.  While there is a general overall allocation to Europe, I presume that if a country can opt out, the calculation of the budget of the fund can be made.  If it can be done centrally in Europe, we should surely be able to figure out roughly what we will contribute to this.  We may be net contributors to the EU, but will we be net contributors to, or beneficiaries of, this particular fund?</p></speech>

The increased budget is aimed partly at increasing the flexibility of the fund to accommodate targeted actions as agreed by the Commission.  A sum of &euro;1 billion will be allocated to provide that fluidity.  I understand that the single rulebook will allow the interworking of this fund with other projects and programmes of the European Union.

There has been a general welcome for them across EU states.  Some states have indicated they are not particularly happy with every aspect of every proposal.  Ireland has no particular concerns with the proposal as currently drafted.  However, we very much welcome our inclusion.  The Government is anxious to become involved in the process early and that is why I hope to have the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas by 2 October in order that Ireland can signal its early intention to become involved in this architecture.  The Government is particularly keen to ensure the relationship between member states and third countries be established early and intensified.  The reason for that is the impending withdrawal of our nearest neighbours, the UK, from the Union.  The manner in which it operates provides for a greater development of relations between the Union and third countries, having regard to the fact that the likelihood is that the UK will be a third country.  The Government has no concerns at present but it is monitoring its engagement and involvement with the roll-out of the proposals.  Once Ireland is at the table, it will be able to ensure that its voice is particularly heard and its influence brought to bear.  As far as the Government and the Attorney General are concerned, nothing that has been proposed is an issue that can cause any concern to Ireland in terms of its relationship with European security and defence.  Any changes to that would be subject to ratification by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in any event.</p></speech>

Much of that threat is perceived to be coming from extreme elements from certain regions of the world.

Has that been discussed?</p></speech>

That would be an issue more particular to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Government gives the highest priority to the security of the State and while there is not, and has not been, a specific threat to Ireland from international terrorist organisations, there is no complacency, as I have said previously.  It is incumbent on our authorities to ensure they take all the necessary security measures proportionate to any threat.  That is why opting into this fund will increase Ireland's capacity in respect of the sharing of information and ensuring we are well placed, along with our EU colleagues.  The Garda and the Army continue to carry out regular focused training exercises, both separately and together, often discreetly and sometimes in public, to ensure we are prepared.  On the specific issue of the policy choices of our EU colleagues, that is not something to which I have been a party.</p></speech>

That is true to a certain degree.  If the Government is worried about the safety of EU citizens and minimising the threat of terrorism, does the Minister not think we should try and stop the wars that are going on around the world?  If Ireland is going to opt in, it should be working for peace in order to reduce terrorism.  Ireland should be challenging the UK and France who are supplying Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates with arms that are creating untold destruction in Yemen.  Would the Irish Government be prepared to challenge the UK and France in this area, if Ireland did opt in?</p></speech>

Does the Minister not think, if this fund is designed to minimise the threat of terrorism, that there is merit in looking at the fact that as long as member states, or third countries with which they might want to co-operate, are involved in untold destruction in regions not far from European borders, that will undermine the security of EU citizens?  Is that not a concern for the Government?</p></speech>

The security of the EU and Ireland's domestic borders is a matter of considerable concern.  The Union is putting together an internal fund for disbursement throughout member states.  Ireland is opting in and it is all about internal EU security and funding.</p><p>We are not dealing with the overall foreign policy of other EU countries.  However important it might be, it is not an issue for this debate and it is not an issue of concern in the putting together of this fund to safeguard and bolster the internal security of the European Union.</p></speech>

If the Minister does not want to talk about them, why not talk about our own foreign policy?

Has the Government considered putting an end to the US military use of Shannon in the interest of peace?</p></speech>

It is important we recognise there are threats to citizens within the European Union.  They do not only come from terrorism but also from organised crime.  Increased co-operation between member states is necessary, particularly as a result of Brexit.  Many member states have significant experience of terrorism and the damage it can cause, including this country.  We cannot hide away from the fact that threats exist.  The fund is &euro;2.5 billion and &euro;1.5 billion will go to member states.  Each member state will get &euro;5 million at the outset and a sum will then be calculated based on the domestic product, population and territory of each country.  How much will Ireland get from that &euro;1.5 billion?</p></speech>

These involve the sharing of information, the application of appropriate hardware domestically and across the European Union and the appropriate software that will allow for the sharing of information and identification, for example, of passengers.  Some of the schemes under the EU Pr&uuml;m Convention are automatic fingerprinting, facial recognition, working closely with Interpol and other agencies and, for example, the roll-out of what will be the passenger information exchange, the increased level of advanced security at airports and facial recognition.  We are very keen that Ireland will play a full role in all of these programmes.  There are particular challenges for us from a security perspective in the context of Brexit.  We are keen to be at the table early to ensure we can participate in what will be best practice in the fight against terror, including in the exchange of suspects' names and watch lists, all of which is required to be done at very short notice, and the availability of information on identification and fingerprinting of those persons who would come into the State.</p></speech>

That will involve the expenditure of funding on a national basis to ensure that, for example, we fully participate in Schengen information systems and in the Pr&uuml;m regulatory framework.

I would question how much influence we will have given that we are a pittance in the big picture, as indicated from the financial figures mentioned earlier.  What is the big rush?  What is the problem?  Why do we need to have this completed by tomorrow?  Presumably, it is a choice.  We can join later on if we have a proper debate about it.</p></speech>

Many of these programmes are only being developed.  If we are involved at the initial stage of the development of these programmes, we can have our voice heard and exercise a level of influence.  The preparatory work involved will be time-consuming, especially as there are a considerable number of proposals within the justice and home affairs section being pursued at the same time.  The final language publication occurred last year, as far as the setting up is concerned.  Accordingly, I was very keen early on in the session that we would be in a position to participate.  It is not often possible to meet deadlines; we saw that last night in terms of a Seanad debate with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  I always take the view that if we can get in early, we can help shape the architecture.  I believe that is important.  In the overall context, we need to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the dedicated responsibility authority under the current scheme, is also fully prepared to embrace what to my mind is a very positive initiative.  I ask members to do what the Chairman proposed at the outset, namely, that he would note it, but I hope that at an early stage tomorrow or next week the Houses of the Oireachtas could approve the motion.  As the programme is rolled out, both I and the Garda Commissioner would be very happy to keep the committee informed of developments insofar as we can.</p></speech>

I am not sure that argument stands up to serious scrutiny given the size of Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>our European colleagues and their supposed expertise in dealing with terrorism and the like.  In terms of my question, we know the Minister is in a mad hurry for us to sign up to this by next week.  It is on the D&aacute;il schedule for tomorrow, to be taken without debate.  Given that I am none the wiser based on the vagueness of some of the answers colleagues have been given, I am asking what is the problem.  Why does the motion need to be on the agenda for tomorrow, without debate?  What are the consequences of that?  I believe the Parliament needs to discuss it.</p></speech>

I am just wondering, in weighing this up, about the consequences time-wise of Ireland not joining on 2 October.

The consequences would be that Ireland would not be participating at the shaping of these programmes, which I believe is important because when we are at the table we can voice and amplify our national interest.  There is a particular issue, as far as the relationship with third countries is concerned, that we are very keen to elaborate upon, having regard to the imminent withdrawal of our nearest neighbour and closest partner, the United Kingdom, from the European Union.</p></speech>

In terms of what I am asking, we heard that the Minister wants to participate on 2 October.  Is there a barrier to the Minister participating on 17 October?  Can he indicate that the Irish Parliament wants to discuss this matter and once we have sorted out the issue, we will attend on 17 October?  Is it the case that if we do not adopt this by 2 October, we will have lost our chance for a year?  Is there something that prevents us from doing so two weeks after 2 October?</p></speech>

It is important that Ireland takes its seat at the table, fully participates and has voting rights in the decision-making process and can use its influence.  Although members of the Opposition may believe that influence is weak and innocuous, I believe it is far stronger than not having a seat at the table.</p></speech>

I am concerned in regard to the backdrop of the view of the population on the Lisbon treaty.  This is an opt-in in relation to the Lisbon treaty.  I am very cognisant that we cannot divorce a discussion of internal security across Europe from security decisions made by the European Union such as to raise the borders and spend massive amounts of money on surveillance and security.  Those decisions are a mismanagement of funding and increase the likelihood of terrorism because of our interference in other regions of the world and so on.  Such decisions deserve scrutiny.  I am trying to find out if the D&aacute;il will have the opportunity to give them such scrutiny.  I acknowledge the point made by the Minister.  I intend to raise the issue tomorrow with the Business Committee.  It would be very helpful to the Business Committee for the Minister to be amenable to answering questions on the matter in the D&aacute;il and I will make members of that committee aware that he will facilitate that discussion.  Through such a discussion, I hope to explore the consequences of Ireland delaying its joining the process, a matter on which I have not gotten any further clarity.</p></speech>

We would not be involved in the initial stages and would not have voting rights.  It would be a signal that we are less than committed to what most member states, including Ireland, regard to be a very welcome development in terms of the sharing of information, closer co-operation and benefitting from a multi-million euro fund such that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could actively engage in formulating a programme for and on behalf of Ireland that would benefit our citizens and their security.</p></speech>

However, I do not accept the Minister's response because his argument has shifted.

I share many of the concerns expressed by Deputy Clare Daly relating to the lack of clarity on some aspects of this matter.  Although I may be wrong, it seems that in advocating for Ireland to be part of the process from the earliest possible stage in regard to the opt-out of third parties and third-party countries the Minister wishes to guard against some developments of concern which may impact on Ireland.  In the context of an opt-in to the process, I ask the Minister for further reassurance that, either through the Garda or co-operation with the Commission and broader European structures, a hardening of policing along the Border will not be facilitated through this process.</p></speech>

In terms of appreciating the operational status, I ask the Minister, as a member of the Government, to give a reassurance that any opt-in to the programme will not result in its resources, whether financial or otherwise, being directed towards that kind of policing along the Border.  What is the position of the Minister and his Department in that regard?  I will also put that question to the Garda Commissioner.</p></speech>

Neither I nor the Government are planning for such an eventuality.</p></speech>

My concern is that the Minister has not articulated the political position of the Government regarding an assurance that either he or the Garda will ensure that our participation in this programme does not result in greater policing of the Border or any form of hard border.  That has been raised on several occasions this morning.  It could arise as a result of pressure experienced domestically or applied by the European Commission.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to confirm my understanding of what he outlined, namely, that this is a measure which European Union countries wish to enact to help fight terrorism.  I appreciate that some people have historical baggage about fighting terrorism but this is a measure which will enable the European Union to preserve the type of structures we want to see, such as the ability for people to go out in the evening in their own city or country and securely move from one EU member state to another, and to ensure that the security services of the European Union act and co-ordinate together and with third countries where possible to ensure that we do not have situations similar to those which, unfortunately, have occurred so often in recent years.  If that is the intent of this proposal, it behoves us all to think of those impacted by such events and work towards the speedy implementation of the proposal.</p></speech>

This is done to ensure that we are prepared for terrorist attacks, engaged at a high level in the prevention of such and prepared for investigations of organised crime terrorist attacks while ensuring our people are protected.</p><p>I am very keen to do this at the earliest opportunity so that our voice is heard at the table and we have our voting rights under Article 3.  This is all about co-operation and ensuring we can benefit from the European architecture for information that is available.  This is a fund the EU is making available to member states and Ireland can be a beneficiary of this fund.  Having regard to the pressures on the public finances, particularly in the area of justice and home affairs, I would have thought this would be seen as a welcome development by this committee.  I am very keen for Ireland's voice to be heard at the table at the earliest opportunity and for garda&iacute; to be able to sit down with the European Commission and work on the various programmes that are involved.  We will keep the committee involved, as far as we can, as to the nature and roll-out of these programmes, all of which have the objective of protecting our citizens.</p></speech>

We are joined by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, who is most welcome; Dr. Helen Russell and Dr. Frances McGinnity of the Economic and Social Research Institute; Mr. John Dunne, chief executive of Family Carers Ireland and Ms Catherine Cox, head of communications; Ms Joan Canning and Ms Hilda Roche of the Irish Countrywomen's Association; and Ms Pauline of the Stay-at-Home Parents Association Ireland.  They are all very welcome.  I also welcome their colleagues in the Visitors Gallery.</p><p>I will invite witnesses to make opening statements in the order in which I introduced them.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I was staying in Connemara and, unfortunately, electronic communication from Connemara awaits the nationwide spread of broadband, which we all hope will occur shortly.</p><p>I am honoured to be asked to make a submission to this committee in connection with the scheme of arrangement for the 38th amendment to the Constitution.  I am not representing any particular group.  I take it that I have been asked simply because I have some knowledge of the law and the Constitution and have had experience over many years dating, I believe, from the time when there was an effort to remove the proportional representation method of election, of various attempts to amend the Constitution that have occurred during my lifetime.  As the committee knows, many official and unofficial groups have criticised Article 41.2 of the Constitution and have sought either its deletion or its amendment to make it gender-equal.  Even at the time of the drafting of the Constitution, prior to its enactment by the people, there were widespread protests by individual women such as Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and leading individual republican women against the idea of including this article, which pictured women's role as chiefly being that of wife and mother.  <br/><br/>It is necessary to look at the effect of this article over the years since its enactment.  The committee will have seen from my written submission that the understanding was that it was effected discriminatory arrangements such as the marriage bar on employment, which lasted until 1973, and a general discriminatory attitude to women's employment outside the home.  We must ask ourselves whether the article provided or provides positive or practical protection for the woman who remained in the home and cared for her children.  It seems this was not the case in law or in practice.  I had a personal involvement in the leading case I described in my written submission, namely, L <i>v.</i>L in 1989.  While the High Court was willing to grant the woman an ownership of the family home because of her role as a wife and mother, this was firmly rejected by every judge on the Supreme Court.  There were five judgments pointing out that this was not the kind of role that could be taken by relying on that and that legislation was the way to go.  Indeed, legislation was the route that was taken in the subsequent divorce legislation.  <br/><br/>Among many groups, it is widely agreed that Article 41.2 is outdated, discriminatory, and undesirable - at least in its current form.  The question before the Oireachtas is whether we should try to amend that article, simply delete it or try to include fathers and their place within the home and family.  It seems to me that the suggestion of widening the article to include fathers has distinct difficulties.  I accept fully that fathers in this generation have a more hands-on and inclusive role in fatherhood and childminding than fathers in my generation or previous generations might have had.  It is fair enough to include them in the first part of the article but what does one do with the second part, which basically says that women should be protected from working outside the home?  That is the part of the article that has been effective over the years in the form of the marriage bar and so on.  Should we say that fathers should be protected from working outside the home as well?  I think that is somewhat impractical.  On the other part, if we drop part two and the first part is left alone, it is simply a happy-sounding and vague sentiment rather than something will really affect people's lives.  <br/><br/>People have asked that the article be amended to include a recognition of the work of carers in general.  Again, I certainly appreciate the vital role played by carers and the need for more support for and recognition of carers of all kinds.  However, before embarking on such a course of action, one must ask what a proposed inclusion of carers in the Constitution would really achieve or whether we want legislation.  Most assistance for carers would involve decisions on public expenditure and one does not readily achieve anything from statements in the Constitution that require public expenditure.  It requires legislation as well.  Would the proposed inclusion achieve what is really needed or would it be what I have wickedly described as simply a pious aspiration?  Given that most assistance for carers would require decisions on public expenditure, the courts rightly regard these as the preserve of the Oireachtas and Government and believe that it is for the Oireachtas to decide these things, not the courts.  It is part of the division of powers.  There is a problem with regard to the definition of the word &quot;carers&quot;.  We have seen this in the somewhat strange suggestion by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, that we should give &euro;1,000 to every granny.  As a granny, that would be just lovely but such a suggestion falls down on the definition of the word &quot;granny&quot;.  Equally, when one gets to the definition of the word &quot;carer&quot;, which is a wide concept, there might be legal difficulties arising out of that subsequently.  <br/><br/>However much we regard carers, before we embark on constitutional change, we must examine what we really want to get, how exactly we want to get it and how we would avoid unforeseen later difficulties and problems.  One has only to consider the history of the eighth amendment plus the proposed 12th amendment, which did not pass; the 13th amendment; the 14th amendment; and finally the need for repeal, to understand what happens when one tries to change the Constitution without being extremely careful about what exactly we are saying and what it means.  Members are aware that the provision for divorce in the Constitution was excessively detailed.  This may have been needed at the time to get the referendum passed.  We would now love to be able to simplify and reform the divorce law but we must run a referendum and change the Constitution in order to do so.  The difficulty about framing a wording to assist carers is that we can fall between the Scylla of an anodyne aspiration and the Charybdis of an over-complex attempted direction of the Legislature that creates later problems.  <br/><br/>In summary, if we have decided that we are moving to take away Article 41.2, we should delete it <i>simplicitor</i>.  Let us simply delete the article.  If the will of the Oireachtas is to seek a referendum to benefit carers or to have a gender-balanced article, we should frame an article and think carefully with good advice about what wording we could have to avoid difficulties and to try to ensure it would be effective.  That is really all I have to say.  </p></speech>

My name is Helen Russell and I am the deputy head of the social research division at the institute.  I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Frances McGinnity.  Together we lead research on equality at the institute.<br/><br/>The role of the ESRI is to provide an evidence base for policy rather than advocate for a particular position, and it is in that capacity that we appear before the committee.  In our submission we present a number of ESRI studies, which shed light on the changing gender roles and the distribution of paid work and unpaid, and care, in Ireland.  The evidence shows that there is a clear mismatch between the role of women as framed in Article 41.2 of the Constitution and the reality of women's lives in the 21st century.  Our research highlights the need to assess the impact of policy and legislation on gender inequalities both inside and outside the home and in both paid and unpaid work.  It also reveals some of the complexities in defining unpaid work and care that may arise in the case of replacement wording for Article 41.2.  In our submission, we focus on three issues, namely, how the role of women in Ireland in paid employment has changed; the measurement and distribution of care and unpaid work; and the nature of policy support for combining employment and caring for young children.<br/><br/>I will first deal with the changing position of women in the labour market.  In a recent overview we documented this change over 50 years.  We saw that, starting from a very low base, women's employment gradually increased over the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s as a number of barriers were addressed, including the removal of the marriage bar and the introduction of equal pay legislation.  Women's educational qualifications over that period also increased.  The pace of change in women's employment accelerated even further in the 1990s and 2000s.  This period encompassed both significant policy development and an upsurge in demand for labour during the Celtic tiger era.  Women responded to these changes with a rapid movement into the labour market.  The employment rate for women rose from 36% in 1990 to 60% in 2016.  While the gender gap in employment rates has narrowed, gender differences persist in pay, the hours of work and conditions.  For example, one third of women work part-time compared with 13% of men and the gender pay gap has stuck at around 15%.  <br/><br/>The increase in female employment has been widespread and has included the mothers of young children.  In the Growing Up in Ireland study we oversee at the ESRI, we found that just over 50% of mothers are in employment when their child turns three years of age and almost 60% by the time their child is aged five, although OECD figures still show that the rate of employment among mothers of young children in Ireland is below the OECD average.  In summary, this evidence suggests that many women enter employment when afforded the opportunity and barriers are removed, though significant gender differences persist in the labour market.<br/><br/>I will now turn to our research on the gender division of caring and unpaid work and whether there has been a corresponding shift in men and women's involvement in unpaid work and caring.  There is significantly less information on this side of the equation.  I think that reflects the lack of visibility and the undervaluing of care work.  One of the first issues we need to consider when researching this issue is how broadly &quot;unpaid&quot; should be defined.  From a gender equality perspective, the distribution of domestic work such as cooking and housework is really important.  Therefore, in our research and, indeed, the international research on gender equality, we include both aspects alongside caring.<br/><br/>Time-use surveys are seen as the gold standard for measuring non-market work.  In Ireland there has been only one national survey of this kind, which we carried out at the ESRI in 2005 with support from the Department of Justice and Equality.  The survey showed that the quantity of this unpaid work is very substantial indeed, and that its distribution is strongly gendered.  On average, women spend just less than five hours per day on unpaid work while men did just under two hours of unpaid work per day.  Within this, women spent an average of two and a half hours per day on care, while men spent 39 minutes and these figures include care for both adults and children.  Data on the distribution of care work from a European-wide survey allow for some comparison over time.  It showed that in 2016, 44% of women and 25% of men in Ireland were involved in care work on a daily basis.  These figures were virtually unchanged since 2003, when the first European survey was undertaken.  The research suggests that there has been some change in the division of housework in Ireland but the gender gap for it remains wide.<br/><br/>In summary, the research highlights the scale of care and unpaid work and the importance of the making visible and valuing these activities from a gender equality perspective.  One step towards highlighting unpaid work is to measure it regularly by collecting time-use surveys like other countries do.  Such a measure would allow for an economic valuation of care work.<br/><br/>The final issue that the ESRI researched was the policy supports for combining care and employment.  In this section we focused on the care of children because that is where our own work has centred.  Historically, there has been a very low level of State support for childcare in Ireland.  Investment and policy development was, in part, curtailed by political ambiguity about the merits of supporting mothers to enter employment.  There has been an  increase in investment in childcare over the past decade, including the introduction of the free preschool year and the affordable childcare scheme, which represents a shift in policy.  Nevertheless families face a high burden of costs.  Comparative research shows that the cost of childcare in Ireland is one of the highest across the OECD.  The ESRI study showed that parents pay an average of 12% of disposable household income on childcare for one child aged three.  The study also clearly demonstrated that the amount that families pay for childcare affects how much paid employment mothers subsequently do, and that higher costs are associated with a subsequent reduction in women's paid work hours.<br/><br/>A further finding of the study was the considerable involvement of relatives, particularly grandparents, in providing childcare in Ireland.  At three years of age, among the children who are looked after outside of their homes, 23% of them were being cared for by a relative.  Some of that care was paid while some was unpaid.  In 55% of the cases, the relative was unpaid but in 45% of the cases the relative was paid.  This highlights the blurred boundaries between care inside and outside the home and between paid versus unpaid caring.  We might have to grapple with that and provide alternative wording.<br/><br/>I will briefly discuss parental and maternity leave.  Family leave is another important element of supporting the combination of paid work and care for children.  Provision for parents takes the form of maternity leave, paternity leave and parental leave.  The duration of maternity leave compares reasonably well with other European countries.  However, the relatively low maximum threshold means that the replacement rate for maternity benefit in Ireland falls well below the level found in a number of comparable EU countries.  Parental leave for both parents has been extended to 18 weeks per child but is unpaid and a father's entitlement to paid leave is confined to two weeks of paternity leave.  When one combines those supports and consider the amount and value of paid leave, one finds that Ireland falls in the lowest of three groups across 43 countries.  There is considerable scope there for improvement.  The international evidence also suggests that where fathers take parental leave, it can lead to a greater sharing of unpaid work and care within the household, and that uptake by fathers is strongly related to payment.  We know that the uptake of unpaid parental leave is very low among fathers in Ireland.  This evidence suggests that combining work and the caring of young children in Ireland remains challenging, and that there are still significant gaps in support.<br/><br/><b></b>In conclusion, the research that we have drawn on highlights there have been very significant changes in gender roles in Ireland but also the continued relevance of gender inequalities in the public and private sphere.  Care and unpaid work have consistently been undervalued yet the scale of that endeavour is very substantial.</p><p> The removal of the outdated gender stereotyping contained in Article 41.2 is an important symbolic move in terms of gender equality, a point that is recognised by a wide range of bodies.  Our research does not speak directly to whether it should be replaced by another form of text.  It highlights a small part of the complexity that faces individuals and families in balancing paid work, housework and care needs, which change over people's lifetimes.  It also presents some of the issues involved in defining care and non-market work that are likely to arise in the framing and interpretation of alternative wording to the article.  Our research also underlines the importance of a series of incremental legislative and policy changes that aimed to remove barriers to women's entry to the labour market and reduce gender inequalities in employment and access to resources.  These supports remain necessary so that women can exercise their right to equal participation in public life while recognising and valuing contributions to care work.</p></speech>

I will provide a brief introduction.  Family Carers Ireland is a national charity that, for 26 years, has worked to improve supports, services and recognition for anyone living with the challenges of caring for a family member or friend who is ill, frail or disabled or has mental health difficulties.  We have more than 4,000 members and operate 20 carer resource centres throughout the country and almost 100 community groups.  We also provide in-home respite and home care throughout the country as an approved HSE provider.  Our submission is based on our experience of supporting and advocating for Ireland's 355,000 family carers, which is a figure from the CSO rather than us.<br/><br/>On the issue of Article 41.2, Family Carers Ireland does not support repeal <i>simpliciter</i>.  Having listened to Mrs. Justice McGuinness, I am conscious that this puts us in direct opposition to her.  We acknowledge the arguments she makes, but we have reached a different conclusion.  I will explain why.<br/><br/>We have no issue with the overwhelming consensus that the article should be reworded to make it gender neutral.  We also agree with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, that the new wording should reference family life and that such reference should be understood as covering a wide range of family relationships, including situations where families do not live in the same home.  Most importantly, we believe that the replacement for Article 41.2 should make the recognition and support for unpaid care in the home that is implicit in the current wording explicit in the new wording.<br/><br/>Much of the discussion that I have heard about this issue so far has been in the context of the evolution of the Constitution and Irish society historically.  I will put it in a slightly different context, namely, the international context of today.  Ireland is typical of every country in the world, in that its health and social care system is predicated on complementary care and support provided through an extended family system.  However, Ireland is quite unusual in not specifying a constitutional framework around the respective roles of the State and the community in the provision of this care.  Virtually every other country in the EU has some sort of legal basis where this is stated, but it is not stated explicitly anywhere in Irish law or the Constitution.<br/><br/>Family Carers Ireland believes that the overwhelming consensus in Ireland would support a constitutional provision that recognised the family's primary role in the provision of care and the State's self-interested responsibility to support families in performing this role as well as acting as the provider of last resort where a family was unwilling or unable to perform the role properly.  There is survey evidence to suggest this is the case.<br/><br/>Our overall preference would be based on the relevant provision in the Portuguese constitution, namely, Article 67.  I have supplied a copy in my note.  However, we acknowledge that that particular format would not sit comfortably within the current structure of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  Therefore, we commend the wording that would probably sit best - that proposed by the Constitution Review Group in 1996 - to the committee and the Government, that being, to delete Article 41.2 and replace it with the following:</p><blockquote>The State recognises that family life gives to society a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.  The State shall endeavour to support persons caring for others within the home.</blockquote> <p>We would reject the suggestion that the second sentence be moved to Article 45, as we believe it is appropriate to frame the State's role as a &quot;duty of imperfect obligation&quot;.  I take the point that it is imperfect.  Were we writing the article from our own perspective, we would simply write, &quot;The State shall support&quot;, but we recognise that is unrealistic.  On the other hand, moving it to Article 45 would downgrade it to a &quot;guiding principle&quot;.  I do not mean to be smart when I say that we were looking for something stronger than that.<br/><br/>I take Mrs. Justice McGuinness's point that much of what we talk about in terms of supports involves expenditure and that, in a sense, the constitutional provision would be limited in that respect one way or the other.  However, it is not anodyne to have an actual recognition of the role in the Constitution.  It also happens to be in keeping with the Government's national carer's strategy, which sets out three principles, the first of which is recognition.  That is something that carers value very much.  They find themselves battling constantly against the system for what they need.  I am not trying to make a point today other than to say that, if they at least felt recognition in that ongoing struggle for what they were doing, it would be some consolation to them.<br/><br/>Article 41.2 has included the formula &quot;shall [...] endeavour to support&quot; for 80 years.  As Mrs. Justice McGuinness stated, it has not really worked and has hardly acted as a magnet for successful litigation or judicial subversion of the separation of powers.  Indeed, in the event of a challenge under the proposed wording, it seems reasonable for the State to point out that it spends approximately &euro;2.5 billion annually on its existing endeavours to support family carers through schemes that are defined in statute.  We would be critical of the adequacy and effectiveness of some of this expenditure, particularly the arbitrary pattern of its delivery in terms of a postcode lottery and the fact that care in the home saves the State well in excess of &euro;10 billion per year in return for its investment, but I struggle to see how any court might conclude that it did not represent a material &quot;endeavour&quot; in most circumstances.  We do not believe that this would open an enormous hole down which Government finances would disappear.<br/><br/>Others have already pointed out in this committee that judicable rights in the Constitution are not absolute.  What I have not heard in the considerations so far is the point that a right does not have to be enumerated in the Constitution to be guaranteed by it.  If the Government is worried about unknown risks, I venture to suggest that the risks are more controlled around a wording that includes &quot;duty of imperfect obligation&quot; than around an absence of any wording, which could leave the Supreme Court open to affirming any one or more unspecified and, therefore, potentially unqualified rights.<br/><br/>Deletion <i>simpliciter</i>has been described as the pathway with the fewest risks and the safest way forward.  We would argue that deliberately and publicly repudiating the contribution of family care in the home, which is what it would amount to, constitutes a much greater risk to society and public policy in the medium term.  Ireland faces a significant and rapidly growing demographic challenge.  There has been a 36% increase in our older population and a 63% increase in people living with a disability over the same period.  One in ten people living in Ireland is providing some level of family care.  With the demographic changes that we are expecting, this figure will need to increase to one in five by 2030 if our existing policies and systems are to be sustainable.  How will this happen without a clear social contract between the State and family carers?<br/><br/>In recent years, it has not been unusual to hear leading Government figures speak of building an Ireland that is the best place in the world in which to live, work and grow old.  We would all agree with that.  Where is that ambition hiding in talk of running away from the &quot;unintended consequences&quot; of modernising Article 41.2?  Do we want to take the pathway of least risk or the right pathway?  We should be thinking in terms of intended consequences, those being, to recognise and support care in the home.</p></speech>

The ICA welcomes the opportunity to make this presentation and to contribute to the discussion on the proposed amendment of the Constitution addressing Article 41.2.  On behalf of the national executive board, my colleague and I will outline the observations of the ICA on this matter.  We hope that doing so will assist the committee in its recommendations and in the most effective next steps to ensure that the Constitution will be reflective of Irish society generally and the role of women in Ireland in the 21st century.</p><p>I will deal with points one to four and my colleague Ms Roche will deal with the remaining points.  </p><p> The ICA is a well-known and respected organisation in Ireland and has had a significant role since its foundation in 1910.  In more than a century, the association has been a vital support to women who gained personally, emotionally and vocationally in being part of a community based, but nationally representative, women&rsquo;s organisation.  Our communities and our families benefited from the personal development which we all experienced, and from the association&rsquo;s attention to all aspects of women&rsquo;s lives.  The ICA has been a lead voice in campaigning for change to benefit women individually, as well as to enhance family life and that of the wider community.

We believe that the wording in the Constitution has been interpreted in a narrow and restrictive way rather than facilitating a rights-based approach, ensuring that the value of nurture and care would be resourced, supported and valued.  We take the view that as it stands, the wording confined women to the role of unpaid homemakers, although even back in the 1930s this hardly reflected the reality of many women&rsquo;s lives, whether in farming, family businesses or other work.  Then, as now, thousands of women were also critical to the economic survival of families.  The fact is that identifying women in their role in the home served to provide the basis for discrimination such as the marriage ban and differential wage rates for women and men.  We reject any intent or interpretation that fails to recognise women as equal citizens and contributors to our society.</p> <p>  Today, we recognise increasingly the diverse roles of men and women within our families and intergenerationally.  We also have a greater understanding of the shared and mutually enhancing roles of men and women in the caring responsibilities, whether of children or older relations, and in supporting healthy communities.  At the level of the family, care responsibilities involve huge strain.  We have not managed to create the correct infrastructure or an appropriate way of thinking about these realities as being equally important as economic sustainability and development.  These are just a few observations we believe are relevant to a debate which should focus on care and nurture as a social necessity and an essential good.  We would hope that a national conversation would pose many questions and provide for a real opportunity to consider questions such as these.  Does the Constitution require a statement which endorses and underpins the value of families, and perhaps communities, as central to the support, care, nurture and development of us all?  What difference do we want to make and what is required to realise that difference?  How do we reflect the importance of men and women in the intergenerational care "contract" and is the Constitution the starting point?  Do we need to be even more explicit about the equality of all citizens and the multiple roles that we all carry and have the potential to achieve?

Being seen goes to the heart of what I am going to talk about, so that recognition was really important to us.  I was to have a colleague here today and it is appropriate to say that she is with her three children because her husband could not take time off of work for her to be here.  I will start with that in an emotional way because this is emotional for us.  When we go into the polling station as people who are carers and have been carers and mark an X beside a "Yes" or a "No" on that ballot paper, we are all attempting to assert our values.  It is not a piece of legislation.  It is something more visceral and it is important to remember that the Constitution is a document that represents the people&rsquo;s voice.  That includes carers.</p> <p>  We also support the approach of the National Women's Council of Ireland.  Today, therefore, we are calling for an amendment to Article 41.2 that is compassionate,  including the removal of the paternalistic and sexist language that we can all agree is offensive and the inclusion of a recognition that nurturing is important to who we are as a nation.  We mean this in the broadest possible sense of community.  We respectfully question the idea that deletion is simpler.  Life is not always simple and it exists in the margins of economic activity far too often.  We feel this is a unique opportunity to express ourselves as a people and if further examination is required to do this, then that is important work and can be done before any referendum takes place.  </p> <p>  I am going to touch first on the notion of equality because this seems to have been key to the Minister&rsquo;s motion.  We firmly believe that the liberation of women is being conflated with economic activity for women rather than looking at equality within the home and the workforce.  There are many different measures that can be taken within the workforce as well as within the home.  Some may say that care work is something that holds us back as women and as a society, but in fact it is the lack of choice, the lack of financial support and the lack of recognition that really holds us back.  Whether we work outside of the home full-time, part-time or not at all, caring still happens. The cared for must still be cared for by someone.  We know that, currently, women carry out most of this work.  We would like to see a more equal contribution from all genders and we believe that this can be achieved only by elevating the status of care work.  Even within the paid workforce women carry out the majority of care work, such as in cr&egrave;ches, and these roles are among the lowest paid.  Who are we that we diminish the value of being with children and vulnerable adults and put every other work above that?  </p> <p>  When we voted "Yes" on 25 May, we voted not only for the choice to end pregnancies, but also "Yes" to support with the continuation of pregnancies for those who made that choice.  Deleting care from the Constitution flies in the face of the commitment made on the doors, including my me, to support all choices.  I am speaking on my own behalf when I say that.  I will outline some practical considerations that we feel people should take on board when it comes to the referendum.  I ask that we put ourselves in the shoes of those going in to vote.  We do not want to pit ourselves against anyone.  That can often happen when people are in different circumstances in the home and outside of the home.  We are fearful that a referendum that offers deletion versus retention instead of amendment versus retention would do that.  </p> <p>  With tax individualisation in 2000, the reduction in supports for lone parents who care at home and the lack of an increase for foster carers, we have experienced at first hand the erosion of the supports for families.  Article 41.2 has never been challenged directly and certainly not in the Supreme Court.  Even as it stands, however, it could be argued that certain minimal supports such as child benefit and home carer tax credit could be dented more easily if it were removed without amendment.  This will weigh heavily on our members and other carers, who rely on these and other supports, when the time comes to vote.  They will be weighing up their commitment to gender equality, which most of us genuinely have, with the hard facts of looking out for our families' financial survival and our children's futures.  </p> <p>  The Stay-at-Home Parents Association is a relatively new organisation, unlike some of the others here.  We were formed out of a common feeling of isolation and the lack of a voice.  There are no trade unions for those engaged in unpaid work nor could we afford to join a union.  No statutory bodies have been established to support our work in the home but we are a huge section of the population, past and present.</p><p>From the outset we have been firm as an organisation in our belief that all families should be supported equally, whether engaged in paid or unpaid work and whether headed by lone parents, married or cohabiting couples, including those from the LGBT+ community.  As an organisation we are secular.  We will take people from any religion and none.  We want to be recognised for our diversity as families in the broadest possible sense in an ever-changing society.</p><p> What is care?  There is the physical and mental labour it entails, but there is also the time away from paid employment that we cannot ignore.  It always means providing for those who cannot earn an income and, therefore, it is financially a very difficult position for most.  The committee may have heard that more parents would choose to work outside of the home if childcare was affordable.  Some would but there are also many who cannot afford to stay home.  It is the lowest paid who return to work the fastest because they need the financial support.  The fact that we need more childcare is true.  That is a discussion for another day.  We certainly believe that everybody should have all choices on the table but staying at home is almost never the cheaper option, yet the majority, 62%, of those who stay at home are the sole caregivers to their children according to the CSO.  To this figure should be added all of those who are cared for and those who care on a non-full time basis - on maternity leave, on parental leave, and during every single waking moment outside of paid employment.  As a society we would not be looking for these supports if being with family and community did not matter to us.  </p><p> While we seek to put forward the position of parents and guardians caring for children - and that is my job here today - we believe that the care of older persons and vulnerable adults is equally important.  Many of us in this room would be in that position.  We also recognise the valuable social and cultural contribution that the children and adults who are being cared for make to society.  This is often forgotten.  We are carers for people because those people matter.</p><p> The reason care work should be recognised in the Constitution, as opposed to in legislation, is that Governments enacting such legislation are often concerned with short-term economic activity - budget to budget kind of stuff.  The Constitution should assert higher values.  Fundamentally we want Governments now and in the future to take note that paid labour market activation is not the only goal of our society, in fact it is a means to an end for our society and not a goal at all.  We want time with our families whatever their shape and wherever we work.</p></speech>

I thank one and all.  Before we go into Members' contributions, I propose we do not pose questions to which I need to seek five different answers.  We want everyone to be a participant but it would be helpful if Members were to indicate, perhaps, two witnesses they would like to respond to a given question.  They might juggle it around a little bit and shuffle it.  We will then get through our work in a reasonable timeframe.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan is first.

I thank all the witnesses for coming in this morning and for the reports they have prepared.  I have found them very helpful.  It is also very encouraging that people attach such importance to the Constitution, really regard it as their document, and are very concerned about how and if it should be changed.  Where we are as a committee, and where I believe everyone here today is, is that everyone believes that the wording in Article 41.2 is inappropriate and that it should go.  There are three options for us a committee when we come to making a recommendation.  The first is that we just recommend deletion.  The second is that we recommend amending the article not in a meaningful way but just to make it gender neutral and more fair in respect of gender.  The third option is that we would amend it in a meaningful way so that it would become a socioeconomic right under the Constitution.  My own preliminary view, and I have not reached a final view, is similar to the view of Mrs. Justice McGuinness, which is that deletion is probably safer.  Perhaps I am being over cautious about that.</p> <p>  In terms of a proposed amendment to Article 41.2, would Mrs. Justice McGuinness agree that it is meaningless at present in terms of giving rights to women or even entitling a man to take a claim that he has been discriminated against because he is not mentioned there?</p></speech>

Listening to the other people, my opinion definitely makes me appear to be the nasty one who recommends simply deletion and so on.  This is, of course, not based at all on me not appreciating everything that carers and fathers and mothers do.  I am a mother and a grandmother myself.  I am just listening to what the ESRI said.  I listened to the figures it gave and it seems that they provide a perfect illustration of the fact that the existing article has done no good at all for equality for women or families.  That is the fact.  If we are thinking of creating a new article about carers - and I believe that most of us agree we are talking about carers in general, not just bringing men into the original article along with women - we really have to look at the effect it can have given that the Constitution is not a policy document.  I know it also sets out values, but it is a basic law.  We would have to look and see.  If one asks me to say something one gets a legal opinion.  It would have to be envisaged whether, if there was a challenge in court as to whether the good things that were set out in the amendment were actually being done by the Government, the courts could grant what the Deputy has rightly described as a socioeconomic right.  As the Deputy will know, the Irish courts have been remarkably reluctant, certainly in recent years and at least since Cearbhall &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh, to grant socioeconomic rights.  I am not totally against putting in something that would show the value of caring but I ask the Deputy please not to think that it will mean that every Government will leap into really doing something practical.</p></speech>

The courts are hardly going to interpret that differently.</p></speech>

I just think a cleaner way of doing it would be to take out the article that we have rather than trying to mess around with its wording and then to try to frame and set out <i>de novo</i>a broader article.  We just should not think it is going to achieve the devil and all.  I certainly do not think there would be anything wrong in doing that.</p></speech>

I think the wording "shall endeavour" has delivered.  There have been policies to support care in the home over the years.  There may not have been much judicial review of them.  I assure Deputy O'Callaghan that if a provision with the wording "shall endeavour to support carers" goes in and we feel it is being neglected, we will take the opportunity to challenge that as an organisation.  In doing so, we would recognise that it would be quite easy for the State to defend, so it would have to be something pretty egregious before it would be used.  The main point of our argument is not about socio-economic rights; it is about recognition and the fact that, like it or lump it, that provision is in the Constitution.  Taking it out will be seen as a significant regressive step.  This is why we recommend putting in something which is not at all a whole lot stronger but at least leaving it in the Constitution as an acknowledgement of the value of care in the home.</p></speech>

I will set out what my concern about an amendment would be.  I ask the witnesses to consider what would happen if we changed the provision significantly and it was then left to the courts to interpret some new article.  When courts interpret rights under the Constitution, they do so on the basis of the people who take cases before them.  I gave the example last week of an 18 year old who collects his sister after school at 2.30 p.m. and minds her until the parents come home at 6.30 p.m.  What I would not like to see is some vague right put in, that individual going before the court and a judge telling him he comes within the definition of a carer in the home and is entitled to be financially compensated and rewarded by the State.  Then the State would just deal with him and it would affect the whole social welfare policy and budget that the State affords to carers in general.  That is my fear about it, and I do not think it is an irrational fear if we go down the line of creating an absolutely new right.  I do not know whether Ms Canning, Ms Roche or Ms O'Reilly wish to comment.  I think they advocated that there be a really strong right within the Constitution to-----</p></speech>

I am sure it can be done in order that the wording could be amended so it would not give rise to any new interpretation.</p><p>I wish to ask the witnesses about one final point.  I mentioned this to my colleagues yesterday.  There is another provision in the Constitution, Article 45.4.2&deg;.  I will read out to the witnesses what it says.  It comes under the directives in respect of social policy.</p><blockquote>The State shall endeavour to ensure that the strength and health of workers, men and women, and the tender age of children shall not be abused and that citizens shall not be forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their sex, age or strength.</blockquote> <p>I am not putting the witnesses on the spot here, but this provision is perhaps similarly anachronistic since it suggests that there are certain &quot;avocations&quot;, which are jobs, that people cannot do because of their sex.  I do not know if there are any that remain, but this was written in the 1930s, in fairness.  Perhaps the witnesses could get a chance to reflect on this, even if they cannot do so today.  It could be amended by the deletion of the word &quot;sex&quot; in order that we would still take account of age and strength.</p></speech>

I think it has been fairly clear from last week that Article 45.2 is non-justiciable.  I do not think it will take much for us to hash that out in public to make it clear.  I think deletion versus retention is probably much more dangerous politically than anything else.  Voters would go into a polling station and have the two options, one of which is about care and one, as I think I outlined there, about removal.  Child benefit has been spoken about a couple of times this year.  It is very fresh in the minds of those who care in the home that removal of this article without putting something in creates a fear for people.  We would then have to go into the polling station and balance how we feel about gender equality, which is a no-brainer, and how we feel about our families.  If, however, we are in the polling station and we see the option to retain something that is clearly sexist versus amending it with something that values us, it is a no-brainer.  That is what I would say from a political perspective.  I take the point that the Constitution is a legal document - I myself have been a solicitor in the past - but it also has a non-legal basis, which we all recognise, and political decisions are made on the basis of what it says in the Constitution, which is only right.</p></speech>

There was a bit of a discussion some time ago to the effect that we should just proceed with the constitutional proposal as it was, as formulated by the Government.  I think this hearing and the previous hearing have been valuable because there is an interesting discussion to be had on this as to whether there should be a simple deletion or whether there should be a replacement.  I am in a similar position to Deputy O'Callaghan except on the opposite side of the equation in that I hold an open mind but that I am generally more inclined to replacing the current constitutional provision with something that is gender-neutral and provides a meaningful recognition of the role of carers.  Having said that, I retain an open mind on the matter.  These hearings are also useful in concentrating our minds, as legislators, on some of the legislative issues that need to be addressed in supporting stay-at-home parents, maternity and paternity benefit, shared parental benefit and leave and all kinds of other issues which need to be addressed.  The Constitution is our basic law and there is a statement of principles there too, but obviously the legislation needs to be there too.  At present we are dealing with a proposal regarding a constitutional question.  I will direct my questions primarily to Mrs. Justice McGuinness but perhaps also to some of the other speakers as we go along.  As with Deputy O'Callaghan, if any of the speakers or organisations want to offer a comment on any of the questions, that would be welcome too.</p> <p>  I will correct Mrs. Justice McGuinness if I may.  I do not think anyone thinks she has come across in any way as nasty or anything like that.  I think everyone very much understands that this is a legal discussion so I think everyone appreciates the perspective from which she is coming.</p> <p>  Regarding Article 41.2, if the wording were to be along the lines of that proposed by the constitutional review group, I think, which was the point put forward by the family carers, if Mrs. Justice McGuinness were a lawyer at this point in time and if someone came to her asking whether he or she could take a case on the basis of that wording, does she think there would be any obvious justiciable angle for anyone who wished to pursue such a case?</p></speech>

The difficulty about taking cases on any of these articles is that so many of them involve public expenditure.  It is clear in the basic laws of the country that public expenditure is the task of the Oireachtas, led by the Government.  The courts are unlikely to order public expenditure, other than in certain cases in which money is owed to citizens.  I mention as an example a case in which a large number of elderly people in nursing homes were wrongly charged a fee for their care.  That question arose as a constitutional area which was dealt with by the Supreme Court, which ordered that all the money should be paid back to the elderly people who had been wrongly charged.  This judgment was unpopular enough from the Government's point of view.  That kind of decision can be made.</p> <p>  I suggest there is a good case to be made for making a supportive overall statement about care in general.  Care occurs inside and outside the family.  Young people and older people are cared for.  I would not by any means entirely agree with setting that out in the Constitution as a kind of ideal value, but that is a separate thing from fiddling about by amending the article that is in place now.  It is better to say that we will get rid of this and put in what we really want.  That is the simplest way of approaching it.  On the other hand, I do not see a case arising in which a carer tries to establish a case.  I would also fear that we might get a kind of unbalanced thing along the lines of what Deputy O'Callaghan set out.  It is almost better to try to fight for what we want on the political and legislative front.  It is not that we do not want it - we do - but it would be a mistake to think that by putting it into the Constitution, we would be doing more than saying this is a value we hold.</p> <p>  When we start looking at Article 45 of the Constitution, we find all sorts of splendid things that we should be concentrating on.  People do not take much notice of it because it cannot be fought in the courts.  I agree with the Deputy O'Callaghan about the subsection of Article 45 from which he quoted, but it is doubtful that we are willing to embark on a referendum to take the word "sex" out of it.  We have to remember what we use the Constitution for.  If we are going to include a clause relating to the value of care inside or outside the home, we should use that almost as a directive, similar to Article 45, to persuade the political parties and Independents as they come up that this is a policy they should be aiming for.  I am afraid that in such circumstances, we would have to keep fighting on the ground to get the actual legislation and the actual expenditure that is looked for.</p></speech>

As Mrs. Justice McGuinness has suggested that the difficulty with including a provision of this nature in Article 45 is that it might well be disregarded as all the other parts of Article 45 have been.  I am trying to understand whether, as far as Mrs. Justice McGuinness can see, it would be the case that if we were to adopt a wording like that proposed by the Constitution Review Group, there would be no obvious cause of action.  I know that is not the argument she is making, but it is a fair suggestion to make?</p></speech>

Given that there have not been many successful actions on the basis of the current provision, it might seem that no obvious case could be taken on the strength of such a wording.</p></speech>

We argued that the provisions of Article 41.2 relating to the value of a woman's work in the home should mean actual money or possession in the hand.  We were met with a kind of cold dismay by the Supreme Court for suggesting that.  Mr. Justice Barr had given us half of the family home in the High Court, but that was overturned completely by the Supreme Court.  We can try to think of what would be a cause of action.  Of course it would be possible for someone to say in a case that this is stated in the Constitution.  Such a person would have to be sure that he or she was trying to claim something concrete - some actual benefit - rather than asking whether we are supporting carers properly.  For instance, one can claim in equal pay cases that one is establishing whether it is equal pay for equal work and that kind of thing.  One cannot make a sort of generalised claim.  One has to find an actual plaintiff.  When the Supreme Court is asked to decide whether an article is effective, it much prefers to do so on the basis of a specific case with a specific plaintiff.  It does not really like vague referrals.  I just do not see that happening.</p></speech>

I believe we need both.  I believe we need to keep this in the Constitution.  We need to recognise and value the work of carers.  Of course we need practical legislation.  The Government is currently drafting legislation on a statutory entitlement to home care, which will support that.  Mrs. Justice McGuinness mentioned the need to be careful to give great consideration to what we are doing and to get good advice.  I believe all of that to be the case.  We can still do that while keeping an amended version of this section.  We can get all the advice before we amend.  If we delete the relevant section now, the recognition we have now will be deleted.</p></speech>

I am simply trying to answer a concern that, frankly, I find a bit over the top, namely, that changing this provision in the way suggested by the Constitution Review Group will led to a floodgate of claims.  We do not anticipate that and I said as much in my submission.  Mrs. Justice McGuinness is also saying this.  There is no conceivable way.  There was a suggestion at the end of that discussion that it be subject to legislation.  I believe, however, that would be redundant in the context of the way the State and the Constitution work.  I just do not believe that it would be needed.  We do not envisage it.</p> <p>  The idea of someone going in and saying "I collect my sister from school every day and I bring her home and give her tea and biscuits until our mother comes home from work so I want a carer's allowance" would be laughed out of court.  We would be laughing along with everybody else because that would be a nonsense.  The State's answer is that it has limited resources and they are concentrated a certain way.  I cannot imagine any normal person in Ireland going with that.</p> <p>  I shall provide the Deputy with a different scenario, which is not a socio-economic right and which is relevant to this committee.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 will be commenced some day next year.  On the day it is commenced wards of court will cease to exist.  The State has given itself three years to work out the current wards of court into the new system.  On the day it commences every family carer in Ireland will be cast into a legal limbo until such time as they can register through the courts as an appointee under the system.  We raised the point - which we thought not unreasonably - that if the State was giving itself three years to do that then how about giving carers who have been caring for perhaps 18 years already three years to also do it.  The answer we received was "No, that would be against the spirit of the legislation because while parents are wonderful we all know that you cannot trust them all."  That is a situation where one might have a question on whether we are really valuing care in the home if that attitude is being taken.</p></speech>

I understand the logic but I suppose it is the realities of this institution and democracy in Ireland.  I would be hesitant regarding a two-part process where we delete and then try to come up with a <i>de novo</i>process for coming up with a new proposal.  While constitutional change has accelerated in recent years there is only so much bandwidth for referendums and for these  institutions to process additional proposals.  It is my view that there is no urgent rush with this.  We would like it to be expedited but I would rather that this debate was as comprehensive as possible, that some process followed on from these committee hearings and that we can develop a comprehensive wording - or a wording that satisfied people.  I would be concerned that the second part of that process could be lost, or if it was removed then perhaps one would not get around to putting in anything on foot of it.</p><p>My other point is tangentially related and I put it to any of the witnesses but to Mrs. Justice McGuinness in particular.  With regard to Article 40, is there room for further rights to be found?  Do we as the Legislature need to do more to consider what are social and economic rights?

He had experience of the Irish Constitution when he lectured in Trinity College Dublin on law.  I was a student of his at one time.  They put a right to housing into their constitution and to an extent it was enforceable in that the Supreme Court in South Africa directed certain ways in which the money that was to be given to housing was to be divided by the Government.  To a degree there was an enforcement of a socio-economic right like that.</p> <p>  We are used to what is called the common law system, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, which is basically in Britain, in Ireland and in many countries that were formally British colonies such as Australia and Canada and so on.  Canada would be the nearest to having a constitution that would enforce certain socio-economic rights.  That would be Canada and South Africa.  To an extent it has been effective.  Provided one had a Supreme Court that was willing to move in that direction something like that might be achieved.</p> <p>  What concerns me is that the division of power is such that the Supreme Court itself will decide whether or not it is going to enforce socio-economic rights and it is not for us to decide that.  Generally we have not done that.  It is difficult because to try to embark on that means that one is directing the Government how it spends taxpayers' money.  The taxpayers themselves might not be all that appreciative of the idea of a set of lawyers sitting up there, who have no skin in the game, directing how taxpayers' money is going to be spent.  The tradition is that politicians are responsible for that, and it is a very responsible task that takes a great deal of thought.  Members themselves know how difficult it is.</p> <p>  Members could always look at parts of Article 45 that might inspire them if they wanted directions in which to go.  I was going through the Constitution - as the question was raised - and Article 45.2 states, "That the ownership and control of the material resources of the community may be so distributed amongst private individuals and the various classes as best to subserve the common good."  It might give rise to some thought, even in a country where it appears that the difference between the wealthy and the poor is growing.  That is nothing to do with what I was supposed to be talking about; I am just being evil.</p></speech>

I was in the Seanad speaking on a matter but the contributions I have heard from this committee have been excellent.  I thank the witnesses for that.  I have read other contributions also.  I was very happy to hear that the approach being taken is to not pitch different groups of women against each other.  I strongly believe that the only way we are going to achieve real equality is by working together for our common good and the elevation of all women in Irish society and the world, so I was very glad to hear that.</p> <p>  I have a brief comment before I pose questions.  With regard to the cleaner approach being the deletion of the article, one could say that about every article in the Constitution.</p><p>It would be much cleaner for everybody if most of them did not exist so I do not consider that to be a basis on which we should proceed.  I come to this with an open mind and am listening to the contributions.  I will weigh them up, discuss them with my colleagues and decide our approach then.</p><p> This is my question to any and all of the witnesses.  We could change the language in the article to be gender neutral and remove the economic element, which would serve the purpose of recognising the value of care, and that would then remove the public expenditure element, since we are afraid of creating economic rights and taking that public expenditure role away from the Oireachtas.  Would that be enough to elevate the status of care?  If we are to have this article as a persuasive point, for the witnesses to use to lobby us and for us to use to lobby the Government, would it be enough to neutralise it with regard to gender, remove the economic element and have this debate in the Oireachtas, with a discussion of care on the airwaves and in the campaign?  I think it is very hard to say.</p></speech>

I do not want to go down that route.  I have worked outside and inside the home and do not want this to become a media frenzy.

We said we would support the words, "the State shall endeavour to support persons caring".  Having said that, we would much prefer the wording, "the State shall support".  Nevertheless, we are willing to be reasonable.  If the State gives a commitment to endeavour to support persons caring, it would brings us further.  We do not want to remove the support element.  We want to keep that and we want recognition but we also want support.  We are willing to accept the phrase, "endeavour to support".</p></speech>

One could argue that under this proposed constitutional provision, we could charge in and say that one only has to be providing five minutes of care.  I am happy to point out that this is not where we are coming from.  I assume any state would argue that the wording, "shall endeavour", is an unreasonable claim.  It could be argued that the requirement to provide 40 hours of care should be reduced to the average working week.  In principle, however, the State has the right to regulate how it will manage its finite resources.  There is no question that it must do that.  This is as much about the symbolism of removing a provision from the Constitution.  If it was not in the Constitution, we would be having a very different debate about whether it would be worth inserting it.  Our biggest concern is the sort of message we will send if we remove the provision.</p></speech>

I take the point being made about the removal of one phrase and leaving nothing in its stead.  That is a point which the Oireachtas will have to consider carefully because it seems valid to me.  With regard to what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, one can phrase something in such a way that it might imply that the State should be giving financial support without making it so directive that it would go outside the usual constitutional framework.  Many things in the Constitution imply expenditure, such as the article that refers to providing for education.  One has to bear in mind the difference between providing education and providing for education, which has been a constitutional question.  The wording could be adjusted in such a way that it would not be outside a normal framework of constitutional wording but we should not be too scared about implying that the State would have to spend some money.</p></speech>

This has been an excellent meeting.  We made the point last week that the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny was demonstrated very well by those who appeared before the committee.  That also applies to today's meeting, which has been incredibly helpful.  In that sense, I do not have a many questions because the witnesses made a very strong case and, thankfully, most of them took a view similar to my own, namely, that the provision should be replaced and we should tease out how we should do that.</p> <p>  The first thing that strikes me is what people seem to be saying, that this can be - and already has been for me - a very important values clarification process for Irish society at a juncture when we are maybe evaluating a new Ireland or new family life.  In that sense, this could be empowering.  The Government has put forward a two-tier strategy.  It recognises that we need to move from the past but says we will take the provision out and then discuss the future.  The witnesses are saying that even by doing that, we would downgrade the role of carers and unpaid work and place a poor value on it.  People may want to discuss that two-stage process.</p> <p>  This ties in with a point Deputy Jim O'Callaghan made when he spoke about a symbolic provision rather than a meaningful one, although he probably did not mean it in that way.  I hear from the witnesses that symbolism is meaningful.  While it is not enough, it is not meaningless either.  Perhaps the witnesses will address that.  If we all agree that something should be inserted in the Constitution, would the witnesses facilitate a mechanism such as the Citizens' Assembly if it was established quickly with a view to doing what has been proposed, or is it too early for that?</p> <p>  A referendum next summer to tie in with the local and European elections was discussed.  Do the witnesses think there is enough time to provide for that?</p> <p>  I have a question for the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, regarding the 2005 report.</p><p>Its witnesses said it is the only evaluation that has been done of unpaid work, which is incredible.</p><p> The witnesses made their point so powerfully that they almost robbed us of decent questions so I will make a comment instead.  We are only valuing paid economic activity and unpaid activity is not given its place, even though it has huge value.  Is there any more research on the subject?  Mr. Dunne said we were unique in not recognising the carer role.  Can he explain what he means by this?  The Minister would put it differently.  He would say it would be unique to recognise it, which is opposite.  All the witnesses highlighted what we need as a society and what our values should be as regards putting care work on a parallel footing to other activity.  I am confident that, based on what they have told us, we will meet the six-month deadline next year but I am curious about what others think.</p></speech>

We have lived with this wording for 80 years and we can live with it for another one or two if it means we get it right.  As somebody once said, it is about "events, dear boy".  It would not be credible to do a repeal simpliciter and then sit down to talk about what we are going to put in.  I agree that symbolism is not nothing, and this is the key message we are trying to get across.  I was asked if the process could be dealt with quickly but I am less exercised by timing than I am about getting it right.  The Constitution is the way to approach it.  I have heard other people say that, while it can be done, it is ambitious.  My experience is that these things take a bit longer when one is trying to bring people along and build a consensus.  Rather than fixing a timeframe and finding that one is running out of time, it should be allowed to run.</p> <p>  Other research on unpaid work, namely, the health survey, was carried out by the CSO in 2016.  That rather blew our socks off.  It was a sample study of activity but it was very detailed.  It found that 355,000 people in Ireland were providing a minimum of 40 hours per week of unpaid care.  That was the first such study and we are looking forward to the second.  It takes a good sample so it should be reasonably reliable, though we would want to see a trend before banking on it.</p></speech>

A typology has been developed in the European Union.  Scandinavians tend to put the primary responsibility on the state but there is a downside to that, because a person who is worried about his or her mother can be told to go away because the state is looking after her.  It is a bit of a caricature but there would not be much appetite for such an approach in Ireland.  Throughout the rest of Europe, the state primarily relies on, and recognises, the role of the family.  The German system is driven by compulsory insurance so one pays for one's care in old age.  If someone does not have children, he or she pays a higher premium because the state recognises there will be nobody to help to look after him or her.  In Estonia, it is written into the constitution that the family has primary responsibility for "antecedents", that is, parents.  They have just begun to relax this but, up to now, the state has said it was a family's responsibility and the state had nothing to do with it.  If people have living children or other relatives, the state will do nothing and will only look after them if they are completely isolated.  On the other side of the coin, there is the Portuguese system, under which the state depends on families for caring.  The state recognises that it is in its interest to help families with caring and that it would fall over without them.</p> <p>  At least 80% of care in Ireland is delivered unpaid.  Someone in receipt of carer's allowance gets it in lieu of unemployment benefit.  The former Department of Social Protection accepted the point we made a few years ago that it is not in the State's interest to force carers out of the home to take up paid employment, because it would then have to backfill with paid services.  Being paid, therefore, does not include getting carer's allowance, though even carers sometimes get a bit confused by that and say they are getting money from the State.  For us, paid work is performed by homecare workers and carers in the family home are unpaid, whether they are getting assistance from the State.</p> <p>  I can send the committee information on the international position.  There are five models and five systems but we are unusual in that nowhere in legislation, or in the Constitution, does it say what the respective roles of the State and the family are.  Our argument is that it is a partnership and that should be captured somewhere as a fundamental statement, by which we mean putting it into the Constitution.</p></speech>

One step towards valuing it is to measure it.  Other countries have regular time-use surveys, in which people fill out diaries of what they do each day.  We did this in 2005.  The idea was that a large time-use survey for caring and housework would be conducted on a regular basis but the recession came and everything stopped.  There is a strong argument for a regular time-use survey to complement the caring survey by the CSO but there is, as far as we are aware, no intention to carry them out at the moment.</p></speech>

There will never be a conveyor belt for older persons or vulnerable adults, whose numbers are increasing, or for children and nor should there be.  We are going to have think in different ways about how we support all the valuable work using a smaller cohort of people who are paid for their work.</p></speech>

I will read the submissions but I also have a couple of questions.

If there was a proposal to delete the current constitutional provision, would any of the groups oppose it on the basis that it wants to go further?</p></speech>

We have not asked and it is not my place to guess the views are of the general population who were inside and outside.  However, we know that those who have cared for children are not confined to my generation; they come from older and younger generations.  Those who have been cared for probably include many people in this room.  It goes beyond our members in many ways.  We will all have to guess.  When Deputy Chambers was outside the room, I set out that it is a visceral experience if one goes in.  One is being asked to weigh up one's values and the two values are important.</p></speech>

The word "shall" creates an obligation.  The word "endeavour" creates a qualified obligation and, therefore, all one can do in that situation is bring it to the courts to have a light shone on it.  Nine times out of ten, certainly in terms of socio-economic rights, the State will easily assert that it is endeavouring, even if it is not succeeding.  It is a weak obligation.</p> <p>  My interest is in administrative law rather than in rights, but when I studied the Constitution, as far as I was concerned, the Constitution stopped at Article 44.  Article 45 was a nice little postscript.  It was not part of it at all.  From that point of view, it should be in the Constitution proper.  As somebody said earlier, the ultimate logic of the alternative position is why do we not delete all human rights because they are all messy and awkward anyway.</p></speech>

If Article 41.2 was modified, I might say that it also undermines care in the home.  We have situations where someone will go into a home and say there is a big man in a bed and that it takes two people to work a hoist but we do not have the budget for that and go away again.  There may well be grounds,  where the principle is accepted, that we provide care in the home, but if it is too difficult to provide the care, we will not.  That might be possible grounds.  These are unusual ones.  They are not typical, and it is certainly not about socio-economic rights.</p></speech>

I will read the contributions in the Official Report.  I thank the witnesses.  Ms Roche spoke about a wasted opportunity if we do not do something and put something back in.  The contributions have highlighted that it would have been a terrible wasted opportunity if we did not have pre-legislative scrutiny, allowed the Bill to proceed and ended up with a referendum on 26 October without any discussion or understanding of what is at stake.  We all have a lot to learn but if we do not listen, we will not learn.  A discussion in some form of assembly would have a lot to offer.</p></speech>
