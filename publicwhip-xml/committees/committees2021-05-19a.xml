    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#B00100"><p>I thank the members and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for participating in today's meeting in line with the exceptional circumstances with which we must deal given the Covid-19 pandemic.  I remind them that apart from myself and members of the committee secretariat, all members and the witnesses are required to participate remotely, within the Leinster House complex where possible.  Today's meeting involves consideration of two matters that are of particular interest to the committee.  The first concerns the employment rights and health and safety of content moderators.  In addition, with the easing of the restrictions relating to the pandemic, the committee is keen to explore issues relating to the reactivation of the economy following the disruption caused by the Covid 19 pandemic.  I hope we can fully cover both items during our meeting.</p> <p>  To assist the committee in considering these matters, I am pleased to welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  He is accompanied by two officials from his Department, Mr. Stephen Curry and Mr. Oliver Gilvarry.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references that may be made to other persons in evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such directions.  The Minister's opening statement has already been circulated to members.  I now invite the Minister to make his opening statement.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to discuss the employment of content moderators and the reactivation of the economy in the context of Covid-19.  As the two issues are quite different, I will speak initially about content moderators and then move on to economic issues more generally.</p> <p>  Although it is a new form of work, we can all agree that content moderation plays a vital role in our use of the Internet and in turn in our everyday lives.  It is hard to imagine what the Internet would be like without them.  Content moderators carry out really important work to protect all of us and we need to ensure they are protected properly in their work.  They prevent the wider distribution of explicit and harmful content and I acknowledge there are specific stressors inherent in the type of work they carry out.  I believe it requires appropriate training, competence, ongoing debriefing and supervision within a well-established, safe and healthy system of work.</p> <p>  In late January, following a request from Deputy O'Reilly, I met a group of content moderators and their representatives to hear from them at first hand.  Following the meeting, I wrote to Facebook setting out the concerns raised at the meeting and the company provided a detailed response to my letter.  I believe this has been shared with the committee recently.  There is a strong legislative regime in Ireland to protect all workers regardless of where they work or the type of work they do in terms of their working conditions, including health and safety.  Employers, no matter what sector they are in, have a duty of care towards employees to ensure that a safe working environment is created.  This includes the management of workplace stressors or psychosocial hazards.  As I said, appropriate training must be provided and employers must carry out a risk assessment with a particular focus on potential hazards relating to content moderation work.  Proper risk assessment, along with mitigation measures, is the foundation of all workplace health and safety.  Promoting positive mental health within the workplace is good for the employees and is also a factor in improving overall business performance and productivity.</p> <p>  For this reason, I urge employees to engage in the first instance with their employer to see how their concerns can be resolved at workplace level.  However, any content moderator concerned for his or her health and safety can contact the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, in confidence and can also contact the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, about broader working conditions.  Where necessary, the resolution mechanisms available from the relevant State agencies can be utilised by both employers and employees.  I am aware that the HSA is addressing matters already raised with it.  As members will appreciate, the HSA is independent in the carrying out of its regulatory function and keeps much of that information confidential.  This includes keeping it from me.    </p> <p>  Moving on to the second topic, which is the reactivation of the economy, I am very hopeful that we can return to something close to normality by late summer.  It has been an extremely long road for everyone - citizens, workers, businesses, friends and family - but I think our patience and resilience have been worth it.  The vaccination programme is picking up momentum administering approximately 270,000 vaccines per week.  Nearly 40% of our adult population has had at least one dose now and we hope to have the vast majority of our adult population vaccinated at least once by the end of June and fully vaccinated by end of September.  Members will be aware that the portal is now open to people in their late 40s to register.  </p> <p>  Within the next two weeks, we expect to be in a position to publish a national economic recovery plan - most likely at the end of May or even 1 June.  The plan will provide certainty for businesses and workers by outlining targeted support for sectors which will continue to be most adversely affected by the pandemic.  It will outline the next steps for the emergency pandemic interventions, including what we will do with the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, reaffirming the Government&rsquo;s commitment to avoid a cliff edge.  At the same time, we all understand that for financial reasons, there cannot be a long tail either.  I think members will agree that the three main schemes &ndash; the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS; EWSS; and PUP - compare favourably with what is on offer in other countries.  Members may be aware that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, published our proposals for a new small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, last week.  This is a cheaper quicker alternative to examinership and with the help of the committee, we hope to have the Bill enacted before the summer recess.  This could save a lot of businesses in the autumn that are viable but need to restructure to survive.  </p> <p>  The national economic recovery plan will help to drive a jobs-rich recovery, help people return to work and assist sectors that have been and will continue to be disproportionately affected by the pandemic.  I am thinking of tourism and hospitality, the aviation sector, arts and entertainment.  The plan will also set out our ambition not just to return to pre-pandemic Ireland but to build a better "normal" - a more inclusive society that is equipped to meet head on the twin challenges of digital and green.  Last Friday, I published updated guidance on ventilation and antigen testing to reduce the spread of Covid in the workplace and help people get back to work and businesses to open and stay open.  </p> <p>  The updated work safely protocol, which was developed in consultation with unions and employers, is the most up-to-date public health advice for the workplace.  It sets out the measures required to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace, including information on how to approach the use of antigen testing.  Our advice is still to continue to work from home where possible but this protocol makes sure every workplace has clear and up-to-date guidance.  It gives clear information on how to use antigen testing appropriately in the workplace.  It sets out that these tests should be used as an additional health and safety measure and not as a substitute for any other precautions.  Employers should also consider how they can improve ventilation in workplaces.  Even simple actions like airing rooms or keeping a window open can make a real difference.  Although we intend to vaccinate the vast majority of the adult population by the end of June, the reality is some people cannot or will not take one.  Vaccination is and will remain voluntary so it is important that employers have guidance on how to manage any unvaccinated workers, particularly in customer-facing roles.</p><p>The document gives some information on that but I accept that it will need to be added to in its next iteration.</p><p> I look forward to members' comments and am happy to answer any questions they may have.</p></speech>

I now invite members to discuss both issues with the Minister.  I remind them to use the "Raise hand" function if they wish to contribute and to take it down when they are finished speaking.  We have a rota and a system.  The first person who has indicated is Deputy O'Reilly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#C00300"><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his opening statement and for meeting with the content moderators.  I know they found the meeting to be beneficial.  It would be brilliant if one meeting with the T&aacute;naiste or anybody else resolved the issues they have.  It will not.  This is an ongoing issue.  It is one on which the committee heard from the content moderators, in particular one by the name of Isabella Plunkett, last week.  I appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste may not have had a chance to hear what she had to say.  If he did not, I encourage him to have a look back at the proceedings because she talked from first-hand experience. </p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste will have heard at the meeting from people who have first-hand experience.  We need to look at the way in which these people are working and the work they do.  They are our first line of defence.  However, we have to ask about the level of trauma these people have to suffer in order for social media platforms to be able to function.  Thinking about this logically, if there were a make of car that every time a mechanic fixed he or she broke a finger, we would take it off the road.  I do not know if the T&aacute;naiste has a view as to how viable the business model is if it requires such a level of trauma and if the consequent supports are not put in place to ensure that people have the opportunity to debrief and to decompress after a shift.  Non-disclosure agreements and conditions that prevent workers from telling their spouse or whoever else is at home when they come home in the evening what it is they have been doing all day are archaic.  They have no place in a modern workforce, yet these are the conditions under which these people are working.</p> <p>  I am aware that Facebook wrote back to the T&aacute;naiste and listed the supports in place, but he will be aware that those supports are not available to the content moderators who work for an outsourced platform.  Does he have a view as to whether a similar level of support should be offered to such workers?  I do not think anything could ever mitigate fully what these poor people have to see in the course of their normal work, but does the T&aacute;naiste have a view on a similar level of supports being available for both outsourced and in-house workers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#C00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question and for introducing the content moderators to me because it was very interesting to hear what they had to say.  I think we all agree that they do a very difficult job.  Some of the work they do can be done through artificial intelligence and algorithms but only a small amount of it.  I am not a tech person but I suspect that for the foreseeable future we will need a lot of this work to be done by a human being and a human brain.  Of course, behind a human brain are human emotions.  We need people who will police the Internet and take content down.  We all see the stuff that gets through so we can only imagine the stuff that does not get through, what it is like and the impact it may have on people.  The Deputy will be aware that I wrote to Facebook about this.  It replied.  I have not met representatives of the company in recent months but this matter will be on the agenda the next time I meet them and I will take an interest in it.  The HSA has its role and will carry out its functions as it should.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy O'Reilly's question, my sense is that if people being outsourced to a company or a contractor are doing the same work as the directly employed people within that company, such as Facebook, they should get the same psychological supports and backup as the directly employed workers.  Now, maybe they are doing different work, but if they are doing the same work, they should get the same psychological and well-being supports.  Like many members of the committee, I think, I am not against outsourcing.  The Government does it all the time.  Departments do it all the time, and very successfully.  However, it should not be done by an employer as a means of avoiding obligations or potential legal liabilities.  That is all I will say about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#C00500"><p>I understand I will have an opportunity to contribute again later when we might get another chance to discuss the content moderators.</p> <p>  As for the notion that we will spend our summer outdoors, it would, as people say, be a lovely little country if only we could put a roof over it.  Last weekend, Dublin City Council put a fence around an open space where people gather.  I fully respect that the residents have issues with people gathering outside their houses but I am also conscious that the Government advice is to go outside and spend the summer outdoors.  I raised this with the T&aacute;naiste last week on Questions on Promised Legislation.  We need a plan and it has to involve toilets and bins.  We can put any nice names we want on them, but it is toilets and bins that will be needed in order that people can enjoy the summer outdoors.</p> <p>  It was put to me during the week that it is almost as if the Government is saying, "Irish people, you just cannot have nice things."  That should not be the case.  If we are to have any kind of summer at all, we need to spend it outdoors.  We do not know when we will be able to have everybody indoors together.</p> <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste comment on what happened in Portobello?  I do not want to see that happen in my area.  I want to see residents respected - of course I do - but, for the want of outdoor toilets and bins, an entire area was closed off.  We cannot keep shunting people around and, at the same time, tell them the message is to go outside if, when they go outside, there is nothing there for them except a fence.  Garda&iacute; have to police people trying to get to one area.  That is a waste of their time and a waste of Garda resources.  Somewhere in the city, while garda&iacute; were standing policing a fence, a crime was being committed.  There has to be a plan to marry the two elements because it is not fair to tell people to go outside but not to go to this or that place and then to move them on all the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#C00600"><p>I definitely do not think the solution to these problems is to close off public areas.  I appreciate that the city council had to make the decision it made and I really sympathise with the residents.  The Deputy can imagine what they have experienced.  This was not just outdoor drinking; it was people urinating and defecating near their homes, and I do not think any of us can condone that.  I remember that in my constituency what kept us sane during the pandemic was the Phoenix Park.  I was there nearly every other day.  There was a suggestion at one point that the park was getting too crowded and it might be a good idea to close it.  The Deputy can be absolutely sure that the public representatives in my constituency responded to that very quickly and said the closure of our biggest park and the crowding of everyone into the small greens was not a solution.  That was not going to work at all and, thankfully, the OPW took the decision not to close the park or to restrict numbers into it.</p> <p>  When we talk about an outdoor summer, it will not be outdoors only.  Increasingly, as people get vaccinated, they can meet up indoors.  I still expect we will have indoor dining in July.  The Deputy is totally right about the toilets and bins, and that is the message we are putting across to local authorities.</p> <p>  Next week, we intend to have two memorandums from the Government.  The first will be on the pathway forward regarding international travel, although the new Indian variants are now causing additional concern.  Nonetheless, it will be a pathway towards the restoration of international travel over the next few months.  The second memo is being brought to us by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, and is all about live events and a whole set of trial and pilot events in June and July - sporting, artistic, musical and cultural, outdoor and indoor - with limited capacity.  We are making those plans and I think that will be good news to people who are dying to see a live event, as I know the Deputy is.  I am too.  It will be of some relief to people working in the sector who have been unable to work and to do their art, essentially, for nearly a year now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#C00700"><p>Yes, but, with respect, other European cities can manage this.  Dublin is a beautiful city.  It is by far and away one of the loveliest places on earth, in my opinion, so why can we not have outdoor spaces that are similar to those available to citizens in cities right across Europe?</p><p>We have many open spaces.  I was really disappointed to see Portobello Plaza closed and to think this might happen to other places, given that we will be spending the summer outdoors.  For those people who will not be dining indoors and who want to stay outdoors, there should be spaces where they can gather, not just places to meet when spending money.  It seems as if those places are disappearing.  We are becoming less and less like other European cities and I do not think that is a good way for us to go.  It comes down to basic facilities such as bins and toilets.  They will make the outdoors much more liveable.  We would like to see some concrete action on that.  I appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste has heard the point but we would like to see more of an instruction being given to local authorities to ensure this is done.</p><p> On the rules regarding indoor dining, I am not a scientist and do not pretend to be, but it makes no sense to me that this is decided purely on the basis of the type of business.  An hotel with a small restaurant and low ceilings will be able to open, whereas a restaurant with high ceilings and good ventilation will not.  The same is true of a pub that has the capacity to put dividers between the tables and so on.  I appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste has met people in the hospitality industry but they are scratching their heads.  If it is going to be based on size, let it be based on size, or if it is going to be based on ventilation, let it be based on ventilation, but that should be based on scientific evidence.  They have not seen evidence and nor have I.</p><p> Will the T&aacute;naiste offer an explanation for the decision, or even some comfort that such businesses will be able to open at the same time provided that they have the facilities?  Nobody wants 100 people to be squashed into a small room with low ceilings.  We are all a bit risk averse at this stage to that kind of scenario.  Nevertheless, a large pub or restaurant with high ceilings and good ventilation is surely as safe as a similar type of venue within an hotel.  I believe it is possible to do it based on size.  It has been based on size or ventilation in other European countries, rather than simply on the type of business that it happens to be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#D00200"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the decision to open hotels before restaurants was based on public health advice and was in line with the advice from NPHET.  We are often criticised for not following that advice and this is one occasion on which we did so to the letter, except for the fact that hotels are opening a few days earlier than NPHET suggested.  It is for a practical reason, not a scientific reason.  I will be frank with the Deputy about that and I have been with the industry too.</p> <p>  We have never closed hotels' dining rooms.  During level 5, when we were all locked down at home, hotels remained open for essential reasons, such as for people who had to stay there because they had nowhere else to stay, and we never closed their restaurants or dining rooms.  If we were to close them now, we would be closing them for the first time.  This was never a problem before.  The problem now arises only because there is a disparity between the way we are treating hotel restaurants and other restaurants.  If we were to turn around and close them now, however, it would not make sense.  We would be saying that people can be served their meals in their rooms only.  I hope and expect that the gap will be for only a couple of weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#D00300"><p>I am not suggesting there should be a delay in opening hotels and I am aware they have been open throughout the pandemic, providing food and essential provisions for essential workers.  Would it be possible to carry out ventilation tests, as was done with classrooms such that classrooms were not all deemed either okay or not okay? Could tests be provided on the extent to which restaurants might be able to accommodate people?  Could the Government examine that?  About 80% of restaurants cannot provide outdoor dining, so they are very anxious, as the T&aacute;naiste will know.  For those restaurants that might have the facilities, with high ceilings, ventilation and so on, could consideration be given to allowing them to reopen at the same time?  I fully appreciate that hotels have been open throughout and do not suggest they should be closed as some kind of catch-up exercise.  In the case of restaurants that have the facilities, would it be possible to give consideration to what I outlined?</p></speech>

My priority now, rather than having a complicated set of criteria for a two or three-week period, is to get the decision to allow restaurants and pubs to open indoors.  If they knew they were going to able to do that in the first week or so of July, that two or three-week period might be more acceptable.  I would be concerned that if we came up with a strict regime to allow them to half-open indoors, they might be stuck with that for months.</p></speech>

The role of content moderator is very challenging.  Ms Isabella Plunkett told the committee last week of the effect it had had on her personally and how it had started to have serious impacts on her life outside her job.  She described the horrible dreams she has and the anguish it causes her, and stated she has had to take the step of taking antidepressants.  Dealing daily with hate speech, racism, images of child exploitation is not a job that anyone should have to do but, unfortunately, it is necessary.</p> <p>  In my opinion, there is a moral responsibility on Facebook to ensure, at the very least, that content moderators are very well looked after.  Facebook is one of the richest companies in the world, worth almost $1 trillion.  It is clear it can well afford to treat staff equally and ensure proper supports are in place well beyond weekly wellness sessions, and to pay them fairly.  If the T&aacute;naiste gets an opportunity in the coming weeks to view a recording of last week's meeting, I encourage him to do so.  The culture of fear that Ms Plunkett described, with content moderators afraid to speak out due to non-disclosure agreements, is quite frankly sickening.  I strongly urge the Government to take action, meet representatives of Facebook and demand it immediately address the issue.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's comments that he intends to meet the company.  If possible, will he outline when he expects that to happen?</p> <p>  Everybody I speak to in hospitality, SMEs or the wider economy acknowledges the substantial and unprecedented supports the Government has put in place while also recognising that despite these supports, thousands of businesses throughout the country remain under significant pressure due to a crisis not of their making.  I have concerns about the debt that businesses are carrying, particularly in the case of SMEs.  The debt warehousing scheme is a very welcome initiative that will improve short-term cash flow for SMEs.  There is no question but that the scheme is very welcome but the timeframe of 12 months is a short period in which to resolve cash flow issues as we emerge from the pandemic, and that needs to be examined.  I appreciate that outstanding liabilities can be paid off following three years at a relatively low interest rate of 3%, but it would save SMEs having to go to financial institutions, where it is difficult to get funding, if the 12-month period could be extended to 24 months.  I would appreciate hearing the T&aacute;naiste's views on that.</p> <p>  The employment wage subsidy scheme is scheduled to run until the end of June.  It has been run at considerable expense to the State but strong consideration needs to be given to extending it until, at the minimum, the end of September and possibly beyond.</p><p>I speak to business owners in Galway city every day.  The scheme is essential for restaurants, hotels and bars, as it gives them the opportunity to rebuild while limiting their expenses.  All members want businesses to survive, rebound from the crisis and develop and grow again.  If we can make the extra investment now, it may prove to be the difference needed for thousands of businesses across the country to get back on their feet and give them the window of opportunity to ensure they can become sustainable before supports are removed.</p></speech>

I usually meet them at intervals of six months to a year, as Facebook is a major employer and taxpayer in Ireland.  I am sure a meeting will happen in the next few months.</p> <p>  On tax warehousing, I hear what Senator Crowe is saying.  It would be strange if we were telling businesses to get Government backed low-cost loans when we could just extend tax warehousing.  That might be the most effective thing for them in terms of cash flow.  It is a matter for the Minister for Finance, as the Senator knows, but I know the Minister quite well and we have had a number of conversations on this issue.  No decision will be made until 1 June.  That is all I can say for now.  I understand the point the Senator made and I agree with it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#E00500"><p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the committee.  The meeting we had with the content moderators was harrowing for all of us.  I congratulate Deputy O'Reilly on having brought the matter to our attention and facilitating their meeting with us and with the T&aacute;naiste, whom I thank for meeting them.  Heinous crimes are being committed in the world, in Ireland and elsewhere.  As the T&aacute;naiste said, these crimes often involve child abuse, rape, torture, murder and God knows what else.  Today, we are talking about supporting content moderators.  I do not know how any human being can survive being exposed to this kind of material, all day every day, without becoming seriously damaged, while not receiving intense support.</p> <p>  Facebook could not continue without the work of the moderators.  I think the T&aacute;naiste said that some of this content is getting through in spite of the work of the moderators.  Is there an issue regarding the investigation by police forces, not just in Ireland but all over the world, of crimes committed and their recordings being put online?  There are real victims out there.  I know some of these crimes occur in war zones, countries without governments and failed states, but much of it is probably happening in the so-called developed world.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will use his good offices at European level and beyond to get governments to chase this material down and prosecute those who put it online, inasmuch as this can be done.  That is not to take away from the content of our meeting today, which is to support the content moderators in every way possible, but what is happening behind the scenes is awful.  I think there are 1,900 moderators working full time in Ireland trying to deal with this material.  That shows the vast scale of the horrific stuff that is going on.  It strikes me that it is important to go beyond what is happening here.</p> <p>  On the issue of opening the economy, the announcement made by the T&aacute;naiste yesterday about supports for people in non-rateable businesses working from home is very welcome.  It is a matter on which several people have rang me about from time to time.  The extension of the small business assistance scheme to such people is very welcome.  I told a number of people about this yesterday and they were very pleased because they have been under a lot of pressure.  I know the amount of money involved is small, but it is very welcome.  When does the T&aacute;naiste expect that to be up and running?  The press release stated that it would be shortly but he might let us know when.</p> <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste comment on the announcement by Aer Lingus yesterday, which affects Cork and Shannon airports?  Aer Lingus has closed its Shannon operations completely.  In Cork there is work taking place on the runway to coincide with the temporary closure of the base there.  It is a concern and I ask the T&aacute;naiste to comment on it.</p> <p> The pandemic has thrown up all kinds of different issues.  Driver theory tests are being cancelled left, right, and centre.  I know it is not the T&aacute;naiste's area, but people need to drive to work and take part in businesses.  It has been put to me that if the theory tests were to be put off until the company running them has the opportunity to get organised, people could start to do the driving lessons first and do the driver theory test afterwards.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, people must do the theory test first but many people cannot do it and are put out by that.</p> <p>  Another area which is related to this, is about people involved in business and industry needing a small public service vehicle licence.  There was a hiatus for a year during which the requirement was suspended but it now in place again and &euro;2,000 is being sought from self-employed people who are involved in taxi tours, limousine and car hire.  These people tell me they will not have business until May 2022.  They are being asked to pay &euro;2,000 for a licence they cannot use.  This is a business issue which I take the opportunity to bring to the Minister's attention.</p> <p>  Those are the two main points I wanted to raise.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for the work he is doing during these very challenging times.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#E00600"><p>Deputy Stanton makes a good point about the content that is posted online.  There is a criminal justice element to this.  I do not know whether there are protocols that Internet platforms follow and whether they simply take this content down or report it to the authorities in the relevant country.  I will check that because one would think they would have a responsibility in that regard.</p> <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, is working on the online safety legislation and the creation of an online safety commissioner, which is long overdue.  There should be a protocol for the platforms to report potentially illegal content to the relevant authorities, but it is the world wide web and that is not easily done.</p> <p>  On the small business assistance scheme for Covid, SBASC, we anticipate that will open for applications on Friday.  However, just in case something goes wrong, I will say that, officially, it will open next week.  If all goes to plan, however, it will open on Friday and will be run through the local authorities.  The closing date for applications will be 21 July, so businesses have a decent amount of time to make their application.  The scheme applies to any business that had a turnover in excess of &euro;50,000 a year and whose turnover has declined by 75% or more.  These businesses can get a grant of &euro;4,000 to help with their costs.  It is no longer limited to rateable premises, so it includes non-rateable premises and people working from home or a hot desk.</p> <p>  Many people would have heard about the needs of wedding planners, photographers, travel counsellors and on-course bookmakers.  They would largely be covered by this scheme.  I recognise there is an issue with very small businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;50,000.  In order to help them out, we are reopening an old scheme called the micro-enterprise assistance scheme.  That will give very small businesses a grant of up to &euro;1,000 to help with their costs.  That will be run through local enterprise offices, LEOs.  Separate from that, the Minister, Deputy Martin, and I are working on something for the events sector, which is still in real difficulty.</p> <p>  What we expect to do from quarter 3, starting in July, is to move away from different sectoral supports to something that is across the board.  We brought in the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, which are great but had many gaps.  We then created about ten or 20 different schemes to fill those gaps.  Ideally, what we will do from July onwards is to have a single scheme that fits all firms.  However, as we all know, one size does not fill all, so we will probably find we will have the same problem again.  Hopefully, this will not be an issue because businesses will be open and trading.  It should not be as big an issue as it is now in any event.</p> <p>  On Aer Lingus, yesterday's news was extremely unwelcome.</p><p>I met representatives of Aer Lingus in the last couple of weeks.  I was aware that the company planned to do some restructuring but it did not give us any details.  Understandably, it has to give those to its employees first.  The closure of the cabin crew base in Shannon was not expected.  It is down to the pandemic and the fact that people are just not travelling.  It is also down to the restrictions the Government imposed.  It would be remiss of me not to point out that there are many Members of the Oireachtas who still do not believe those restrictions went far enough.  The decision would have been even worse had we gone along with the calls made by some Members.</p><p> Aer Lingus and the other airlines are receiving very substantial support, millions of euro, every week through the wage subsidy scheme.  Airports have also received financial support.  There is no shortage of money going into aviation from government.  I believe it is in the hundreds of millions of euro at this stage.  We have had conversations with airlines about paying them to keep certain strategic routes open but that is not something they are particularly interested in, aside from the fact that this would run into state aid rules and competition rules.  They want to fly their aeroplanes with passengers on them.  They do not want to be paid to fly empty planes.  We are not New Zealand or Qantas.  In the real world, aeroplanes can be moved out of Ireland very easily to places like Manchester.  That is one of the consequences of the very strict travel restrictions we have in Ireland.</p><p> I do not regret imposing those restrictions, by the way.  We have one of the lowest death rates per million population in Europe.  Only Finland and Denmark have seen fewer deaths per million than Ireland, and some of that is down to our very strict travel rules and the fact that we are an island.  However, they have real consequences for real people, including not being able to see families and friends who live abroad and the loss of jobs in tourism and aviation.  The sooner we can get back to flying, the better.  However, we still stand the risk of reseeding the virus into Ireland and bringing in variants and we cannot ignore that risk.  There is real concern around the Indian variants in particular coming from the UK and we have to keep a close eye on that.  </p><p> I will have to pass on the driver test issues and small public service vehicles.  I could give the Deputy an answer but it would probably be wrong.  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, to get in touch with him on that.</p></speech>

I particularly welcome the introduction of examinership-lite and the new approach to work, sick pay, the living wage and so on.  We are seeing the Department responding to a changing environment.</p> <p>  Is the use of antigen testing rather than PCR tests before boarding flights in prospect?  A case is being made that it is being done elsewhere.  </p> <p>  We know changes to corporate taxation are coming.  The challenge for Ireland as we come out of this is to build long-term resilience.  That will involve embedding climate and circular resilience, building a sharing economy and building lifelong learning and digital and remote skills.  These are all changes that we need to make.  To what extent is there an effort under way to mobilise the capacity of the Department's agencies to address these longer term structural changes?  It will need agencies and educational institutions to help companies make the shift.  How will that be approached.  There is always the risk that the urgent will squeeze out the important but there is no doubt that we have to change our model and build new sources of competitive advantage.</p></speech>

NPHET and the Chief Medical Officer do not like it, while the chief scientific officer, Professor Ferguson, is a big fan.  The Government is not ruling it out but for now, we have PCR testing for international travel.  We are not ruling out a move to antigen testing but, without rehearsing the arguments, there are advantages and disadvantages.  The obvious advantage is that antigen tests are cheaper and quicker and will pick up people who are in their infectious stage of the virus where they are shedding virus and are transmissible.  On the downside, they miss a lot of positives and negatives and can give false reassurance.  Given that we are making so much progress with the vaccines, I hope we might not need tests at all.  Perhaps we will get to the point where we can say that being fully vaccinated is enough and not require people to have any form of test.  That is where I would like to be but we have to figure that out between now and next week when the Government agrees its proposals on international travel.</p> <p>  On the wider strategic point, in fairness, the agencies and Department are doing as the Deputy described, even though we have been extremely busy firefighting and dealing with the pandemic over the last year.  Since we have not been engaging in many of the normal activities, such as trade missions and travelling around the country attending major events, we have had a bit of time to do some more strategic thinking.  The remote working strategy was a reflection of that.  An artificial intelligence strategy will come out quite soon.  IDA Ireland also has a new strategy.  Like everyone, the Department and its family of agencies have used the downtime created by the pandemic to do some forward thinking and insurance is part of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1659" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#F00400"><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his time and his work to date.  Great supports have been provided, in fairness.  My son, who is a student, had a part-time job and he benefited from the PUP which kept him sane.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for the work on the PUP, which was put in place pretty quickly, so well done.</p> <p>  On Facebook, I have received letters from various people.  I had meetings with members of Foxglove and we raised the issue in the committee.  Given that Facebook does not directly employ these moderators, surely there is an onus on the recruitment agency, the company that employs them, and it should be put under pressure to provide proper services and reports for its employees.  Is that something we can look at?  There is a loophole for Facebook because if it is not directly employing these staff, it is not directly responsible for them.  What are their official employers, the agencies that recruit them, doing to support these young people and their mental health?  These are young people because there are no old people in these jobs.  I am too old to get a job as a moderator.  We will let down our young people if we do not get proper structures and supports in place for these content moderators.  Prevention is better than a cure.  All members feel very strongly about this issue.  I will not go on about it; I just wanted to make the point about the middleman.</p> <p>  On local enterprise offices, LEOs, there are more than 248,000 small businesses in Ireland with fewer than ten employees.  That is a huge number of jobs and they are the heart and soul in much of the country.  These companies are often much more reliable than the bigger guys who might let us down by leaving and setting up in other countries, as happened yesterday.  Small businesses are often high quality family companies that take good care of staff.  We should support them more.  The LEOs have done amazing work throughout the pandemic to keep small businesses afloat.  They are under serious pressure, however, and it is clear from my meetings with them that they would love to have extra staff and supports. </p> <p>  On food producers, we are importing a lot of food that we could produce here.  For example, potatoes and garlic are coming from China, Israel and England.  We have a lot of great land that should be used more for growing food, not only mass producing beef and dairy.  We should strengthen our labelling for food production.  Under the current system, a company can import anything it likes, do something small with it, wrap it up and make it look as though it was made in Ireland.  We need to have stronger labelling for food made in Ireland.  I am aware of this from my sister's business which produces cheese.</p><p> If we strengthened labelling, we would strengthen Irish food producing companies. Also, because of the climate emergency, carbon footprint and all of those things, there has never been a better time to have a huge push to buy Irish.  Back in the 1980s there was a great buy Irish campaign and it is time to have another one.  I say to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that a good buy Irish campaign on social media and national media might not be the worst spending that we could do.</p><p>  I cannot emphasise how important Shannon Airport is to the entire region.  The 120 jobs that were lost yesterday are devastating for the families affected.  A lot of those workers have been loyal to Aer Lingus for a long time and it is disappointing to see the lack of loyalty that has been displayed by Aer Lingus to Cork, Shannon or to their staff.  More important is the ripple effect the airport has on a huge region through the generation of many thousands of jobs in the tourism sector.  It is well known that 95% of the people who fly into Dublin go somewhere else and do not spend their money here.  However, the people who come into Shannon and Cork are the people who stay and spend money here.  They keep businesses open and keep people living in rural regions.  If we are serious about regional rebalance I urge the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to sit around a table because they really need to see how important the Shannon and Cork airports are to a huge area of this country.  We cannot talk about extending runways in Dublin while there are no flights coming out of Shannon Airport.  We need those flights to England to connect us with the rest of the world and I cannot emphasise enough how important that is.  They are essential for our mental health in the region, as well as our economic health and it is important that we are given hope.  I believe that the Taoiseach is meeting some people but the four Ministers need to get their thinking caps on and decide what to do specifically for Shannon Airport as it has zero flights at the moment.  We need Shannon Airport to resume flights and thrive again.  When people come to Ireland, the east coast is great but the west has the Wild Atlantic Way and the most visited spots in Ireland such as the Cliffs of Moher and Adare.  The region is massive and, therefore, it is important that the four Ministers I mentioned have an emergency meeting.</p></speech>

Whoever the employer is they have a duty of care whether it is Covalen, Facebook or anyone else.  Under the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012, if one is taking on agency workers, one has to give them the same protections as the people who are directly employed by one.  The same basic working conditions certainly apply.</p> <p>  On the LEOs, again I very much agree.  We are scaling them up.  We are staffing them up.  They have an extra &euro;5 million in their budget this year and we have extended their remit.  They are now responsible for everything ranging from flood relief to businesses to all the new schemes that we have set up.  I do want to keep scaling them up over the next couple of years but I want to do so in a way that is manageable.  Sometimes one can scale up an agency or public body too quickly, ask them to do too much too soon and then things fall over.  So I want to be able to scale up but to do it right.</p> <p>  On the labelling, I am a big fan of Tola cheese, as the Senator knows, and I hope that company is going well.  As labelling is an EU matter under the Single Market, we do not have full control over how things are labelled and how they are not but we have input into the EU.  There are things that producers can do voluntarily but in terms of what the law is around labelling that is a Single Market issue and it is done at a European level.  It is something, however, in which I certainly have an interest as trade Minister.</p> <p>  Finally on Shannon, as the Senator will be aware, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is going to meet Aer Lingus today.  He is going to ask them to defer their decision to close the cabin crew base at least until Aer Lingus sees the Government's plan for aviation, which will be out next week.  What the company is saying, and said in its letter to me on the redundancies, is that it is not just about the pandemic and the travel restrictions.  The airline is also saying that the base has been inefficient for quite some time even before the pandemic.  I think that needs to be explored with it because we would like to see the decision deferred.  If the decision goes ahead, we are going to want to talk to airlines about how we can incentivise them to return.  Airlines are very nimble and bases that are closed one month can often be re-opened the next year and we have seen that particularly with Ryanair.  I know that when I was the Minister responsible for tourism - long, long ago - removing the travel tax really helped to get new routes into the country and frequency scaled up.  The travel tax is now gone but we are going to examine what incentives we can put in place to encourage airlines to return and routes to return.  The Ministers, Deputies Donohue and Eamon Ryan, and I actually spoke about that yesterday just after the Cabinet meeting.  We have started that initial discussion already but all those things will only work when people are allowed to fly and that is the bottom line.</p></speech>

I must record my alarm that the company in question happens to be a subsidiary of a company that is in receipt of very significant State contracts.</p> <p>  With regard to what the Government can do on this, I seek the T&aacute;naiste's view of non-disclosure agreements, the withholding of those from workers and whether they should be published.  Also, should content moderation be regulated as hazardous activity?  Should content moderation be recognised in the health and safety regulation of this country? </p></speech>

I cannot imagine why anyone would be expected to sign any sort of agreement yet not have it.  How do you know you are actually adhering to the agreement yourself if you only get to read the thing once?  If they are not giving a copy of it, that is outrageous.  Any person of course should have a copy of any agreement that he or she ever signs.</p> <p>  It is important to say that non-disclosure agreements cannot be used to prevent content moderators from raising issues of concern about their working conditions or their health and safety concerns.  Non-disclosure agreements tend to be about confidentiality and not breaching confidentiality.  They cannot be used to stop people from raising legitimate concerns about their legal rights and entitlements or health and safety conditions.  Again, without knowing what is in these agreements it is hard to comment on them in any detail.</p> <p>  As for the issue the Senator has raised around health and safety regulation, I will give it some thought.  That is the first time it was raised with me as a possibility that we could reform our health and safety laws in that regard.  We always have to be willing to update our laws as the world of work is changing all the time.  That is something to which I will give some thought and on which I will consult the HSA.  </p></speech>

Obviously he is aware of the serious concerns that were articulated by some organisations in the retail and hospitality sectors on the ability to take back staff and to have a sufficient supply of staff for reopening.  Certainly our Sunday newspapers and a lot of radio airtime have been given over to the issue in recent days.  What is going to be done for these sectors?  What are the issues with these sectors that they cannot get staff?  Is it pay or skills?  Is it time that we had a proper joint labour committee for the retail and hospitality sectors to enable us to talk through those issues?  Some of the issues arise because the pay rate is the national minimum wage or barely above it, so there are difficulties in attracting workers back.</p></speech>

We are in a very different place now than we were when we did the reopening last summer.  I remember hearing last summer lots of anecdotal evidence from employers saying they could not get people back to work because the difference in what they were getting from the pandemic unemployment payment and what they would get for working 30 or 40 hours a week.  Essentially, it would not be enough to encourage them to come back to work.  In the end, however, I did not see very many shops or restaurants that could not reopen.</p> <p>  I am not actually convinced yet that people will not go back to work.  We are seeing the number of people on the pandemic unemployment payment falling fast.  This needs to be assessed in a few weeks' time.  There will always be a small number of people who, for whatever reason, do not accept their job back.  I think, however, the majority will.  It is probably too soon to come to any conclusions about that yet.  Let us see where we stand in terms of the numbers on the pandemic unemployment payment in July and August.  We will have a better read then.  We could be down to maybe 100,000 people.  That is a better base from which to understand this.</p></speech>

That is all set out in law.  They are being challenged in the Supreme Court and we will have to see the outcome of that case.  I hope it will be that these stand up constitutionally and legally.  In that case, we can have more of them.</p> <p>  I would like to see them exist in the meat sector, for example, which is an area of ongoing concern.  There are also plans for them in childcare and we have a successful one in construction.  Much of this will depend on what happens in the Supreme Court and as to whether these stack up constitutionally.</p> <p>  I believe in the voluntarist system.  It is better that we have a system where employers, unions and employees agree to these arrangements rather than having them imposed.  If the State were to do anything, I would rather see it raise the floor for everyone rather than for certain sectors and not others.  Whether it is the living wage or sick pay, I want to do it for everyone and not different sectors.  I do not see why that would not be good public policy.</p></speech>

There has been no reference to it in the contributions so far.  There are no easy answers as to what the Government can do.  It has to act, however.  We know that last December when the economy opened up, the unemployment rate was at 53% for those aged between 15 and 24 years.  There will be no going back to normal for a long time, particularly for young workers.  What are the T&aacute;naiste's thoughts on that?</p> <p>  We now have a situation where workers in certain sectors are forced to take unpaid internships in order to get a start in their chosen career.  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe this is acceptable?</p></speech>

It has affected men differently to women and younger people differently to older people.  Older people have borne the brunt in terms of death and illness from the pandemic.  Young people have borne the brunt in terms of the economic impact, losing jobs, loss of income and the loss of the opportunities to do the things that younger people want to do which is to meet friends and find a life partner.  All those things have been horribly interrupted in the past year.</p> <p>  I do not like the idea of saying men are more affected than women or older people more affected than younger people.  When one examines it, different groups are affected in different ways.  Even when it comes to gender, men are more likely to have died from Covid and twice as likely to have ended up in ICU.  Women have been more adversely affected by domestic violence, mental health issues and the burden of caring.  It is absolutely the case that young people have been affected in a particular way.  It is an economic way as well as other ways.</p> <p>  The figure around youth unemployment is often misleading.  When people hear of 50% or 60% youth unemployment, they think that means that 50% or 60% of all young people are unemployed.  That is not the case at all.  When somebody is in education or training, they are not counted.  The actual youth unemployment rate is 22%.  I accept that is very high and is about double the average for the whole population.  However, probably the best statistic is the loss of employment.  The numbers employed who are young is down about 14%.  The numbers employed who are middle aged or older is down about 6%.  That would give a more accurate reflection as to what has happened.  It is because young people are disproportionately employed in areas like retail, construction and hospitality which are closed.  Construction is back open while retail and hospitality will reopen.  That will deal with most of the problem but by no means all of it.  That is why we need to do more.</p> <p>  As to what we can do, some of it is around better terms and conditions like the move to the living wage.  One has to have a job, of course, before one gets that.  That is why we need to make sure we do it right.  Education and training opportunities are another area.  I am proud that we have more people from more diverse backgrounds in third level and further education than ever before in the history of the State.  That has been as a result of the great work done by the past two Governments, one of which included the Senator's own party.  We need that to continue.  These are the angles we will go on.  Getting the economy back open is how most people will get their jobs back.  That will bring about the biggest fall in youth unemployment, as well as a focus on education and training, and ensuring people have opportunities.</p> <p>  The unpaid internships need to be examined.  I have done it myself and I have had unpaid interns, as the Senator might have too.  I found it beneficial.  There is a big difference, however, between doing something for a few weeks and unpaid labour for an entire year.  We probably need some regulation in this area but I have not quite had a chance to examine it yet.</p></speech>

At this stage, surely we should not be sending the kind of signal that would be sent by extending IDA Ireland to Israel.  Instead, we should be doing the very opposite in terms of the signal that we send internationally.</p></speech>

That is not a political decision.  It is not one that crossed my desk or I signed off on.  IDA Ireland has its own legal authority in these areas.  It was done for good reasons because we have a significant trading relationship with Israel.</p> <p>  My general approach to these things is that we should continue to engage with states.  Sometimes we have trade boycotts.  However, as the Deputy knows himself, there are many states with which we could cut off links that people do not talk about enough.  Israel tends to be the focus of campaigns for boycotts around trading links.  There are many other countries, however, that have serious questions to answer such as Venezuela, Cuba and even some countries in eastern Europe.  For reasons I do not understand, people seem to be silent about these.</p></speech>

I agree with that as both a formal legal position and a moral position.  However, we heard last week that that is precisely what is happening.  The existence of the NDAs, which the workers do not know the exact contents of, is held over them to prevent them from speaking out, talking to unions and so on.  Would the T&aacute;naiste agree that NDAs should be published so that everybody can see what is involved and so that there is full transparency?</p></speech>

As they are agreements the workers have signed, it would then be up to them to decide whether they want to publish details of them.  I would like to see it.  There are reasons NDAs exist.  They are often good reasons relating to protecting people's privacy and confidentiality.  I have worked in jobs in the area of medicine where there were rules around these issues for good reasons.  I would not like to think that NDAs are being used to impose a chilling effect on workers or for them to feel that they are silenced and cannot raise concerns about their rights, entitlements and health and safety.  The short answer to the question is that I would like to see them but it would not be for them to be published publicly.  When an agreement is signed between two parties, it is for them to decide whether to publish them.  I would like to see the content.</p></speech>

A general point that was raised about the conditions facing content moderators was, in effect, the two-tier workforce, with those who work directly for Facebook and have access to proper psychiatric counselling and so on and those who work for various outsourcing companies, such as Covalen and others, who do not have access to that, to wellness coaches and so on.  There are two groups of workers who are being treated in discrete ways as a result of being employed in two different ways.  Would the T&aacute;naiste agree that all of the workers doing the same work should be brought in-house to Facebook so that they have a direct relationship with Facebook and it can be held responsible for their terms and conditions and so on?</p></speech>

It is quite common in business and in the public sector to have core-flex arrangements, with core workers who are needed all the time, then you can flex up or down depending on needs that arise.  That is often done through agencies or outsourcing arrangements.  That should be their purpose.  Their purpose should not be to deny people doing the same work the same standards of protection when it comes to their health and safety and well-being.</p></speech>

I have a final question to give the Minister a chance to clarify an earlier remark he made about Covid deaths.  He said that Ireland had the third lowest number of Covid deaths in the EU and mentioned Finland and Denmark as being lower.  I checked those statistics and it seems that Cyprus, Malta, Estonia and the Netherlands all have lower rates of death, which still puts us in the lower half, at seventh lowest rather than third lowest.</p></speech>

The announcement yesterday was catastrophic for the reason.  The regional balance we talk about will be in tatters if Shannon is not protected.  The T&aacute;naiste said that the Minister is meeting with Aer Lingus today.  There needs to be a better Government intervention.  The T&aacute;naiste said that there was a problem in the regional airports before the pandemic.  I understand that 87% of flights were going from Dublin Airport before the pandemic.  We all understand where we are with the pandemic but we need a plan when we come out of the pandemic for the regional airports.  The Shannon-Heathrow route is crucial for families who live in the mid-west with family abroad and it is also crucial for the foreign direct investment companies that we were lucky enough to attract to the Limerick, Shannon and mid-west region.  This cannot just be left to one Minister.  I am concerned about the Minister with responsibility for aviation policy.  Is his plan not to intervene?  I ask the T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach to personally intervene in this.  I cannot emphasise how important that is, especially the Aer Lingus Shannon to Heathrow route.</p></speech>

I have met the company in the past couple of weeks.  I will get involved again as Minister with responsibility for enterprise.  It is part of my responsibility, in my mind, to make sure that we have good business connectivity from the mid-west to Britain, Europe and America.  The same goes for Cork and other airports.  I will get involved in this aviation issue and am involved in it already.  It would be remiss of me not to point out that Aer Lingus, in its statement, called out our strict travel restrictions as a reason for this base being closed.  There are parties in the D&aacute;il which thought we should have much stricter restrictions.  I understand that it is still the policy of many parties in the D&aacute;il to have even stricter travel restrictions than we have now.</p></speech>

We could be here all day talking about how that happened and who is responsible, but it was lost in any event and it took eight years to get it back.  The issue of connectivity is centrally connected to the issue of jobs.  The T&aacute;naiste and I represent neighbouring constituencies.  Dublin Airport is located in my constituency and it is right beside the Taoiseach's constituency.  We know how important the aviation jobs are.  I echo the issues that were raised today with regard to the need for a plan.  There needs to be a real sense of urgency about this because what could be lost in the space of a couple of months could take years to be recovered.  There is a genuine fear.  It is not just about the jobs, although they are so important, it is also about connectivity.  I do not want to go through it but wanted to put it into the T&aacute;naiste's head that when a route is lost, you lose it quickly and get it back really slowly.  Anyone involved in aviation could tell you that.</p> <p>  I will go back to the issue of content moderators.  The discussion that we are having is interesting and welcome because this is a new type of work.  It is hazardous work, a point which was made previously.  It is a type of work that just did not exist when I was young.  It requires its own set of guidelines.  A joint labour committee may be an interesting way to approach it and there may be other ways.  Separate to it being something new, exotic and interesting, we have the issue of these non-disclosure agreements.  Fionnuala N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in from the Communication Workers Union, which does brilliant work in this space along with Foxglove, cited the chilling effect that these non-disclosure agreements have.  Your boss might give you an agreement, with two minutes to read and sign it, and it might be 80 pages long.</p><p>You sign it because, quite frankly, you have looked at the news and you see the level of youth unemployment coming at you and you think, Jesus I need this job, so you sign the contract.  It is taken from you and then used against you.  You do not have a copy of it, but all you know is that you are constantly prevented from raising issues and having that contract held over you.  It is used as a tool against workers.</p><p> It appears this is not a breach of employment law, and my read of it is that it is not, although employees are entitled to information, but it should be because it is being used against them.  Fionnuala N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in used the phrase "the chilling effect".  What that means in practice is that workers are afraid to raise concerns.  I fully appreciate that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, exists, and in the course of my other work I had dealings with the HSA.  I know there is voluntarist machinery available that people can use, but the Minister must accept these people exist in an area that is somewhat outside of the normal industrial relations sphere and these agreements are being used to keep the workers in a situation whereby they are afraid to get organised, come together and challenge their employer.</p><p> This is linked to the next issue I want to raise with the Minister, which is youth unemployment.  We know the people who suffered the most during the economic crash, as in, for the longest, and I am not making a hierarchy of people who were battered by what was done to the economy but in terms of the sustained impact, youth unemployment took the longest to recover.  Is the Minister amenable to working on a cross-party basis to ensure that NDAs can be nullified?  We very often do that although people never see it happening.  There is a role for NDAs in some very discrete instances, but the indiscriminate use of them as a mechanism to control workers is not good and it should not be happening.</p><p> Will there be a dedicated section on youth unemployment in the national economic recovery plan?  All of the unemployment that will arise out of the pandemic will be tough to deal with, but we must learn the lesson from the previous crash in that youth unemployment was sustained at a higher rate for longer than in other age groups.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Reilly might fill me in privately some time.  I imagine there is a story to tell there.  I do know how it was regained because it was regained when I was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It was a mixture of the travel tax, route incentives, a growing economy, a marketing budget for Tourism Ireland and fifth freedom rights.  I am sure we can get it back with a similar mix when the time comes.</p> <p>  On the non-disclosure agreements, I cannot understand the concept of asking somebody to sign an agreement and then not allowing them to have a copy of it.  I will check up on the law in that regard.  If it is not illegal, it probably should be.  I just do not understand the concept as to why somebody would be asked to sign an agreement and they are somehow supposed to memorise it.  Even if you want somebody to adhere to an agreement he or she signs, would it not make sense for that person to have a copy of it so that person can remember what he or she agreed to?  There is something very odd and suspicious about people not being able to see an agreement they signed.</p></speech>

It is not that hard to understand.  It is workers having this used as a tool against them to exploit them.  It keeps the union away from them.  We could be here all day talking about the right to organise and union recognition, so let us not go down that road.  I understand completely what it is that motivates a company to do it.  This tool is working very well because the workers were initially terrified of getting organised.  Thankfully, now they are working with the union, which is a very good and positive step.  The situation is designed to ensure the chilling effect is felt by the workers and the impact of that is they will put their head down, do their work and not raise concerns.  We need workers who will raise concerns, especially in this area because of the mental health effects and the hazardous nature of the work they are doing.</p></speech>

Perhaps there is an opportunity to make an amendment to employment law in the coming months or this year to make sure employees are entitled to a copy of any agreement they have signed.  I do not see who in the House could be against that.</p> <p>  In response to the question on the national economic recovery plan, there will be sections both on youth unemployment also a section on gender equality and how that must be part of the economic recovery as well because there has probably been a widening of gender inequality in an economic sense during the pandemic.</p></speech>

It is vital that happens as soon as it is safe to do so.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm this will happen if more than 80% of the population have been vaccinated by the end of June?</p> <p>  I will briefly make two other points.  In 13 days' time hotels and restaurants with outdoor dining will be back trading, as far as the T&aacute;naiste is aware.  When will the Department issue the guidelines for this, because it takes some time to get set up and to organise a range of issues?  We need to get the information urgently.</p></speech>

As a person involved in business myself, I tried to outline how vital it is.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's positive comments and I would greatly appreciate if he could speak to the Minister for Finance.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

As always, there are four factors.  It is not just the vaccines but also case numbers, which seem to be rising a bit again, the situation in hospitals, which is continuing to improve, and then issues concerning variants.  We do have a concern about the Indian variant.  There is some evidence in the UK of increased transmission and increased hospitalisations as a result of that.  We will see how that develops in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  I believe it is F&aacute;ilte Ireland that draws up the guidelines on outdoor dining and drinking.  It will not be done by us, but we will have an input.  I do not have a date for them, unfortunately, but I appreciate that people need to see them soon in order that they can plan ahead.  To give the Senator a rough idea, it is going to be seated dining only with 1 m or 1.5 m between tables and no more than six at a table.  The six people can come from any number of households.  There will be no rule about a maximum of 15.  If an establishment has the space, then it has the space.  There will not be a requirement to buy a substantial meal.  That will be gone.  We do not anticipate that there will be a limit on the amount of time people can stay.  It will be a lot more practical than what existed before, but that is not finalised yet.</p></speech>

Many of the questions that have been asked today should be asked of Facebook.  Chairman, could we invite in Facebook to ask those questions directly because their employment is really a matter between Facebook and the employees?  Based on some of what the T&aacute;naiste said in his contribution at the start of the meeting, it will be a difficult meeting with Facebook.  It emerged at this morning's meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment that Twitter plans to take a legal challenge to the online safety laws.</p><p>That just shows the challenge we have with some social media companies.  I do not expect the T&aacute;naiste to comment on the matter, given that the announcement was made only in the past hour.  Twitter stated that one of the reasons it is taking the legal challenge is that it will set a precedent across the world, which seems to be a strange argument.</p><p> On Shannon Airport, the T&aacute;naiste stated that a number of political parties pushed for stronger measures.  I have seen that in my county, Tipperary, where two political parties, and one party leader, pushed for stronger measures, whereas now they are calling for answers in regard to why Aer Lingus has taken this step.  Has the T&aacute;naiste spoken to Aer Lingus?  Have we got any reassurance regarding the strategic routes, particularly that from Shannon Airport to Heathrow?  I think that route is up for review in about one year's time.  Have we any reassurances the routes will remain?  It is a significant concern for the general public in the mid-west.</p><p> On the new scheme the T&aacute;naiste announced this week, namely, the small business assistance scheme, I am surprised it has not been raised more often during the meeting, although my colleague, Deputy Stanton, mentioned it.  This is something that the Members of both Houses have been calling for over the past nine months.  They have asked whether something could be done for businesses that are not rateable premises.  It is very welcome that we are doing it.  While it is small money, it will be very significant.  I am delighted that it will, I hope, be open for people to apply on Friday or if not then, early next week.  Is the grant a straight &euro;4,000 or do businesses have to show what fixed costs they have?</p><p> The closing date for the first round was 21 April.  I am aware of a number of businesses in County Tipperary - I am sure there are many throughout the country - that did not apply for the first round.  They were essentially closed in recent months and, for one reason or another, thought they could not apply until after they began reopening, which occurred after the closing date for applications.  Is there any measure the Department provided last summer, such as the restart grant, whereby businesses could apply for the first restart grant when they apply for the new grant?  Is there any way in which businesses might be able to apply for the first small business assistance scheme at the same time that they apply for the second one?  The closing date was 21 April and if businesses are reopening, it would give those that for whatever reason might not have applied for the first round the opportunity to apply.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that while the Minister is very aware of the impact aviation has on the environment in terms of emissions, he is also aware of the essential nature of aviation for an island nation.  He is certainly not anti-airline or anything like that.</p> <p>  To my mind, the crucial routes from Shannon Airport are to Heathrow, the east coast of the US and another EU hub.  That hub was going to be either Paris or Frankfurt and we got the former, which was great, but then along came the pandemic and we lost pretty much everything.  It is a very worrying situation.  Again, Ireland is not Australia or New Zealand; it is very different.  Airlines do not want to be paid to stay on the ground in Europe.  They do not want to be paid to run routes on which there are no passengers.  They will just move the aeroplanes, and that is how the single European sky works.  Unfortunately, that could happen to us and that is why we will need a large and attractive incentive package to get airlines and their routes back.  We can do that only when passengers are allowed and able to travel, and we are just not at that point at the moment for public health reasons.</p> <p>  I am always worried about giving information about grant schemes because there are now so many that I tend to mix them up.  My recollection is that it is a straight grant of &euro;4,000.  An applicant does not have to demonstrate particular fixed costs.  We are not going to ask for insurance bills, utility bills or whatever, but applicants will have to show that their turnover is down 75% or more and that they had a turnover of &euro;50,0000 or more, and they have to commit to reopening or staying open.</p> <p>  As for missing the application deadline, to be honest there is not an awful lot we can do about that.  People miss application deadlines all the time and we cannot just reopen them all the time.  Nevertheless, there are sometimes cases, particularly humanitarian ones, where somebody may have missed the deadline for very good reason, but just not having applied, not thinking it was necessary to apply or not getting around to it would not be enough.  We will consider a bit of flexibility in certain circumstances if there are overwhelming compassionate reasons but that is limited.</p></speech>

It is welcome that there will not be a cliff edge but rather a gradual easing of supports.  There has been a change even in the past two weeks.  The number of people receiving the PUP in County Tipperary on 4 May was more than 18,000, whereas it has now decreased to 9,000.  It has halved already and that is without the hospitality industry having yet reopened.</p> <p>  One issue I have come across with staff and management relates to when people will be returning to work in a normal work environment.  Companies are eager to get people back to work but staff are not as eager to return.  Businesses seek guidance and the guidance remains that working from home is preferable, but the issue of antigen testing is tied in with that.  How can we encourage companies that might not be fully sure about antigen testing to use it or to see it as an option to get staff back to work?  Obviously, there are differences of opinion on all sides and that applies to the workplace as well.  Some companies will view antigen testing as very positive, while others will be unsure about it.  How can the Government encourage companies that are unsure?</p></speech>

Many employers are using it.  We issued new guidance on the issue on Friday last to give employers the strength of a Government document, with the harp on it, that gives them guidance on what or what not to do.  We always say it should be voluntary and staff should not be required to take an antigen test.  It should be done right, using tests approved by the European Commission in particular, and it should be seen only as an additional health and safety measure, not a substitute for getting a PCR test if a person has symptoms.  Similarly, it is not a substitute for social distancing, mask-wearing or any of those measures.</p> <p>  I genuinely encourage employers to take this up because if it is viewed as an additional health and safety measure, it will pick up some cases that might otherwise have been missed, and had those cases not been picked up, they might have caused an outbreak.  It is in employers' interest to have antigen testing in their workplaces.  They can offset it as a business expense against tax and it is not a benefit-in-kind for their employees, so they cannot be taxed on it.  It is not a health benefit in that sense but rather a health and safety measure.  I re-emphasise that if somebody has symptoms, he or she needs to self-isolate and get a PCR test.  Antigen tests are not a substitute for that.</p></speech>

On tradespeople and apprenticeships, we will need a huge number of tradespeople if we are serious about the move towards building, with Rebuilding Ireland, and retrofitting homes.  I worry about the lack of tradespeople.  I spoke to a builder recently who informed me that tradespeople are becoming known as "grey sites" because they all have grey hair.  I recently visited a school, and not one of the children put up their hand when I asked who wanted to be a tradesperson.  We need to do some serious work on this.  We need to make apprenticeships more attractive.  I wish I had been told to marry a tradesman when I was in school because tradespeople are the ones who keep everything on the road.</p><p>I do not know whether we need to issue a PR statement or something around the importance of tradesmen.  They are literally keeping everything we do together, whether it is buildings, transport or whatever.  Where would we be without tradesmen?  I do not know whether they are valued as much as they ought to be and I think we need to do something around that.  We lost a good few tradespeople in the previous recession.  Some of them are in Australia or Canada or such places.  It may be time to consider calling them back, as was done for nurses and doctors.  We will have a shortage of tradespeople to do the work we want done.  We want to get houses built and retrofitted.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to think about that and consider what can be done.  The apprenticeship model must include time in college so that even people from rural areas who want to become a tradesperson get time experiencing college life and living away from home and that kind of thing.  The job itself has changed in many ways.  I am going to move away from apprenticeships and the importance of tradesmen.  I should say tradespeople.  I have female friends who are carpenters and so on but I was reared saying tradesmen.  However, we have to consider tradespeople if we are serious about what we want to do.</p><p> An issue I wish to raise with the T&aacute;naiste relates to the public realm and how space is shared, particularly in the context of the food and hospitality sector.  There is a need for local authorities to create outdoor spaces, not necessarily outdoor dining but outdoor seating and other outdoor spaces such that if a person wishes to sit down and eat something, whether he or she bought it from a restaurant with seating or a restaurant without seating or whatever, he or she can do so.  We really need to consider the public realm.  I think that will not be done properly unless there are urban designers or urban architects in local authorities.  I mean no offence to road engineers and technicians and quantity surveyors.  They are brilliant at their jobs but this task is not part of their profession.  We really need to look at that issue because we want to become like the rest of Europe, where it is normal for villages and towns to have beautiful, safe and aesthetically pleasing places to hang out.  We get the same amount of rainfall as Copenhagen and Amsterdam.  People speak about the weather a lot but it is not as bad as many people think.  We need to consider that.  It will not work if we do not get proper urban designers.  We cannot leave it on the shoulders of people who have been trained as road engineers.  That is really important if we want to get outdoor everything right, which we do because, as a nation, we went outdoors and realised it is bloody amazing.  It is really important to do that.</p></speech>

I know the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, wants to try to speed up the roll-out of rural broadband from seven years to five years.  I believe that with the help of the T&aacute;naiste, we might get it done even faster than that.  It is so important.  Even five years seems like a ridiculous amount of time to have to wait.  I know it takes time for it to be physically rolled out but I cannot over-emphasise how important it is to get broadband into rural Ireland.  I worked from home for the past 14 years.  Members would not believe the stress I had.  At one stage I had to hold my laptop above my head.  The digital hubs are brilliant and have a significant part to play.  Even if one works from home, one needs to go to somewhere to meet people.  Digital hubs are amazing and good work has been done on them by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys.  If the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, wants to try to speed up the roll-out of rural broadband, the more Ministers who can get involved in making that happen, the better.  It is key to everything happening in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

There will just be one chance to reset the compass in terms of climate and the circular economy and that is as we start to reopen.  In practical terms, will this happen?  Will there be audits of enterprise to assess preparedness and setting milestones?  Will more people commit to plastic pledges and 2030 climate pledges?  How will we drive it on?  I will take one example, that of the food sector.  It wastes 1 million tonnes of food each year.  That is equivalent to 3 million tonnes of carbon.  That is one year of the ten-year reduction if we could get cracking on that.  Two thirds of the plastic used is not recyclable.  We could really strengthen Origin Green by having better sourcing and identification of the way production is happening.  How is it going to be driven on in practice?</p></speech>

It is something I would like to discuss in more detail with the Deputy because I have been having those thoughts myself.  One small thing we are doing now is we have opened up the green enterprise fund which the Deputy has probably heard about.  It is approximately &euro;10 million that will fund businesses to do exactly the things he mentioned, such as audits of their energy use, waste and kind of how they operate, in order to reduce waste, energy use and emissions.  That is only a drop in the ocean and a small start because industry accounts for 13% of all emissions and we need to cut them basically by half while still expanding and employing more people.  That is an enormous challenge and probably an issue to which the committee could devote a whole session.  Is that a lazy answer?</p></speech>

It is not just about looking at energy and waste.  The reality is the choice of materials in construction, for example, can have a significant impact in terms of whether they lock up carbon or generate carbon emissions.  There is a need for micro-thinking to start happening at sectoral level within the agencies that are in charge of them.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I will be very brief.  I assume that all members are getting emails from constituents - I certainly am - who are concerned about the emergency legislation that is to be renewed again on 9 June.  They are calling for reviews of this and so forth.  We are moving out of restrictions and lockdown thanks to the work of all involved.  I am wondering whether the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 will be renewed on 9 June as scheduled.  That has an impact on employment, jobs and so forth.</p> <p>  The other thing that has been missing all along is the issue of interpretation.  A query was received yesterday about whether drive-in cinemas are allowed at the moment.  To me, drive-in cinemas are quite safe.  One sits in one's car looking at the big screen and not interacting with anyone.  However, the Garda has interpreted them as not being possible under the current restrictions.  We need to have a debate about how we move forward from here and open up the economy, especially under the various pieces of emergency legislation that were passed by the Houses and that all members want to see rescinded as soon as possible.  That is a very broad issue, but it is a very fundamental and important one.</p></speech>

If the Deputy had told me two years ago that we would live in a country where it was illegal to leave or enter the State for non-essential reasons, that one could not have visitors to one's house or could not meet outside with more than 15 people, I would have thought he was absolutely bonkers.  What has happened in the past year or two is unprecedented.  We overuse that term but what has happened in the past year really is unprecedented.  We want to go to a new normal and build back better, as people say, but one thing I definitely do not want to keep on the Statute Book for any longer than is necessary is this draconian legislation.  Unfortunately, it is still necessary.  We are not out of the woods yet and that is why we will have to extend it.  There will be proper debate on that in the D&aacute;il and I encourage Deputies to speak freely on this issue.  They should not feel that they are against public health or something if they raise these concerns.  Civil liberties matter.  Concerns about civil liberties have almost disappeared in the past year or so and that bothers me.</p></speech>

I re-emphasise that members must be on-site to contribute.</p> <p>  I welcome Ms Noelle O'Connell, CEO, and Mr. Stephen O'Shea, European Movement Ireland.  As the delegation is on-site I do not have to read the normal long note on privilege, which is good news.</p> <p>  I hope that Ms O'Connell does not mind but we teed up the findings during last week's public session as they were already in the public arena.  Members will look to extrapolate, examine and scrutinise these interesting figures and we look forward to engaging with the delegation on them.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any members who are participating via Teams to confirm, prior to making their contributions, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I invite Ms O'Connell to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

It is a great privilege to discuss the findings of the latest European Movement Ireland's opinion poll entitled Ireland and the EU 2021.  I will also briefly make reference to the Conference on the Future of Europe.</p> <p>  As the distinguished members of the committee will no doubt be aware, since 2013 the  European Movement Ireland has carried out annual, independent polling on Ireland's relationship with the European Union.  Our efforts to track and analyse this sentiment is unique and, I hope, valuable.  The regularity with which we carry out this polling, analysis and exercise allows us to not only capture a snapshot in time but present changes and trends that occur.</p> <p>  Bearing the usual caveats about opinion polls in mind, I will highlight a few points from the results that the distinguished members might find interesting.  To start with our regular question on support for Ireland's continued membership of the EU remains strong at 84%.  Support was highest in the youngest and oldest age cohorts at 87% and 93%, respectively.</p> <p>  We see a reluctance to give up control over certain areas of national competence.  Only 35% of people favour giving the EU more control over healthcare policy if that meant losing control at a national level, while fewer than a third of people or 29% would support more political or economic integration if it meant losing control over key economic policies such as tax.  However, the younger cohort and demographic are more supportive of EU health competences, and further economic and political integration.  It is encouraging to see that more than three quarters of people or 77% believe that EU funding to member states should be linked to rule of law principles.</p> <p>  Interestingly, fewer than a third of respondents or 32% believe that there will be a united Ireland in the EU in the next ten years.  That figure is broadly similar to the question we polled in 2020.  This is somewhat surprising given the increased scrutiny in this area since last year's poll.</p> <p>  On the future of the EU and Europe, 52% agree that now is the time to hold a Conference on the Future of Europe, and to reform the EU even if this would result in a referendum in Ireland.  There will be more on that later.</p> <p>  It might be useful to members to highlight some trends, themes and suggest some associated insights arising thereof.  The key finding of 84% agreeing that Ireland should remain part of the EU remains encouraging, and is consistent since we started polling.   However, the finding that 53% believe that the EU is moving in the right direction suggests that strong support for EU membership in Ireland cannot be taken for granted.</p> <p>  We were not entirely surprised by the numbers having confidence in the EU vaccine strategy.  A useful reference point to consider in this particular question is that in 2020 we asked respondents if the EU had dealt well with the Covid-19 pandemic and found that sentiment was pretty evenly split between 47% who agreed and 46% who disagreed.</p> <p>  We have included questions on defence co-operation in several years.  Since 2017, we have asked if Ireland should be part of increased defence and security co-operation.  While the numbers agreeing with that have remained relatively consistent, with 54% this year and ranging between 49% and 59% over the period in question, the numbers disagreeing have declined steadily from 40% in 2017 to 27% in 2021.</p> <p>  I draw the attention of members to the fact that in reply to several questions, those in the 35 to 54 age cohorts were less positively disposed than those in other demographic groupings.  It is difficult to arrive at certain and definitive conclusions regarding the reasons for this.  However, we need to pay attention to what seems to be a somewhat disconnected and disenchanted middle.</p> <p>  Broadly, these numbers tell us that while Irish people remain positively disposed towards the EU, support is not unequivocal and should not be taken for granted.  Furthermore, it cannot be conflated with unquestioning support for further integration, particularly related to areas that have traditionally been associated with strong member state competencies.  Those of us who support Ireland&rsquo;s place in Europe should be encouraged by these findings while recognising that it will take commitment, effort and engagement to maintain support for EU membership in Ireland.</p><p>We only have to look to our nearest neighbour or, a little further afield, to some of our neighbours in eastern Europe to see how quickly things can change and the consequences that arise.  In a world that is changing fast, old certainties are becoming new uncertainties.  The Covid pandemic has had a significant impact on economy and society but the EU will be central to our collective recovery and its future legitimacy and public support depend greatly on how it responds to these many challenges.  Ireland&rsquo;s position as an active, engaged and progressive member state will be central to that effort but that position can only be maintained with the support of the Irish people and that support must be earned and trust maintained through action and engagement.</p><p> I will make some brief remarks on the Conference on the Future of Europe.  European Movement Ireland was delighted to partner with the Government on the official national launch of the conference by the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, last Friday in Iveagh House.  When addressing the committee last November, I outlined our view that the Conference on the Future of Europe should deal with substantive issues affecting the EU and should be citizen-led.  We see this process as a significant opportunity for citizens to contribute to the future shape of the EU.  However, we must remain determined and diligent to ensure it is a truly bottom-up exercise that genuinely engages citizens and delivers tangible outcomes.  In that regard, we are very pleased to be working and partnering with the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Government on engaging citizens on these issues on the island of Ireland as well as the diaspora overseas.  As members will know, European Movement Ireland has a long history of engaging citizens on European issues and Ireland is considered to have a long and distinguished track record in engaging citizens more broadly on issues such as those debated at the Citizens' Assembly.  Ireland is seen as an example of best practice in terms of how we go about engaging citizens and I hope that, through the Conference on the Future of Europe, we can continue that strong tradition.  We are currently in the process of finalising plans in that regard - the conference was only launched on Europe Day, 9 May, in Strasbourg - but our aim and goal is to meet and engage with as broad, diverse and representative a cross-section of people as possible, including those in Ireland and EU citizens in Northern Ireland and beyond.  We will start doing this in the virtual world first, through online consultations that will begin in a couple of weeks and go on into next year.</p><p> I am very grateful for the committee's previous engagement on this issue and the excellent report arising from that which was an extremely beneficial and important contribution to the process.  I offer my congratulations in that regard.  I would be delighted to return to speak to the committee about our progress in more detail at a later date when we are more up and running.  M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas, a Chathaoirligh, agus baill an choiste.  Ba mh&oacute;r agam an deis labhairt libh inniu.</p></speech>

She referred to several figures.  One that is of interest to me is the lower percentage relating to the 45 to 54 age cohort.  A few members of the committee are in that age bracket.  Members might focus on that issue and maybe she could come back to the issue of why there is less enthusiasm for membership of the EU among that cohort.  I know she referenced it already but maybe we can tease it out a bit further.</p></speech>

I thank Ms O'Connell for her presentation, the very interesting research she has carried out and the work done by European Movement Ireland with regard to the European project.  As regards the figures, they are positive for those of us who are champions of the European project.  I will zone in on three of them.  Some 53% of respondents agree that the EU is moving in the right direction, 29% agree that there should be more political and economic integration in the EU even if that means that member states lose control over economic policy and tax, and 54% agree that Ireland should be part of increased EU co-operation on defence and security.  There are warnings relating to those three figures.  We have the Conference on the Future of Europe.  That may result in a referendum, treaty changes or whatever may be proposed.  As politicians, there are certainly warnings in the context of those figures with regard to treaty change and a referendum.  Does Ms O'Connell agree that is the case?  It seems to me that although there is great support for the European Union generally, with 84% in favour of continued membership, many people only want it to go so far.  I know we have to be ambitious with the project, but we also need to be cautious.  Does Ms O'Connell agree?</p><p>I was interested in a phrase used by Ms O'Connell either in her article in <i>The Irish Times</i>or in her presentation to the committee, that is, the disenchanted middle.  There is certainly food for thought in that regard, as the Chairman noted.  Is there any evidence in the poll findings of polarisation or extreme views supporting or opposing the EU?  We have seen the rise of the far right and populism in Europe generally and polarisation in politics globally.  Is there evidence of such polarisation in Ireland?</p><p>Can Ms O'Connell provide the committee with more information regarding how European Movement Ireland intends to consult citizens?  In her article in <i>The Irish Times </i>she mentioned the Traveller community, islanders, the Roma community, minorities, the LGBTQ+ community and citizens of Northern Ireland.  That is very welcome.  We need to reach out to as many people as possible.  When will European Movement Ireland have its plans finalised for genuine consultation and making a big effort to reach out to people to participate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noelle O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021051900002#B00400"><p>The Chairman and the Deputy posed similar questions in terms of the disenchanted middle.  That is an interesting finding that occurs across many of the responses.  It is not indicated in all of the findings, but it is evident from enough of them that we have remarked on it as a trend and a pattern.  We are seeing the challenge of that cohort and demographic who have suffered significantly as a result of the economic crisis in terms of a possible inability to access their own homes and the challenges that are impacting them in terms of living and working through the Covid pandemic.  It is something of which we need to be mindful and on which we need to continually engage.  As part of the Conference on the Future of Europe we are, of course, going to work with all demographics.  There is a welcome and understandable focus on engaging with the younger population, which is really important, but I am very conscious and cognisant of the fact that we must continue to engage with all sectors and demographics.  We cannot afford to allow that middle 35 to 54 age cohort - many of those present are in that demographic - to feel left behind.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked several valid questions regarding the levels of support and engagement.  Of course, we cannot take the level of support for granted.  The Deputy is right to be cautious.  What we are ascertaining is whether people are in favour of progressing to deeper involvement in Europe and what type of integration that requires.  Understandably, many people still wish for Ireland, as a member state, to maintain control over national competencies.  Obviously, it is a complex issue.  Anything to do with the European Union in terms of sentiment and opinions certainly is.  Support cannot be taken for granted or given on all issues.  It will be interesting to see on what topics citizens particularly focus and what views are expressed as we virtually travel the country in phase 1 of this online consultation.</p><p> Nevertheless, the Deputy is correct.  In terms of treaty change and a referendum, it is welcome from our perspective.  The Taoiseach said only in recent days that Ireland will not rule out treaty change and that will have an impact on a possible referendum in Ireland, but that should not be the starting point.  It would not necessarily be helpful or beneficial to have that as the prerequisite and starting point, but if that is what arises from the process of consultation that will take place throughout the 27 member states, that will be considered.</p><p> As for polarisation, opinions fluctuate and vary.  For example, if we had asked the vaccine question a couple of weeks after the significant increase in vaccine dosage, that would, arguably, have led to a higher finding.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the process of the Conference on the Future of Europe and I am very happy to share that with members.  As they will appreciate, the conference had a somewhat challenging institutional beginning but we officially launched on 9 May.  For us in Ireland, we will seek to take the learnings and adopt best practice, as we did in the future of Europe consultation process in 2018 and 2019, and examine the use of a citizens' assembly, with a safe, interactive and engaged forum for people to have their say.  We will reach out to all elected members to ask them to invite any constituents who are interested in getting involved.</p><p> It is fantastic that we have had a number of expressions of interest from members of the public, including people in the mid-west and Connacht, looking to get involved in the process.  It will take place virtually over a couple of hours, with discussions on a number of key topics such as the economy, digitisation, the role of the EU in global affairs, the environment, climate change and agriculture.  In a series of guided discussions, participants will get relevant information in advance to help prepare and guide them in the discussion.  We will then have an open conversation, which will take place virtually in the different constituencies and be fed back to the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  That will, I hope, form part of the Government's thinking and consideration on this process, as it did in the previous iteration.</p></speech>

I have a few questions that will build on what Deputy Haughey raised.  I was struck that 84% of respondents support remaining, which is, statistically, more or less the same as the referendum result in 1972 that led to Irish accession to the European Communities.  I acknowledge there have been a couple of changes in our guests' findings over recent years, which is to be expected with the highs and lows of Brexit and how that transpired, but it is nonetheless remarkable that the figure is still so high.  As Deputy Haughey rightly said, that should not be taken for granted.  How resilient does Ms O'Connell believe the figure is?  I appreciate that European Movement Ireland is part of the wider European Movement International network.  Has any similar research been carried out by its sister organisations?  How does Ireland stack up in terms of approval for remaining within the EU?</p><p>I was struck by Ms O'Connell's comments on the Conference on the Future of Europe and the important role her organisation will play in that.  I appreciated her presentation to our committee on the previous occasion, and I hope the findings that her organisation sends to the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will also be sent to this committee.  When we talk about the future of Europe, that 52% approve of holding the conference is all well and good but it is not a massive number.  There is a danger the conference will become an internal reflection for the European institutions, as opposed to a real discussion among the citizenry and member state parliamentarians about how we can move Europe forward.  Whether we like it or not, there are considerable challenges facing the Union at the moment.</p><p>I do not buy into the narrative, which is probably put across in other jurisdictions, that the EU is facing a crisis, that it may collapse, that this is the end of the EU and that it is a Franco-German hegemony.  The European project was born out of crisis.  It thrives in crisis.  Its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>is to respond to crisis.  Between the global pandemic and the climate emergency, there are certainly plenty of crises to go round and for the Union to play a strong role in.  How can we, as member state parliamentarians, best feed into this process to ensure it will not just be a talking shop and that there will be some tangible contributions in order that what emerges from the process is not just something that could have been done around a boardroom table in Brussels without talking to any citizens?</p><p>On defence and security co-operation and our allies within the EU, while the figure is still generally positive in regard to increasing co-operation, I am struck by the decline in opposition to such.  The cyberattack on our systems in the past week goes back to the importance of co-operation with other member states in the context of security and defence.  That does not necessarily mean sending troops to some far-flung battlefield or building up armaments but it does mean the exchange of data and information, with the levels of smart policing and security that are so necessary at the moment.  Does Ms O'Connell believe that will feed into the conference or is the issue a little removed, with people simply not thinking about it until it is on their doorsteps?</p><p>It is interesting that the vaccine strategy received a relatively low approval rating.  We are all politicians, and as much as we may deny it in public, we love opinion polls.  We read each one of them and pay attention to them, even though we say the only poll that counts is that on election day, which is of course true.  Even so, they are a snapshot in time, and an opinion poll taken a couple of weeks ago, such as this, could have very different results if taken today.  I wonder, therefore, whether that result might be slightly different if the poll were taken now.</p><p>I should declare I am on campus in Leinster House.  I am not in that squeezed middle cohort but I wish the Chairman the best of luck with his vaccine registration.  In due course, I hope to get there myself.  As the roll-out moves through all the different cohorts and registration opens to them, we see how important the issue is.</p><p>We are very grateful to Ms O'Connell and Mr. O'Shea for the report.  The importance of it is that it is consistent over a period.  They have asked topical questions but the same questions, and we start to see interesting patterns emerging.  Colleagues will want to raise various issues but my final question relates to the feasibility and possibility of a united Ireland.  One of the early achievements of Enda Kenny as Taoiseach, straight after the Brexit referendum, was to get European Council approval that if, at a future date, we voted for unification on this island, that would be automatically accepted by the EU following the precedent of East Germany and West Germany.  That is obviously a major issue for us in Ireland, but as when we talk about Brexit and the Border issue, the level of awareness and knowledge among colleagues in other member states, including former member states, is pretty negligible about what is happening on this island.  Harking back to our guests' engagement with European Movement International, in which they play an important role, are the feasibility and permutations that a vote on a united Ireland might lead to ever raised, even anecdotally, post the Brexit process?</p></speech>

On how resilient the 84% figure is, it has fallen from the halcyon high of 93% in 2019, which we can attribute to a Brexit bounce or dividend when solidarity and all things Brexit on the island of Ireland were front and centre during the Brexit negotiations.</p><p>However, as the Deputy mentioned, 84% of respondents being in favour of continued membership of the EU reflects the figure of 83.1% from almost 40 years ago.  How many things remain consistent through 40 years?  It is a pretty strong tribute to, and recognition of, not only the benefits we have gained as an economy and society, but the increasing level of growth and development we have experienced that in large measure has been helped by our membership of the Union and has enabled us to have a greater voice and say at the global table.</p><p> As regards the Deputy's question on whether other organisations in the wider European Movement International network have carried out similar surveys, they have done so on occasion, although probably not with as much regularity as European Movement Ireland.</p><p> The Deputy asked how the Irish level of support for the EU compares with that in various other member states.  As distinguished members of the committee no doubt know as purveyors of opinion polls, many such polls, a bit like buses, come along at once.  The most recent Eurobarometer survey was published in recent days and indicated that 75% of Irish people have a positive image of the Union.  That is the second highest level in the EU.  It also found that 77% of people in Ireland agree that the interest of Ireland is taken into account at the EU, which is the highest level in the Union.  That is really encouraging.  Of course, we cannot take that for granted or be complacent because, sadly, Brexit has demonstrated the challenges of trying to reverse more than 40 years of negative discourse, rhetoric and diatribe in a very short six-week referendum campaign.  That process of combatting and rebutting misinformation with facts, engagement and constructive dialogue is ongoing and it is not one in respect of which we can choose to take our foot off the pedal, so to speak, notwithstanding the challenging times through which we are living.</p><p> The Deputy made a great point regarding the Conference on the Future of Europe.  We certainly do not want the conference to be more of the same or a navel-gazing, introspective opportunity for the bubble to talk to the bubble, to be honest.  That is why we want as broad, representative, constructive and diverse an engagement with the people of Ireland as possible.  That is why we will be working very hard to ensure we have a diverse and representative demographic.  To follow on from that point, which is similar to a point made by Deputy Haughey, we will be reaching out to bodies and associations that represent and advocate for the rights of migrants, Travellers, civil society groups in Northern Ireland, women's groups, sporting organisations and farming bodies.  Nobody will be left off our list.  In that regard, we are really grateful to and appreciative of the members of the committee for engaging with their constituents and encouraging them to have their say, get involved and put themselves forward to take part in this really important process because if not now, when, and if not us, who?   This is why we want to get as many people involved as possible.</p><p> The Deputy made a very interesting point regarding the involvement of the committee.  There is the formal structure as part of the conference in which national parliaments can become involved.  I am sure that is something he and other members of the committee will consider.  More broadly, it is obvious that we cannot have 5,000 people in Munster on a Zoom call debating the various topics.  We will have to try to narrow it down.  We will encourage people to listen in, get involved and have their say.  As the process progresses, we would love for the members of the committee to get involved and take part.  We are somewhat in the embryonic planning stages.  This was a lot easier in the world before Covid.  As the Chairman is no doubt aware, we had an excellent citizen dialogue in person up in lovely Letterkenny where we had approximately 80 people get involved around tables for three hours.  There was a moderator on every table and we got to meet everyone.  The Minister heard what the constituents were saying.  We now have to try to replicate that process in the virtual online world.  I encourage members to consult, engage and promote and help us to spread the message and to exhort their constituents to get involved.  </p><p> Deputies Richmond and Haughey referred to the finding that 54% of respondents favoured Ireland being part of increased defence and security co-operation.  As we have gone around the country in recent years discussing this range of topics on the future of Europe, we have seen an increasing recognition and realisation in this regard, as the Deputies mentioned, and observed that the number of those against such increased co-operation has been in steady decline.  There is a growing awareness that, as we have sadly seen this week, cyberterrorism does not respect borders, which highlights the importance of cybersecurity.  It is necessary to pool our collective knowledge and consider how to defeat these challenges that are not just at a national level but at a global level.  That is certainly an issue of which people in Ireland are increasingly mindful.</p><p> As regards Deputy Richmond's question on a united Ireland in the EU, I refer to the situation prior to December and the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA, and the withdrawal agreement being signed off.  There is obviously a welcome understanding, recognition and appreciation of the importance of supporting, maintaining and upholding the principles and hard-won peace of the Good Friday Agreement and the solidarity of mitigating the worst impacts of Brexit on the island of Ireland.  There is among our counterparts a recognition, appreciation and understanding of that.  This issue has moved down the agenda somewhat within the EU more broadly.  Many member states and our sister organisations are focused now on growing and navigating their way to recovery post the Covid pandemic and looking at the institutional challenges the EU may need to consider further.  The tax issue is one to which the Deputy referred.  The issue of the island of Ireland and the Brexit impact is not as high on the agenda as it was previously but I am confident and assured that solidarity remains and support exists for working collectively to mitigate against the worst impacts of Brexit, which, let us be frank, is something that certainly was not desired by the majority of people on this island.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021051900002#D00200"><p>I thank Ms O'Connell for her comprehensive and thoughtful presentation, as always, to those of us engaged on European matters.  As Deputy Richmond stated, Oireachtas Members use polling all the time and are impacted by it, regardless of what we say publicly.  We are also focused on the nature of polling and know that the question put and the timing of it is extremely important to the result one gets.  Some advocacy groups present poll findings to committees of the Houses and others with a question that is obviously weighted in such a way that it will get the result the group expects.  However, this comprehensive view is important for us.  I wish to drill down into the nature of the questions put.  The overarching question with regard to whether the person supports continued membership of the EU is straightforward and clear and people understand that.  It is remarkable that there has been such a high and consistent figure in favour of continued membership.  I know from looking at polls from my constituency and political polls that a consistent figure in an area over several decades cannot involve the same people, so there are different cohorts of people who amount to the same number being won over.</p><p>The impact of the debate on Brexit has focused people on the EU, which had been a sort of passive backdrop to our lives for many people.  The notion that a state can disintegrate itself or disentangle itself from a 40-year integrated trade and political co-operation arrangement has underscored the value of membership of the Union.  Some people, including very many British colleagues to whom I have spoken, were also genuinely surprised by the degree of solidarity Ireland received.  The view, certainly of the Brexiteers, was that we would be left alone amid the greater economic consequences of Brexit when hard economics came into play, and that was not the case.  That has impacted people's positivity.<br/><br/>The more granular questions, such as whether there should be more health competence or more economic integration if it means less control, are too abstract to get meaningful answers from.  Someone has to say specifically what he or she means if he or she is to get a meaningful response to a question such as that.  The default system for most of us is the <i>status quo</i>unless we have a compelling reason to support change.  To the notion as to whether competence will be ceded, questions must be asked as to what end and what specifics?  One cannot receive meaningful responses to those general questions.<br/><br/>This comes down to my last focus and question, which is on the future of Europe, a really important debate, and the nature of our interaction.  We all love hearing from people.  After every election defeat, the first thing a political party will say is that it will talk to the electorate again and reconnect.  That is a really important thing to do, but the nature of that reconnection and that dialogue is important.  We have a representative democracy, that is, an elected Parliament; we do not have a direct democracy whereby everything is put to a popular vote.  People therefore expect suggestions, ideas and visions to be presented to them.  My question is how the witnesses see the process unfolding.  Should it involve the electorate in all their different structures and compositions being presented with alternative visions of the future for them to make their choice, or is it to be a passive listening exercise whereby someone goes into a room and asks them what they think, which is a lot less constructive?<br/><br/>Finally, I recall many years ago, when I was involved in local government discussions, that the local government organisation went around to communities to ask what they wanted in their communities.  They said, &quot;Here is a blank page.  What do you want?&quot;  Everybody had a great dialogue and there were round tables and so on and at the end of it every community wanted a swimming pool, a bowling alley and a hospital.  There was a list of items everybody wanted as opposed to a vision of what was practical and doable and what the options were.  How do the witnesses see the dialogue meaningfully engaging with people to build a consensus as to what the vision of a new Europe should be?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.109" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noelle O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021051900002#E00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I agree with him.  All his comments resonate with us and we will take them on board.  Far be it from me to drill down into the merits, nuances and subtleties of polling with distinguished committee members.  They all know far more about opinion polling than I ever will.  Let us be very honest: it is difficult to set definitive answers to specific questions.  We are limited by both resources and the number of questions in the poll; otherwise, we would have had hundreds of questions.  They are designed to try to gauge broad sentiment in specific areas.  Unfortunately, the Deputy is correct that we cannot drill down into every nuance and specific policy area to the extent we would like, but we see the value and the merit in nonetheless getting a broad brushstroke focus.  It is interesting that we have seen a reluctance among people in Ireland to cede control over tax more broadly over many years and in response to different question formats.  That trend has remained consistent throughout our polling.  What we are trying to do is build a picture of the sentiment in certain areas, recognising, of course, the limitations that come with this and the caveats and health warnings the Deputy constructively outlined.</p> <p>  The question about the process unfolding and whether it will just become a passive listening exercise is a great one.  From our perspective, there is a big challenge in this regard.  It is a little like apple pie, swimming pools and bowling alleys for everyone.  We will have to try to set realistic expectations and manage them because what the people in Ireland might have to say about how they see an evolving and a reforming EU taking place could be very different from what our counterparts in, for example, Slovenia, might say.  Slovenia will assume the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU in a couple of weeks.  How do we get this balance right?  There will have to be compromise, and the committee has discussed this over previous meetings.  The challenge will be to reconcile the vision while managing realistic expectations and taking on board the differing and competing views and perspectives across member states, as we have seen only too well and too frequently with something as complex, multifaceted and challenging as the 27 member states that comprise the EU and its diverse population of more than 450 million citizens.  At the end of the process, perhaps we will be able to get an idea of how the Union can be better, work better and serve the interests of its citizens.  I refer to polls similar to those we have carried out in Ireland and the Eurobarometer polls and their findings and statistics.  They will tell us what the EU is doing and give somewhat of a report card.  That will be important.  The Deputy is absolutely correct.</p> <p>  When I present on the topic of the citizens' assemblies, as I am frequently invited to do, and I am asked to share the Irish experience, Ireland is held up as a model of best practice, which is a fantastic tribute to how we approach these debates.  People always point to the fact that the citizens' assemblies dealt with very sensitive, delicate and contentious issues on which the Government reflected and which the Oireachtas looked at and that many of those issues were then put to a vote in referendums in which people voted and made their voices and opinions heard on those issues.  It will be a challenge to get the balance right between vision and expectation management, but I hope we will have the constructive engagement of committee members, the Oireachtas and the Government, and that commitment is there.  We always say that this cannot be just a talking shop and that the information, views and feedback cannot be just compiled, put into a report and left sitting on a shelf.  A tribute to us all in Ireland is that the views and perspectives of our citizens have been inputted into the Irish position.  That is of real comfort and is something we will stress and reinforce as we embark on this constructive conversation, dialogue and listening process.</p></speech>

It showed some interesting results.  Every politician will say that an opinion poll is only a snapshot in time.</p> <p>  One of the questions posed in the poll is rather poignant.  It is the question on Ireland's position on the UN Security Council as an opportunity for us to influence global affairs.  It would be interesting if we asked that question at this point after four meetings of the council in light of the horrendous situation in Gaza and its failure to take a position or at least issue a statement.  I believe the response to that particular question now would be skewed in a different way given the complete failure of the council in that regard.</p> <p>  There was a question on whether Ireland should be party to increased EU defence and security co-operation.  That was a timely question given everything that has gone on in respect of cybersecurity.  Was any analysis done on the views of people on neutrality?  We know people have strong views on Irish neutrality and that two thirds of people favour our strong position on neutrality.  Was any analysis done on fears of erosion of our position, especially given our strengthening ties with the European Defence Agency and our participation in EU battle groups and so on?  Was any analysis done around concerns in that regard?</p> <p>  There is another question I am keen to tease out further.  It relates to the law and principles such as democracy, human rights and equality.  It is an important question but I believe it was skewed a little.  Was any further analysis carried out in respect of trade agreements in which the EU is a participant?  Under a Euro-Mediterranean agreement we are trade partners with Israel.  We know about the gross human rights violations that are continuing.  We know about the human rights aspects of that trade agreement and the failure of the EU to implement sections relating to human rights.  Was any analysis done with regard to the views of people on trade agreements and human rights violations?  It was probably a missed opportunity in not asking a question around the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement.  It is an issue on which this committee has undertaken specific work and analysis.  Was any assessment or analysis carried out on that?</p> <p>  The next issue is the question in respect of a united Ireland in the EU within the next ten years.  Again, this was a missed opportunity.  While the results are interesting, I do not believe they are in line with the broad view of Irish people and the broad support for Irish unity.  That particular question could have been accompanied by other questions to determine the numbers who support the concept of Irish unity.  Will Ms O'Connell touch on that to see whether any analysis was carried out?</p> <p>  I will finish on the Conference on the Future of Europe.  What are the views of Ms O'Connell and the organisation on how we engage with citizens from the North in the conference?  Should the Government make a specific argument for northern citizens to partake in the conference in their own right?  It is well known at this stage that they will be subject to EU rules and regulations but will have no say in the future of the EU.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noelle O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021051900002#F00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  There were some excellent questions there.  I will start with the question on the UN Security Council.  As I mentioned previously in response to Deputy Howlin's, we are somewhat limited by breadth.  We do not carry out a Eurobarometer survey.  As much as we would like to, we cannot and do not have the resources to really drill down into greater detail on the 50 key topics that we would like to.  Maybe some day we will get to that stage.</p> <p>  In any case, every year we try to ask a pertinent and topical question.  I am delighted that the Deputy raised the question we posed on the UN Security Council.  It is encouraging to see 68% of people in Ireland agreeing that Ireland's seat on the council offers us an important opportunity to influence global affairs.  That is certainly to be welcomed.  Ireland's permanent mission to the UN is working constructively and proactively on all matters to ensure we exercise the Irish voice and bring to bear the Irish perspective to the best extent that we can through the UN and the UN Security Council.  It is important to see that support is in place among people in Ireland in that regard.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about our analysis of neutrality and the view of 54% on increasing defence co-operation.  Over the 2018-19 period, physical future of Europe citizen dialogues took place throughout the country.  We can see the views from our conversations with people from Letterkenny to Cork and everywhere in between.  There is appreciation, understanding and a proud recognition of our track record in peacekeeping.  We have the longest unbroken peacekeeping service.  There is recognition of the importance of maintaining our neutrality.  The view is that it is not mutually exclusive from looking at proactively engaging in some of the defence and security matters that can be engaged in co-operatively.  Arguably, few would disagree that the recent cyberterrorism and cybersecurity attacks have highlighted the importance of looking to combat these threats.</p> <p>  As the Deputy knows, there were efforts to look at misinformation and disinformation.  We saw a great deal of misinformation around vaccines and coronavirus.  Interestingly, one of the questions we posed in the poll was whether the EU should do more to regulate social media platforms.  More than 70% of people in Ireland believed that should take place.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked an interesting question on trade agreements and trade deals.  Due to space and budgeting, we had to leave that question out this year.  In the 2020 poll, we posed a question to people on whether EU trade deals with other countries throughout the world benefit Ireland.</p><p>A total of 75% responded in the affirmative so they agreed that EU trade deals with other countries around the world benefit Ireland, 17% did not know and 8% disagreed.  The rate for Dublin was 75%, the rate for Leinster was 79%, and the rate for Munster, Connacht and Ulster was 72%.  The Deputy is correct that we did not pose a question specifically on CETA but, again, this issue is certainly not going to go away.  We look forward to putting the question, or some form of it, in future polls.</p><p> On the Deputy's question on a united Ireland, he is absolutely right.  Our polling has indicated broadly similar answers on this question over recent years.  A Kantar-Independent News and Media poll on 1 May showed that 67% of adults in the South support a united Ireland and that 16% are opposed to it.  For Northern Ireland, the same poll shows 35% of adults are in favour of a united Ireland and 43% are against it, although, significantly, one in five did not express an opinion.  That there are those who say they do not know or do not express an opinion highlights for us the importance and necessity of constructively engaging and having a conversation on this topic.  The BBC LucidTalk poll showed 51% would vote for a united Ireland while 27% would vote against it.  It is interesting to see the different figures in the various polls.  It indicates that this is a topic whose importance is such that we have to engage on it.  We must have a conversation on it in the North and South.  We will certainly be doing that.</p><p> Reference was made to EU citizens in the North.  As I am sure members will be aware, more than 700,000 people in Northern Ireland have an Irish passport and are therefore entitled to be and are EU citizens.  At the national event to launch the Conference on the Future of Europe on Friday, 14 May, it was constructive and welcome to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Thomas Byrne, all refer specifically and repeatedly in their opening remarks to the importance of focusing on and engaging with people in the North.  We will do this in the Ulster citizens' dialogue.  We will reach out to all community groups, political organisations, civil society groups, trade associations and sports clubs and encouraging them to help us spread the message.  I hope some of their members will be interested in taking part.  I assure them that we will be doing this very proactively.  It is welcome to see that everyone from the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Taoiseach were at one on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1602" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021051900002#G00200"><p>I thank the witnesses.  As always, we have heard an interesting presentation.  Deputy Howlin's remarks on polls and how they are read are worth reflecting on.  I will take up the Chairman's challenge on behalf of all those between 45 and 54.  We are Generation Europe.  Some of us were born in 1973.  We grew up with Europe.  According to the poll, 55% of those aged between 35 and 44 agree Europe is moving in the right direction.  The rate drops way down to 42% among those aged between 45 and 54 and increases again among those aged between 55 and 64.  On the question on whether Ireland should remain a member of the EU, 85% of those aged between 35 and 44 agree.  The rate is nine percentage points lower among those aged between 45 and 54.  To what is that decrease attributable?  What is the most sceptical age group in other EU countries?  Is this process replicated in European movements in other member states?  How do our key measures stand by comparison with those of other member states?</p> <p>  Ms O'Connell mentioned consultation and engagement.  In this regard, is it worthwhile to focus on the age groups that seem to diverge from the norm?  I do not want to use the word "sceptical".  There is a lot of convergence regarding the questions but the figures I have mentioned stand out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noelle O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021051900002#G00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  He made a great point on Generation Europe.  He referred to the disenchanted middle, to which I alluded.  From a socio-demographic perspective, it is interesting to note support for EU membership is particularly high among younger and older generations.  Interestingly, this contrasts somewhat with the trend in many fellow member states, which generally experience a decline in support for the EU among the older cohort.  Ireland is something of an outlier in that regard.  That is probably attributable to the older generation having seen how many improvements were afforded to them, their children and grandchildren through the opportunities afforded to us by membership.  Interestingly, with regard to the finding that 76% of those aged between 45 to 54, or Generation Europe, support membership, a possible explanation is that this cohort has gained the most from opportunities afforded by EU membership since 1973 but, conversely, has also lost the most as a result of the economic, banking and financial crises from 2008 and onwards.  To follow on from Deputy Brady's points, we would probably need to carry out further analysis of this and have more focus groups on it.  It is, perhaps, illustrative of the point Deputy Calleary is trying to make.  He is correct in asking what more we can do to engage.  It is a matter of ensuring that the demographic in question is represented at every stage in the Conference on the Future of Europe process.</p> <p>  On the question on what other organisations do, which was also posed by Deputy Richmond, some organisations do what we do on occasion but not to the same level.  The EU's Eurobarometer surveys, which are carried out regularly and consistently, give a quite good EU perspective on some of the questions and topics we have touched upon but the EU poll we have carried out since 2013, with its caveats and health warnings, is to try to give an Irish snapshot.  It gives us a little more leeway to pose some of the questions through an Irish prism.  Perhaps we lose the Irish flavour in the wider Eurobarometer surveys, which, understandably, must cater for, and are targeted at, a wider EU audience.  It is a matter of trying to get the balance right.  I am sure we could have many committee meetings and engagements answering a compare and contrast leaving certificate question on all the various polls, results and findings.  I do not know what time we would finish at but there would certainly be a lot for us to explore.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021051900002#HH00100"><p>I will probably be in some agreement with much of what has been said but I will pontificate and the witnesses can feel free to agree, refute or even attack what I say.  Like everyone else when it comes to polls, I trust the ones that support my argument and the others, I believe, need to be questioned.</p> <p>  I imagine a significant number of people would agree that the EU is moving in the right direction, particularly post Brexit and the solidarity that was shown.  I do not know if it relates to what the Chairman, Deputy Calleary and others said about the 45 to 54 years cohort and whether that could still be the outworkings of the banking crisis and the feeling that we were treated badly by Europe.  People&rsquo;s mode and mood changed on the EU in respect of the Covid vaccine.  It was really good at selling the idea of European solidarity but there was a certain failure to keep the eye on the ball and it was not until Thierry Breton was put in place that there was more focus.  The question that will occur next time will be about the part the EU and the Commission plays in international solidarity, ensuring maximum supply throughout the world so we are all safe, because that is the only way that will happen.</p> <p>  People welcomed it when the EU and the Commission got their acts together on co-operation.  I understand that we are always afraid of ceding that terrible term "sovereignty", and but it can be of benefit particularly on healthcare.  Even without having competencies, when we made determinations at a European level we were able to do business.  That is probably what we have to work on.  It is only through that sort of work that you will sell that idea.  </p> <p>  There is a question on the Conference on the Future of Europe, reform and a referendum.  I am not sure if there is much desire for a referendum but everyone wants to have their voice and we need to take the opportunity and try our best to get out to all parts of society.  I attended the launch remotely and I feel as though Ms O'Connell and Mr. O'Shea have spent a considerable time on my screen at this stage.  It is necessary work and we need to ensure that we engage as many people as possible because there are many cohorts and groups that do not engage, for whom Europe is very much foreign.  That is something we need to deal with.</p> <p>  The EU is seen as a means for dealing with some issues that we have not been good at dealing with, notably climate change and digital media.  Sometimes significant issues need to be dealt with on a global or European basis.  It is hardly shocking that there is 71% agreement on the issue of sharing platforms and social media.  We had a shock this week with the cyberattack.  That fits somewhat into the question of security and defence but I would separate out anything relating to military areas.  The State has a very good history of peacekeeping, which is something that people are proud of and want to maintain.  </p> <p>  There is a question around whether there should be more political and economic integration in the EU and whether this means member states lose control over economic policy and tax.  That is the area of corporation tax and fear around that.  As much as we want co-operation, we also want to be able to set rules that impact positively on our own economy and how we organise our society.   These issues will have to find a level.  Over the years, some people had a difficulty with the EU veering too far to the right and away from the public space into the private.  In Ireland and across Europe, the pandemic showed the need for governments to step up to the mark, particularly when the chips are down. </p> <p>  I referred to increased EU defence and security co-operation.  People are okay with some parts but I agree with Deputy Brady&rsquo;s earlier remarks about neutrality being a core belief.  I am not sure about the idea that the US should remain an important ally for EU defence co-operation.  That probably requires more questions on what people are agreeing to there.  As much as America is a significant entity whether in defence or international trade, this week in particular we find ourselves having been in disagreement with the Trump Administration, now in disagreement with the Biden Administration and what it is not doing to sort out the Palestine issue.  </p> <p>  Of course everyone is going to agree that the EU should only provide funds to member states if their governments adhere to rule of law principles, democracy, human rights and equality.  There are issues in Hungary and Poland, particularly around LGBTQ people, but there are also issues we overlook such as Catalonia and the disgraceful actions of the Spanish Government.  Some of those may not technically fall under European competencies but we need to have a real conversation on this.  </p> <p>  This week we saw the difficulty the EU had among foreign ministers to merely support a call for a ceasefire this week.  Hungary held out on it.  The onus is on us as a State and those who agree with us when it matters.  When we are dealing with the slaughter in Palestine and years and years of annexation, plantation, stealing of lands and apartheid, action needs to be taken.  We need to step up whether we act alone or alongside some of our colleagues but not all of them.  Only by doing the right thing will we put the pressure on.  In recent weeks, there has been agreement that we need to do what was done to apartheid South Africa, which was done through international solidarity.  Let us look at what happened in Ireland.  It started with a small number of workers in Dunnes Stores who were simply not willing to deal with South African produce.  We need to start looking at this because it is not just about the slaughter at this time but about ensuring justice and a real solution for the Palestinian people because the disparity is too great between Israel and Palestine.  As long as we give only weak words while the Americans give complete support to Israel, nothing will change.  Were this to happen at an EU level, it would show Europe in the best light and be a major selling point to citizens that it is stepping up for our rights and those of others.  </p> <p>  Deputy Brady also dealt with the UN Security Council.  We believed it was great but we were shown how powerless it was when it could not even determine a statement on a ceasefire, never mind the stronger terms that were required about the crimes of Israel.  It is another case where we have to use the position, even if only to call out the ridiculousness of our not being able to make a determination at that level and make a clear statement on an absolute wrong.</p><p>On the question of whether there will be a united Ireland in the EU in the next ten years, further questions need to be asked.  The Brexit crisis has changed everything.  The conversation has started.  People may be agreeing on the basis of the conversation going on at this point in time with regard to unionism being at odds with itself.  The British Government then piles confusion on top of confusion.  Even at meetings of this committee, he heard how the relationship between Vice-President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi and David Frost was going quite well but now David Frost has set a date of 12 July, by which he will either get his way or it will be end of the Irish protocol.  This is utterly ridiculous.  Like all statements from the British Government on European affairs or the relationship with Europe, one cannot be sure if it is a negotiating gambit or a real position.  The fact is that agreements have been agreed to and these must be honoured.  </p><p> We have all mentioned the democratic deficit in Northern representation.  We have to use every forum we have in this regard.  I accept what the representatives have said; the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, did all attest to the fact that significant Northern representation or involvement was required in the Conference on the Future of Europe.  That is all to be welcomed but there is a need for further questions.  I also imagine that a significant number of those engaging are doing so on the basis of the rights that were removed from them by their removal from the EU despite their having voted to remain within it.  The only solution to this which will be enabled by the EU is Irish unity.  Whatever anybody thinks about that, if we fail to plan, we are not doing what needs to be done.  It is straightforward.  The sensible thing is to have a plan and a conversation and to deal with the ins and outs of what this united Ireland would look like.  Again, this would be a united Ireland within the framework of Europe.  I have definitely pontificated sufficiently.  I thank the witnesses very much.  I am sure some will have wished they had a button to mute me.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.120" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noelle O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021051900002#J00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his excellent points.  I could not comment on whether there was any pontificating involved.  I will start by apologising.  May is traditionally one of the busiest months in European Movement Ireland.  Not only did we have Europe Week starting on 9 May but, in the past two weeks, we have been involved in supporting the fantastic work of, and partnering with, the Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and the Department of Foreign Affairs in two national launches.  One was the launch of the Conference on the Future of Europe, which the Deputy mentioned, and the other was the launch of the Government's EU jobs strategy, which is about encouraging and promoting awareness among Irish people of the career opportunities that exist for them in the various EU institutions, bodies and agencies.  That is a fantastic strategy.  It is very important because it will really work to provide opportunities to make sure we have a pipeline of Irish officials to ensure we are represented at every level and around every table.</p> <p>  With regard to the screens, if I can use the EU jobs strategy launch as an example, paradoxically, one of the positive aspects of this crisis with regard to the virtual world is that more than 700 people registered to watch the Government's national launch of the EU jobs strategy.  I was contacted by people working for UN agencies in Fiji and people working in Canada who were looking to learn more about the opportunities available.  I apologise but this is a great opportunity to discuss and debate Ireland's relationship with the EU and Europe and how to go about framing and improving that relationship.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct and he hit the nail on the head in respect of the vaccine strategy.  If it a point often forgotten but the EU is one of the few global blocs, if not the only one, to export vaccines and to facilitate access to vaccines and to the supply chain for less fortunate or developing countries.  If we are honest about it, others have not been as forthcoming or generous in that regard.  The Deputy is correct that none of us is protected until we are all protected.  That is why it is welcome to see the progress in respect of the roll-out of the vaccine strategy.  I hope that, if it please God, we will swiftly move through all demographics and cohorts here in Ireland.  The EU has, in fact, exported more than 100 million doses of vaccine.  That is to be commended and recognised.  It obviously did not get everything right.  The Deputy is absolutely spot on in that.  There was a slow and bumpy start.  The template and roadmap were possibly not as easy to implement at such a fast speed but I really hope that the EU will take the lessons it has learned from this process into the years ahead.  I apologise as I misspoke.  In excess of 200 million doses have been exported.  I am getting my statistics and figures wrong.  It is therefore an even better and more improved performance.  </p> <p>  The Deputy touched on corporate tax issues.  It is a really interesting point.  We want to put that question in our poll every year.  I believe it is interesting.  It shows where Irish people's thinking is.  This issue is obviously assuming greater focus and urgency, not least following the Commission's announcement yesterday or President Biden's comments.  It is certainly fair to say, in light of the work the OECD is doing and the challenges of dealing with tax, that this is a global rather than a national issue.  It is certainly something about which people in Ireland feel very strongly.  It is interesting to see such consistency in our findings across the years.  </p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy.  What we want, and what everyone really wants, is a reforming EU that fully lives up to the values it espouses and was founded upon.  We are nothing if we do not hold true to our values.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  I share many of the sentiments he has expressed with regard to maintaining and upholding the rule of law, equality and respect for human rights and human dignity.  We should not be afraid to call that out.  It is welcome to see countries stepping up to the plate more actively and putting forward their perspectives more vocally, notwithstanding that it is impossible to get consensus and agreement across all member states.  We in Ireland are doing that.  Again, we have to be a little bit cognisant of managing expectations in that regard but it is welcome to see Ireland collectively putting forward our robust perspectives and constructively feeding into various conversations taking place at all levels.  With regard to the UN, it is important that we continue to do that.  It is something we have been doing.  Notwithstanding the geopolitical challenges that characterise the increasingly multifaceted global world order, it is important that we in Ireland use our voice effectively to the best of our ability and that we continue to do that.  The Deputy is correct; there is an onus and a responsibility on us to do so.  </p> <p>  We touched on the united Ireland question.  European Movement Ireland is one of the participants in the Brexit stakeholder forum of the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We very fortunate to have had a presentation a number of weeks or months ago from the Vice-President of the European Commission, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi.</p><p>His knowledge, commitment and solidarity with the island of Ireland to work collectively to mitigate the worst impacts of Brexit for the citizens in the North and recognise the challenges it poses to businesses, SMEs and all of us here in Ireland, was striking, welcome and important.  He carried out the same consultative forum listening process with stakeholder groups and associations in the North.  That is to be commended. </p><p> I raised the issue with him of ensuring the representative voice of those people in the North who identify as Irish and European continuing to be represented and advocated for.  I am grateful to and appreciative of Vice-President &Scaron;efovi recognising this fact.  I hope the Commission will continue to seek to engage with all of us on this island in that regard and ensure we maintain that engagement.</p><p> A great Corkman said fail to plan is to plan to fail.  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is absolutely right that in any of these conversations, question and discussions we have posed in our new Ireland and the EU poll we want to make sure we keep doing that.  I will have that as our motto for the conference on the future of Europe.  I hope when I am invited to look back on the process, we will be able to report on the positive and constructive outcomes and that we are in a better place this time next year, having gone through the process and learned significantly, than where we are now.</p></speech>

It is always good to reflect on polls and to discuss issues.  I will go back to that 45 to 55 year-old cohort again.  It is fascinating in terms of the percentage who believe there will be a united Ireland in the EU in the next ten years.  There was a lowest percentage of 20% as well.  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; alluded to the banking crisis in terms of the confidence in Europe.  There are so many areas to explore and it is invaluable to have these statistics, especially as we embark on a comprehensive engagement on the future of Europe.</p> <p>  It is valuable and helpful and the breakdown, from geographical to gender breakdown, is interesting.  The geographical differences are not stark; they are quite similar.  There are a couple of differences on the Connacht-Ulster side and on the Munster side, where a bigger percentage in Munster, at 35%, see a united Ireland in the next ten years.  There are many figures and statistics and we are grateful for them.</p> <p>  Ar son an choiste, t&aacute; m&eacute; f&iacute;orbhu&iacute;och de na finn&eacute;ithe agus na comhghleacaithe uile agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leo as ucht teacht go dt&iacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht.

Thank you for the invitation to meet with the committee today to discuss issues relevant to general insurance in Ireland.  Zurich welcomes the opportunity to be part of this important discussion and to contribute to the work of this committee.  Since our last meeting with the committee in October 2019, we have grown our overall market share to 10% and our business now employs 400 people across our Dublin and Wexford offices.  We remain a proudly Irish business, with 100% local management team focused on the Irish market, writing around &euro;350 million in premiums in Ireland.  We have maintained our AA- financial strength rating, which means Zurich customers can continue to rely on us to consistently deliver on our promise when it matters.</p> <p>  Like all businesses, the impact of Covid-19 was unexpected and unprecedented.  Our immediate priority, when the first lockdown was announced in March 2020, was to support the national effort, protect our employees' well-being and maintain full service to our customers by moving the vast majority of our employees to remote working.  We maintained a robust consumer protection risk framework to manage customer conduct risk and drive positive behaviours.  This framework brings to life our ingrained practice of listening to customers and treating them fairly in line with the Consumer Protection Code and is evidenced by our low level of customer complaints, less than 1%, based on active policies and received claims in 2020. </p> <p>  Claims reputation is particularly important to Zurich.  We strive to provide an efficient and fair claims experience for our customers and our reputation for paying valid claims is a key factor behind our market success over many years.  In line with our existing claims philosophy, Zurich is committed to treating all our customers honestly, fairly and professionally.  We ensured that this approach was applied to all Covid-19-related claims from the beginning.  Our approach to all claims is to investigate the individual facts of each claim, clearly explain policy coverage to the customer and communicate the rationale for our determination on liability to the customer in writing.  Where there is cover, any claims offer is fair and represents our best estimate of the customer's reasonable entitlement. </p> <p>  We offer internal appeals and complaints processes to all customers.  We also advise them of how to bring any complaints to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman of Ireland and, to date, we have been notified of one complaint to the ombudsman in relation to a Covid-19 claim.  Our approach is fully aligned to the expectations set out in the "Dear CEO" letter, issued by the Central Bank of Ireland, CBI, on 27 March 2020, in relation to business interruption claims and the CBI&rsquo;s business interruption insurance supervisory framework.  Zurich is committed to continue to meet the CBI&rsquo;s expectations as set out in the letter and framework, through our dedicated and professional handling of all Covid-19 claims.</p> <p>  I will turn to the new guidelines on judicial awards and the impact on policy premiums.  Let me first say that Zurich welcomes this change as a meaningful step to deliver lower insurance premiums to Irish customers.  I want to take this opportunity to again confirm that we will pass on the benefits of resulting reduced claim costs to our customers.  I am sure the committee will appreciate that there are certain important legal limitations, particularly under competition law, that limit my sharing of any competitively sensitive information or speculating in relation to either future premium levels or Zurich&rsquo;s future pricing strategy.  Each individual insurer will need to independently assess their own view of the impact of the changes and act accordingly.  We have completed our initial analysis of the expected impact of the new guidelines on our future claims costs.  Claims costs make up a significant part of premium, so it is logical any reductions in such costs should positively impact premiums and in the coming weeks we are implementing changes to customer premiums to reflect the impact of this reform action on claims costs. </p> <p>  The new guidelines should lead to material reductions in general award levels.  I also hope they will lead to an increased percentage of claimants accepting Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, awards.  PIAB provides a fair, cost-effective and consistent mechanism to provide compensation to claimants, which benefits all key stakeholders and society at large.  In recent years, Zurich has continued to accept over 90% of the awards made by PIAB.  We have seen a consistent fall in claimant acceptance from approximately 65% in 2013 down to around 50% today.</p><p>The most recent national claims information database, NCID, report on private motor insurance clearly demonstrated that most claimants do not receive a significantly higher award subsequent to rejecting a PIAB award.  It usually takes a further two years to settle the claim, with a marginally higher amount paid to the claimant but with the resulting legal costs adding more than 50% to the average claim cost.  Any action that can be taken to increase PIAB claimant acceptance rates will reduce the future costs of claims in Ireland.  I welcome the ongoing work to reform and refine the work of the PIAB, which could lead to further reductions in insurance costs and, inevitably, customer premiums in a competitive market.  Zurich is committed to continuing to review and adjust its premiums in light of future reform and market developments to ensure we continue to offer fair and competitive prices to our customers.  I look forward to answering questions from the committee.</p></speech>

I now invite Mr. O'Midheach of FBD Insurance to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom&aacute;s O'Midheach" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051900002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  In my brief opening statement, I will introduce FBD and touch on topics of interest to the committee.  I was appointed chief executive officer in January 2021.  I am joined today by my colleagues, Ms Kate Tobin, chief underwriting officer, and Mr. Jackie McMahon, chief claims officer.  FBD was established in the 1960s by farmers for farmers and has built on those roots in agriculture to become a dedicated general insurer serving the needs of our agricultural, small business and consumer customers throughout Ireland.  More than 900 people are employed by FBD across 24 counties.  We are Ireland's only remaining indigenous general insurer and our business is entirely focused on the Irish market.  We hold approximately 10% of the liability, motor and property insurance market in Ireland, as measured by share of gross written premium and we have approximately 500,000 policyholders.</p> <p>  We fully understand and appreciate the impact the Covid-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, on our customers.  During 2020, FBD provided approximately &euro;12 million in rebates to our commercial and motor customers.  We continue to provide rebates to impacted commercial customers, at a total cost of &euro;4 million thus far in 2021.  With regard to business interruption, it was evident from the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic that differing points of view existed concerning the application of business interruption insurance under FBD's public house insurance policy.  In order to determine liability and provide clarity and quantum, we supported the intervention of the courts.  We worked in a collaborative manner to ensure the process was carried out as efficiently as possible, with FBD covering the reasonable costs of all parties involved in the case.  As the committee is aware, judgment in the case was handed down by the Commercial Court on 5 February.  That judgment has provided the necessary clarity in regard to policy cover.  FBD fully accepts liability and we have moved quickly to engage with affected customers.  Interim payments of more than &euro;11 million have been made as we await the final resolution from the courts.  There is a further court hearing scheduled in July to determine how the final elements of claim settlements are to be backdated.</p> <p>  Many publicans in Ireland have been loyal and valued customers of FBD for many years.  We are thankful for their ongoing custom during this challenging period for them.  We are proud that our retention rate among those customers remains high.  We are very supportive of the Government's insurance reform agenda to reduce premiums for consumers, borrowers and businesses.  The average premium for FBD's private car customers has reduced by approximately 20% since 2017.  We continue to monitor our claims experience and claims costs closely, and we are committed to reducing premiums.  This year, we particularly welcome the adoption and implementation of new Judicial Council guidelines for personal injuries awards, which is a very positive step.  While we have yet to see the new guidelines reflected in awards by the PIAB or in the courts, we have been proactive in reflecting their assumed future impact on the premiums currently being quoted to our customers.</p> <p>  I must mention the ongoing competition law investigation by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, into the private motor insurance sector.  FBD takes compliance with the competition rules very seriously and is, of course, working in good faith with the CCPC on its investigation.  We will endeavour to assist the committee as far as possible but, as members will appreciate, we are constrained in terms of what we can say around sensitive competitive dynamics such as pricing, including potential price changes, and our confidential commercial strategy.  I look forward to any questions or queries members might have.</p></speech>

I now invite Mr. Declan O'Rourke of Aviva Insurance Ireland to make an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.133" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051900002#B00500"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to discuss issues relating to business continuity insurance and the recent changes to judicial awards and their impact on policy premiums.  These are issues of significant importance to all stakeholders in the Irish insurance industry and we welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  As the CEO of Aviva's general insurance business, Aviva Insurance Ireland, I cannot respond to questions on mortgage protection, which is a life policy underwritten by a separate Aviva business here in Ireland.  However, I have made available to the committee a short statement from Aviva Life &amp;amp; Pensions Ireland on the impact of Covid-19 on underwriting criteria for life policies, which also clarifies queries on the impact of vaccinations on mortgage protection claims.</p> <p>  Aviva has been operating in the Irish market for more than 240 years.  Our businesses in Ireland are fully owned subsidiaries of the international insurance group Aviva plc, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a member of the FTSE 100 Index.  In Ireland, Aviva currently employs 1,500 people across our offices in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  Aviva Insurance Ireland, of which I am CEO, and Aviva Life &amp;amp; Pensions Ireland are significant general insurance and life players in the Irish market.  We are sustainable and socially responsible insurers that seek to deliver value for all stakeholders, including our customers, over the long term.  We contribute significantly to national sports and community organisations through our sponsorship of the Aviva Stadium and our support of charitable and community causes.  We remain committed to operating in a competitive Irish insurance market that is stable and sustainable for our customers.  We have led the market in supporting insurance reform and we continue to support the creation of a more sustainable and less volatile market, which will assist with both the cost and availability of insurance for all our customers.</p> <p>  We are aware that the issue of business interruption claims is a significant concern to businesses, advocacy groups and policymakers.  As has become apparent through recent legal cases in the UK and Ireland, this is a complex issue and it is widely accepted that no insurance market in the world provides widespread business interruption coverage for a pandemic such as Covid-19.  Aviva Insurance Ireland has approximately 15,000 customers who have cover for business interruption.  The vast majority of those policies do not provide cover for business interruption arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.  The wording used by Aviva in the policies is generally unambiguously clear.  However, we have approximately 50 policies taken out by small businesses where the wording is not as clear.  So far, we have received only a few claims on those policies and we have paid them.  Despite not receiving claims from the remaining customers, we have been very proactive in writing to those policyholders to draw their attention to the cover they have in place and inform them that they may have a valid claim.  We have a small cohort of large corporate policies where a claim may arise in the future.  We are working closely with the brokers on those cases. </p> <p>  Where we have received business interruption claims due to Covid-19, we have provided each customer with a full explanation of our decision in cases where policies did not provide cover.  Only a small number of customers were unhappy with our determination and subsequently  made complaints.  Most of those complaints were resolved by our complaints handling processes.  However, a handful of customers took cases to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  All of those cases have been ruled in our favour.  In summary, the vast majority of Aviva Insurance Ireland's policies do not provide cover arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.  Where they do, or where the policy wording is not clear, covered claims are being paid and all notifications are being dealt with promptly.</p> <p>  Aviva is fully supportive of the Government's action plan for insurance reform and welcomes the implementation of the new personal injury guidelines.  We acknowledge the work done by successive Ministers of State, Eoghan Murphy, Michael D'Arcy and Deputy Fleming, the relentless work of officials at the Department of Finance and the work of Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns.  We also acknowledge that despite opposition from many of its own members and the Law Society of Ireland, the Judicial Council voted to adopt the new guidelines.  The changes will have a positive impact on the cost and availability of insurance for businesses, voluntary organisations and motorists. </p> <p>  While acknowledging the work done, there is still a long way to go before minor awards are on a par with those in many European countries.  For example, one of the largest reductions is for fully recovered minor whiplash, awards for which will move from &euro;16,000 to &euro;6,000.  However, this will still be four times higher than what applies in the UK, where minor whiplash payouts are moving from &pound;4,000 to &pound;1,500.  Many countries do not provide any compensation for minor whiplash.  We believe there is still more to do in both reducing awards and strengthening the scope and remit of the PIAB.</p> <p>  Regarding the impact on premiums of the new guidelines, Aviva has anticipated the changes and reduced premiums in advance of the implementation of the guidelines.</p><p>In an open insurance market like we have in Ireland, there is a clear correlation between premiums and claims costs.  Insurance markets will not allow excessive profits and combined ratios generally gravitate to approximately 95% over the cycle.  As claims costs reduce, insurance companies enter new segments of the market where there is an opportunity to make a reasonable return.  In the Irish market, we are already seeing better availability of insurance in underserved areas.  At Aviva, we see the changes to awards as a positive and an opportunity to grow our customer base, enter new market segments, launch new products and provide great value to our customers.</p></speech>

There are many areas and colleagues will cover other issues so I will keep my questions quite specific.  My question is for Mr. O'Midheach from FBD on something he referred to quite extensively in his opening remarks that I want to tease out, namely business continuity insurance.  I have three questions.  First, why is FBD still arguing over the costs of the test cases brought?  I believe the Central Bank has written to the company on this.  Does he intend to respond?  Second, Mr. O'Midheach said that &euro;11 million in total has been paid out.  Does he not accept that a 5% interim payment is not fair to the businesses considering that most have been closed for 16 months.  Third, FBD is reducing the awards by the amount of Government support received by publicans.  Will it return these moneys back to the State?</p></speech>

We are awaiting the details.</p> <p>  On the second question regarding the interim payments of &euro;11 million, the 5% payment was an immediate payment to publicans on receipt of any form of representation.  It was an immediate payment prior to a second interim payment, which would be on receipt of some details.  The second payment would cover any costs that are not subject to the quantum hearing that are detailed in the submission.  We will pay the second interim payments.  Those have been engaged on so the Deputy's reference to the first interim payment is essentially an immediate payment without any reference to detail.</p></speech>

There are many different factors for pubs, whether they were wet or dry, the periods it was open, what its trade is like, and how it splits between off-licence sales and on-premises sales.  We asked for an amount of information against which we can evaluate quantum based on what we know now and based on the judgements of the High Court and while awaiting the judgement from the quantum hearing that is working through some of the outstanding issues, we are making a second preliminary assessment.  We are basically turning that around in approximately three days from receipt of the information.  We have established quite a user-friendly portal to assist publicans in submitting the information to us.  Once we receive the information we make an evaluation, send the offer to the publicans and we will revisit that when the quantum hearing is finalised.  Should that be delayed, we can make a subsequent payment once we get further information.</p></speech>

Included in the business interruption contract is a reduction for any sum saved during the indemnity period in respect of charges and expenses that are saved by the business.  Our belief is that would include the Government subsidies and the principle of making an insured party whole and not double paying.  It is subject to the quantum hearing that will be held in July but for the moment, our calculations have reduced the gross sum insured by those sums received from the Government.</p></speech>

My focus will also be on business interruption.  Most businesses are only now, more than a year later, beginning to make their claims.  Without the State acting on their behalf using the taxpayers' money, many of these businesses would not have survived until today.  It has been taxpayers' money that has kept them afloat and put them in a position to make a claim.</p> <p>  I am not too sure whether a similar approach has been taken by all three companies.  It probably affects FBD and Zurich more than it does Aviva.  The methodology used is the liability to the insurance companies is the loss of gross profit less any net savings of expenditure.  Is that fair?</p></speech>

The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fleming, has made it very clear that in the event that we do not pay the subsidy to the publicans, he will engage in a mechanism by which he will seek to recover that money from the insurance companies.</p></speech>

The danger is that if someone has an insurance policy, he or she does not, effectively, qualify for State support.  I do not agree with that as a principle and we need to engage with the Minister on that.

For some larger claims with larger organisations, they may well come in.  To date, we have not gone through an individual calculation of any large organisation to determine exactly what will or will not be deducted.  As the representatives from FBD noted, a court case that will help to rule on some of those points is due.</p></speech>

My first question relates to when premiums are going to reduce.  In 2019, Mr. Brennan appeared before this committee, along with colleagues from throughout the industry.  They asked us to reduce the cost of claims and to produce legislation, which has since happened.  The judges have done their work and reduced the cost of claims for minor injuries, which are now fully recoverable up to 60%.  Mr. Brennan stated at that meeting that if insurers had not reduced their prices by somewhere in the region of 10% to 15%, the committee should ask a lot of questions.  For liability, he stated it should be higher, and probably close to 20%.  That was based on a 50% reduction in claim awards but, as Mr. Brennan will be aware, the legislation and the decision made by the Judicial Council have raised the limit to 60%.</p> <p>  What I and everybody else want to know is when Mr. Brennan and his company are going to pass on these reductions to policyholders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.160" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Brennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051900002#D00700"><p>Unfortunately, I am constrained in regard to anything to do with price signalling.  As I said in my opening statement, we have made a decision on the amount we are going to pass through to customers in the coming weeks.  We are actively working to implement that on a number of platforms.  I cannot say more than that because anything else could be seen as signalling when and to what extent we are going to reduce our premiums.</p> <p>  I recognise that it is really important that the industry responds to this reform.  It has taken us years to get here, and I have to ask the Deputy to allow us a few weeks to implement this and get it across to our customers.  We will not be found wanting.  I appeared before the committee in October 2019 and made some clear statements, which I stand over.</p></speech>

They took effect on 24 April but Mr. Brennan is well aware of them.  People are being charged by his company for renewal of motor or business insurance and are not getting the reduction, despite Zurich knowing damn well that if there is a claim in that policy over the next 12 months, the cost of paying out on that claim is now substantially reduced.  Nevertheless, the company is pocketing the benefit, despite the commitments the industry gave to us.  Mr. Brennan should not try to pretend this is something out of the blue.  Why has Zurich not reduced costs over the past three weeks since these guidelines took effect, and why is it continuing to charge motorists and businesses extortionate premiums despite the level of awards having reduced in these cases by up to 60%?</p></speech>

Is that the way that insurance is priced?</p></speech>

It is about looking forward to the following 12 months.  I accept that we anticipate, hopefully, a reduced cost of claims, which I welcome.  It is a big reform and we will not be found wanting.  We are going to implement - I have to be careful about what I say - changes to our premiums that reflect these rewards.</p></speech>

I return to what I said in October 2019.  The percentages I talked about then are still appropriate.  I have looked at the most recent national claims information database for 2019 and the same principles apply.  I have to be careful about using numbers during this meeting and I apologise for that.  I do not want to mislead the Deputy.  Certainly, the information on motor insurance suggests that the percentages I quoted in October 2019 are reasonable.</p> <p>  On liability insurance, we are not necessarily seeing the same level of savings coming through because the types of injuries that feed in to those sorts of employers and public liability are of a moderate to severe nature, and there is not the same level of reductions as in the new guidelines.  They are not 50% across the board.  For some injuries, particularly moderate to severe ones, the reductions are lower.</p></speech>

I have carried out a survey in which I asked people to tell me whether their premiums had decreased, increased or stayed the same.  We received more than 1,000 responses from people who have had renewals in the past three weeks since the guidelines came into effect.  Is Mr. Brennan surprised that 61% of them have had an increase in their renewal quotation for motor insurance?  Only 20% of them have seen a reduction, while a further 20% report that their premiums are broadly the same as in the previous year.</p></speech>

On motor insurance, for example, we have seen a 4% reduction in quarter 1 this year on quarter 1 last year, on average, across our policies.  I stress that, like FBD, we have 500,000 customers, so perhaps some of their premiums have changed for other factors.  The vast majority of Zurich customers, however, will have seen reductions in their motor insurance premiums over the past 12 months, not related to the cost-of-injury reforms.</p></speech>

When is Aviva likely to pass on the significant reductions?  It is pocketing large sums as a result of premiums it has been writing over the past three weeks, knowing damn well that the awards that will be paid out, if they are to be paid out on these contracts, will be significantly reduced.  When are motorists and businesses likely to see premium reductions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051900002#D02300"><p>In the past six months, there was quite a bit of anticipation of this and the market has reduced by approximately 8% in that time, which is the largest decrease in motor premiums I have seen in such a short time.  Quite a bit of this is already factored in.  We need to be careful on the 60% number, although I accept that in the case of minor injuries, there has been a reduction of 60% in general damages on fully recovered whiplash cases.  As for the moderate and larger cases, however, the latter will probably not change at all, while the moderate ones are dropping by approximately 20% or 30%.</p><p>Over the entirety it will not be anything like 60%.</p></speech>

Is this really what the insurance industry is trying to say now, that it expected this so it started to reduce premiums last year and this has to be counted into the equation?  Is this the tale Mr. O'Rourke is trying to tell?</p></speech>

What I am saying is that in any market there is anticipation in advance.  There is not a single day where everything changes.  There are many factors and pricing is ongoing.  I can obviously speak about the significant price decreases in the past and we have seen significant decreases in the past two years.  Our average premium is back to where it was in 2010.  There has been an awful lot of progress already.  I cannot speak about the future, obviously, but we have seen big moves by the industry at this stage.</p></speech>

The national claims database held by the Central Bank provides us with a rich amount of facts.  The facts are that over the past decade the cost of claims has reduced by 9%, the number of claims has reduced by 45% and premiums have increased by 35%.  One of the most significant things that has happened in the insurance industry in recent years took effect on 24 April.  This is that the cost of claims was reduced by a significant amount.  It was the insurance industry that was begging, screaming, crying, lobbying and looking for this.  It has been delivered.  Over the past three weeks, the industry has not significantly reduced the cost of premium renewal.</p> <p>  I will give an example from one of the surveys.  The premium last year of an individual who has an insurance policy with Aviva was &euro;400.  This person has had no claims, has the exact same cover and has not replaced the car.  We are comparing like with like.  The renewal quotation this year, which was received within the past three weeks, was &euro;730.  The person phoned up and tried to get a better deal.  The person moved company and got insured with FBD for &euro;375.  This was an 83% increase at a time when the Government, the D&aacute;il and the Judiciary have slashed the cost of claims.  What people want to know is when they are likely to see significant reductions in their premiums.  Will Aviva pass on euro for euro the savings the industry will make as a result of paying out reduced claims?</p></speech>

The Deputy needs to look at it over a period of time rather than a three-week period.  We are committed to passing on the savings.  In our view, we have passed on many of them already.</p></speech>

It is easy to say there is a 60% reduction in the minor whiplash cases but there are still a lot of factors in this.  We need to see the behaviour of solicitors, claimants and judges to see where this goes.  For example, quite a lot of judges voted against this so it will be interesting to see where this will land.  The solicitors will try to work with this as much as they can to continue to have high fees.  Claimants are already looking at multiple injuries, and there is some activity to push cases higher with multiple injuries that may previously have just involved one injury.  It is complicated.  It will take time to figure out exactly what the discounts are.  We have passed on almost all of the savings we believe are there now.</p></speech>

When are we likely to see the savings passed on to its customers?  Why have they not been passed on up until now?  Will the company commit to passing on euro for euro savings as a result of the reduction in awards to its customers?</p></speech>

We did a calculation of what the amount ought to be and we have applied that amount.  It has been applied in the case of motor insurance.  Our calculation of that amount has been applied to the rating and it is now live on the market.</p></speech>

I will give another example from the survey of an FBD customer, again comparing like with like.  The same car has not had a previous claim and last year's premium was &euro;550 and this year's premium is &euro;635.  In another case, last year's premium was &euro;1,300 and this year's renewal quote is &euro;1,450.  How are premiums increasing if the savings have been passed on?</p></speech>

Obviously, we cannot reference particular cases.  To some extent, it has to do with the timings.  Was it in recent days or recent weeks?  I am surprised, as were my colleagues, because in general I would have thought with the reductions in recent times that it would be unusual for any one individual, without some other cause, to have an increase.</p></speech>

Their companies, Zurich and Aviva, are in the top seven insurance companies in Ireland.  They are also in the top seven in the UK.  Will the witnesses explain to the committee what are the responsibilities and requirements on their companies since the British Government reduced the cost of whiplash awards?  What do they mean?  How do the companies have to show the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, that they are passing on these savings to consumers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Brennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051900002#E01500"><p>I will start.  In the UK we have a very small share of the motor market.  It is certainly well less than our motor share here.  The difference is that in the UK the change was in the form of one-for-one guidelines and they can be mapped easily enough.  What we have here is a move from the book of quantum, which is a set of guidelines, and there is not a one-for-one match.  It is going to be very difficult at an individual claim level to say exactly what would have been paid on the claim in the past.  The Deputy mentioned the national claims information database, which contains rich information and tells us the total cost of claims.  This is where we will see the real effect of this coming through.  In the same report, we will see the effect on premiums and the two can be matched.</p> <p>  What has happened in the UK is a one-for-one match, whereby we can see the award under the new guidelines and what it would have been under the old guidelines.  We do not have this here.  They are quite different and there are ranges.  Trying to match them one for one would be quite subjective.  If anything, we could play a game by stating the award would have been higher under the old awards but here is what it is.  The best way to monitor this would be through the national claims information database.  The Deputy has brought a Bill to the D&aacute;il and I suggest we engage through Insurance Ireland to see whether we could add some extra fields to the national claims information database.  It could be another way of monitoring the exact impact of these new awards.</p></speech>

In Britain, Mr. Brennan's company, along with all of the other six largest companies in Ireland, has to satisfy the FCA as to what the cost of claims would have been before the awards were slashed, what the cost of claims are after the awards were slashed, what the premiums would have been if the awards had not been slashed and what they are now.  This is the way the British Government ensured in legislation that the insurance industry passes on pound-for-pound savings.  Mr. Brennan's argument is that Britain applied it to only one issue, which is whiplash.  If it can be done for whiplash it can be done for all other injuries.  Is it not the case that the industry does not want this oversight because without it there is no way to ensure the insurance industry has passed on pound for pound and euro for euro the reduction in awards to its consumers?</p><p>This is the only way we will be able to satisfy it.  All of the companies, with the exception of FBD have to do this in Britain, yet they are resisting this oversight here.</p></speech>

As I said, the national claims information database has become the go-to on data and, rather than creating another process, I would prefer that we try to see can we work with the existing process.  We will provide all of our data to the Central Bank in a very carefully regulated and transparent way to see could we use that to provide the same level of reporting the Deputy and the Oireachtas would like to see.</p></speech>

It is part of the 2018 legislation, which has taken effect.  Let me make it clear.  Does that include that the companies would provide the expected cost of claims prior to the reduction in awards, the cost of claims now, subsequent to the awards being reduced, the premiums if the awards were not reduced and the premiums now, as a result of the awards being reduced?  Is Mr. Brennan saying his company would be open to the national claims database having that information and reporting on it?</p></speech>

I am not aware of the exact details of the case and I have not seen it worked out in practice in the UK.  We would be happy to work on it.  All I am suggesting is perhaps we would work together and engage with Insurance Ireland to find the best way to measure this.</p> <p>  I have been very clear.  We will pass on the benefits, euro for euro, and that is what we intend to do.  I believe the national claims information database already provides the information to cover that at a high level.  I am not sure moving it down to each individual claim is the way to do this and it will create an awful lot of work.  It is quite subjective because, as I said, there is not a one-for-one match between the old book of quantum and the new guidelines.  All I am suggesting is we could try to work together to find a way to minimise cost.  We do not want to create cost for everybody because that cost will ultimately feed into customer premiums, and I am sure the Deputy would agree with that.  It is about trying to find a way to work with the existing process to get the overview that is required and that the Oireachtas would like to see.</p></speech>

However, when Mr. Brennan said they are not worked out, my point is that the regulations are here, they are worked out and they are quite detailed.  What I am asking is whether the companies would be satisfied to provide the same information to the Central Bank here?  I have no faith that the insurance companies are going to pass this on, euro for euro.  That is my position, and I hope I am wrong.  What I am not going to do is allow for legislation to be passed, for the Judiciary to do its part and for the insurance companies to pocket much of the benefit from it.  I want to hear from Mr. O&rsquo;Rourke whether his company would be open to having the same level of oversight and requirement that has been legislated for in Britain in regard to providing the information I have just outlined.</p></speech>

I do know individual prices are changed all the time by customer level and at all different levels, so that would be a very difficult thing to do.  There are other ways we can do it.  We can look at the margin of the insurance companies and the particular lines.  If we look at the motor insurance business in Ireland, it has never been a particularly profitable business anyway and I do not see it becoming particularly profitable in the next year.  Most companies are looking to make a margin of five points on it.  I think it can be monitored quite easily over the next period through the national claims information database and through returns from the insurance companies as to the margin they are making on that business.</p></speech>

The objective of it is good and, certainly, protecting vulnerable customers is very important.  Aviva has led the way on this, even as far back as 2019 when we put a cap on the difference between new business and renewal business, which for a direct channel in Ireland is 25%.  That is an important one.  Nobody wants to see a situation where people are being charged large premiums, especially vulnerable people, as it is not right.  We have acted on that.  We have led the market and both regulators have seen that.</p> <p>  That is an important piece but there are other unintended consequences of this.  There is no doubt the people who shop around now get a good deal and they will not get as good a deal afterwards if dual pricing is banned because, at the moment, incentives for new customers to try to encourage customers on board are probably being compensated for by older customers.  That is the way a lot of markets work, including this market.</p> <p>  There is a lot to it.  I know the FCA is grappling with what is going to happen with back books, where there is no new business and where less than 15% of the business is new business.  I know it is grappling with margin versus price and with discounts on new business.  It is having its own tangled web with this.  We need to be careful we do not end up in a situation where, like the health industry, the products are 99% the same but the prices are different and we end up with an awful lot of products.  We would fear that certain players might be able to get involved in sharp practice because there would be quite an opportunity within a very strong regulated market like that.</p> <p>  We all want to protect vulnerable customers.  We monitor our pricing for vulnerable customers versus our overall book to make sure there are no significant differences.  I agree we need to protect vulnerable customers but we need to be careful with the market as well because some unintended consequences could happen.</p></speech>

We monitor what goes on in the UK but much more important to us is the fact the CBI &ndash; the Central Bank - is currently engaged in a very detailed review of the practice here in Ireland, and we expect it to report in the coming months.  I am sure what is happening in the UK will feed into its consideration and deliberations, and we will respond to that.  As I said, we are fully engaged with the CBI.  One of the challenges is that the FCA in the UK has said it thinks it will reduce premiums but, ultimately, if companies have a target profitability level, it will redistribute premiums.  If that is the right thing to do, then that is the right thing to do.  I think we will learn from the FCA and what measures it comes up with, and there are certain things we could look at across the industry here as well.</p></speech>

It was very interesting to hear Mr. O'Midheach talk about FBD welcoming the legal challenge and so on.  While it might have welcomed it, it fought it tooth and nail, and that is the reality.  The Central Bank made it very clear that the Government's announcement for pubs to close was to be deemed not a voluntary closure but an enforced closure.  What did FBD do?  It challenged that in the courts.</p></speech>

It said it was not a forced closure by the State.  Let me get on to the substantial point.  The test cases have happened and FBD has lost the cases.  It argued in court and it lost the cases and we have to find out the quantum.  I engaged with the Central Bank because there was huge anxiety in regard to test cases in terms of the costs and what would happen.  The Central Bank had issued a very clear statement in terms of reasonable cost being covered.  Now, FBD is arguing in regard to that.  I note Mr. O'Midheach&rsquo;s language in regard to reasonable cost.  Is it not the reality that what he believes is reasonable and what the actual legal costs are in some of these cases could be a difference of &euro;1 million?</p></speech>

We have not seen the specifics of what people are believing to be the costs pre the legal cases being heard, and if it is in the nature of &euro;1 million, whether that is spread over the four cases or one individual case.</p><p>When we see the detail, we will see what is generally perceived to be reasonable or unreasonable prior to entry into court.  </p></speech>

I note what Mr. O'Midheach said about passing on the savings arising from the enactment of the judicial guidelines, although there seems to be some evidence to the contrary.  The delays by Aviva and Zurich are simply unacceptable.  As has previously been said, this did not come out of the blue.  They knew this was coming and their foot-dragging is simply unacceptable.  When they get around to passing on the savings, will that happen automatically or will customers need to ask for them?  What will they do for those customers who have taken out premiums since 24 April?  Will there be a rebate for them given that the Judicial Council guidelines took effect on 24 April?</p></speech>

I do not see this as foot-dragging.  We have taken a long time to get to this point.  I have been in this industry for approximately five years and we have been talking about reform for that time.  We have been involved in many reports along the way.  I am delighted to see this day has come.  There are practical reasons the implementation of changes takes some time.  These will feed through automatically to our premium rates.</p> <p>  Many factors feed into insurance rates.  When we look forward, we need to estimate several factors, including, for example, the acceptance rate of PIAB and the chances of whether these cases will be accepted in court.</p> <p>  I am comfortable that we are offering a fair price.  We will adjust that price in the coming weeks to allow for some changed assumptions on what the future injury costs will be.  We need to implement this across multiple platforms.  I am sure the Senator has been involved in areas of government where people wanted to implement something quickly but it needs to be fed safely through the various systems and processes to ensure that those results can be got out to customers.  Right now, we are engaged in implementing it.  We analysed the results in April.  We made a decision on the level of change we would put through and we are implementing that as we speak.</p></speech>

The decrease in the past six months has been the largest decrease I have seen in my career in the industry.  This has been anticipated by the market.  It is happening.  It will continue to happen as we find out the behaviours of the solicitors, the judges and the claimants, and we can be more certain about exactly what the amount is.  That is what happens in any insurance market.</p></speech>

It is simply not acceptable to extend that further and for the insurance companies to say that they now need to see the outcome of decisions in the courts.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about excluding the value of State supports in the business interruption insurance payouts.  I have heard the comments made about the wait-and-see approach being adopted.  Industry representatives are awaiting engagement with the Minister.  I find that extraordinary, given that these statements have been made knowing full well that in personal injury cases, insurance companies are required to provide a statement of recoverable benefit on the benefits that the injured party would have had to claim arising from personal injury, particularly with regard to loss of earnings and social welfare payments.  Arising from that statement of recoverable benefit, the Department of Social Protection is reimbursed by the insurance company in respect of those payments that needed to be made because of the personal injury.  </p> <p>  While FBD, Zurich and Aviva know that they must abide by one set of rules for public liability and employer liability in personal injury cases, are the witnesses now saying that they will abide by a different set of rules that they make up for themselves on the payout of business interruption claims?</p></speech>

There is a set of rules by which we gather the money and pay that.  No such set-up rules exist.  There is no mechanism currently.  That does not exist.  We are quite happy to calculate the amount because it would be clearly determined as a result of the quantum whether we withhold it or not.  If we withheld it, we could clearly calculate it.  Then, we can engage on any mechanism, set of rules or principles after that.  I am not saying that we will not, but there is no set of rules.  In the example the Senator gave, there is a clear set of rules, and established precedent.</p></speech>

However, there is also the point that the current set of rules is very much set up on the basis that somebody is responsible for the accident that led to somebody else claiming or getting benefits from the Department of Social Protection.  However, in this case we are talking about very different circumstances; nobody is responsible for Covid-19.  It is a very different sort of set-up.  We need to understand that the current rules do not automatically apply.  We need to engage with the Minister to understand the grounds on which he believes we should refund these.</p> <p>  I go back to my earlier point.  It is a dangerous principle and we need to be very careful.  People are entitled to something different irrespective of whether they have an insurance policy.  That is an important principle for me and for the industry.  The current one is very much based on if someone is in an accident and it is deemed to be somebody else's fault and they are deemed to be responsible for it and if we are covering that person, we pick up those costs.  That is the legislation that is there.  It is a very different set of responsibilities for Covid-19 because no individual we are insuring is at fault or responsible for Covid-19.</p></speech>

Of course, the very nature of business interruption cover is that it sets out the various types of interruptions.  It does not necessarily attribute blame from what I understand of the cover.  His argument is very much that insurance companies should be entitled to be subsidised by the State because it was not their fault and it was somebody else's fault.  The practice of insurance companies pocketing the payments made by the State has gone on for years in personal injury cases.  Millions of euro were made by insurance companies until legislation was passed in 2013 and enacted in August 2014, which led to having the statement of recoverable benefit and the need to reimburse the Department of Social Protection.</p> <p>  I am not convinced by Mr. Brennan's argument that his insurance company deserves a subsidy because it is not the company's fault or the client's fault, but somebody else's fault.  It is an act of God so to speak.  </p></speech>

I was simply pointing out that the current legislation is very much based on a very specific point of law around personal injuries arising from accidents.  I was not trying to say that the insurance company is entitled to this.  I was simply pointing out that this is why it does not automatically apply.  The current legislation does not automatically make this happen.</p></speech>

Obviously, we will urge the Minister of State to engage in those meetings.</p> <p>  My final question relates to the types of insurance products that are available in this country.  Aviva Insurance Ireland's submission outlined the better availability of cover in underserved areas and the anticipation that this will play out arising from the Judicial Council guidelines and the changes that are taking place within insurance.  FBD Insurance and Zurich Insurance have also noted their commitment to the Irish market.</p> <p>  I want to ask the witnesses about insurance cover in the area of leisure and activity businesses.  Do they consider there is a gap in the market now with regard to adventure centres, adventure projects, voluntary projects or groups and leisure centres?  Is there is a gap in the market with regard to coverage for those sectors?  Are the three companies before the committee seeking to provide coverage to these sectors in the near to medium-term?</p></speech>

We have done that.  We have underwritten quite a number of voluntary organisations in the past number of months and we have also added some leisure business.  It is a small amount; we are just being careful.  It is an area in which pretty much all the insurers in Ireland have been badly burned in the past.  We need to gradually look at that, therefore, but we are certainly doing more than we would have done a year ago in a number of those areas.</p></speech>

They have to go to England and further afield.</p></speech>

The Senator spoke about children.  Children will still have to go to court for assessment.  That might be something that would help with childcare in adventure centres, children's play centres and those kinds of areas.  Things could be done there as well.  A review of PIAB is going on now, which is also a really important piece of the jigsaw.</p></speech>

We feel that to make a move into those sorts of areas, we need to see more progress on the duty of care.  One of the big challenges for both voluntary organisations and the leisure sector is the level of duty of care here in Ireland.  As things stand right now, we do not have any immediate plans to expand into those particular areas.  As the Senator said, they have been serviced over the years, mainly with more specialised companies from outside Ireland, mainly the UK.  I believe that will continue to be the case for the immediate future.</p></speech>

Given our situation as an Irish stand-alone insurer, FBD Insurance is very cautious about entering into new sectors, particularly where we do not have expertise.  As the situation changes over time with the claims experience in some of those areas, we would seek to expand.  It would usually be into areas that are adjacent to the business we underwrite at the moment, however.</p> <p>  We provide insurance for some voluntary organisations.  We ensure men's sheds, usually related to the locations of our local offices, and we also insure the Tidy Towns.  One of the major game changers around this will be the review of the Occupier's Liability Act 1995 and whether anything can be done on duty of care to balance the interests between small business owners, their patrons and their employees.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; pl&eacute; an-suimi&uacute;il againn go dt&iacute; seo agus t&aacute; an ch&eacute;ad cheist at&aacute; agam i gcomhair FBD Insurance.</p> <p>  My first question is for FBD Insurance.  Does Mr. O'Midheach accept that the benefit of taxpayers' money, paid to small businesses and their employees by Government subsidies, ought to go to the small businesses for which they were intended rather than to large insurers such as FBD Insurance?</p></speech>

They have, therefore, been in receipt of those payments.  We have deducted those payments from the gross sum to make the insured party whole.  By the same token, I do not believe it is anybody's intention that they ought to benefit by those in addition to being made whole for the gross sum.</p></speech>

That is the reasoning behind providing these Government subsidies.  I am of the view that it is wholly and grossly unfair to do this to these businesses, which are already suffering.</p></speech>

There is, therefore, no benefit from insurance.</p> <p>  The debate then about making the Government whole is a distinct issue, which we have covered in previous discussions about mechanisms and rules.  The insured party would be made whole, however.</p></speech>

I have another question in this regard.  How many claims has FBD Insurance receive from publicans to date beyond those it has not deemed to be covered by business interruption, and how many has it settled?</p></speech>

We have at this stage communicated with all the public house claimants.  We had quite a process to ensure we could communicate with all of them.  Regarding claims where we have received information from publicans, the figure concerned is 220, or about one fifth of what we have overall.  We have received information from those people.  Slightly fewer than 85 have accepted, and then we have a similar number where the offer is currently with the people concerned.  The remaining claims are then at the stage of being assessed.</p></speech>

If Mr. McMahon does not get a chance to get those figures before the end of the meeting, he could furnish them to the committee afterwards.  It will be important for the committee to see them.  Turning to the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019, how is the insurance industry preparing to implement that legislation in full?  What impact is it anticipated that will have for those affected?  It is a pity in many ways that the Government dragged its heels in this regard.  I refer in particular to the ambiguity in respect of the potential for this initiative to have been of benefit to those impacted by the pandemic.</p></speech>

Much detailed work has been undertaken in that regard in the past six or seven months.  We are ready to implement the Act on 1 September.  The main impact for customers is that they will be able to see their claims and premiums information for the previous five years.  The advent of this legislation is going to change the nature of insurance.</p> <p>  One of the unexpected consequences may be more pieces of paper in a renewal package - perhaps another four or five documents on average.  Customers will see more questions being asked, because the insurer's responsibility to ask specific questions has been increased, and that will happen.  Insurers will, therefore, ask more questions as part of the renewal process and in respect of new business concerning policies.  However, I reiterate that we are ready and we will be going live on 1 September in respect of the final stages of the Act.</p></speech>

We are also working hard to implement the provisions of the legislation, and have been for the past 18 months, so we should be ready by September as well.</p></speech>

Insurance companies, of course, have a legal obligation to report fraud so it can be investigated.  It is not incumbent on them to carry out the investigation, but they do have that legal obligation to report such instances.  From the figures I see here, in 2019 there were 63 reports of fraud, while in 2020 there were only 48 such reports.  Given all the bluster and everything we heard in media reports over the years regarding how significant an impact fraud was having, do the witnesses agree that the number of reports is quite small?  Can they explain why that would be the case?</p></speech>

The process identified 345 claims that warranted further investigation by our specialist team dealing with potential fraud.  Of those 345 claims, there were 68 cases where we suspected some element of fraud.  I underline the fact that it was only a suspicion of potential fraud.  On further investigation of those claims, there were 13 claims where we felt there was sufficient evidence of fraud to be of material assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and those cases were referred on.  Again, I cannot speak for the industry as a whole, but 13 claims out of 68 would, from my understanding, be above our market share, but that is all I say in respect of Zurich.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to have this exchange of views.  I used to be my party's spokesman in this area once upon a time a long time ago.  I must not have had too much of an effect, because we are still dealing with the same problems.  Does Insurance Ireland regulate the level of risk that may be undertaken by the various insurance companies?  I refer to the cover given, for instance, for business interruption or whatever it might be.  What is the story in that regard?  Could someone enlighten me?</p></speech>

He was appealing to judges to bring injury awards down to European levels.  We have finally got there, or we are on the way.  We still have a bit to go, but there has been progress in those years.  To answer the Deputy's question, Insurance Ireland does not do that.  It is an open market and Insurance Ireland has nothing to do with the cover provided by individual insurers.</p></speech>

I posed a question to the Minister some years ago because I was given information to the effect that several lenders had taken insurance cover against some risks.  In fact, it was alleged at the time that those lenders were going to get paid by two different bodies.  One of those groups was the public, and the other was the insurance companies.  What is the story behind that?</p></speech>

Typical examples include directors' and officers' insurance, which would cover the boards of those companies, professional negligence insurance, which would cover financial institutions for cases of negligence, mis-selling, etc., and crime cover for possible instances of theft, in addition to normal insurance policies.  There are quite a few possibilities.  It would depend on what the action was, but typically in financial institutions we see many negligence actions.  We also see quite a bit of crime.</p></speech>

A reply to a parliamentary question stated that some are covered in the high-risk category, but the Minister was not sure how many or what percentage were covered.  That set off alarm bells because insurers would not have to cover too many.  All they needed was to cover two or three big risks, or maybe one really big risk, to result in a serious chasm in the entire insurance sector.  To what extent were payouts undertaken in respect of high-risk financial transactions or speculative transactions?  Are insurance companies still covering those?</p></speech>

My immediate suspicions were aroused as to what extent cover might be offered to people who are trading in a fashion not in accordance with the rules, and who may have been compensated and drew down the cover.  I certainly would like to feel that Insurance Ireland was looking at these kinds of situations.  For example, would there be an assessment by the insurance company as to the potential for reckless trading?  What would be done in that situation?  Would the insurance company say "Okay, you are looking for cover for &euro;10 million or &euro;20 million, this is what the premium will be and we will cover you"?</p></speech>

In the event that the action was not determined to be an illegal act but it was a high-risk act - otherwise they would not be looking for cover in the particular situation - can Mr. O'Rourke give us any indication as to how those issues are greeted nowadays?  Does the insurer come out to the front door to meet the person seeking the cover, or does the insurer hide in the office and pretend that the person does not exist, hoping that he or she will go away?  Does the insurer just pay out when the time comes?</p></speech>

Is it taken as granted?  Do the companies ordinarily proceed with the cover or do they refer to anybody to examine it?  Do insurers say to themselves, "I do not think this is a very good risk and we should not have it"?  I pursued this issue ten years ago.  I came to the conclusion that there could have been a serious amount of cover offered for various high-risk financial transactions, which were unsafe or highly speculative.  I believe since that claims might have been paid.  In response to an earlier question Mr. O'Rourke said they would have been small amounts and it would be very small in the context of the Irish industry, and so on and so forth.  Like bookies with a bet they do not want to handle, they could have lay off the risk to a European insurer.  I am not trying to trivialise it.  I became familiar with all of these routes at the time, and I have one more.  Will Mr. O'Rourke clarify the degree to which the insurance companies evaluate the liability they take on in some of these circumstances, and especially with medium- to high-risk financial transactions?</p></speech>

Stockbrokers, banks and funds, for example, will be insured around the world and they have global insurers with expertise in the area.  They will know, for instance, whether an investment fund is high risk, are moms and pops investing, is it specialist investors who can take care of themselves, if investors need to be protected, what are the chances of a claim, and what types of things do they invest in.  Those specialist underwriters will figure out a rate.</p></speech>

It is a question I asked insurance companies some years ago.  Many small business people and private citizens have a number of vehicles for which they require insurance cover.  Some families may have up to 20 vehicles depending on the size of the family.  I inquired as to whether fleet insurance was available.  Immediately, the insurance companies threw up their hands and said, "Not at all, not under any circumstances, and how could you even consider a thing like that?"  I am not so sure I was given the right reply, but maybe Mr. O'Rourke could elucidate further on it.</p></speech>

A number of insurers offer multiple car discounts.  We offer a loyalty discount.  If the customer covers both their house and car we give discounts on both and free travel.  If they are classic cars there are schemes that take care of that and the premium is much lower because the cars are driven very little.  There is an array of options.  The local broker will probably be able to answer the question better than the insurers.  We would know bits and pieces of each one and what we offer ourselves but the brokers tend to know all of the products out there.</p></speech>

Most brokers would not add a profit margin to a quote.  They get the quote from us and then they add certain fees they charge their customers for doing certain things.  It is an actual fee and they would disclose it to the customer.  They would not normally add a profit margin to the premiums we send to them.</p></speech>

The information he has given the committee is that we can see insurance premiums coming down.  He said there is evidence of that.  The evidence I see in my office is that insurance premiums are going up.  I am not saying the majority are going up but the ones I see are.  I have an example to hand where the individual is insuring a car and nothing has changed except that he and the car are a year older.  His insurance last year was &euro;470 and this year it is &euro;608.17.  Given that there was very little driving going on over the past year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, other than in local areas, and given that there is a 50% no-claims record on this particular premium, why has it increased?  I know Mr. O'Rourke will say he cannot comment on individual cases but all the other cases are the same.  Nothing has happened to justify any kind of an increase in those cases.  If anything has happened, it is that the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, has said that insurance premiums will come down.  That is not what we are experiencing in our offices.  In spite of everything the witnesses said this afternoon, I hold to the position that insurance premiums have gone up for a considerable number of people.</p></speech>

In six quarters, the NCID showed that premiums dropped by 9%.  The CSO figures up to the end of 2019 and from 2020 onwards are showing a further 7% drop.  That is a 16% decrease overall.  There will always be some-----</p></speech>

I have referred to one such case. The individual in question is a loyal Aviva customer but he is expected to pay &euro;138.17 more than he paid last year.  I would say this is the same for everyone.  This person has been reading the newspapers and watching media coverage showing the indicators that insurance premiums are going down.  Like Mr. O'Rourke said, the overall percentages are going down.  Why then would customers like the man to whom I referred be facing an increase in premium?</p></speech>

This man, a customer of Aviva for years and with a no-claims bonus in place, has been told his premium is going up by &euro;138.  Mr. O'Rourke can cite statistics and analysis and the whole lot but there are too many people like this man coming into my office and telling me they cannot get insurance or, as in his case, that their premium has gone up.  Nothing Mr. O'Rourke has said today explains the increase in this individual's premium, which is similar to what is happening in other cases.</p></speech>

I just do not understand this argument we have had here for years abut insurance premiums.  Regarding the decision of the Judicial Council, Mr. O'Rourke said that quite a number of the judges voted against the proposals and his concern now is that they might ignore the proposals and continue in their old ways.  That is what I am taking from what he said.  He also referred to solicitors and how they might be into activities that would retain their high levels of fees.  That is a throwback to when we first started this discussion.  The solicitors blame the insurance companies, the insurance companies blame the solicitors, everyone blames the judges and the customer gets screwed.  It seems we are back in that territory again.</p></speech>

The PIAB is an independent State body set up to assess injuries.  For all of us, it is the best place for injuries to be assessed.  However, out of 30,000 cases that go into the PIAB, only 6,000 get assessed there.  I am not saying these things will happen but it is really important that we keep an eye on them.  That figure of 6,000 needs to increase and it is in everyone's interest that it does.  Right now, there is no incentive if a case comes out of the PIAB and the legal costs go from &euro;800 to &euro;16,000.  There is no barrier to stop that happening.

I have done likewise and I set that against all of the things that are improving in insurance, what is happening in the courts and so on.  Nothing the three CEOs have said gives any comfort to me or, indeed, to those customers to whom I will write back after this meeting.  I will encourage them to write directly to the three insurers represented today and see what comes out of it.  I suggest to Deputy Doherty that he do the same.  I am fed up listening to the same old story all of the time.  It is like Groundhog Day and we do not move on in any substantial way.</p> <p>  I want to ask about chartered engineers and fire safety consultants.

The complaint I have received is that most design team members are required to carry a minimum cover of &euro;6.5 million.  I presume that is public liability cover for the various developments they are involved in.  They currently can only get &euro;1 million to &euro;2 million coverage and as they exceed &euro;2 million, there is a 400% or 500% increase.  They are being asked to sign off on housing estates and developments that have been completed.  Without them having the cover, many councils and voluntary housing agencies will simply not get the sign-off that is required by law.  It is interesting that when they are dealing with insurance companies regarding fire cover, there is a clause in one of the policies, which states: "We will not make any payment for any claim, or part of a claim or loss, arising directly or indirectly due to the combustibility or potential combustibility of fire protection performance of any type of panelling, cladding, facade or other material used in the surface, roof or interior of any building including, but not limited, to any associated core filter signage and insulation".  Is that a clause that any of the companies are familiar with?</p></speech>

This has become a very specialised area.  Any company that has been involved in the area will need to provide cover outside Ireland to protect themselves.  The Chairman spoke of the large sums insured that are involved.  It sounds very like international global reinsurance type-wording.  Again, what happened with the Grenfell Tower is the reinsurers are saying they do not want to provide cover for these after all that has happened.  They have seen the risk and they do not want to provide cover, particularly to cladding.  As I said, I am not an expert in the area but that does sound like international reinsurer type-wording to me.</p></speech>

How reinsurance tends to work is that companies will take the risk up to a certain amount and will reinsure anything above that with these large global reinsurers.  They would be quite insistent, I imagine, in an area like that that their wording would be passed on.</p></speech>

One tries to get diversity.  One would try to avoid putting money on deposit at the moment because of negative interest rates but there are times when it is necessary to have access to it if, for example, there are a couple of large claims coming up.  One needs to know the cash is available in the company's bank account.  Generally one tries to invest in something that hopefully has a positive yield with a longer term.</p></speech>

Both are members of the expert advisory group on ventilation and Covid-19, and will present on the role of ventilation in achieving better health outcomes in tackling the Covid-19 virus.  I welcome Ms Orla Hegarty, associate professor at the school of architecture, planning and environmental policy at UCD, and Mr. Simon Jones, commercial director, Aereco Limited.</p> <p>  Before we hear their opening statements, I must point out to our witnesses that there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege applies to evidence given from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if witnesses are directed by me to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  I ask Ms Hegarty to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

I am an architect and academic at the UCD school of architecture, planning and environmental policy.  My expertise is the science of prevention because although the virus is biological, the pandemic, which spreads from one person to another, is highly environmental.  Buildings are key to suppressing the pandemic.  Prevention is about managing people and managing air.  Vaccines alone cannot end this.  They need the support of a parallel prevention plan.</p> <p>  Looking at buildings in Ireland, we see the following.  More than half of the people who died were infected in just 0.03% of buildings.  Over half of the cases in workplace outbreaks have been in just 150 buildings.  Infection in overcrowded private homes is twice the rate of uncrowded homes.  One in four school buildings has had a Covid-19 index case in the past four months.</p> <p>  The problem is infected air.  We now understand that risk of transmission is predominantly indoors and very specific to certain buildings and indoor air conditions.  These conditions are preventable, and this knowledge is key to stopping infections and to opening buildings at low risk.  Most transmission is not from hands touching surfaces, it is from inhaling infected air.  Masks are the only protection at close range.  Outdoors, the virus is diluted and blown away.  However, in buildings and vehicles, it can build up, fill a space, linger for hours and infect many people.  Viral particles in the air behave a little like smoke and must be cleared out.</p> <p>  Many countries are achieving low-risk social and economic activity using prevention policies that manage people and their air.  These strategies include the following: providing public health information; reducing occupancy, that is, the number of people; limiting certain activities; setting indoor air standards; measuring unsafe, stale air; improving ventilation and filtration; and, sometimes, doing structural or engineering works to buildings.</p> <p>  Indoor air can be measured and managed.  This week, international researchers said &ldquo;preventing respiratory infection, like reducing waterborne or food-borne disease, is a tractable problem&rdquo;.  Indoor spread is measurable and controllable.  They warn that. &ldquo;For decades, the focus of architects and building engineers was on thermal comfort ... initial investment cost, energy use, and ... performance ... [and] infection control was neglected.&rdquo;  This was not always the case.  Ireland regulated overcrowding in bedrooms to prevent TB.  Before the modern era of energy efficiency and airtightness, architecture and public health were very closely aligned and that is why ventilation is regulated.  However, the balance has shifted away from disease prevention as the current regulations aim only to &ldquo;provide adequate ventilation while limiting energy use and avoiding occupant discomfort&rdquo;.  One hundred years ago, Chicago suppressed the 1918 pandemic with targeted measures, including building inspectors who signed off on ventilation as a condition of trading.  The city of Chicago reopened within six weeks.  There was no second wave and no vaccine.</p> <p>  With regard to the focus on what is high risk, international evidence points very clearly to which buildings and activities are high risk and where to target resources.  There is a significant body of research from theoretical and experimental sciences and building case studies.  Super-spread events, where many people are infected at once, indicate the particular environmental conditions of spread.  This means that targeted suppression can be very effective, as seen in Japan and other places.</p> <p>  There is a need to target the clusters.  Covid-19 has very particular characteristics.  Most people do not spread the virus to anyone else.  It is said to be &ldquo;highly over-dispersed&rdquo;, meaning spread is not a factor of average contacts.  Suppressing the pandemic, therefore, is less about rules for people and more about rules for places.  This is an opportunity to target interventions because most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, so the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare super-spread events.  These super-spread conditions can arise in any enclosed space with two people or many.  Indoor risk is about the building, its management and operation, the number of people and the activity.  There are strong seasonal factors because indoor air quality changes with the weather, the season and the operation of the building.  Infection risk indoors can be reduced by 50% with increased airflow, and by almost 90% with airflow, filtration and wearing masks.  Although data in Ireland are limited, the patterns of Covid spread are very similar to other countries, so public health measures can be targeted to have the most impact.</p> <p>  I will now look at the high-risk areas.  With regard to vehicles, high levels of ventilation and filtration are critically important in cars, vans, buses and aircraft.  An outbreak on an aircraft into Dublin last summer resulted in 13 cases on the aeroplane and 59 cases in total, across six HSE regions.</p> <p>  With regard to housing, infection rates are double in overcrowded private homes, according to the CSO data.  A significant number of infections happen within households, and rates are higher in households with children.  Inadequate space in institutional and shared housing is high risk, such as in dormitories, hostels and emergency homeless accommodation.  Direct provision centres have had 82 outbreaks with an average of ten cases each.  Traveller and Roma housing have had 423 outbreaks with an average of 12 cases.</p> <p>  With regard to schools and childcare, more than one in four schools has had a Covid index case since February and, in total, there have been almost 2,500 cases linked to 579 outbreaks in schools.  Last week alone, there were 61 outbreaks in schools, which was 20% of all outbreaks.  Of 633 cases linked to outbreaks last week, more than one third, or 36%, were in schools and childcare facilities.  There have been almost 2,000 close contact cases in childcare and after-school facilities since last July and 342 outbreaks in approximately 900 childcare buildings, that is, more than one third of childcare facilities have had an outbreak.</p><p>In hospitals, nursing homes and residential care, 55% of the people who died from Covid-19 in Ireland, were infected in fewer than 0.03% of all buildings.  A mere 667 buildings accounted for the infections that led to more than half of the deaths.  There have been 600 outbreaks in 581 nursing homes, but it is very uneven.  In Kildare, 87% of all nursing home deaths were in just a quarter of the buildings and that needs further investigation.  Inadequate ventilation is linked to poor respiratory health in older people.</p><p> More than half of all infections in workplace outbreaks were in meat and food plants.  There were nearly 3,500 cases in outbreaks with an average of more than 40 cases per building in those.  There have been 96 outbreaks in construction.  One meat plant alone had an outbreak with 226 cases.  One construction site outbreak had 148 cases.</p><p> I will deal with indoor dining, bars, gyms, places of assembly.  Some places have significantly higher risks, particularly where people are indoors in close proximity for long periods of time and without masks, such as in restaurants, pubs, theatres, cinemas, hotels, and entertainment and sports venues.  An outbreak in a caf&eacute; in Cork resulted in 57 cases.  At an extreme level, one breach in hotel quarantine in Australia directly resulted in 18,000 infections, 800 deaths and a 112-day lockdown.  Breaches in buildings can have a very significant impact.</p><p> Certain activities have higher risks, including exercise in gyms and for sports, singing in choirs and at religious events, and shouting, because they generate aerosols and involve deep breathing.  A recent outbreak in a gym in Canada resulted in 480 cases and it spread to 49 workplaces.</p><p> This knowledge provides an opportunity for more sure-footed policies.  Eliminating unsafe conditions protects everyone, including children, people with compromised immunity and those not vaccinated.  It also mitigates the risk of variants, and of super-spread events.  Vaccines alone cannot provide enough headroom for reopening.  A prevention plan is needed.</p><p> Safe indoor air has many measurable benefits for health and well-being.  It mitigates all respiratory illness, including flu, and future-proofs for another pandemic.  Aside from all these benefits, good indoor air quality is a legal requirement of workplace health and safety.</p><p> This understanding of transmission and prevention has significant implications, and indicates a need for fundamental review of some incorrect assumptions in public health policy; public health information; reopening plans; sectoral rules; tracking and tracing procedures; epidemiological modelling; and building standards, inspection and enforcement.  To ensure that policy is consistent and scientifically up to date, an active multidisciplinary approach is needed.  It needs collaboration and engagement across disciplines including biomedical, epidemiological, environmental, sociological and other sciences.</p><p> Further analysis of these patterns of spread and investigation of buildings is needed.  There must be a risk-based approach to target interventions and effectively use limited resources.  If this virus were in water or food, the response would be to take samples, investigate the source and eliminate the problem.  So it must be with infected air.</p><p> This is a third way that steers a scientific course between lockdown and uncontrolled spread.  However, it requires a paradigm shift so that public health policy is evidence based and responsive to new knowledge.  There needs to be a shift in perception that we cannot afford the cost of control, because the economic costs of infections can be enormous and may well exceed costs of containment.</p></speech>

Over the past 150 years the link between science, the development of interventions, and organisation of public authorities has increased the success and public understanding of public health.  It is time for ventilation and its impact on air quality to be seen through a similar lens.</p> <p>  We spend up to 90% of our time indoors and this pandemic is a disease of buildings.  Regardless of where we see the balance between fomite, close or long-range transmission, the impact on health of our indoor environment has been thrust into focus.</p> <p>  Ventilation is a critical factor in reducing the risk of long-range airborne transmission, particularly in enclosed spaces.  Often simple strategies that ensure adequate ventilation can help to reduce the spread of Covid-19 in many settings, including homes, schools, workplaces, public buildings and vehicles.  Moreover, these strategies can also reduce the risk of superspreading events where many people become infected at the same time.  It is an important part of a layered strategy to reduce transmission and should, of course, be used in conjunction with other measures.</p> <p>  As the science and our understanding of this disease has developed, ventilation is increasingly recognised as a critical factor in this multi-layered approach.  While it is an important component of any building, ventilation sits within a rapidly changing landscape.  The climate emergency is driving changes in regulations and fundamentally how our buildings are being asked to perform.  We are about to undertake a wholesale upgrade of our existing building stock that will have dramatic impacts on the performance of every building we occupy.  Our lifestyles and how we spend our time indoors continue to change.  Technology is rapidly evolving, giving us more insight into how our buildings perform and how we manage them.  The science related to indoor air quality continues to evolve and its impact on our health and well-being deepen.</p> <p>  Ventilation in buildings and how it impacts our health, in this case Covid-19, is not a field of absolutes.  We must not let perfection be the enemy of the good.  We already know many of our buildings do not perform as intended.  We all have experience of them.  Poor indoor air quality already costs us every day.</p> <p>  According to the EPA, 300 cases of lung cancer per year in Ireland can be linked to radon in our homes and workplaces.  According to the Asthma Society of Ireland, 380,000 people currently live with asthma in Ireland, a disease we know is significantly exacerbated by poor indoor environments, such as damp and dusty homes.  Every four minutes someone is admitted to hospital with asthma.  This disease alone costs the State &euro;472 million per year.</p> <p>  Ventilation impacts in a very real way our health and well-being, the learning outcomes of our children in school, lost days at work, lost rent and income to landlords and the State through disrepair and vacant properties as result of condensation and damp, and in other ways.  The pandemic has brought into stark perspective the impacts ventilation can have in disease control.</p> <p>  It is time for a significant shift in how we, as a society and State, view the air we breathe and start to value it the same way we value the water we drink and the food we consume.  The role of ventilation in fighting this pandemic and the additional benefits it brings must be brought further forward in our strategies and communication.</p> <p>  We need to mobilise professionals and provide signposts and advice for every building owner to access consistent and technically correct information on ventilation - information that is already available.  This would enable them to work with and get the best out of what they have and develop strategies to improve their buildings over time, not just for Covid-19 now and into next winter but for all the other benefits it brings.</p> <p>  We need better enforcement of regulations on ventilation in our new buildings and the development of better standards and guidance for our existing ones.</p> <p>  Ventilation in buildings needs to be at the centre of not just this pandemic but in everything we do in buildings.  It is a subject matter that has an impact on all Departments, including the Departments of Education, Health, and Environment, Climate and Communications.  The dividends of getting this right will repay our effort many times over.</p></speech>

I agree that we expect water to be treated and the principle of treating our air makes common sense.</p><p>I have travelled by train to Dublin all of the time during this pandemic and part of the requirement of Irish Rail is that the windows are left open.  That is done for a clear reason.  The principle of how air is treated is very important.  I understand that in the building we are in now, unfortunately because of the pandemic we cannot use the committee rooms where our engagement with the witnesses would normally happen.  My understanding is that at least one company approached Leinster House last August seeking to carry out a ventilation exercise in the committee rooms and the Chambers.  As an institution, we want to see people getting back to work but we should be leading by example.  It is regrettable that the Houses of the Oireachtas did not engage more with this principle and use the Oireachtas as an example of how people can return to work safely.</p><p> I am interested in hearing our witnesses' views on the industry standards and the quality and perhaps Ms Hegarty might respond .  There is obviously a difference between ventilation and filtration.  High efficiency particulate air filter, HEPA, filtration is seen as the Rolls-Royce model of equipment that would do what we all want to see in terms of clean air.  Where are we as a country in embracing this?  Are we very much behind the curve?  Is there a European model?  I believe that Germany is particularly ahead when it comes to this, that there are air ventilation systems in the Bundestag and that most schools and public buildings in Germany have very clean and properly ventilated air.  Is there a better example than the German one in Europe?  Ms Hegarty might talk to us about that.  Can she also reflect on how far behind we are as a country in this area of protecting public health?</p></speech>

The most important thing we need to get across today is that much of this can be dealt with by way of clear public health information and good guidance.  We live in a temperate climate.  We are not the United States of America, where there is a great deal of air conditioning.  Most of our buildings are naturally ventilated so that people can improve things dramatically by just understanding the risks here in buildings and vehicles.  Most of our buildings are small ones with openable windows.  In particular, in the seasons when we are not heating or not having to heat a great deal, this can be addressed very easily at little or no cost.</p> <p>  In the winter season, we definitely need to start monitoring air because people are closing up buildings and there is a high risk of infection.  In our larger buildings, we have mechanical or other systems and people need technical advice.  We are talking in particular here about places like shops that are using wall and ceiling-mounted air conditioning units.  These are very dangerous because they are not bringing in fresh air but are recirculating cool dry air and they have been connected with outbreaks where they are blowing air around the room.  Again, this is an area where advice could help.</p> <p>  Larger buildings that have mechanical ventilation systems are often switched to recirculate the air to save energy.  If that is the case they need to be checked and may need upgrades on filtration or on equipment.  There are separate risks there.  </p> <p>The Senator mentioned HEPA filtration.  This involves very low technology portable filtration fans that people can buy, sometimes for &euro;100 or a little bit more for a classroom, that would be very suitable for places like nursing homes and childcare settings where perhaps people cannot wear masks or where there is a concern about vulnerable children or older people being in draughts or uncomfortable conditions.  These are plug-in portable fans that can be very effective.  Even from where we are now, there are very simple strategies that can be used in many places, with advice.</p> <p>  We also need to be very careful where people are selling systems at present, which may not be effective, are not regulated and which could possibly produce harmful by-products that are dangerous to health.  There is an unregulated area at present in which systems are being advertised, sold and installed without being proven to be effective or giving a benefit and which may be very expensive.  This is a technical area which needs to be resolved.</p> <p>  On the question of Germany, it has been dealing with this and has put forward an investment of several hundred million euro in order to improve schools and public buildings.  Monitoring air can be a first step.  This can be done very cheaply and carbon dioxide monitors are small and portable at a price of between &euro;100 and &euro;200.  They can be fitted to classrooms, office buildings and shops very easily.  They are light and can be moved around.  Spain is using these quite extensively in schools, as are other countries. </p> <p>  There are many low technology solutions and advice that can be taken at very little cost.  There will obviously be larger buildings that need specific targeted interventions where they have been identified as risk areas.</p></speech>

Does she believe that the Government is taking this issue seriously?  Ms Hegarty stated that this is very much an unregulated area.  The first thing we need to do, therefore, is to introduce regulations to make the testing and monitoring of air part of what we do, in the same way that we test and monitor water.</p> <p>  On the systems that are being used, clearly it is worrying if there are some that are not up to scratch.  Many people have engaged with and purchased equipment motivated by the right reasons.  Clearly then, a job of work has to be done to bring in some sort of regulation and approved recognition for systems, standards and so on.  Does Ms Hegarty believe that this work is now being taken seriously and is being done?  As a committee, should we be making recommendations to the Government in this area?  What is her advice be to us on that?</p></speech>

I do not feel that the response has been adequate or that the public health message has been clear.  The vast majority of people to whom I speak do not know why it is important and if they have heard the word ventilation, they do not understand why it is significant.  Many of the policy and sectoral documents advocate improving ventilation if appropriate or if possible.  They do not explain that it is absolutely critically key as a first defence.  There are also a number of other flaws across this issue.</p> <p>  One is that sectoral guidance is left to the sectors to write.  Whether it is sports, construction, childcare, nursing homes, shops, hairdressers or dentists, the sectors are writing their own guidance and a scientific review is not being done on whether that is consistent, correct or up to date.  A significant number of documents out there are scientifically incorrect and out of date.  People are doing their best and what they think is appropriate but are doing the wrong things.  This needs a more co-ordinated approach and needs to align with epidemiological modelling, which is to understand the changes in how we model the spread of disease because this is not a disease of averages.  Very targeted interventions could be much more effective than blanket restrictions.</p></speech>

That would make a considerable difference.  Obviously the focus of NPHET is on hospital buildings and on mitigating risk there.  Hospitals are only 86 of our 2.5 million buildings.  The focus in hospitals is different to the focus on what is happening in the community.  It is also important to note that hospital buildings generally, particularly the newer buildings, are built to a very high standard of ventilation.</p><p>Even within that, we do not have rules within the hospital sector that will protect staff in terms of higher quality personal protective equipment, PPE, for those staff still working behind Perspex screens in some places without masks.  Again, that is not a protection.  A suite of measures are needed, especially within sectors.  There needs to be consistency and the measures should be based on scientific principles rather than what is convenient in a given sector.</p></speech>

Initially, when the expert group started to meet, the minutes and reports of the meetings were published online.  There are minutes of the meetings of 2 February, 5 February and 8 February.  Then it stops and no minutes or reports are published on the website.  Why is that the case?  I assume the group has met several times since then.</p></speech>

The reporting of the group moved from the National Public Health Emergency Team to the senior officials group in Government.  The group is no longer reporting to NPHET.  That would have changed in March, although I do not have the exact date in front of me - it may have been in April.  I understand the reports produced by NPHET will be published but I do not think they are on the website at the moment.</p></speech>

I hear what Ms Hegarty said about the group originally reporting to NPHET but now reporting to the senior officials group that was set up to manage Covid-19.  If the minutes of the meetings are not being published, we cannot see what is being discussed or what recommendations are being made.  Is this something the group has raised?  Were the members of the group aware that the minutes of the meetings stopped being published on 8 February?</p></speech>

We understand the HSE website is slow to publish minutes generally.  It takes some time to get them up.  As such, the reports have not been published yet.  Our understanding is that the plan is to do so.</p> <p>  On a certain date we stopped reporting to NPHET and moved across to the senior officials group.  At that point, public reporting of reports and minutes ceased.  That does not mean those reports and minutes are not kept on record within the group.  They would be available to be published somewhere if that was the decision.</p></speech>

My point is broader.  I am not saying it directly to this group because it is not the responsibility of the group to ensure the reports and minutes are published.  I accept that minutes are taken and records are kept.  However, it is important that they are made public so that we can learn from them as well.

I will repeat the point.  I have no difficulty with the witnesses.  I am saying that in terms of process, public education and access to information it would be better if the minutes of the meetings were published so that we could see them.  For the purposes of preparing for this session, I was able to see the minutes for 2 February, 5 February and 8 February.  Then it stopped.  Is that something the group could take up with the HSE?  Can they ensure that the information on whatever meetings that have taken place since then is made publicly available?  Both witnesses have made a strong contention that there is a lack of awareness and education in respect of ventilation.  If an expert group is in place, I imagine it would be beneficial to the expert group and the witnesses that what has been discussed is made publicly available.</p></speech>

I know we are putting a focus on this because of Covid-19.  The witnesses expressed the view that air management and air quality was a greater issue than Covid.  Obviously, in a pandemic it becomes a major issue to better manage air quality and prevent the spread of this virus.  However, it has wider implications for the health of people and in other areas.  In terms of the overall management of air quality where do we rank in Europe?  Are there data?  Have studies been done on how we rank?  Is it correct to assume the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has overall responsibility for the management of air quality?  Has each Department responsibility in law to publish air management or air quality plans?  Is there an obligation on each Department to manage this in their buildings and so on?  Is that a requirement of each Department at this point?</p></speech>

It is difficult to measure buildings.  We have buildings in use that are 200 or 300 years old.  We have buildings that have been adapted over time.  We have new buildings and some that have energy upgrades.  People have used them in different ways.  Sometimes they are used in a more crowded way than they were designed for or for a different purpose.  It is difficult to make comparisons.</p> <p>  We do not have ventilation regulated centrally in any way in Europe.  Each country regulates its standards.  Obviously, there is the factor of the local climate and other conditions.</p> <p>  Some other countries are doing far better in the pandemic response, especially Asian countries that have adopted this approach right from the beginning.  Countries like Vietnam, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan and China have responded with a clear message on ventilation as prevention.  They did this from the beginning of the pandemic.  Western countries, especially English-speaking western countries, have been especially slow and, I would say, resistant to adopting this as part of the pandemic response.  We can see the outcomes in comparing cases and deaths across the two different regions.</p> <p>  Who is responsible?  Responsibility is scattered.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has standards for new buildings.  As we know, we have self-certification of new buildings, so certifying compliance is in the control of the developer or owner and not necessarily picked up anywhere independently.  Having standards and performance are two different things.  We can have an issue with the people who operate the building not knowing how it should be considered and so they may block up vents or overpopulate rooms.  The remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage stops at construction.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has some responsibility in respect of air quality standards.  The Health and Safety Authority has a role under workplace health and safety.  Then again, not every building is a workplace.  There is inconsistency and there has not been a focus on this.  Building regulation standards only tend to change in response to an event.  If there is a structural collapse, a fire or some other emergency, we tend to react and have new regulations.  We have not had an issue with air quality since the tuberculosis era.</p> <p>  We have drifted into a medical response to issues, whereby we medicate and treat the illness rather than prevent it.  We have probably had 50 years of this, building from the oil crisis.  We have not had the experience of SARS or other pandemics that some other countries have had in more recent years.  Now is the time to react to this event and take it seriously.</p></speech>

This issue has major implications.  I am interested in the application of ventilation.  I visited a lot of schools in my constituency prior to Christmas and the way in which the age of the building influenced how the school managed ventilation was really interesting.  With the ultra-modern, state-of-the-art buildings, big and bright and with a huge amount of natural light, which is really healthy, and quite open indoor plaza spaces, I got a sense that they were very well ventilated from a design and engineering point of view.  In the schools that were 30 or 40 years old the ventilation consisted of wide open entrance doors, windows open in every classroom, cold classrooms and children and teachers wearing warmer clothes.  That is simply unsustainable.  As we move forward now, particularly into retail and hospitality spaces, the role of ventilation is critical, whether or not it is with a view to dealing with a further pandemic at some stage down the road.  We know indoors is a no-no, but what have we learned about the obvious hospitality activities of eating and drinking and how we can apply those lessons to those areas?  What kind of advice are the witnesses now in a position to give?  What are we learning?  What is the halfway house or even the quarter-way house between fully open-air, which is almost but not completely impossible in the Irish context, and indoors, which is impossible in the context of a pandemic?  What kinds of lessons have we learned?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.411" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#E00400"><p>As for schools, the age of the school building obviously has an impact.  A lot of older schools built before perhaps the 1970s were designed with the memory of TB still alive.  They have good cross-ventilation, higher ceilings and more space.  A lot of that has been squeezed down and engineered out, I think, and some of those older buildings may have had retrofits involving sealed windows and partitions and other things, which have made them more dangerous.  What the schools did between August and Christmas was very commendable in that they were really the only ones to take this seriously in the autumn.  However, in the absence of any way of measuring safe air quality, the schools probably over-ventilated in a lot of cases, that is, they opened all the windows and the classrooms were very cold and uncomfortable because school management did not know when to stop.  If we provide CO2 monitoring in schools, we can find a happy balance because we can assess in real time whether risk conditions are rising.  Then we can open the windows for 15 minutes or take the class outside for 15 minutes, prevent risk and keep people comfortable.  That is the only option for next winter because children will not be vaccinated, so the schools need a plan for autumn and it needs to start immediately to be in place by winter.  The nursing homes probably fit in that category as well.</p> <p>  As for retail and hospitality, all buildings can be made safe.  Once we start measuring, we can target the risks.  Clearly, many buildings are low-risk because, otherwise, the pandemic would be even worse.  The issue, therefore, is how we find the conditions that are dangerous and deal with them.  This is not perceptible to humans.  I was in a large building yesterday with a CO2 monitor.  It felt reasonably comfortable at all times, yet when I looked at my CO2 monitor the reading went from safe to unsafe within five minutes in a different part of the building.  That would not have been perceptible to anybody not carrying a monitor to check air conditions.  As humans, we cannot guess at this, no more than we can guess at safe water.  We need to start monitoring.  People do not stay very long in retail environments and they wear masks, so the key issue in retail is to keep the numbers low, keep the air moving and protect the staff, particularly those who are there for longer periods and perhaps using back areas, storerooms and break rooms where they take off masks.  They can be the danger areas.</p> <p>  Hospitality is probably the most challenging sector, but that is not to say it cannot be dealt with.  It is the most challenging because people sit close together across a table, breathe the same air, tend to stay a long time and do not wear masks and a lot of buildings have been adapted and changed over the years and tables can be very close together.  Every building needs to be looked at differently and individually within a framework of good advice on the spacing of tables, particularly filtration and localised filtration to tables, which may be a good option for restaurants.  That is the HEPA filtration we spoke about earlier.  It basically comprises just a fan and a filter which cleans virus particles and other particles from the air continuously while people are in the room.  Then it is a matter of taking particular care of staff, back areas, toilets and cold rooms.  The means by which people travel to hospitality environments can be as high-risk as the actual building they enter.</p></speech>

How would Ms Hegarty see it being put on a structured, formal basis in terms of feeding into any future plans in the autumn and the winter?  That is the first matter.</p> <p>  My second point is about public transport: trams, the DART, trains and buses.  They are back up to 50% capacity now.  What kinds of data does Ms Hegarty have on that?</p> <p>  An obvious area which was connected with antigen testing recently is stadiums.  Are there any data on the air quality in the stands of a GAA, rugby or soccer ground?  Has the expert advisory group come up with any advices in that regard?</p></speech>

It is just to feed into what she says.  I see all the windows open.  I just feel that that stems from perhaps not a particularly scientific approach.  How can we assist public transport companies towards best practice in this regard?  They cannot be faulted because we are learning all the time, but how could they be assisted with this?  What technology could we put at their disposal?  In other words, how could we make public transport reasonably reassuring for the public in greater numbers - or can we at all - in terms of air quality?</p></speech>

The first is to improve airflow such that if vehicles have systems installed they are on full fresh air and not recirculating air that could have virus in it and in order that there is a good throughput of air all the time, that occupancy is managed such that there is no overcrowding and that people wear good masks, not lightweight ones.  The general position in places such as Taiwan and now Austria is that everybody wears a higher standard of mask and does not have a haphazard view of masks.  There are two things-----</p></speech>

For protection from aerosol particles, that is, the very fine, lighter particles, which is what we are talking about, N95 or higher protection masks are recommended.  Some countries have moved to those, and the examples of that are in Asia, specifically Taiwan.  The masks are being provided by the Taiwanese Government.</p></speech>

The blue paper-like masks are surgical masks.  The two issues with masks are filtration, that is, the material used, and fit.  Surgical masks are often not a very good fit in that there are gaps around the edges which make them ineffective against aerosol particles.  As I was saying, the Taiwanese Government mass-procured all their masks, people there are provided with a certain number of masks at very low cost every two weeks and everybody wears a very good mask.  Some parts of Europe have required such masks on public transport or in retail or other establishments.</p></speech>

In Japan, there is sort of silence rule on public transport because infected people put less of the virus into the air if they are not speaking or shouting.  We should give people the simple advice that not speaking or speaking in a very low voice can reduce risks.</p></speech>

The advice I am giving is based on the information I have gathered from speaking to other people, including aerosol physicists and people who work in occupational health.  That is the point I am making about it being a multidisciplinary issue.  It is very important that all of these people are around the table for our risk assessment to balance everything.  In the early stages last year, there were concerns about supplies and procurement.  There were concerns about people buying up supplies which would not then be available to people in the hospitals.  Those things have changed over the course of the year.  Similarly, in making these kinds of decisions, there must be a balance between risk and availability.  This may involve equipment, masks and the settings in which people are.  We must also consider whether cheaper and easier mitigations are available.</p></speech>

There were two questions as people reached for an understanding of how we implement this.  The reality is this is very complex to do.  We have to get down to basics.  Good public information and awareness about the benefits of ventilation will go a very long way in getting people to be aware of their surroundings.  I look on the screen in front of me and see that every single person is in a different environment right now.  We can learn a lot from the world of retrofitting.  We need bespoke solutions for each individual room and building.  That is the hard reality.  There is no easy road with regard to ventilation in existing buildings.  One needs professionals, people who are capable of assessing risk and people who understand health and safety at work.  People need to go into spaces, look at them and understand how to get the best out of those buildings.  It goes back to the idea of perfection being the enemy of the good.  We can look for the perfect solution for every building but the reality is that we have to start somewhere.  The best place to start is with awareness.  We have to get people to understand and be cognisant of the air they breathe.  We can start to develop advice and tools over time to enable people to get the best out of what they have and, eventually, develop strategies to improve those buildings over time.  That is the point I wanted to make.</p></speech>

The case they have made makes absolute sense.  Sometimes straightforward, common-sense things are overlooked and a more complicated approach to things is taken.  It is incredible that, after 15 months of a pandemic, Mr. Jones still has to tell us that we need to get down to basics.  One has to ask why we have not been dealing with those basics up to now.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Jones.  With regard to the expert advisory group on which both of our guests serve, given the level of expertise within that group, has it produced-----</p></speech>

The first outlined the details of the actions of the expert group.  The second looked in more detail at the best advice available at the moment.  A point which has been made here a couple of times is that good advice is already available right across the sector.  We have seen such advice from American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, ASHRAE, from the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, CIBSE, and from the Federation of European Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Associations, REHVA.  Many international organisations are already producing very good advice.  From a solutions perspective, the expert group is not reinventing the wheel.  A lot of that information is already available.  That is being reported.</p></speech>

One rarely hears ventilation being mentioned.  I am curious as to why that is the case.  Has the group made recommendations in the reports it has produced?  To whom did those reports go?</p></speech>

It is an invisible thing, a natural thing we do every second of the day without thinking about it.  Even getting people to be cognisant of the air we breathe is very difficult indeed.  This pandemic has certainly brought that into focus but issues of indoor air quality and poor health are slow burners.  They are not as dramatic as the pandemic so we do not see it.  I apologise; what was the second part of the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

Most of them are in line with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, documents and other advice that was out there.  The advice in the first two reports went to NPHET.  It sat with NPHET.  Since then, we have reported to the civil servant group.  We have moved away from reports and towards letters to the civil servant group.  These letters are more specific to given sectors.</p></speech>

It seems crazy to have an expert group looking at this area, making recommendations and advising the Government when no one is hearing about it.  That just does not make any sense at all.  It is something the committee should take up.</p> <p>  I am very short on time.  May I ask Ms Hegarty what are the short-term immediate solutions for household ventilation?  She said that one can deal with 50% of the problem by improving airflow.  With regard to improving air filtration, what kind of costs are we talking about in this regard in either a domestic setting, a school setting or a small business?  I am thinking of the hairdressers and retail outlets opening up this week or last week.  What are they doing about that?  Have they had any direction or guidance from any State agency as regards what they should do about ventilation?</p></speech>

This does mention ventilation.  I have been reading quite a lot of sectoral guidance since May of last year when the construction industry produced its first set of advice.  These documents come across as official guidance and people in the sector are taking them as official because they have yellow covers and an official <i>imprimatur</i>.  They are often highly inconsistent and unscientific however.  Other than the work safety protocol, I do not know of any clear advice for anybody opening a shop or small business.  I believe many people mean well but are not doing the right things.  In some cases, they may be making the situation worse.  It is really important that a clear message goes out.<br/><br/>With regard to households, again I suspect that a lot of infection was happening in cars, as well as in homes.  When people are told not to meet or that two households can meet together, the risk does not relate to whether two or three households are involved but to the air conditions in the room.</p><p>It is the equivalent of inviting a smoker into one's home.  How would someone deal with that situation?  How would it be worse if there were ten people in the room and two of them were smoking?  People must understand the logic of that.  It can be very dangerous in a car with two people.</p></speech>

There has been a strong belief in some quarters that this is not how it transmits but the science now tells us otherwise.  Second, there has been no joined-up thinking between the expert groups in that they operate independently and do not collaborate so people in different disciplines use different terminology and possibly have mistaken beliefs sometimes.  I have come across people who assume that improving ventilation means that we put engineering and equipment into every building and that this is not feasible.  That is not what this is about.</p> <p>  The word "ventilation" has been seen as another add-on beyond distancing, masks and hand washing instead of being seen as core to everything.  Thinking of it as ventilation, it has not translated into "this is about how we use buildings."  It is much more than ventilation.  It is about how people move around in buildings, how many people are in the building, how long they stay for, whether they are wearing masks and whether they are more vulnerable.  A targeted approach that picks out the really high-risk areas would be much more effective than a lockdown.  It would involve an incremental approach involving prevention, particularly schools, childcare, nursing homes and indoor dining and hospitality, over the next few months while the weather is good.</p></speech>

We are talking about quite a broad spectrum of typologies.  Things like hepa filtration and single-room occupancy have been issues in hospital settings for at least a decade.  Businesses and schools are a different consideration than homes.  I know there has been some research in Ireland on the very poor ventilation quality in our homes.  While this may not necessarily speak to Covid transmission, it certainly speaks to the level of asthma we have.</p> <p>  Regarding how we arrive at our building standards, the original Building Control Act provided for a Building Regulations Advisory Board where experts would have joined together to advise the Department about what is appropriate.  That seems to have been disbanded.  Do the witnesses think a mechanism like that would have been useful in the past year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.447" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#G00500"><p>The Building Regulations Advisory Board is there in statute.  It was disbanded in about 2012 and has not been in operation since.  This is a major failing because individual buildings are being reviewed in isolation when they are all connected.  In the case of the new build-to-rent apartment standards, I do not believe there was due consideration of the impact of taking out cross ventilation, lowering ceiling heights so there was less volume, making spaces smaller and removing lobbies to corridors so that there was more of a risk, as we have seen in buildings with long corridors such as the quarantine hotels in Australia, of pressure build up in rooms with long corridors where there are heavy fire doors and one gets airflow conditions that cannot be predicted.  This has caused cross contamination in quarantine hotels in Australia.  Daylight standards have been reduced, balconies have been taken out, which means it is difficult to purge ventilate a room, and more people are sharing lifts than is probably appropriate for public health.  An independent building regulation advisory board that works openly and transparently with a lot of high-level expertise would be very helpful because often a change is made in one area without recognition of the impact and these things are all connected through architecture, be they climate change, the pandemic, cost saving or daylight.  The lack of an open board or possibly a mechanism for those kinds of discussions has been detrimental.  It would be good to see that resumed.</p> <p>  To answer the question about ventilation, we have had improving energy performance requirements over the past ten or 15 years driven by the energy performance and buildings directive from Europe but the ventilation standards have been very slow to catch up in parallel with that.  Ironically, some of our newer buildings that are more airtight may be higher risk for Covid than some of our older buildings.</p></speech>

Ireland is leading the way here.  In our latest revision of building regulations under Part F, we need an independent validator or inspector of ventilation systems in all new homes.  That is to be applauded.  We are the first country in Europe to go that far in saying that all new buildings need to be inspected by somebody independent.  This is definitely to be welcomed.  Unfortunately, this falls down a bit because the t's and i's have not been crossed and dotted and there is no central database where that information is held and can be audited.  As of today, we do not know how many homes have been inspected and we certainly do not know how many of them have passed or failed.  The devil is in the detail with that kind of stuff that really adds power to those regulations.  In some ways, our ventilation regulations are pretty good and are certainly in line with many other countries.  What is key is inspection, policing and making sure the supply chain is delivering.</p></speech>

We have talked about ventilation systems.  I know a lot of the discussion is about simply opening windows and making people aware.  We will be dealing with more and more mechanical items, particularly in newer buildings where there is an airtightness requirement.  As far as I am aware, there has never been a conviction for proprietary building materials that are incorrect or badly certified.  Is that a concern?  I think Ms Hegarty mentioned that there are products on the market that are not fully compliant or do what they say on the tin.</p></speech>

What I have spoken about here is hepa filtration - a very basic fan and filter that people can run very safely just drawing the air through it while they are in a room, be it a cr&egrave;che or bedroom.  This is advisable everywhere and could be a good solution for many buildings and businesses.  Other systems are available.  There are very specialist systems to do with UV light, which may have some specialist installations and are sometimes used in hospitals and other specialist locations, that may have applications in other buildings here but require specialist independent advice and installation.  There are other systems on sale in Ireland that use light, ionisation and other systems that have not been regulated for this purpose and may not be effective.  Some systems produce by-products like ozone, which is damaging to the lungs.  People are selling systems that do this.  They are also selling systems that operate when the room is empty, which is of limited use.</p><p>If you are going to bring people into a restaurant for the evening, for example, using these systems before people arrive is of very limited benefit.  Airing the place well before people arrive and having filtration around the room would be very effective and safe.  Using some kind of other system may be an expensive option and may not be effective.  It is important that advice coming from the Government be very clear so that people who are struggling in their businesses and well intended are given good advice.</p></speech>

How long does Ms Hegarty think we will be wearing masks in settings, particularly public transport and workplaces?  The guidelines for the lockdown will be eased in time but could we still be wearing masks on public transport in a couple of years' time?</p></speech>

We need to be very cautious opening, in risk assessment terms, with a small percentage of the population vaccinated.</p> <p>  Masks are by far the best protection we have.  The highest risk is close to somebody who is infected.  Another strange characteristic of this disease is that most of the people who get infected are infected by somebody who does not know that they are ill.  You are infected by somebody who is either pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic.  He or she is not showing symptoms.  That is why it has been so difficult to tackle this disease around the world.  Other illnesses may have something that demonstrates symptoms and people stay at home, but not with this one.</p> <p>  Masks are by far our best defence because they do two things.  They stop somebody who may be infected putting virus into the air and they protect the other person who is breathing.  They are also cheap, low-tech, manageable and visible.  Unlike some other places where they are removing mask restrictions, we should be very careful about rowing back on that because people have been very compliant here with wearing masks.  Wearing masks might be more of an issue in specialist settings.  Clearly, people in Asia wearing masks on public transport as a matter of course has been very effective.</p> <p>  Somebody asked about entertainment and hospitality.  A trial was run at a concert in Germany last summer where people were put in very good quality masks and very good ventilation was put in the building.  They found they were both effective mitigation measures for a large crowd gathering for a concert.  Some of this may come down to what mitigation measures people are willing to accept to have more social contact.  There is a balance here rather than going back to the way things were.  It is about adapting to things that will work so that we can have social and economic activity, in the main, by targeting specific areas and accepting mitigation measures that are effective but yet allow us to do most of what we want to do.</p></speech>

There are certain shopping centres - I am not going to name the company - that do not have any windows whatsoever.  How well-ventilated and safe are these places, particularly if people congregate there?</p></speech>

I did some spot checks in supermarkets using a CO2 monitor and, with a little bit of effort, most of them would be relatively safe.  Some of the concerns about people being infected in supermarkets is because the people are not going anywhere else, but that does not mean that they were not in another unsafe setting, maybe on transport or in their own home, that they did not realise was unsafe.</p> <p>  In terms of workers in supermarkets, I would have a concern that in some places people are still working behind Perspex, which is not safe, and that they are sharing break rooms and toilets where they are not aware of the dangers of spread caused by just going on a break with another staff member or going to changing rooms.  We notice very clearly a classroom or a supermarket and less so the back areas of locker rooms, staffrooms, toilets, lifts and corridors where the risk might actually be because there are pockets of dead air, somebody has passed through earlier and somebody comes through later and moves into the same space.  We need a more joined-up approach more broadly than just the supermarket.</p></speech>

The relative safety or not of those environments should be quite easily determinable because they have big mechanical ventilation systems where you can set how much fresh air those buildings get.  If they are not capable of delivering that, then that is an engineering problem but it should be a determinable risk.  I would be confident if they were inspected and those involved worked with the available advice that is out there, those buildings should be able to be made relatively safe.</p></speech>

As we know, half of the deaths that took place in the South of Ireland were in nursing homes.  How much of a factor was the lack of ventilation in residential nursing settings?  How can we remedy the situation in the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.458" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#H00800"><p>We do not have records on the air quality in any of these buildings at any given time.  All we can do is look at the patterns of spread, the speed of spread and the fact some buildings are much more highly impacted than others.  They are all clues that this virus is airborne and has lingered in the air.  I have also looked pretty closely at some of the other nursing home outbreaks in the Netherlands and especially in Canada and the same patterns are there of very rapid spread.</p> <p>  The conditions in nursing homes are quite particular and this is the reason we have had the problem.  They tend to be underventilated because people are looking to keep warm. The operators are largely private and they look to save money on energy.  Nursing homes are often in converted or subdivided buildings that maybe, when they were changed, ventilation was not considered properly or vents were blocked up.  The people who are there are more vulnerable.</p> <p>  The climate makes a considerable impact.  I did not get into it today but the spread of the initial phase of the pandemic was in very particular climate conditions across North America, Europe, Iran, Wuhan and Japan where the air temperature was between 5&deg; and 11&deg; Celsius outside with low absolute humidity.  There was a very strong pattern to that.  In those particular climate conditions, which would be typical of Ireland in heating season, if you bring that air indoors and heat it to 20&deg; for comfort, it is incredibly dry, and dry low humidity air is connected also with a higher risk of Covid in indoor air conditions.  So you have a perfect storm of overheated buildings, underventilated very dry air, people who are most susceptible and certain buildings.  Unlike in homes where people have showers and there is cooking, which puts moisture in the air, that does not happen in nursing homes.  There is a low occupancy and those activities are not happening close to patients, so you probably had people whose noses and throats dried out, and mucus is a person's first protection against this.  For a whole series of reasons it is quite explainable what happened in nursing homes.  More and more evidence shows, to my mind and certainly from speaking to people working in lots of different disciplines ranging from medicine to physics and chemistry, there is an alignment that plausibly explains why the areas were at risk and, more importantly, how we can prevent it happening again.</p></speech>

My sinuses are particularly irritated by dust and particles of all descriptions.  It is of the utmost importance to address the needs identified.  It is necessary to avail of technology in every way possible, particularly in the context of hospital wards, nursing homes, public transport, taxis and cars.  To what extent have the delegates managed to monitor the quality of available technology, whether it involves a backpack-type installation that can be carried around and placed in a room when required or is part of the building?  To what extent do these appliances do what they are supposed to do?  In other words, do they trap all particulate matter, some or 90%?  How effective is the technology?  Does it prevent the spread of viruses such as Covid?  To what extent has it been possible to test this, if such tests have been carried out?</p></speech>

The first phase involves removing the pollutant in the first instance, which requires the replacement of stale air with air that is typically from outdoors.  If that outdoor air is not safe enough, filtered outdoor air is used.  That is the first defence.  The second is when polluted air cannot be removed wholesale from a space.  In that case, recirculation through filtering of the space is the next solution.  This is where we start to talk about HEPA filters, be they portable or part of the building.  Where air is recirculated, the pollutants are passed through effective filters to deal with them.  The next phase is to deactivate the substance one is seeking to prevent from entering.  This is where we start to talk about technology such as UV lights, which can kill viruses.</p> <p>  All these technologies, in the right circumstances and appropriately used, have been able to show complete effectiveness at removing pollutants from spaces but they have to be appropriately specified.  One has to understand what one is trying to achieve with them in the given space.  A good example is HEPA filter recirculation through portable devices.  Those devices can typically remove close to 100% of viruses in a single air pass.  While they are very effective, their ability to be effective in a space depends on how much air they are capable of moving in a given period.  Therefore, they have to be appropriately sized and located in the right spots, and so it goes.  The simple answer to the Deputy's question is that these technologies are capable of dealing with almost every issue we face, be it Covid or another pollutant, in these spaces; the challenge is using them appropriately.</p></speech>

To what extent has evidence been produced?  Has it been made available to the witnesses?</p> <p>  I am aware that there is an efficacy rate of almost 100%.  To the extent that technology is of the quality required to remove 100% of viruses, it is possible not to have draughts, including for schools, without having draughts.  We all had air conditioning in the form of draughts in our houses 40 or 50 years ago but that has changed over time.  I will outline an experience I had in Europe some years ago.  When I went back to my hotel, I never looked at the air conditioning and went to bed, woke up in the middle of the night gasping for breath, presuming I was suffering from various terminal illnesses that were going to change my life, and almost panicked.  I had to look around in the dark for the switches to turn them on.  I could not believe the difference when the tension went.  It had never happened to me before.  I went back to sleep and everything was rosy and perfect.  As a result of my experience, I realise that there is a need for some kind of standard.  This could apply to aircraft also.  I see no reason in the world why it could not apply with 100% effectiveness.</p> <p>  Depending on the size of the equipment and the size of the building or dwelling in which it is used, it can work with 100% effectiveness and clean the air of viruses, which is the vital issue at this stage.  What essential examination of the devices has taken place?  What evaluation of the cost has taken place?  Could Mr Jones point us in an appropriate direction in addition to having the committee taking it upon itself to talk to the Government and set up a structure that deals with this kind of thing as a matter of urgency?  Incidentally, I am totally supportive of the initiative.  It is a great idea.</p></speech>

Even if a device is capable of removing 99.9% of viruses in a single air pass, its ability to be effective in a space depends on whether it is appropriately sized.  A recent study showed that four or five HEPA filters are needed in a single classroom of a particular size to deliver effective control.  The first port of call should always be fresh air, or fresh outside air.  Another point to remember is that if air is being recirculated, one may be removing particulates and viruses but one is not dealing with other pollutants.  While dealing with one problem, another can build up, such as humidity, VOCs, chemicals in the air, and other pollutants or gases.  That is why I say there is a hierarchy.  We try to deal with ventilation with a view to removing pollutants in the first place, replacing them with fresh outside air.  If that is not enough, we start to look to other technologies.  The challenge is determining when fresh outside air is not enough and there is a need to supplement it.  If organisations such as schools are to invest in HEPA filters, how do they know they are at a point at which they need to do so?  The devices are not cheap for a school.  If a school has 20 or 30 classrooms and two or three HEPA filters are needed per classroom, a big investment will be required.  How does the school know it is in a position to need those types of products?</p></speech>

I thank Ms Hegarty and Mr. Jones for attending our meeting this morning.  I have read their statements with interest.  We have had an interesting discussion, yet part of me believes it is one we should have had months ago.  We very much feel we are facing the final furlong of the Covid crisis.  Maybe the witnesses share this view.  Covid will still be here after the crisis but we feel we are in the final stage of getting people vaccinated and restoring normality to the country.  The discussion we are having today would probably have been very much worthwhile last autumn or early last winter when people were more inclined to be indoors and we were facing the peak Covid period.</p> <p>  I have several points for the witnesses.</p><p>Their statements have convinced me.  Ventilation is something I was interested in anyway.  Is some of what they are saying at odds with a policy direction that the Government has pursued in recent years, namely, retrofitting homes and building energy rating, BER, certification?  There is a rush among anyone who wants to sell a house at the moment to get to a C, a B or, better again, an A grade and there are incentives to those building homes to put in mitigating measures such as insulation etc.  One now sees very few homes with chimneys, which traditionally were the source of ventilation in Ireland before the more modern systems, as they created updrafts.  In my house, if the fire is lighting the sitting room door will slam in because of the updraft it creates.  That is not a feature in many Irish homes being built nowadays and it certainly is not a feature in apartments.  I will put that question to Mr. Jones, as it is the kind of technology he deals with.</p></speech>

Had I been asked that question maybe even five years ago I would have said that yes, many of the practices and policies were at odds with what we are discussing today but I really do not think that is the case now.  Ventilation and indoor environmental quality is very much aligned with the goals of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the plan for retrofitting our buildings.  It is a core tenet of it.  Certainly under the deep retrofit programmes carried out, there is quite extensive auditing of ventilation systems.  It was one of the first organisations to take up this independent validating of ventilation systems as part of that programme.  While it may not be perfect, it is certainly moving in the right direction and there is no reason for it to be at odds.  One of the key selling points for improving our building stock is the improvement to the indoor environment.  That is one of the core tenets of the SEAI's approach to selling retrofitting.</p></speech>

I have two questions for Ms Hegarty.  One is on HEPA filtration in aircraft.  There is a debate under way at the moment and we are at the cusp of international air travel resuming.  From everything I have read, HEPA filtration in aircraft claims to be 99.7% effective, yet there is a caveat that it depends on whether the air you are breathing in has actually gone through the filtration system.  If it is from the passenger in front or behind, it is a different story.  Does Ms Hegarty believe international air travel, with its extensive network of HEPA filtration, is safe?</p> <p>  Many pubs in Ireland have massive air filtration systems in their ceilings.  They were probably brought in before the smoking ban.  Many have become obsolete yet they are massive pieces of infrastructure bolted onto the ceilings of pubs which have not been used in many years because of the smoking ban and most places do not using them any more.  Do those systems have a function?  Might they be upgraded or repurposed when pubs reopen so that it will be safe when people are congregating and drinking indoors?  I ask because it will not always be possible for everyone to always be outside, going by what Irish weather is like.  </p></speech>

They will not be vaccinated for the autumn.  When people speak about a return to normality, one quarter of the population will not have protection and will be vulnerable for the rest of this year.  In my view, whatever money needs to be spent on schools is money well spent because it will keep the rest of society open, as well as keeping education and the economy open.  It is critically important that there be a plan for schools over the summer in order that they can operate comfortably and safely for next winter.  The discussion about population protection with vaccination rates at 80% refers to 80% of adults.  That is, at best, 60% of the population.  Regardless of the vaccination programme over the next number of months, a prevention plan in ventilation is critically needed.  Vaccination on its own will not allow things to reopen; it is mathematically not possible.  </p> <p>  On BER certificates, I completely concur with Mr. Jones on the regulations in place now.  However there is a very weak link in terms of compliance and enforcement because the sector is still left to regulate itself.  This is too important to be left to the sector.</p></speech>

Some pubs may have great systems, and let us find out where they are so we can open them.</p> <p>  On aircraft, there has been a lot of different information.  It depends on the age of the plane, the number of people in it and how good the system is.  It seems that some of the risk is when it is parked at the gate, when it is taxiing and when people are getting on through air bridges.  It appears that unsafe air conditions can arise there rather than in mid-flight.  We need more information.  In principle, were people to be wearing good quality masks on aeroplanes and were there independently verified ventilation and filtration, it would be possible to engineer a relatively safe solution if the industry was minded to do that.    </p></speech>

They were fascinating and it something I was not aware of.  I appreciate their highlighting the importance of eliminating infected air with good ventilation.</p> <p>  At this stage of the pandemic, when everyone is exhausted after lockdown and after a long, tough winter, many people seem to have lost hope.  The reopening of society and reconnection with community is incredibly important now but based on what we have heard today, it seems that we as a health committee need to start planning around the implementation of ventilation systems that will operate as we come out of the summer into the winter once again.  This information is extremely important and I totally agree about schools.  It is critical at this point.  We need to focus long and hard on how we will protect young people and children.  In her opening statement, Ms Hegarty rightly stated "Vaccines alone cannot provide enough headroom for reopening", and I fully agree with her in this regard.  </p> <p>  I have a couple of questions and I ask the witnesses to forgive me if I am repeating some of them as I lost the line earlier and could not hear some of the meeting.  To follow up on Deputy Durkan's question on the cost for schools, do the witnesses have any idea about that?  I think it needs to be made a top priority.  What would the witnesses like us, as a committee, to do to support them in the work they are doing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.474" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#K00800"><p>On cost, as a very first measure, for less than &euro;1 million every school could have one CO2 meter that could be moved around.  There are about 4,000 schools so it would be well within that cost.  That would also raise awareness as a first step and identify dead areas and hot spots.  If every classroom needed a monitor, which is probably where we need to move, it would be considerably more because there are probably tens of thousands of classrooms.  There is a balance of identifying risk and areas that need to be watched.  Even with a change of wind direction, conditions in a classroom can go from low to high risk pretty easily, so it needs active monitoring.</p><p>As for filtration, some classrooms are well designed for cross-ventilation and may be relatively low risk, but others may have smaller spaces for special needs education, childcare or early years education where people might not be wearing masks and filtration would be a better option.  The exercise would need to be done on how that money was spent.  Germany is spending a lot of money on this area, as are American schools.</p><p> We do not have as big a challenge as many other places because we have a mild climate and we naturally ventilate our buildings.  In America most of the schools are mechanically ventilated.  We have an easier problem to fix or maybe we have buildings that are more responsive to be able to deal with high-risk situations quickly.  Measuring is part of it.  I do not have an assessment of the cost for every school.  Basic information could probably go a very long way.  </p><p> Regarding supporting the work, I will speak personally because I cannot speak for the group.  It would be very beneficial if there was a forum for multidisciplinary engagement.  As things stand, the people dealing with behavioural science, the people dealing with the medical side, the people calculating the epidemiological projections and the people dealing with ventilation all work in isolation.  There is no sharing of knowledge or information that would help people to refine what they are doing to use the resources more strategically.  </p><p> The key point in all of this is that we do not need to prevent every case to stop a pandemic.  We do not need to deal with every building.  We just need to do enough to get the R-nought below 1.  Very strategic activity in places where people gather in large numbers, on public transport and in particular high-risk settings such as meat plants, could have a very substantial impact overall.  It is not a case of spending money on every building or changing everybody's home.  It is about advising people how to live more safely so that they can make strategic decisions that are safer.  It is the cumulative effort of that, along with targeted measures somewhere else.  It is just a proactive approach, using what we have and using it wisely.</p></speech>

Almost no resources, whether that is time or money, are allocated to improving ventilation and creating awareness of the impacts of ventilation on health.  This does not just apply to the pandemic.  It applies beyond the pandemic to health in general, as I pointed out in my opening statement.  Money spent improving awareness and outcomes through ventilation for this pandemic has other benefits too.  Getting this right will pay us dividends well beyond the pandemic.</p></speech>

We have many older buildings which are providing vital services.  I am on the board of a hospital that was initially built in 1741.  While it has undergone considerable adaptation, it is still an old building.  Likewise, many of our public facilities are old buildings.  If the witnesses were doing a national plan on this issue, what areas would they prioritise to get the changes that are required for filtration and air ventilation?</p> <p>  Unfortunately, many people contracted Covid in the past year in nursing homes and community hospitals.  What major changes need to be made in those facilities?  Should we set a timeline for each of those facilities to reach the required standard?  What level of investment is required to get that done?  Nursing homes are normally kept very warm and there is not a sense that fresh air is circulating in the place.  Is that an area we should now be prioritising?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.479" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#L00500"><p>I will answer the questions in reverse order.  Nursing homes, community hospitals, long-term care facilities and that kind of institutional housing, including direct provision and other similar locations, really need to be considered in the same way as schools should be for the autumn.  This is a new disease and vaccination is also new.  The duration of immunity is unknown, particularly in older populations and among people who might have a low response to vaccination.  I would definitely have a concern about nursing homes, care homes and community hospitals.  There could be a further problem in the autumn.  In the same way that schools need to be preparing now, those buildings should be considered as representing an upcoming risk in the autumn.</p> <p>  As Mr. Jones has said, there are international standards that we can plug into if they are adopted.  In particular, we cannot assume that an engineer or an architect will be available to every business and building owner.  People need to be able to pick up and read simple advice to allow them to make careful decisions, whether that is turning off a unit in a hairdressing salon or opening a back door in a shop, restaurant or wherever.  Beyond the technical advice, it is very important that practical guidance is given to people about some of this.  </p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about older buildings.  There are only 86 hospital buildings.  It is well within the resources available to look at each of those buildings and carry out an assessment of where the risk areas are.  The entire building may not have a problem; there may be pockets of risk.  In the short term, simple implementation measures could be made even within days in some cases.</p></speech>

Does major work now need to be done to those nursing homes, even though many of them are less than 20 years old?</p></speech>

However, the regulations we have are very generalised for natural ventilation.  Even design performance may not reflect the actual performance.  How they perform on paper may not be what happens in reality.  What happens this morning may be compliant, but with a change of wind direction, a very still day, somebody not opening a window or somebody blocking a vent this afternoon, it could become very non-compliant.  It is impossible to say where the problem is.</p> <p>  As we also have a system of self-certification, it is impossible to know who signed off on that building and whether they did a careful assessment, whether they gave good advice to the people who are running the building or whether a subsequent change was made without any professional input, for example, changing doors, adding partitions, doubling up on rooms or something else.</p></speech>

We do not have anything like that in the building sector.  We have a system whereby owners and developers hire people to sign off on buildings and, in the main, they are not independently verified.</p></speech>

They are well managed and covered by the likes of the Office of Public Works, OPW, the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, the HSE, the Department, and HIQA.  They all have structures above them and within them that are capable of resourcing the kind of advice and help that they need.  A colleague of ours in the UK, as part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, SAGE, coined the term this week that the success of this summer will come down to three "Vs", namely, vaccines, variants and ventilation.  That is a pertinent point at the moment, in that what will make or break us for the next two quarters will be how successful we are with vaccines, how variants impact on that and how we deal with our buildings.</p></speech>

Is it the case that any building that is under construction should be immediately looked at to put in the adaptations required?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.487" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon Jones" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#M00400"><p>All new buildings come under regulations.  We have started to introduce terminology within regulations around matters such as capacity, recognising that it is not okay to just meet minimum requirements for ventilation and that there needs to be some flexibility inherent within buildings.  That is very welcome.  Regulators in the UK are currently revising their ventilation regulations.  They have looked at them again in light of Covid.  We have had a commitment from building standards authorities in Ireland that, in the next revision, they will be cognisant of disease control in regulations for buildings.  The thing to be aware of when talking about regulations is that we are typically talking about flow rate, which is the amount of air moving in buildings.  There is sometimes quite a difference from what we would call background ventilation, to maintain reasonable levels of general air quality, and the volumes of air that we are looking to move to limit risks of infection.  We need to be in a space where our buildings are capable of doing both.</p></speech>

We need to look at our apartment and hotel regulations, as well as at other settings.  I have particular concern about the reduced standards for apartment sizes that were brought in about three years ago, which do not have cross-ventilation or balconies and have up to 20% less volume of air than they would have had previously.  We need to be concerned about the deregulation of standards.  It merits a review in light of the pandemic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#M00600"><p>I have a couple of questions and comments myself.  Ms Hegarty spoke about how Chicago suppressed the 1918 pandemic with targeted measures, including building inspectors who signed off on ventilation as a condition of trading, and the city reopened within six weeks.  Here we are 100 years later and we are almost starting again, going by some of the evidence that was given today.  There was some mention of the situation in Australia.  We are aware of the strict quarantines involved there.  Regarding the Irish quarantine, I am conscious that we are taking away people's liberties because of the health concerns.  Are the witnesses aware of particular criteria, especially related to ventilation, in some of the hotels selected so far?  Has that come into consideration when a hotel is assessed?  We have all stayed in hotels where, for instance, the windows did not open, so one relied primarily on the air conditioning and so on.  Are the witnesses aware of that as an issue?  Regarding the strict approach taken in Australia, the witnesses have mentioned the fire doors, and how that trapped the air within that corridor.  Do the witnesses have any recommendations for that?</p> <p>  I do not know what the witnesses' experience of most aeroplanes is, but many of them are fairly dirty, and filthy in some cases.  It is a while since I have been on a plane.  After getting off a plane, you usually have a cold or something else a couple of days later.  It is down to people sneezing or coughing on the planes and down to the ventilation systems.  The witnesses said there had to be an independent verification system.  Maybe they will expand on that.</p> <p>  The figures at the start of Ms Hegarty's opening statement state that half of the people who died were infected in 0.3% of the buildings.  Over half of workplace outbreaks have been in just 150 buildings.  One in four school buildings have been affected.  It has been mentioned that we are at the end of the road with Covid.  I do not think so if we are talking about one in four school buildings having a Covid-19 index case in the last four months.  Would the witnesses accept that we need to be much more targeted, especially in those 150 buildings?  I imagine that if I knew where those 150 buildings were, I would be a bit wary of going in and out of them.  I presume some are hospitals and nursing homes.  Do the witnesses think it would be helpful for people to be able to make those judgments?  Do they think there should be some sort of targeted intervention now, at this stage, when we are rolling out the vaccine?  I do not think this is going away any time soon and we may face another wave.  If we have buildings where there is a particular problem, should there be some sort of focus on those buildings?</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the schools.  It makes sense to have some sort of supports for those schools from the Department, especially where there is overcrowding in the classroom and for the old buildings.  Do the witnesses have recommendations for some sort of fund for schools?  They mentioned the carbon dioxide meter.  Is that a minimum that they are saying should be introduced in schools?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.490" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#M00700"><p>Carbon dioxide monitoring in schools is a cheap, quick, easy way, and would pay for itself with energy savings because people will not have to overventilate and sit in the cold.  They will be able to ventilate adequately for the risk, so they will save on heating bills.  The Chairman mentioned testing in Chicago.  I recently noticed that San Francisco has posters in windows of business premises where they have had an independent inspection.  Somebody has come out and given advice.  It is not just about inspecting the building but about public confidence to go back to enter those businesses again.  They have posters in the windows to state that the building was inspected on a certain date, which system they are using, or if the door has to be open, the filter has to be on, or whatever the requirements are.  There is really good public health information.</p> <p>  Regarding the quarantine hotels, we have a lot of information from Australia and New Zealand about risk factors there, very strongly indicating that traditional hotels with rooms off long corridors with air conditioning are a bad idea for disease spread.  It is not a minor risk.  The outbreak in Victoria was purely down to a hotel breach and 800 people died as a result of that breach.  Perth recently had a five-day shutdown following a hotel quarantine breach.</p><p>They are now looking more broadly at non-city centre locations akin to low-rise buildings or even caravan parks, that type of setting, for their permanent quarantine facilities in Australia.  It also means one takes away the risk of city centre staff members living in overcrowded conditions themselves whereby outbreaks can spread or who perhaps have a second job or use public transport.  Outside city locations seem to be better, as do hotels with opening windows and not air-conditioned hotels.  It is getting away from that corridor model.  We have plenty of advice from Australia that could be adopted here from what they have learned.  Can the Chair remind me of the final point? </p></speech>

Is there something more that can be done?  Again, there is a fear that as soon as people get the green light, a lot of them will jump on planes to get some sunshine.</p></speech>

It comes down to the operation of that individual aircraft.  Is it serious enough that there needs to be independent monitoring?  I suppose that is a political decision.  Data would help in all of this.  The HSE is gathering data from every outbreak.  They know which schools, cr&egrave;ches and hospitals have had outbreaks but those data are not available.  Anything I have quoted today is from publicly available sources.  I do not have access to any more but there is a lot more available.  I think we have to start using those data, rather than having them in a filing cabinet somewhere.  That is how risk assessment could be done and how targeted interventions could be done.  They have data about cases related to travel, quarantine, hotels, schools, childcare facilities and nursing homes.  If it is a case of inspecting buildings, clearly that is an indication of where to start.</p></speech>

We certainly will look for the reports mentioned in the witness statements.  It would be useful for the committee to get copies of those reports.  The suggestion that we try to produce a report on this issue is useful.  If there is anything else that the witnesses feel they have not had a chance to expand on this morning, we would appreciate it were they to send it in writing to the committee.  It was a useful intervention this morning.  A lot of information was provided that hopefully people will take on board in their own lives, particularly those at home.  There is a responsibility on school authorities and the Department of Education to follow up on some of the statements made this morning.</p> <p>  That concludes our business for today.</p></speech>

Nuair a thosaigh na st&aacute;isi&uacute;in raidi&oacute; i 1988 n&iacute; raibh an Independent Radio and Television Commission, IRTC, a bh&iacute; ann ag an am ag iarraidh go mbeadh ceol ar feadh an lae, n&oacute; wall-to-wall music, orthu.  Cuireadh isteach tiomantais cos&uacute;il le nuacht, cult&uacute;r, ceol, Gaeilge, dr&aacute;ma&iacute;ocht agus mar sin de ach is percentages beaga a bh&iacute; ann ag an am sin.  Cuireadh na ruda&iacute; sin isteach sna conartha&iacute; nuair a thosaigh na st&aacute;isi&uacute;in sin agus sin an staid inniu.  T&aacute; an rud c&eacute;anna i gceist le Virgin Media freisin.  N&iacute; raibh aon tiomantas tugtha do na st&aacute;isi&uacute;in sin nuair a thosaigh siad.</p> <p>  Maidir le cad at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn, t&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;anamh iarrachta agus d&uacute;irt na st&aacute;isi&uacute;in le Dr. John Walsh c&eacute;n cabhair at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il uathu chun an Ghaeilge a l&aacute;idri&uacute; iontu.  T&aacute; obair &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn leis an gcoiste, mar shampla, chomh maith le hOireachtas na Gaeilge, an website Aerthonnta agus an database sonra&iacute; Eolaire, lena f&eacute;idir le daoine at&aacute; l&iacute;ofa sa Ghaeilge agus at&aacute; ag iarraidh cur isteach ar phost craolach&aacute;in do chl&aacute;r Gaeilge cl&aacute;r&uacute;.

Tugaimid gealltanas sonra&iacute; a bhaili&uacute; faoin bplean agus sin mar a rinne muid leis an tionscadal bailithe sonra&iacute; i leith na Gaeilge.  Nuair a bh&iacute; an taighde ar si&uacute;l ag Dr. John Walsh agus Dr. Rosemary Day ar dt&uacute;s bh&iacute; siad ag f&eacute;achaint ar sceidil ph&aacute;ip&eacute;ir na st&aacute;isi&uacute;in agus n&iacute; raibh siad ag d&eacute;anamh anail&iacute;s ar an &aacute;bhar craolta &eacute; f&eacute;in.

T&aacute; s&eacute; sin an-t&aacute;bhachtach agus an-chabhrach chun f&aacute;il amach cad at&aacute; &aacute; chraoladh ag st&aacute;isi&uacute;in i real time.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ar intinn againn na sonra&iacute; sin a bhaili&uacute; gach bliain chun go mbeidh muid in ann anail&iacute;s a dh&eacute;anamh bliain ar bhliain agus treochta&iacute; agus ruda&iacute; mar sin a aithint.

T&aacute; s&eacute; deacair i gc&oacute;na&iacute;, i gcomhth&eacute;acs mar seo.  B&rsquo;fhearr liom i gc&oacute;na&iacute; a bheith ag obair as l&aacute;mh a ch&eacute;ile mar go bhfuil s&eacute; r&aacute;ite chomh minic agam, n&iacute; de bharr na paind&eacute;ime, go bhfuil an Ghaeilge in &aacute;it at&aacute; thar a bheith baolach.  T&aacute;imid ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; craolach&aacute;in inniu agus an rud a l&eacute;im amach don phr&oacute;iseas a bh&iacute; ar si&uacute;l againne ag an bpointe sin n&aacute; go raibh Bealtaine 2019 chomh lag agus at&aacute; an tAcht Craolach&aacute;in 2009 agus d&uacute;ramar go raibh s&eacute; pr&aacute;inneach &eacute; a neart&uacute;.  Tiocfaidh m&eacute; ar ais go dt&iacute; an tAire leis an rud sin ach b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeadh an tUasal O&rsquo;Keeffe in ann a thuairim f&eacute;in a thabhairt faoi chomh lag is at&aacute; an reachta&iacute;ocht.</p> <p>  Tiocfaidh m&eacute; go dt&iacute; taighde John Walsh agus t&aacute; a fhios agam go raibh eisean agus an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s ag obair as l&aacute;mh a ch&eacute;ile leis do ch&eacute;im a tr&iacute;, agus fair play d&oacute;ibh as sin.  Thosaigh an Dr. Walsh agus an Dr. Day agus th&aacute;inig siad os &aacute;r gcomhair faoi dh&oacute; agus t&aacute; obair iontach d&eacute;anta acu.  Bhreathnaigh siad ar 57 st&aacute;isi&uacute;n agus chuir siad os &aacute;r gcomhair a laghad Gaeilge a bh&iacute; &aacute; n-&uacute;s&aacute;id ar na st&aacute;isi&uacute;in uile at&aacute; ceadaithe ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s.

I mo thuairim, agus n&iacute;lim &aacute; r&aacute; gurb &eacute; seo tuairim an Dr. Walsh n&aacute; an Dr. Day, t&aacute; ag teip ar an &uacute;dar&aacute;s, ar bhealach amh&aacute;in n&oacute; bealach eile, a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil Gaeilge ar na st&aacute;isi&uacute;in uile.</p> <p>  Bhreathnaigh Dr. Walsh agus Dr. Day ar an sceideal agus ansin chuaigh siad ar ais ar&iacute;s le c&eacute;im a d&oacute; agus c&eacute;im a tr&iacute; leis an &uacute;dar&aacute;s, agus sraith agallaimh a bh&iacute; i gceist.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeadh an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s in ann d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar an taighde sin, an m&eacute;id at&aacute; foghlamtha aige agus cad at&aacute; le d&eacute;anamh aige faoi sin, go h&aacute;irithe &oacute; thaobh cead&uacute;nais agus conartha de.

Tugaim faoi deara an tagairt dearfach at&aacute; ag RT&Eacute; leis an Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga agus a thiomantas a aithint chun sol&aacute;thar &aacute;bhair Ghaeilge a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; thar a ceithre st&aacute;isi&uacute;in f&eacute;in agus an tiomantas &aacute;bhair mh&eacute;adaithe a shol&aacute;thar ar ard&aacute;in mhalartacha amhail an seinnteoir agus seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; podchraoladh RT&Eacute;.  F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an chomhthionscnamh nua, ar sc&aacute;th a ch&eacute;ile, idir RT&Eacute; agus TG4 a thabharfaidh an cl&uacute;dach is leithne agus is f&eacute;idir d'&aacute;bhair Ghaeilge ar ardchaighde&aacute;n, beag beann ar c&eacute;n craolt&oacute;ir seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; poibl&iacute; a fuair an t-&aacute;bhar.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil s&eacute; ar intinn ag RT&Eacute;, ag teacht lena tiomantas 365 uair an chloig de chl&aacute;racha Gaeilge a chur ar f&aacute;il do TG4, an t-easnamh in uaireanta na bliana 2020 a sheachaint, easnamh a tharla mar gheall ar na deiseanna laghdaithe i dtaca le l&eacute;iri&uacute;ch&aacute;in &aacute;bhair a bh&iacute; ann de bharr Covid-19.</p> <p>  D&eacute;anann an BAI monat&oacute;ireacht ar chraolt&oacute;ireacht na Gaeilge cheana agus d&eacute;anann an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga monat&oacute;ireacht ar chomhl&iacute;onadh an Achta Craolach&aacute;in 2009 freisin.  Go deimhin, chonaiceamar an feabhas a rinne RT&Eacute; ar chl&aacute;racha Gaeilge a shol&aacute;thar tar &eacute;is tuarasc&aacute;il an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga in 2018.  Mar chuid de phlean gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta don Ghaeilge an BAI, chuir s&eacute; t&uacute;s le tuarasc&aacute;il bliant&uacute;il a bhaileoidh sonra&iacute; i leith na Gaeilge agus chuir an ch&eacute;ad tuarasc&aacute;il i m&iacute; Feabhra marc tagartha ar f&aacute;il maidir le c&eacute; chomh maith is a bh&iacute; craolt&oacute;ir&iacute; ag clo&iacute; lena ngealltanais maidir le cl&aacute;racha Gaeilge, agus d&eacute;anfar &eacute; seo a rian&uacute; le himeacht ama.  Is c&eacute;im th&aacute;bhachtach chun tosaigh &iacute; seo agus b'fh&eacute;idir gur mhaith le Michael O'Keeffe &oacute;n BAI n&iacute;os m&oacute; a r&aacute; faoi seo.  Mar gheall ar an Acht Craolach&aacute;in 2009, beidh an Coimisi&uacute;n um Thodhcha&iacute; na Me&aacute;n ag cur tuarasc&aacute;il ar f&aacute;il go luath agus ansin beidh seans agam an Achta a threisi&uacute;.</p> <p>  Aonta&iacute;m gur ceart don St&aacute;t lean&uacute;int le craolt&oacute;ireacht na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn gach bealach is f&eacute;idir agus d'ardaigh Conradh na Gaeilge an cheist seo liom.  Mar is eol do na Teachta&iacute;, rinneadh pl&eacute; ar an cheist seo ar Ch&eacute;im an Choiste de Bhille na Teangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;) 2019, a cuireadh i gcr&iacute;ch le d&eacute;ana&iacute;.  Gheall mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an tAire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Chambers, machnamh a dh&eacute;anamh ar leasuithe a thabhairt ar ailt d'Acht na dTeangach Oifigi&uacute;la 2003 tr&iacute; fhor&aacute;il a chur isteach ar Ch&eacute;im na Tuarasc&aacute;la chun a chinnti&uacute; go nd&eacute;anfaidh forais phoibl&iacute; 20% d&aacute; gcuid f&oacute;gra&iacute;ochta&iacute; tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge le linn bliana ar bith.  Chomh maith leis sin, chun a chinnti&uacute; go gcraoltar 5% den fh&oacute;gra&iacute;ocht sin le linn bliana ar bith sa mhe&aacute;n Gaeilge agus m&aacute; achta&iacute;tear an fhor&aacute;il sin, d'fh&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; sruthanna ioncama breise a chruth&uacute; do TG4, tionscnamh a chuirimis go l&eacute;ir f&aacute;ilte roimhe.</p> <p>  N&iacute;l an f&oacute;gra&iacute;ocht maidir le Covid faoi ch&uacute;ram mo Roinne ach, mar Aire, t&aacute; s&eacute; seo r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach domsa.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh an f&oacute;gra&iacute;ocht Gaeilge ar f&aacute;il ag an am c&eacute;anna leis an mB&eacute;arla agus t&aacute; m&eacute; tiomanta mar Aire go dtarl&oacute;idh sin.  Seo ceist at&aacute; ardaithe agamsa ar&iacute;s agus ar&iacute;s.  D'iarr m&eacute; ar mo chuid oifigigh an sc&eacute;al a fhiosr&uacute; freisin.</p> <p>  D'ardaigh an Teachta Moynihan Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  C&eacute; go nd&eacute;anann RT&Eacute; a fheidhmeanna a fheidhmi&uacute; go neamhsple&aacute;ch, f&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an athbhreithni&uacute; ar strucht&uacute;ir gr&aacute;daithe at&aacute; le teacht &oacute; RT&Eacute; lena n-air&iacute;tear gr&aacute;d cl&aacute;r reachtaire faoi dheireadh na bliana seo.  &Eacute; sin r&aacute;ite, creidim go l&aacute;idir i bprionsabal an chomhionannais i ngach gn&eacute; den saol, mar at&aacute; &aacute; l&eacute;iri&uacute; sna ceapach&aacute;in at&aacute; d&eacute;anta agam do bhoird St&aacute;it at&aacute; faoi ch&uacute;ram na Roinne &oacute; a ceapadh m&eacute; mar Aire.  N&iacute;or mhaith liom a cheapadh go bhfuil fostaithe de chuid aon eagra&iacute;ocht St&aacute;t n&oacute; neamhst&aacute;t at&aacute; i mbun na hoibre c&eacute;anna ar sc&aacute;la&iacute; p&aacute; difri&uacute;la.  Cuireann foireann RT&Eacute; Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta seirbh&iacute;s craolach&aacute;in den scoth ar f&aacute;il do phobal na Gaeltachta, ach go h&aacute;irithe do phobal labhartha na Gaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht chomh maith.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, f&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an athbhreithni&uacute; ar strucht&uacute;ir gr&aacute;daithe at&aacute; le teacht &oacute; RT&Eacute;.  Is &eacute; mo thuairim pearsanta go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh Gaeilge agus B&eacute;arla ar chomhch&eacute;im agus go l&eacute;ireofa&iacute; an meas c&eacute;anna don d&aacute; teanga.  Tuigeann RT&Eacute; go bhfuil dualgas aige faoin reachta&iacute;ocht i dtaobh na Gaeilge.  Tuigim go mb'fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh RT&Eacute; ag teacht os comhair na coiste go luath agus is f&eacute;idir le comhalta&iacute; an cheist a ard&uacute; le RT&Eacute; ansin.</p> <p>  Thug m&eacute; freagra mar gheall ar an fh&oacute;gra&iacute;ochta agus ar an fh&oacute;gra&iacute;ocht Covid-19 don Teachta Connolly agus d'ardaigh an Teachta Moynihan na point&iacute; c&eacute;anna.</p></speech>

T&aacute; deacrachta&iacute; i dtaobh an transmission, mar a bh&iacute; Fionnuala ag r&aacute;, agus i dtaobh an airgid freisin &oacute; thaobh running costs agus mar sin.</p><p>Sin iad na ruda&iacute; at&aacute; faoi chaibidil ag an subgroup.</p><p> Deireann an Teachta go bhfuil bliain imithe ach is bliain &eacute; since an presentation &oacute; Dan Healy agus Gear&oacute;id MacDonncha as Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  Chuireamar an subgroup le ch&eacute;ile ag deireadh na bliana agus t&aacute; s&eacute; ag obair go tapa.  Bh&iacute; cruinni&uacute; c&uacute;pla seachtain &oacute; shin agus t&aacute; cruinni&uacute; eile den choiste i m&iacute; an Meitheamh agus beidh report eile.  T&aacute;imid ag cur a l&aacute;n resources istigh sa concept chun a fheice&aacute;il an bhfuil s&eacute; possible.  T&aacute; s&eacute; mar pholasa&iacute; againn go mbeadh st&aacute;isi&uacute;n cos&uacute;il le Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute; ar an aer.  Is f&eacute;idir liom &eacute; sin a r&aacute;.  Leis an bhfoireann at&aacute; againn sa subgroup, t&aacute; m&eacute; hopeful go mbeidh progress roimh dheireadh na bliana seo.  Caithfidh m&eacute; &eacute; sin a r&aacute; i dtaobh Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute;.</p><p> Mar a d&uacute;irt an tAire i dtaobh RT&Eacute;, agus b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh RT&Eacute; os comhair na committee seo, t&aacute; a fhios againn go bhfuil a l&aacute;n oibre d&eacute;anta ag Niamh N&iacute; Churn&aacute;in at&aacute; ar an gcoiste linne agus at&aacute; ag obair sa r&oacute;l in RT&Eacute;.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n le d&eacute;anamh ag RT&Eacute; agus caithfidh m&eacute; sin a r&aacute; mar b&iacute;m i dteagmh&aacute;il le Niamh an t-am go l&eacute;ir.</p><p> Tagra&iacute;m don tuarasc&aacute;il &oacute; 2019.  Bh&iacute; ocht moladh ann, mar a d&uacute;irt an Teachta.  T&aacute; c&uacute;pla rud anseo.  T&aacute; an coiste againn agus b&iacute;onn ourselves agus Foras na Gaeilge ann.  Bh&iacute; &Eacute;amonn &Oacute; hArg&aacute;in ann ach t&aacute; s&eacute; imithe as an bpost &oacute;n m&iacute; seo caite.  Rinneamar an-iarracht chun an coiste a chur le ch&eacute;ile agus t&aacute; an fhoireann againn.  T&aacute; ceathrar againn ag caitheamh n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; 25% d'&aacute;r ama sa r&oacute;l seo.  T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta go bhfuil na molta&iacute; sin curtha i bhfeidhm.</p><p> I dtaobh na Gaeilge at&aacute; ar na st&aacute;isi&uacute;in, mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; leis an Teachta Calleary, seo iad na leibh&eacute;il a bh&iacute; na st&aacute;isi&uacute;in ag d&eacute;anamh nuair a thosnaigh siad ag craoladh 30 bliain &oacute; shin agus n&iacute;l s&eacute; sin athraithe.  Is fi&uacute; an cheist a phl&eacute; an mbeadh s&eacute; n&iacute;os fearr quotas a chur ar st&aacute;isi&uacute;in.  An &eacute; sin an route at&aacute; an coiste ag &eacute;ileamh?  Leis an obair at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag an gcoiste agus a luaigh Fionnuala, is d&oacute;igh liom go nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; staid n&iacute;os fearr ar na st&aacute;isi&uacute;in.  Rinne an Teachta reference do Galway Bay FM.  Ag am an ch&eacute;ad report, n&iacute; raibh s&eacute; ag craoladh as Gaeilge ach n&iacute; sin mar at&aacute; an c&aacute;s anois.  T&aacute; gach st&aacute;isi&uacute;n ag craoladh cl&aacute;ir Gaeilge ach aonta&iacute;m leis an Teachta go bhfuil an percentage an-&iacute;seal.  N&iacute;l aon cheist faoi sin.</p><p> Mar a mha&iacute;gh Dr. Walsh san report: "Measann cuid de na craolt&oacute;ir&iacute; gur riosca tr&aacute;cht&aacute;la iad cl&aacute;ir Gaeilge."  Sin rud amh&aacute;in a ma&iacute;odh sa report.  An rud eile a ma&iacute;odh ann n&aacute; go bhfuil deacrachta&iacute; ann daoine agus cl&aacute;ir a fh&aacute;il.  T&aacute; muidne ag cabhr&uacute; leis an dara rud a r&eacute;iteach ach t&aacute; an riosca a bh&iacute;onn siad ag caint faoi ann agus sin view a bhfuil acu.  Is &eacute; mo thuairim f&eacute;in n&aacute; go bhfuil an polasa&iacute; at&aacute; againne n&aacute; obair tr&iacute;d an gcoiste agus encourage na gr&uacute;pa&iacute; chun n&iacute;os m&oacute; Gaeilge a chur ar na st&aacute;isi&uacute;in agus support that through na databases agus na daoine.  Sin &iacute; an tsl&iacute; ach b'fh&eacute;idir nach n-aonta&iacute;onn an Teachta liomsa i dtaobh sin.  B'fh&eacute;idir gur mhaith leis an Teachta n&iacute;os m&oacute;-----</p></speech>

Ma&iacute;onn st&aacute;isi&uacute;n eile gur an craolt&oacute;ir n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta &eacute; ach, do chuid mhaith daoine sa t&iacute;r, is m&oacute; go bhfuil TG4 ina chraolt&oacute;ir n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta n&aacute; an st&aacute;isi&uacute;n eile RT&Eacute;.  Laistigh de sin, an mbeidh sol&aacute;thar ann le go mbeidh maoini&uacute; ceart ag TG4 go d&iacute;reach maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; nuachta agus maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; reatha?  Th&oacute;gfadh s&eacute; seo reachta&iacute;ocht.  N&iacute;l mise ag iarraidh riamh a chloiste&aacute;il n&aacute;r mhol coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n &eacute;.  Is muidne an tOireachtas agus is &iacute; an Teachta Martin an tAire.  Is comhairle a chuireann chuile dhuine eile orainn.  Is f&uacute;inn at&aacute; s&eacute; cinneadh a dh&eacute;anamh.</p> <p>  I measc na ruda&iacute; breise go dteasta&iacute;onn airgead go g&eacute;ar uathu n&aacute; cl&aacute;ir do ghas&uacute;ir.  N&iacute; bealach n&iacute;os fearr ina bhfoghlaim&iacute;onn gas&uacute;ir teanga n&aacute; tr&iacute;d an teilif&iacute;s.  T&aacute; cl&aacute;ir do ghas&uacute;ir agus do dh&eacute;ag&oacute;ir&iacute; ag teast&aacute;il maraon le tuilleadh cl&aacute;r teilif&iacute;se scoile.</p> <p>  M&aacute; bhreathna&iacute;tear ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; reatha ar TG4, t&aacute; "7 L&aacute;" ann, cl&aacute;r a mhaireann leathuair an chloig.

N&iacute;l aon dul chun cinn d&eacute;anta in ainneoin go bhfuil st&aacute;isi&uacute;n n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta ag craoladh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.</p> <p>  Aonta&iacute;m leis an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;radh ach an bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist cist&iacute;ocht a thabhairt d&iacute;reach &oacute;n St&aacute;tchiste n&oacute; &oacute;n t&aacute;ille chead&uacute;nais do Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, gan aon l&aacute;mh a bheith ag RT&Eacute; sa sc&eacute;al?  Chinnteodh s&eacute; sin cothromas agus cumas maidir le cl&aacute;ir a dh&eacute;anamh.  Bheadh s&eacute; thar a bheith sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il don Aire anail&iacute;s a dh&eacute;anamh ar c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad duine at&aacute; gafa le "Morning Ireland" agus c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad duine at&aacute; ag RT&Eacute; Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta le "Adhmhaidin" a chur ar an aer.  T&aacute; an rud c&eacute;anna i gceist um thr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.  Thuigf&iacute; go gcaitear leis an nGaeilge i gc&oacute;na&iacute; in &aacute;it na leathphingine agus go bhfuil &eacute;acht &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag an bhfoireann ar ph&aacute; n&iacute;os l&uacute;.</p> <p>  T&aacute; Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute; luaite anseo ach is &eacute; an t-&eacute;ileamh at&aacute; ann i measc m&iacute;laoisigh n&aacute; go mbeadh st&aacute;isi&uacute;n raidi&oacute; n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta ann do dhaoine &oacute;ga a bheadh ag craoladh go minic agus a bheadh ag feidhmi&uacute; go hioml&aacute;n tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge.  Is f&eacute;idir le Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute; n&oacute; le st&aacute;isi&uacute;n n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta nua a bhun&oacute;fa&iacute; le cist&iacute;ocht dh&iacute;reach &oacute;n St&aacute;tchiste an r&oacute;l sin a ghlacadh.  Is cuma liom ach ba cheart go mbeadh st&aacute;isi&uacute;n n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta ar n&oacute;s Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta ann a bheadh d&iacute;rithe ar aos &oacute;g na t&iacute;re seo agus a bhfaigheadh cist&iacute;ocht &oacute;n l&aacute;rchiste.  Tugaimis 2FM na Gaeilge air le go dtuigf&iacute; an cine&aacute;l ruda, m&uacute;nla n&oacute; creata at&aacute; i gceist agam.</p> <p>  Is ceisteanna don Aire iad seo mar is ceisteanna m&oacute;ra polasa&iacute; iad.  Cuireann &Uacute;dar&aacute;s Craolach&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann an polasa&iacute; i bhfeidhm ach is muide sa Teach seo, agus an Teachta Martin mar Aire, a chuireann an m&oacute;rpholasa&iacute; i bhfeidhm.

Not only will we look at the spending measures, but specific recommendations on how to deliver programmes across the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Rural and Community Development.  In this regard the committee advertised for submissions.  Again, I thank the stakeholders, groups and individuals who submitted documentation to us.  These have been very beneficial to us in our deliberations.</p><p>At our meeting we will hear from one such stakeholder group when we gain further insight into the submission of the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, which a representative body of Ireland's local development companies.  It represents 49 local development companies that provide a comprehensive range of community-based services in areas such as social inclusion, personal development and well-being, early years and family support, education and training, employment services, enterprise and social enterprise, climate change and just transition.</p><p>The representatives from the ILDN will tell us that the local development companies support more than 15,000 communities and community groups and 173,000 individuals annually through &euro;330 million of State-funded programmes, allocated at national level.  These include LEADER, the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, the national walks and recreation programme, social enterprise supports, T&uacute;s, the rural social scheme, RSS, the local employment service, LES, and the back-to-work enterprise allowance.</p><p>The committee looks forward to hearing about the work of these community companies in supporting citizens and communities and their most recent and ongoing work responding to the Covid-19 crisis.  Throughout the Covid-19 crisis, the local development network companies throughout the country have been to the fore in designing innovative solutions to meet the needs of people isolated in their own homes as a result of the lockdown.</p><p>The committee wants to explore how some of these innovations can now be mainstreamed to meet the needs of those who have been isolated in the past and remain so, regardless of physical location or public health guidance.  In addition to exploring the pre-budget submission with the ILDN, we will have the opportunity to discuss the broader policy issues, such as the ILDN's strategy statement and the issue of the outsourcing of local employment services and related procurement matters.  It is an issue on which members of this committee have received many representations and one which has engaged the committee on numerous occasions since our establishment.</p><p>In that regard, I welcome Mr. Joseph Saunders, chief executive officer of the ILDN, and Ms Adeline O'Brien, chairperson of the ILDN's social inclusion committee.  They are most welcome.</p><p>Turning to matters of privilege, members of this committee and of the Houses have absolute privilege in respect of statements made in either House of the Oireachtas or before the committee.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses present on the precincts of Leinster House are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are required to give to a committee.  If, in the course of committee proceedings, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside of the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call Mr. Saunders, chief executive officer of the ILDN, to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to join the meeting today to discuss the its preparation for budget 2022.  We look forward to having a fruitful discussion and being as helpful as possible to the committee in its own deliberations.</p> <p>  In his opening remarks, the Chairman alluded to the breadth and scope of the ILDN activity and referred to the 49 members companies, so I do not propose to repeat that.  I will start on one of the points to which the Chairman alluded, namely, the local development company response to the Covid crisis.  The national footprint the companies have in delivering on a local community level allowed local development companies to be what we might term first responders to the Covid crisis, initially contacting tens of thousands of our hardest-to-reach citizens and thousands of community groups in the infancy of the crisis.</p> <p>  I thank the relevant funding Departments, particularly the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Social Projection for the flexibility that was shown over this period which allowed local development companies to tailor-make solutions for their own particular areas and communities.  This included deploying staff to FoodCloud and ALONE, filling in pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, forms for those without computer access or know-how, and providing food and medicines through the social inclusion community activation programme, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme.  At a human level, members will recall the days of the pandemic when there were difficulties for people visiting loved ones and those in their final days in nursing homes.  We rapidly organised a virtual laptop visitation scheme for the loved ones with family members in nursing homes who could not access those homes in the Dublin metropolitan and surrounding areas.  Our work also involved supporting social enterprises, whose income base had collapsed in the early weeks of the pandemic but whose services were required more than ever.</p><p>There was also the support of social enterprises, whose income base had collapsed in the early weeks of the pandemic but whose services were required more than ever.<br/><br/>In the first four weeks of the crisis, local development companies received an average of 2,200 pandemic-specific requests for assistance each day and they responded to each of these through the deployment of 1,400 staff and 980 scheme workers for tasks that were specifically associated with the community call in response to the crisis.  A good example of this was the area of food poverty.  Following the onset of social restrictions, FoodCloud and the ILDN came together to see if they could plug the gaps across the country where these existed.  As a result of this rapid scaling up, local development companies collaborated with FoodCloud to set up food banks in 22 counties, mainly where this provision was not previously available.  It also augmented existing provision in other counties.  While food poverty was not new at this point, it had manifested itself in a new and extreme way which required a rapid response.  This collaboration with FoodCloud was presented by Ireland as a case study at the recent OECD seminar on best practice in local development response to Covid-19.  We also supplied staff through ILDN to FoodCloud distribution hubs in major cities, as well as distributing food countrywide to social inclusion target groups through T&uacute;s, RSS and SICAP, whose infrastructure and the availability of vans and storage facilities allowed this to happen rapidly.<br/><br/>Such responses have been based on a partnership between the State and the local development sector that worked very effectively.  While there were significant challenges, and we would like to have done more and for more people, it is fair to say that local development companies, given their expertise and infrastructure, were not overwhelmed at that point.  With highly skilled and experienced staff, they continue to be a sustainable agile delivery mechanism as this crisis morphs and, hopefully, settles.  However, in many ways it is only deepening now and we will see the longer-term effects as time passes.  Local development companies will play a key role in the ongoing well-being, mental health and community building that is now required and, crucially, in getting people back to work and assisting social life to re-emerge, albeit under new conditions.<br/><br/>Given the range of services provided by our members, as outlined by the Chairman, we will not speak to all the programmes today, but we wish to highlight a number of priorities which the committee might consider in its budget proposals.  The first is THE LES.  The Department of Social Protection contracts ILDN members for the provision of local employment services in 23 locations.  Providers deliver a case-managed employment service for all jobseekers and this has been positively evaluated by the independent consultants, Indecon International Economic Consultants.  Given the uncertainty in the labour market, the high numbers requiring activation over the next two years and the capacity available to the State through local development companies, we have reiterated our position that now is not the time to embark on a realignment of existing LES operational areas, as is being proposed with the introduction of a dual-strand procurement process.  That will disrupt activation services at a time when they are most needed.  ILDN has proposed that all local development companies that do not have an existing LES would be in a position to pilot an LES-type service reflective of the Covid-19 context and the changing socioeconomic profile.  In this period, local development companies with LES contracts would continue to deliver the current LES, but provide enhanced services and do so for all jobseekers.  This proposal offers an agile and affordable response to the inevitable high demand for employment services over the coming months and years.  There is integration with existing rural employment and inclusion services where LES do not currently exist, no requirement to develop infrastructure <i>ab initio </i>and no disruption to existing services from a realignment of operational areas or the loss of skilled staff.<br/><br/>Moving to the LEADER programme, the next EU LEADER programme will not commence until 2023.  To bridge the gap to the start of the next programme, a transitional LEADER has come into effect with a budget of &euro;70 million to the end of 2022.  ILDN and its members have warmly welcomed this allocation.  The LEADER programme offers the ideal vehicle for the delivery of development funding to rural areas in the most effective manner.  Community-led local development, CLLD, acts at European level as a multi-fund approach, that is, by joining different funding programmes and instruments one can achieve greater results.  We believe there is merit in the adaptation of a CLLD muli-fund approach for LEADER to ensure rural communities benefit from all available EU and State supports.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it is important that the Government allocates the maximum percentage possible of Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, Pillar 2 funding and Exchequer co-funding for the purposes of LEADER.  We regret that the ILDN and its members have not been included in the CAP consultative committee overseen by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which is drawing up the new CAP proposals at national level.  It is regrettable that those who deliver LEADER, an important element of the CAP budget, do not have a seat at this table and it is important that this committee is aware of this point and that it monitors how the CAP strategic planning process unfolds.<br/><br/>With regard to other activation schemes, particularly T&uacute;s, community employment, CE, and RSS, we believe it is critical to allow for maximum participation in these important schemes in the years ahead.  The rural social scheme currently faces a critical juncture and an inevitable decline if impending impacts of eligibility rules are not addressed soon.  There is a six-year rule in place, introduced in 2017, and its impacts are about to apply in early 2023.  If left in place, this provision will remove 38% of the schemes, with just over 3,000 participants, in a three-year period, which will have devastating consequences for the scheme itself, those who are on it and the communities in which such valuable work takes place.  Together with the 13% who will leave at normal retirement age, this means that over half of the scheme will be removed.  This represents a cliff edge for rural communities in work undertaken, experience and leadership loss and a reduction in biodiversity by pushing landowners off the land and their replacement by more monoculture practices.  ILDN urges the Government to review this rule ahead of budget 2022 and to bring forward reforms to protect participation in this vital scheme.  Eligibility reform is necessary to ensure that the scheme survives.<br/><br/>Eligibility change is also necessary with the T&uacute;s scheme.  T&uacute;s saw reduced numbers prior to the pandemic, but this was exacerbated by it more recently.  A number of reforms to eligibility criteria and length of service on the scheme and, crucially, for improved referral processes are needed to ensure the programme stays at the heart of the State's activation options and continues to serve those most in need of this valuable work experience prior to their fuller entry to the labour market.<br/><br/>I will hand over the final part of our submission to my colleague, Ms Adeline O'Brien, who is the CEO of Empower in the Fingal area and chair of the ILDN social inclusion committee.</p></speech>

The current budget is &euro;43 million, a fall from &euro;84.7 million in 2008.  Those who are already disadvantaged are likely to be more so due to crises in health, the economy, education and employment, such as Covid-19.  This is compounded by poorer access to information technology and digital and online services.  As we move into the recovery phase, digitalisation and the remote delivery of services will become mainstream across society, thus causing further disadvantage to groups with poor access to, and experience of, digital channels.</p> <p>  To protect vulnerable groups, typically SICAP target groups, the ILDN proposes a digital inclusion fund, to be administered by local development companies in conjunction with SICAP.  This is in keeping with the European Commission recommendation that Ireland address the risk of a digital divide.  While specific funding is required for the digital inclusion fund, the initiative will benefit from existing integrated services and facilities throughout the local development network.  Further investment in SICAP is also important in the context of the implementation of the Government's White Paper on ending direct provision.</p><p> In terms of a sustainable local development sector, ILDN is seeking the introduction of a core cost funding model as a more sustainable and equitable approach to supporting the inclusion-focused and anti-poverty work of local development companies country-wide. This model is based on a full costs recovery system in line with objective No. 4 of the Government&rsquo;s sustainable, inclusive and empowered communities strategy.  I thank the members for their attention.</p></speech>

I strongly praise the role that the network has played in tackling the pandemic.  One of the words used in the submission is "agility" and the service really demonstrated its agility, speed and creativity in its response to the pandemic.  It should be praised for how quickly that was rolled out.</p> <p>  I have some questions that might provide the witnesses an opportunity to give some more detail on elements of the submission.  The submission recommends reforms of T&uacute;s community employment and rural social schemes.  What reforms do the witnesses propose?  Ms O'Brien spoke about a core costs model.  This is not a concept I understand well so I am interested in the witnesses taking time to dig down into that a bit more.</p> <p>  I am interested in hearing how much would make the digital inclusion fund successful?  There is an idea about rolling out the local employment service to areas not currently provided for, which makes a huge amount of sense, but I am interested in hearing the detail of how much it would cost, how quickly it could be rolled out and what kind of Government supports would be needed to make that an adequate response.  Those are four points and there is much to get through in the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.579" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Adeline O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021051900002#C00600"><p>I can speak specifically about the digital inclusion fund and Mr. Saunders can respond on the other issues.  We are proposing a digital inclusion fund and the rationale is that we are all aware of the digital divide that became apparent during the pandemic.  It is important to note the digital divide was always there, although masked in a way with services similar to ours, where we delivered on-site and bespoke one-to-one training and support for people accessing information and communications technology systems.  Once the pandemic hit and everybody was expected to access those services within their home, the divide became very apparent.</p> <p>  We have assessed the need for digital inclusion and we see access to digital technology as a rights-based matter, as it has an impact on a person's ability to access services.  We see mainstream transition to most services, including the delivery of healthcare, employment services, Department of Social Protection services and housing, and we see people living in marginalised communities further disadvantaged and marginalised.</p> <p>  We have identified four particular characteristics of digital exclusion and, within that, the four components that need to be in place for a person to be fully digitally included.  There is the hardware piece that became very obvious, and we saw many news items with community groups responding to people in need of hardware and devices.  Along with that is a need for an operating system; there is a software requirement when a piece of hardware is provided to a person so the device can operate and function fully.  There is also digital competence, and this is about a person having the capacity and ability to engage online in the same way as he or she would in person.  That might be second nature or mainstream to some of us but it can be a very alien concept for people who are not digitally included or are otherwise marginalised for a variety of reasons.  The final component is connectivity, and that is not just about whether there is provision in an area.  It is about the cost of connectivity.  We see broadband and connectivity as an essential utility and one cannot be fully included without that.  Unless all four components are in place, a person cannot be fully included in society to access all required services.</p> <p>  We are proposing a digital inclusion fund that could be easily administered throughout the local development network.  As has been mentioned, this network would have national reach and the proposition is that the nuances of digital inclusion in each part of the country could be addressed specifically in each county or small area by the local development company.  As was mentioned by the previous speaker, we have managed to have an impact on marginalised people in a very robust and agile way right across the country, and we see digital inclusion as just an extension of that.</p> <p>  There is not a major distinction between levels of poverty, whether it is food, energy or digital poverty.  We have demonstrated a clear ability to respond to food poverty very quickly and we can and have been doing the same with respect to digital poverty.  We estimate that in order to achieve national coverage, the cost would be approximately &euro;7.4 million, which is an average of approximately &euro;160,000 per local development company.  We feel we are ready to go with this vital service when we are talking about access to online services becoming mainstream for everybody.  We have already seen those on the margins excluded before the pandemic becoming further excluded, with deprivation becoming more compounded as a result of this exclusion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.580" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Saunders" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021051900002#C00700"><p>I can briefly address the three other matters raised by the Deputy, beginning with the core costs.  As the Chairman outlined, there is a very wide range, breadth and scope of activity that local development companies deliver on behalf of the State.  There is a very small amount of philanthropic funding and it is fair to say more than 98% of income is from the State; it is a delivery arm of State services.  Within that context, the sustainability of local development companies is not a given.  Moreover, the sustainability of many companies is currently under threat.</p> <p>  Members should be aware that many of the programmes we deliver do not make an adequate contribution, if any, to core management or administration costs.  We often take programmes for delivery based on the fact that there is infrastructure already available in the local development companies.  There is an over-reliance on core programmes, such as LEADER and SICAP, in this regard to provide staffing, management and administration.  As members have already heard, the SICAP budget is 50% of what it was in 2008.</p> <p>  Our argument is that if the State values this delivery of almost a third of a billion of programming in the social area each year, the viability of local development companies needs to be underpinned.  That is currently not happening adequately.  As part of the Government's sustainable, inclusive and empowered community strategy, of which we were a co-creator, in collaboration with a number of other colleague organisations in the NGO sector, there are commitments to core cost multiannual funding models.  The progress on these must be accelerated and this must be addressed before any further difficulties are experienced.</p> <p>  With regard to the T&uacute;s programme and eligibility criteria, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was the initiator of the programme and is aware that it was designed in a time of high unemployment to provide work experience for those who were job-ready and had suffered in the previous recession.  Employment figures improved prior to the pandemic and those on T&uacute;s were experiencing greater distance or barriers to entry into the labour market.  The one-year experience on the programme was very valuable but in many cases people required a longer period.</p> <p>  Our first recommendation for T&uacute;s is to reduce the qualification period from three years to one year.</p><p>This is because many participants were being forced to leave the scheme and go back on unemployment payments, were distanced from the labour market and could not get back on for three years.  Our second recommendation is that employment contracts be extended for participants identified as needing increased support to ensure their eventual progression.  In many cases, this would need to be two or, possibly, three years.  We recommend to update the eligibility criteria to increase access to the programme for other jobseekers, not only those on qualifying payments.  Our third recommendation relates to the extension of employment contracts for T&uacute;s participants aged 62 or over who had little opportunity to go back into the open labour market but were providing vital community and also protecting their own health and well-being the programme with very little cost to the State.</p><p> On the final point regarding the LES programme, I suspect other members may wish to contribute on this as well.  I will keep my comments brief.  The LES is located in 26 contract areas throughout the country.  There are large gaps.  We would welcome any extension of that but, at present, we would say that the current providers are in a position to move in an agile way with a small budget increase.  Currently, LES provision nationally is of the order of &euro;18 million to &euro;19 million.  On the requirement to extend that nationally, non-LES companies -  that is, the local development companies that do not have LES contracts - have rural employment services through SICAP and pre-employment services through T&uacute;s and the RSS.  They have other projects and programmes which they are delivering as well.  As a result, they could easily translate this into a wider LES-type provision for what we estimate to be a cost of &euro;14 million to &euro;15 million.  That would bring the total cost for a national employment service open to all citizens to between &euro;33 million and &euro;35 million.</p></speech>

I have just a couple of questions.  They have covered some of the issues that I wanted to raise so I will not go over them again.</p> <p>  I will make a quick comment on the digital poverty piece.  It is something I found interesting over the course of the past year and a bit.  Also, I have worked in areas of educational disadvantage where I saw it at first hand.  Even this week, I met with the parents of children with dyslexia who must apply to the Department for tablets or laptops and yet, ironically, during the Covid pandemic, third level students were automatically given laptops and tablets.  It is interesting that we have children who I have seen at 13, 14 or 15 years of age dropping out of school who eventually will end up engaging with services such as the LES and T&uacute;s.  It is like closing the door after the horse has bolted.  If we can close the gap in terms of digital poverty as we go forward, particularly with young people, it will make a massive difference to their lives.</p> <p>  In the context of the LES, my question relates to something I have spoken about at length previously.  The concern I would have, having read the submission, relates to whether our guests are asking for existing services to be in some way red-circled or are they saying that the new services that will be put in place in those areas that do not have a LES will be the new model which is being proposed by the Department of Social Protection.  Obviously, my preferred option would be that this is not-for-profit and no for-profit organisations would every get their hands on it.  I would always fear - this goes back to industrial relations - that if you red-circle employees, then invariably down the line those red circles eventually become a target.  The services that are being provided for profit can operate on different wages and conditions for staff, different operating conditions, etc., and all of a sudden you have maybe 14 or 15 LES operators for profit who are operating a completely different system.  The pressure comes on then if you are paying decent wage, if you have good conditions for your workers and if you are also providing a good service.</p> <p>  Another issue I have relates to the community development projects.  At the time I was involved in community development projects, we had locally managed community development projects which were in the community.  I note that there are a number of pilot projects.  In the context of the local development companies, SICAP funding and community development projects, I would have a concern about how representative it is in disadvantaged working-class areas and how a community can decide for itself where that funding goes.  I would have a huge concern that it is becoming very much a top-down as opposed to bottom-up approach to funding for disadvantaged areas.</p> <p>  Then there is the last piece around the food banks.  In my opinion, food banks are fundamental evident of failure in society to provide a decent income for people and they are something that we should be always working to get rid of.  It is not something that should become endemic or that could be a core piece of work for any organisation because if we provided people with a decent income, they would not have to access food banks, food clouds, etc.  I understand the concept behind them.  I understand that they are what is needed at the moment and that many families rely on them.  We should be looking to do ourselves our of jobs in terms of poverty, digital poverty, food poverty, etc.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I thank the Chair and the Deputy.</p> <p>  To address the food banks issue, I agree 100%.  This should not be something that becomes embedded in our practices as a society.  This was a moment-in-time response.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has set up a working group on this but, as the Deputy rightly identifies, it is an issue to do with the adequacy of income provision.  It is at this level that it should be sorted on a long-term basis.  From our perspective, the pandemic has shown that this need existed.  It predated the pandemic but it came out because suddenly people realised there was an option to access the service in this way.  Even in the context of my office, which is a central office that does not necessarily deal with the public, we had huge demands being placed on us and we had to redirect certain of those demands to local areas.  The point is well made and I agreed with it.  This should not be allowed to be embedded.  It is a moment-in-time response which needs to evolve rapidly into a more long-term response.</p> <p>  On the LES issue and the possible dual-strand approach, the job conditions and, of course, the job qualifications which speaks to the quality of the service in the current LES is something that we need to drag everybody up to, not drag down to others.  My fear for a dual-stranded process is contagion from the poorer standard to the better standard.  It behoves us to respect and protect the employment conditions, but also the service standards, that are currently so positively evaluated by external agencies such as Indecon and ESRI in relation to local employment services.</p></speech>

On community development, the local development company provides an infrastructure and there is a national infrastructure that allows and facilitates community development at grassroots level.  I agree entirely with the Deputy that it is in areas of deprivation where we see a greater demand for services, even typical medical services.  You see people in disadvantaged areas having to access services in twice the number as an average area.  We see a huge continuing demand for community development engagement, particularly in areas of disadvantage.  It is not that it is a replacing of grassroots or a suppression from the top down.</p><p>It is more about providing an infrastructure nationally that has tentacles in every small area of the country.  It is about identifying those needs on the ground and supporting the people who live in that area to come together.  We very often find, particularly in the Fingal area as the Deputy will be aware, that we have a very diverse community.  A huge proportion of the people who now live in Fingal were not born or did not grow up in Ireland.  The natural infrastructure we would have seen in communities fad&oacute; fad&oacute; does not really exist for many people.  Those natural networks of support that would normally have been there do not exist for everybody.  </p><p> We see a role in manufacturing a community development infrastructure and a national network of support for people, particularly those on the margins.  It is about empowering those people to come together to form a critical mass in order that their voices can be heard.  Once that happens through the SICAP programme, when we engage with groups the objective is to ensure they become sustainable and exercise and politicise themselves in their own way with their own voices.  That is a core principle of what the local development company is doing, particularly with marginalised groups.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.587" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021051900002#E00200"><p>I will raise a number of issues.  I agree with the proposal that the LES should be extended to cover the whole country because there are issues in relation to employment everywhere.  I have always abominated the situation we had initially when I became Minister, where some areas were covered by partnerships and others were not, even though there is poverty, deprivation, disadvantage or whatever one wants to call it, in all areas.</p> <p>  The witnesses might clarify one technical question for the committee.  When do existing LES contracts terminate?  Is there a clause within those contracts that allows the State to extend them?  There is no point in us making a proposal if people come back to us saying that the contracts legally terminate on a certain date.  Can that issue be clarified?</p> <p>  Are ILDN companies interested in taking over or doing the work previously done by Turas Nua, JobPath in other words, and Seetec?  Again, we should not bring in multinationals to do this work.  It would be much better done by partnership companies where the board would be made up of local people, rather than some big board outside their area.  The issue is not whether the companies are technically not-for-profit but, rather, do they belong to the people and are they of the people?  That is absolutely vital.</p> <p>  I will make a comment on LEADER.  The State is finding it very hard to spend capital funding.  If I was in the ILDN, I would instruct all the companies to keep spending and improving until they are out of money and to do it in a year if they can.  Then, like Oliver, they can go back and say, "Please sir, can we have some more", because my guess is there will be much more available.  We have made spending money so difficult.  No matter what the sphere, we will see that everything will have surplus money and everyone will be screaming to try to spend the &euro;10 billion capital.  The figures keep indicating the same thing.  The Covid pandemic is only part of that problem; our own structure is another.  </p> <p>  I will make a comment about T&uacute;s.  The witnesses are very modest in their request.  When T&uacute;s was set up, the Department of Finance got at it, as it will get at these things.  It was in December 2010, which, it might be remembered, was not a great time.  The idea of T&uacute;s was to employ on work schemes people who failed to get a job through CE and those who would never be likely to get employment in the competitive labour market.  It was never meant to be a one-year scheme.  </p> <p>  I would like the witnesses' views on whether they accept there are people who are unlikely to get what I would call competitive private sector employment but who still can perform very useful tasks in our communities that are absolutely required and who do so efficiently and at an economic cost.  I put the question that if we were a hell of a lot more ambitious or radical then the witnesses were today - only allowing it for over 62-year-olds - would they be opposed to us?  As for the RSS, I abhor and totally disagree with the introduction of the rule changes in 2017 on means testing, which means that people, even those who have partners and families, will get &euro;23 for 19 hours' work a week.  That is wrong.  How would the witnesses feel if we said to go back to pre-2017 rules that were working perfectly?  We are going to run out of people on the RSS.</p> <p>  I will make another point and give a figure I have to hand.  I made inquiries about T&uacute;s numbers.  I presume this is replicated around the country but the witnesses might confirm it.  In 2017, in Connemara, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta had 52 and Forum Connemara 53 work placements.  In 2020, those numbers had dropped to 49 and 28, respectively, because the referrals were not coming.  If that is an indicator of the rest of the country at a time of the highest unemployment, we have experienced for many years, we have a major structural problem.  On SICAP, I note what was said about the drop in budget.  We will not go into that because others have covered what I was going to say fairly well.</p> <p>  Finally, and I thank the Chair for the indulgence, I will make three points on digital exclusion.  One, people still should be able to get a human being at the end of a telephone for services.  Some people will never become digitally included, particularly if they are dealing with State services.  They will be able to send an email, watch Facebook, do Zoom meetings and all sorts of things, but they will not feel comfortable doing official business with the State, digitally.  Second, would the witnesses back me in stating that people should be able to make phone contact and fill in paper forms if they want?  The State puts many burdens on people.  It should not stop people insisting on a little extra work if they want to fill in a form the old-fashioned way.  It might not be as handy for the State, but the State is not here to be handy for itself; it is here to provide service for the people.  Finally, has any analysis been done on badly-written programmes?  I keep looking for services digitally and I use many services digitally.  I obviously use a computer all day, every day, but some programmes are very badly written, are confusing and create problems for people who are not familiar with them.  Those are my issues.   Does the Chair want to skip to the next person and let them be bulked in?    </p></speech>

The current contract, which existing LES providers are working under, is a contract presented to them last November.  It came into operation at the beginning of January and is for one year, until the end of 2021.</p> <p>  Would we be willing to take on the work that other contract providers are doing?  Our submission and opening statement allude to the fact that we are willing to provide a comprehensive employment service for all citizens, regardless of means or need, but the financial and delivery models for how that is done are extremely important.  Our voluntary boards do not wish to make profit out of any jobseeker or to engage in per-unit costings where upfront funding is needed.</p><p>We want a model run on a community not-for-profit basis which is available to all citizens.  We would provide that while operating the entirety of activation services if asked to do so.  We propose to extend our current operations rapidly and radically.</p><p> With regard to the RSS, I agree with the Deputy's two criticisms of the rule changes.  This scheme does vital work.  To give a good concrete example of how it contributes to the mission of Ireland Inc., the Wild Atlantic Way benefits from thousands of RSS and T&uacute;s scheme workers providing environmental management, beach clean-ups, litter clean-ups and interaction with visitors along the route.  This work is quiet and unseen but is vital in many areas.  The Deputy is right about the cohort involved.  There are challenges in filling vacancies on these schemes.  Any obstacles like the six-year rule are to the detriment of both the individuals who would be on the scheme and the wider communities they would serve through their work.</p><p> As to the LEADER programme, the pressure to spend is always there.  As the Deputy knows well, this is a developmental programme and there is an arc to the funding pattern over the seven years.  Our members are working extremely hard to get this money out into communities.  They have animated and are fielding a great range of expressions of interest and are turning them into applications.  The Deputy will be very aware of some of the gold-plating of the European rules which has stood in the way of that over the past while.  We will be looking to return to more simplified, less bureaucratic mechanisms for the expenditure of moneys that are closer to the point of delivery in the design of the next programme.</p></speech>

With regard to digital inclusion, we see the need for both.  I do not believe that anybody would argue that the art of human engagement and supporting the most vulnerable people could be entirely replaced with online services.  In fact, many of the supports we provided through a digital inclusion programme during the pandemic involved supporting people to access services online while in a face-to-face setting.  There is no sense that everything needs to be moved completely online.  There will always be face-to-face interaction.  Many of our services are delivered in that way.  It is about making sure those people who are accessing our services and who are engaged in their communities can also do so online.  There is no doubt that 80% of engagement with services will move online.  It is about giving everyone the opportunity to do both rather than about replacing our face-to-face services with digital engagement.</p> <p>  The Deputy is quite right with regard to the T&uacute;s programme.  Obviously referrals will need to open up.  We have already spoken about some of our recommendations for reform of the scheme.  With regard to people not competing in the general labour market, as the Deputy has rightly pointed out, there are many reasons for that.  Some of these relate to language issues or intergenerational unemployment.  We are also seeing intergenerational ill health in disadvantaged communities.  People with convictions or caring duties also face difficulties.  While the T&uacute;s programme provides really valuable and critical work experience for the individual, we also see it as providing community services.  It provides positive social contact for people, allowing them to connect with their own communities.  Not everybody has a natural infrastructure of support and care around them.  We would often say that somebody might get a start in one of these places.  If you are new to a community or if you have been marginalised for any reason, the T&uacute;s programme opens up possibilities for engagement and integration in the local community.  It also provides routine and a meaningful social role in the community.  We see it as having enormous benefits beyond the work experience itself.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is absolutely right.</p></speech>

I have just a couple of questions.  The first relates to food poverty, which appears to be a growing issue.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul was before the committee last week and its representatives flagged this as an issue that is going to grow as we emerge out of the Covid pandemic.  With regard to the food banks set up by the Irish Local Development Network in conjunction with FoodCloud in 22 counties, mostly counties where they were not previously provided, will the representatives give a bit more detail?  Are these services still ongoing?  Does the network see them remaining in place in the majority of these counties?  It has been said deprivation is a cause of concern.  We know deprivation had increased in 2019, long before the arrival of Covid.  That will be of major concern as we move forward.</p> <p>  It is important that we acknowledge the wonderful work of local employment services.  This was reflected in the 2018 Indecon report.  It showed the excellent relationships services have with local employers and with those who use them.  We also have to acknowledge local employment services are unique in that they serve a much wider cohort than only those jobseekers who are referred to them.  People can just walk in, including those who are furthest away from sourcing employment.  That is really important.  It makes the services unique and it is why it is so important they continue in their current not-for-profit community-based form.</p> <p>  I raised this issue with the Minister last night as a priority question.  She announced that the external report carried out on contracted services, which has not been published up until now, will be published.  That will be interesting.  The network has suggested now is not the time to embark on a realignment.  The extension to the four new areas is coming up fairly quickly.  I assume that tender will be here any day because the Minister still says the Government will be moving on that in July and will get it set up and established.  They are seeking for the new and existing services to begin in January.  I also got the impression from the Minister last night that JobPath will continue into next year.  Referrals were meant to end at the end of 2019 and then again this year, but they have not.  That is a cause of concern.</p> <p>  Another thing the Minister is now saying, which I have not heard before, is that the costs-met model, the current model of the local employment services, involves day-to-day scrutiny of expenditure and is burdensome on the employment services and on the Department.  She is now clearly saying, as she said last night, that a payment for each individual referred is the preferred approach.  This is, of course, the model of JobPath.  I am even more concerned about where we are going now.  It is something on which we need to keep a very close eye.  If something is not broken, it should not be fixed.  The local employment services are excellent.  They need to be extended but the community not-for-profit model is absolutely critical.  The network will have our full support on that.</p> <p>  With regard to community employment, age is obviously a big issue for this and for other schemes.  What is the network seeing with regard to age?  How much of an issue is age for those over 55 who would like to take up a place on a community employment scheme?  I would imagine that, in many cases, people leaving these schemes will not be replaced.  There was already an issue with people being referred to the likes of community employment schemes, which was heavily impacted by a preference for JobPath.  In many areas, I would imagine that, where people have to leave, the service will simply no longer exist.  That is also of concern.</p> <p>  The network has clearly done an awful lot of really good and rewarding work throughout the Covid pandemic.  I acknowledge that.  It has played a critical role in helping people throughout the pandemic.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

We have noted the responses to parliamentary questions.  I will go back to my earlier statement that the voluntary boards of local development companies operate on a not-for-profit basis.  They are not interested in profiteering through costs per unit for jobseeker placements or assistance.</p><p>The SICAP model is a costs-met model, which provides the oversight that the funder and the taxpayer is due and needs but it does it in a way that is not based on a per-unit cost; there are some penalties, or what are called remedies, involved.  Therefore, there is a way of providing oversight on the one hand, minimising bureaucracy for the provider and having a fair funding model.  There is a way to do that and even at this point, we would encourage that whatever eventual contracts come out should utilise the best of each of those aspects on a community-based not-for-profit service that puts the jobseeker at the heart of the service.</p><p> On food poverty, I think we are all aware that the issue has not abated.  The service continues, it morphs slightly in different areas as needs settle down in particular areas or different distribution mechanisms are put in place but this issue is not going away.  In that regard, we look forward to playing a role on the working group the Minister has set up and we would welcome an opportunity for membership there while taking into account, however, the goal, which I mentioned in my replies to Deputy Donnelly, that this is an issue we should be seeking to address in a more permanent way.  From our perspective, we can play a role in that but the Deputy has identified income improvement or income augmentation as being the key here and that is something we do not have any particular role or control over.</p><p> On the CE issue and the issue of age, of the 800 or 900 plus CE schemes around the country, just 34 of those are within local development companies so we do not have the broad breadth of experience on this.  Of course, the issue of unclear delineation between schemes, the older age cohort, the issue Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned of those who will not get a place in the open job market, they all need to be seen in the round but a basic principle is that people can do and provide valuable community services, as well as services to their own health, well-being and personal development outside of the open labour market.  We think these schemes should continue to facilitate that community benefit and that personal development, not least from a cost-effectiveness viewpoint, given the savings in health costs that arise from people's full participation in their communities.</p></speech>

During the pandemic we saw people accessing services related to food poverty who had not previously done so because of the raising of awareness around the services available in the local community.  Generally, the people who are accessing food supports and experiencing food poverty had many other issues; there was a lot going on in their homes, and a lot more going on in the community.  We see a real connection between food poverty, energy poverty and digital poverty.  It was people accessing general supports.  When all else fails and a person has spent the limited income he or she has on energy, what is left is food.  We have established a network of support through the communities and linking with those who had not engaged previously and were further on the margins.  Thus there is a support system established there through the food bank system and that is an infrastructure from which other supports can be disseminated.  The Deputy is absolutely right that nobody would want to be doing that and we did not think we would be addressing food poverty at this scale across the country and in every community one can imagine.  It has highlighted much greater levels of deprivation in addition to the food poverty people presented with initially.</p></speech>

I have been involved in a number of them in my own County Kildare over a long period and have realised the great work they do on the ground.</p> <p>  I want to pick up on one aspect mentioned by the Chairman in his introduction of the representatives, namely, tackling isolation.  Maybe we could get some comments on what is happening there.  I am aware of a great group in County Kildare called Older Voices, which does great work in tackling isolation throughout all the socioeconomic groups and obviously that is the type of model I would like to see rolled out.  I am sure it is in other areas but not all.  That group has done some tremendous work over the period the pandemic has been with us.  Rural isolation, and indeed urban isolation, is there and we must tackle it.  The witnesses should comment on their thoughts on how we can tackle it in an ongoing way and whether additional funding is needed to do so</p> <p>  On food poverty, I brought this up the last day when the Society of St. Vincent de Paul appeared before us, but I am finding there are new groups starting up in a lot of towns and villages.  In some cases there are three or four groups competing with one another in some of these towns.  I realise the Minister has organised a working group and Mr. Saunders has spoken about that but obviously there is need for a national programme to co-ordinate this.  Taking in and totally supporting what Deputy Paul Donnelly has said, there are other issues at play here and we must tackle those first but at the moment there are so many groups around the country that we must co-ordinate them and I would welcome a comment on that.</p> <p>  Obviously, I support the work the local employment services have done and it is important to say they do great work, to acknowledge it and to support the witnesses' calls and those of all members in this meeting.  On the LEADER programme, Mr. Saunders mentioned animation and the animators we have and I am familiar with those.  It is very hard to get the funding.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has rightly said spend and somebody will send but sometimes it is very hard to get there.  Mr. Saunders commented that he was hoping those rules would change.  Maybe he could give a little detail on what he is hoping for because we would all echo those calls.  Anybody who has been involved in supporting community and particularly voluntary groups in filling in those forms would definitely support his calls that there be some changes in that regard.</p> <p>  I will mention some parochial stuff related to County Kildare once again and perhaps this is reflected throughout the country.  There is a perception when it comes to allocating funding, particularly in County Kildare, that it is a rich county - a K4 that has been there for a long time - I have mentioned before.  The witnesses might comment on how, within every county, there are pockets that need help.  As I said, LEADER and SICAP do great work in County Kildare but they need support and additional funding.  The Department must recognise that there are such pockets in every county, even if there is a perception that these counties are rich in some senses.</p> <p>  I have two final questions.  The training budget for the CE scheme is being raised with me a lot at the moment.  CE schemes are struggling at present and Mr. Saunders mentioned it in his opening statement.  He might comment on the benefits of that training scheme and what it does for CE schemes.  Finally, on SICAP, it has been mentioned that there has been a 50% reduction since 2008.  Obviously there is a lot of work that can be done in that regard.  What headline items can the representatives envisage and what could be done, were we to go back towards those 2008 figures?</p></speech>

One measure local development companies are looking at in particular concerns the fact that people who are not naturally connected within their community and who are experiencing isolation tend often to attend their GP.  In our local area of Mulhuddart, the GP tells us that there are people accessing her services who she has referred to our social prescribing programme.  This programme, which we have established, is evidence-based and shows that for people who are experiencing isolation, anxiety and low-grade depression, attendance at their GP actually reduces as they are connected with their local community.</p><p>The social prescribing programme meets with an individual who is referred by the GP, by other services, or as a self-refer.  It takes a person through a typical day and what that could be like, living in his or her own community and connected to all the community resources around him or her.  We find that is a very positive way of identifying what each individual needs in terms of isolation.  Sometimes, if there are many people in an area there is a sense of &ldquo;We need to form a group&rdquo;, but sometimes isolation is very person-centred.  Sometimes that person needs a bit of support along with the social prescriber, so his or her capacity to engage in a group or to connect with their local community around them is developed.  I am aware social prescribing is one measure already being run by the ILDN and many of our member organisations and companies throughout the country.  For that to be developed and expanded further would be very important.  I will hand over to Mr. Saunders to discuss the LEADER programme.</p></speech>

This has been a barrier to rapid roll out.  It has caused problems not just for the local development companies but also, as mentioned, for the applicants.  More and more we find we are assisting applicants to fill in their application forms and to get through the hoops they must jump through.</p> <p>  One positive on this is the notion of simplified cost options, SCO, which is a concept in place in other European countries.  In planning for the next programme, we are engaged with the Department of Rural and Community Development, going through some scenario planning on models of SCO that should decrease bureaucracy for the next programme.  We have put detailed proposals before the Department, and we have engaged in analysis on this, including the obstacles around some of the procurement processes and some of the administration hurdles.  They do need to be simplified.  At a general level we tend to subsume or take in EU regulations, maybe excessively or far too enthusiastically.  Certainly, across the EU, the LEADER programme is reporting increased bureaucracy, but not in all areas or to the same extent we have experienced.</p> <p>  We have been working with the Department.  The last programme initiated some basic reforms in that.  We are hoping for a better system the next time also.  Obviously, however, that is not all in our hands.</p> <p>  I accept 100% the point about pockets of disadvantage.  Poverty is everywhere and sometimes it is hidden.  We must remember that it morphs and changes also.  In the previous iterations it may have been called something different, and in the early days of the social inclusion programmes one of the big indicators of poverty was the presence of local authority housing in an area.  Today we know it is the housing assistance payment, which is prevalent everywhere.  Consider two housing estates, one next to the other.  One may be local authority housing and the other estate is HAP tenants.  To all intents and purposes, the socioeconomic profile and the income levels of the people are the exact same.  Those two estates in the two areas need to be treated the same in any kind of research or data presentation that will guide the programme.  The programme's own research, upon which it relies, needs to keep up to date with the changing levels of poverty, and to identify poverty at local level.  Our own companies and the staff in them are good at this.  They are adept and experienced at knowing and recognising these areas and making the appropriate connections, but we need the programme design to take it into account also.  I accept that point.</p> <p>  On community employment training, we would like to see the reinstatement of the training budget to the previous levels.  There is also an issue with participants between the ages of 21 and 25, who must be working towards a Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, qualification.  In some cases, their needs are for more basic, person-centred and unaccredited training.  This, however, is not counted in the system.  We have made the case for this reform in pre-budget submissions for successive years, and we will continue to do so.</p></speech>

It is extraordinary and shocking that we see people having to take up food from food banks, although it is great they are there.  In fairness to the Chairman, I have heard him speak on numerous occasions on the wastage of food every day in Ireland.  The amount of food that is wasted is shocking.</p> <p>  I apologise if my question was already answered in response to Senator Wall&rsquo;s very important point.  I am involved in a social service whereby five of us run a service, which is a really good system of getting meals out, mainly in a wide rural area, to vulnerable people.  The Chairman and Deputy Kerrane would also know about this.  We do about 600 meals a month.  There was an approach from a person with a food bank and who was involved in another area of food.  I would not say that person was encroaching, but my point is that ours is a fantastic service and we get huge support from the HSE, which helps to make a subsidised meal.  I do not think there is any point in anyone with a food bank, no matter how well-intentioned he or she is, encroaching on an area that is being well looked after.  I accept there may be one or two people in the system who fall through the net, but generally in our area and most areas, there are a lot of those HSE-funded programmes.  Has the development network had any contact with the HSE?  Is there any sort of coming together on that so we would have one, co-ordinated system and not have someone, no matter how well-intentioned he or she is, coming in on it?</p> <p>  I lend my support to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  Again, in the context of the rural area, when a family are gone away for whatever reasons, an older person may be on his or her own.  It may be a mother or father, an uncle or an aunt.  This is when it would be important to have somebody at the end of a phone when the person calls services.  My colleagues, especially those from the rural areas, will know that sometimes the answering machines not only frustrate older people, the machine actually upsets them.  It upsets people when they cannot have a direct contact.  As a society we all accept modernisation and how things move on, and we can all get frustrated with these machines, having to listen for ages waiting for a contact.  Imagine being an older person in that situation.  I know one person in recent months who needed an essential service.  We got it straightened out in the end, but she was two months suffering until she contacted me about it.  I am sure other colleagues have had the same thing.  It really is important we fight for that and that there is somebody at the end of a phone to answer people when it comes to many of these services, and I am referring to State services.  The Department of Social Protection is quite good at that but in some areas of essential services some people are falling through and not getting the contact.</p> <p>  I agree that the local employment services are vital and have done a huge job.  I would not like to see too much interference with them because they have an important role to play.</p> <p>  On CE schemes, the point has been made to me that people who have been on that scheme in the past year have done very little work due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  What is the possibility of that scheme being extended for one year for those people?  There will be an issue there for those workers.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment on that.</p></speech>

On the CE schemes issue, we found that it affects the CE scheme and T&uacute;s schemes.  As some schemes were frozen, people&rsquo;s time on them was extended, but it is not extended after the post-pandemic period.  Those people have not had the benefit of the experience the State offered to give to them through either a CE or a T&uacute;s scheme.  We would advocate, and have advocated, that those people&rsquo;s time on schemes should be extended.</p><p>That has not been acceded to yet but I agree 100% with what the Senator is saying.  Our position is that for those who are being accorded one year or three years on whatever scheme it is, if they have been denied that through no fault of their own, their time should be extended.</p><p> The Senator is correct that I did not address Senator Wall's comments about the duplication issue head-on.  The potential for duplication needs to be avoided at all costs.  As regards food poverty, food banks, meals on wheels and the introduction of new services, that needs to be co-ordinated when linking in with the HSE.  Our 49 local companies are well tapped into the current level of provision.  The entire orientation should be towards collaboration, supporting what exists and plugging gaps rather than moving in on activity that community groups are already covering adequately.</p></speech>

Senator Wall asked about an increase in the SICAP budget.  Nationally, SICAP supports 30,000 people annually and approximately 3,500 groups on average over the life of the programme.  All of the reports show that it is having a huge impact on the individuals themselves, as well as the communities we serve.  It is about doing more because there is obviously huge demand.  We are seeing demand for services post pandemic and coming out of lockdown.  The digital inclusion fund must be addressed and the SICAP infrastructure through the local development network is perfectly placed to address that.  Specific supports are also needed for people exiting the direct provision system, who will be integrating into communities around Ireland.  The local development network has tentacles in every community across Ireland so our infrastructure is well placed to do that.  I spoke previously about isolation but the opposite of that is people engaging in their communities and connecting with the communities around them.  We are looking at programmes like social prescribing, which speak to the heart of how people are connected with the people around them and the communities in which they live.  Those are the key areas we are looking at but demand for our services is growing and increasing, and that will be particularly true in the next few months.  We can see the evidence of that becoming very clear.</p></speech>

If others member wishes to come in with a supplementary question, I ask them to raise their hands.  I want to touch on two points in the presentation.  The first relates to this digital inclusion fund.  Ms O'Brien has frequently come back to this point during her contribution.  It is imperative that such a fund is established.  This issue has been brought to the fore during the Covid-19 crisis.  Notwithstanding the comments of Senator Murphy and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, there is an opportunity here with the development of technology.  Particularly with devices such as Alexa and so on, many older people are finding it far easier to engage with technology today than they were even 12 months ago.  Twelve months from now, when there is a substantial amount of fibre broadband across rural Ireland, that will change again.  This is an opportunity to develop new, innovative technologies that meet the needs of isolated communities.  As I said in my opening contribution, it is not just about people who are physically isolated in rural areas.  There are people isolated in Deputy Donnelly's constituency and many other urban constituencies.  They may be in a home with other houses around them but they are socially isolated and we need to reach out to them.  They cannot be ignored.  Bizarrely, funding for the digital training in which I invested substantially in my old Department was shut down during Covid-19, when it should have been ramped up.  The ILDN should go down the avenue of this digital inclusion model.</p> <p>  Mr. Saunders mentioned community employment training, which is a fundamental aspect of the community employment scheme.  We should be providing all possible available opportunities for training regardless of what type of training that is.  He picked up on the issue whereby people in the 21-25 age group have to do QQI training but young people who have fallen through the cracks and who have very poor literacy or numeracy skills are not going to be able to secure a QQI qualification.  In fact, it is a waste of public funding to put them through that process if they do not have the very basic skills to engage with society.  That is where the focus should start and I do not mean today or yesterday.  Agricultural colleges across the country have run literacy and numeracy courses for students in tandem with the green certificate courses.  This must be the fundamental building block to assist young people in getting out of that poverty trap.</p> <p>  I will let Deputy Donnelly in and then the witnesses can respond to both our questions.</p></speech>

When the pandemic came along, that changed fundamentally and a lot of the barriers and relationships that had been built up previously came down straight away.  Everybody recognised that the pandemic was something new and people did not know what was coming down the line so there was an air of wanting to help each other.  Is that approach still the same?  I fear that those barriers may be beginning to go back up among some of the organisations.  I just want to get a sense from the witnesses because they have a wide reach into the community right across Fingal, as well as with different State agencies.  I would appreciate if the witnesses could give me a sense of that.</p></speech>

Work was done on the food poverty issue with the dissemination of information through the local community development committees, LCDCs, as well as collaborative pieces with those partners addressing health inequality.  There were issues in accessing health services and the digital inclusion initiatives we ran supported people through that.  There is much closer collaboration between local development companies, HSE representatives and Department representatives on the LCDCs and the Community Call.  It is continuing.  The issue is not as urgent but longer pieces of collaborative work have definitely emerged from that.</p> <p>  There are two issues with embracing new technologies.  The first is inclusion, which relates to everybody.  Sometimes there is capacity to engage where connectivity, hardware and software are not an issue but very often in those cases with older people they also need the capacity to engage safely.  Work is needed around safety and engaging online but as well as the inclusion aspect there is also the issue of poverty, where the barrier to engaging online is the means to do it.  Poverty is a major issue when it comes to inclusion.  Following some of the work we have done where we included people by digital means, they are now engaging in education and training.</p><p>They are also engaging in parenting courses and inclusion activities online where previously transport was an issue and access was an issue for some people with disabilities.  Childcare was another typical barrier to engaging in group-based activities.  We have seen that a lot of people who would never have been able to access our services for a variety of reasons are now completely engaged.  It is correct to say that it is about embracing technology but all four components have to be accessible for everybody to be completely included.  Where hardware, software and connectivity are in place, knowledge and competency in engaging safely online are critical for everybody.</p></speech>

We have seen increased collaborations, which is one of the things that would be welcome from our perspective.  We develop collaborations both with new Departments and new sections in Departments.  We also work with other NGOs with which we did not necessarily have ongoing operational collaboration.</p> <p>  On a more philosophical level, this openness probably existed because everybody realised that this pandemic was new and that nobody had the rule book.  Therefore, none of us could presume that our own wisdom was necessarily the correct perceived wisdom.  The Deputy is probably alluding to the fact that some of that fundamental honesty may be slipping away but I hope not.  We have not seen evidence of that but we have the antennae well out for it.  The fact is that we were all in this boat together.  Nobody really knew who was steering the ship or in which direction it needed to go.  It was a leveller in that respect and we all had to be a little bit humble about our own little piece of expertise.</p> <p>  I note and concur with the observations made by the Chair on community employment training.</p></speech>

I agree that there is isolation and loneliness in urban areas.  I know that I probably homed in on rural areas but I fully accept that in constituencies such as the one Deputy Donnelly represents and in other big urban areas, it is also necessary to look out for people.  The point about technology was a fair one but there will still be a cohort of people who will not become technology friendly, particularly older people, so we need to look at how we can help them.  I admit that they have become handy with text messages, WhatsApp and some of them are using computers, as I see in my own home.  It is just a small cohort of people who might be left stranded, such as in the case I mentioned, particularly if they do not have family around them.  That can be a problem.  Technology has a huge benefit for people but we must get everybody working on and understanding that technology and in many cases we need to ensure that people are not afraid of it.</p></speech>

Picking up on Senator Murphy's contribution, he is right that we need to address a particular cohort of people for whom, for different reasons, technology is not suitable.  We also need to be honest and open-minded.  Older people are far more open to change and using technology than any of us could have contemplated in the past.  I recall seeing a local Senator recently calling out the numbers in an online bingo event where there were a considerable number of older people.  It was great to see the grandparents of grandchildren marking the bingo cards over the Internet, which I never thought I would see.  Technology can bring families together as well.  It is about trying to provide the innovative solutions that can meet the needs of all aspects of our society.  That is what all members of this committee are determined to do, regardless of where we come from and what our perspective is.</p> <p>  I ask Ms O'Brien initially and then Mr. Saunders to make a brief closing comment.</p></speech>

As has been outlined, there is an infrastructure in place, the tentacles of which reach into every single small area of the country.  There is an infrastructure that is able to deliver at scale and there is a possibility to dial up and dial down.  We have seen the breadth and range of local services we are providing in each and every community.  We are well positioned to take on national issues that are affecting large numbers of people across the country, looking at national policy, deciphering that and addressing how it can be best delivered in each local community and area, based on the individual needs that are identified in local areas.</p> <p>  We spoke about agility in terms of the pandemic.  The fact is that we are all governed by voluntary boards; we are a not-for-profit local and community-based organisation that has the potential for a national response to all issues affecting people in their community.  It is about ensuring the sustainability of the sector and the infrastructure of the local development network.</p></speech>

On Senator Murphy's observations, I agree that this is a people's business and our starting point is wherever people's starting point is as we try to bring them on a journey while also recognising their capacity.  The digital era has challenges and opportunities and we need to see those in a balanced way.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair and members of the committee.  The members who are on the call and those who are not have each individually taken an active interest in our work at local and national level over the past few months and that is reflected in the invitation we received to be here this morning.

Is it agreed that they are formally agreed and that no matters are arising?  Agreed.</p> <p>  This meeting has been convened with representatives from Facebook Ireland Limited, Twitter and TikTok in the sixth of our public hearings to discuss the general scheme of the online safety and media regulation Bill 2020.  I welcome the witnesses to the meeting, who will be joining remotely via Microsoft Teams.

As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statements on the website following the meeting.  I will call each organisation to deliver its opening statement in the following order.  We will first have Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin from Facebook, Mr. Ronan Costello from Twitter and then Dr Theo Bertram from TikTok.  Before I invite them to deliver their opening statements, which will be limited to three minutes per organisation and I ask the witnesses to please adhere to this as much as possible, I have some housekeeping to do and I hope they can bear with me.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  As our witnesses today are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus they should please note there are some limitations on parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity with legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in any such way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I also remind members of the constitutional requirement that members should be physically present in the confines of Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin in order to participate in the public meeting.  I will not permit a member to attend where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, if any member attempts to do so from outside the precincts they will be asked to leave the meeting.  I ask members to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the staff of the Debates Office preparing the Official Report.  I also ask them to mute their microphones when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback.  I ask them to use the "raise your hand" button when they want to contribute and, of course, to keep their mobile phones on silent or, better again, switched off.</p> <p>  Our guests are very welcome and we are eager and anxious to hear from them today.  As they know, the legislation we are working on is very important and their presence today will have a huge input into it.  They will be afforded three minutes per statement and then we will hand over to members who will have five minutes each.  If questions are directed to them, I ask the witnesses to be as concise as possible in their answers.  It would be much appreciated.  Please do not feel offended if I have to interrupt to keep the meeting very focused, which I intend to do.  I now invite Mr. &Oacute; Broin to make his opening statement on behalf of Facebook Ireland Limited.</p> <p>  As we have a technical glitch we will suspend the meeting for a few minutes to rectify it.</p></speech>

As members will be aware, Facebook has been calling for regulation of harmful online content since 2019.  We do not believe it should be left to companies such as ours alone to decide what should and should not be allowed to remain online.</p> <p>  Members may have had an opportunity to review our written submission, which contains our seven main recommendations for the Bill.  I do not intend to try to cover all of those points in the three minutes available to me.  Instead, I will focus on three key areas.  The first of these relates to the establishment and appointment of the regulator.  When the Government announced its intention to introduce legislation and appoint an online safety commissioner in March 2019, Ireland took a leadership role in the ongoing global debate on how to appropriately regulate harmful and illegal online content.  The rapid establishment of a fully resourced and staffed regulator is crucial for several reasons.  One of these is to ensure existing EU law is implemented, but another is to provide the research and evidence base for decisions to be taken by policymakers and legislators in Ireland.  In our submission, we call for the rapid establishment of an online safety commissioner and the prioritisation of existing EU online safety law.</p> <p>  The second point is that the safety of our users is a priority for us.  The idea that it is in our interest to allow harmful content on our platform is categorically untrue.  Creating a safe environment where people from all over the world can share and connect is core to our business model.  If our services are not safe, people will not share content with each other and, over time, will stop using them.  Advertisers do not want their brands associated with harmful content, and advertising is Facebook's main source of revenue.  For this reason, in consultation with subject matter experts for more than 15 years, we have developed policies, tools and a reporting infrastructure that are designed to protect all of our users.  We continue to evolve these policies and launch new safety features.  To give an example, recently there has been a focus on abuse directed at sportspeople and other public figures on Instagram.  Last month, we launched a message filter on Instagram which redirects abusive messages so people never have to see them.  This filter, which we hope will be effective in tackling this challenge, is rolling out on Instagram in Ireland now.</p> <p>  I commend the secondary school students who appeared before the committee recently to give evidence in respect of online bullying.  It has long been our view that while we will continue to play our part in addressing and removing this type of content from our platforms, online bullying requires a multifaceted, multi-stakeholder approach.  That is why we have invested heavily in Ireland&rsquo;s National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre in Dublin City University.  The centre&rsquo;s FUSE programme, which we are pleased to fund, takes an evidence-based approach to online safety and gives students, teachers and parents the tools to speak about and address online bullying.  As the Oireachtas Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science heard from the National Anti-Bullying and Research and Resource Centre last week, FUSE has, since its launch in 2018, has engaged with over 130 schools across all counties, with positive results.</p> <p>  I look forward to today&rsquo;s engagement and I hope to be able to respond to as many of the members&rsquo; questions as possible.</p></speech>

In this opening statement, I will provide our observations on the Bill while briefly discussing the international regulatory context and Ireland&rsquo;s unique role at this milestone of Internet governance.</p> <p>  The open Internet has been an unprecedented engine for economic growth, cultural development and self-expression.  At Twitter, we define the open Internet as a global and borderless digital space where anyone can freely access information and express themselves, and where businesses can start, innovate and compete with relative ease.  However, we believe this vision of the open Internet faces challenges that we all acknowledge, including Twitter and members of this committee.  Its fruits are being undermined by the consolidation of industry, the regression of civil and respectful discourse and the subversive spread of harmful disinformation.  Twitter asks that we approach the regulatory response to these challenges from a shared foundation in that the laws we make should protect, not diminish, the global and open Internet.  They should nurture fair competition, not choke it.  They should encourage diversity in approaches to content moderation.  They should mandate a degree of interoperability between services.  Institutions such as the EU and the Irish Government, which are now at the frontier of this new era, should be mindful that the regulatory models and penalties they enact will be exported across the world to service political agendas of all kinds.</p> <p>  With regard to the general scheme of the Bill, we wish to highlight three primary concerns.  First, the global and borderless nature of the Internet is best preserved by the establishment of regional and global standards that reflect its structure.  In our view, the harmonisation of regulatory standards will safeguard fair competition because companies of small to medium size will be better able to shoulder a single compliance regime.  Fragmentation benefits only the largest players.  As Ireland is part of the EU's digital Single Market, it should consider delaying the enactment of provisions that may overlap with proposals currently under development in the context of the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and similar initiatives at EU level.</p> <p>  With the proposals contained in the general scheme of the Bill, Ireland is setting a global benchmark.  We contend that several of the sanctions, as currently envisaged, create an unhelpful international precedent.  I refer specifically to the extent of proposed financial sanctions, the provision for service blocking and the criminal liability of senior management.  Already, we see countries imposing punitive financial penalties to make the business environment difficult for platforms with unwelcome positions on freedom of expression.  Service throttling and blocking are often used to limit citizen access to news, information and minority or opposition perspectives.  Non-compliance is met with custodial threats for company employees.  These actions challenge the foundational principles of a free Internet.  We humbly ask that Ireland acknowledge this unfortunate trend and reflect its support for the open Internet in the sanction regime set out in the general scheme.</p><p> Finally, with respect to the proposed financial sanctions, it should be recognised that there is a large cohort of platforms for which sanctions of the order of those set out in the general scheme would be an existential concern.  In the platform sector, content policy like that outlined is often competition policy by other means.  The implementation of equitable sanction regimes is a key part of promoting fair competition.  The alternative is a landscape too costly for all but the largest players.  I look forward to discussing the Bill with committee members today.</p></speech>

We are grateful for the opportunity to provide feedback to the committee on the general scheme of the Bill and I am happy to answer questions on any topics members may choose.  I am sorry that I cannot be there today in person.  It may not sound like it, but I am an Irish citizen thanks to my mum.  I have many fond memories of travelling to Dublin, not so much of the ferry crossing, but once I got there I always loved it.  Having worked in tech for the last decade or so, I am also proud that Dublin has become one of the most important global destinations for digital industry.  As the director of government relations and public policy for Europe for TikTok, I am very pleased that Dublin is a major global hub for our business.</p> <p>  For those who are not familiar with TikTok, it is a global, short-form video platform that provides its users with a vibrant, creative experience in a fun and safe environment.  Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy.  Since beginning our journey in Ireland, we have gone from strength to strength.  Our Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, Trust &amp;amp; Safety Hub established in Dublin in 2020 is led by Cormac Keenan, with many senior global leaders based here.  The hub is designed to enhance TikTok's localised approach to content policy while also supporting our ongoing objective to put safety at the heart of all that we do.  Members of the committee may have noted our recent announcement about our European transparency and accountability centre being based in Ireland, which will allow experts and policymakers like the committee members to come and see at first hand how we moderate and deliver content.  At least one committee member has been to our transparency centre in the US, at least virtually.  We also have a data privacy team based in Dublin, which is overseen by the Irish Data Protection Commission.  TikTok has hired more than 1,000 people in the past year, bringing its total headcount in Ireland to more than 1,100.  Our ambition is to continue growing.  We have also announced our intention to establish a data centre in Ireland.  This will involve a further $500 million investment that will create hundreds of jobs.</p> <p>  TikTok is dedicated to protecting its users from misinformation and disinformation on the platform.  In fact, we were one of the first platforms to create a Covid information hub dedicated to disseminating information from the WHO, and we are actively working with the Irish Government and Irish health authorities to build awareness of the importance of vaccines in the fight against Covid-19.</p> <p>  Youth empowerment and education is a huge focus for us, and our youth portal is a place where teens and parents can build their digital literacy skills as part of the growing TikTok community.  TikTok is also the lead sponsor of this year's St Patrick's Festival and we are contributing &euro;500,000 to various community aspects to this year's campaign to support local artists and live events.</p> <p>  Ensuring a safe online experience is of paramount importance at TikTok.  Our platform is designed to inspire creativity and joy, and we know people are at their most creative when they feel safe, and that is why we support the objectives of the draft legislation.  TikTok welcomes a systemic approach to regulation, one that looks at systems and processes rather than individual pieces of content.</p> <p>  TikTok is also encouraged by the commitment in the general scheme of the Bill to a proportionate, consistent and fair approach that recognises the different nature of regulated services and the rapidly evolving technological environment.  There is an important balance between online safety and protecting fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, and the enshrinement of democratic values within the proposed media commission's constitution is a positive step in that respect, helping to strike the right balance.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss these issues today and I look forward to answering any questions.</p></speech>

We have run out of time.  I thank all the witnesses who made presentations.  The overarching theme coming through is their support for this proposed legislation and for the commission, which I am thoroughly delighted to hear.  We will now take questions from members.  I call on Deputy Mythen.  He has five minutes for questions and answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.634" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1621" speakername="Johnny Mythen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021051900002#C00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  I welcome the submissions and look forward to their answers, as they are an integral part of the global communications network.</p> <p>  I will start with a general observation.  I do not think there is a public representative who has not had a friend or colleague harassed online or worried parents contacting our constituency offices to complain about their children suffering because of alleged abusive content published on one of the witnesses' social media platforms.  I know they are here to comment on the general scheme of the online safety and media regulation Bill.  I welcome that, but the public are rightly worried when existing protections are not fit for purpose.  The latter erodes people's confidence in any further protective measures, especially when they perceive global companies such as the ones before the committee are not acting in their full interests.</p> <p>  The witnesses stated they have worldwide experts in many fields working on their teams.  They all outlined the systems used to protect people who use their sites but there are ongoing and significant complaints about abuse, bullying and harassment on the platforms.  One of the consistent complaints we hear is the length of time it takes for this type of content to be removed.  What is the current timeframe and objective from when complaints are made to the removal of harmful content?  What mechanisms are in place in the organisations to protect staff, especially their mental health, because we know they have to go through a lot of disturbing and violent content?</p> <p>  Last week, we heard from the Children's Rights Alliance about the importance of an individual complaints' mechanism for the safety of young people online.  What is the perspective of each of the witnesses on that issue and could they explain the reason for it?</p> <p>  Could the witnesses also flesh out why they want to remove interpersonal communications services from the scope of the proposed legislation?  We know children and young people are accessing online platforms, including but not limited to violence, pornographic images and child sex abuse.  How is this content still accessible on the platforms?  At present, what steps are taken if a child is underage and how do they verify the age of users?</p></speech>

We have four and a half minutes so I will ask each of the witnesses to be as concise as possible in responding to the specific questions that have been asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.636" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021051900002#C00700"><p>There are quite a number of questions there.  I will focus on one or two and if I do not get to the answers now, I might get to them while replying to other members.</p> <p>  On the length of time involved, the goal is to get content which violates our community standards removed as quickly as possible.  We do not have a strict turnaround time on that.  Our goal is to get to it as quickly as possible.  With the advances we have made in artificial intelligence, AI, in recent years we are getting to a lot more content before it is even reported to us, but that is an ongoing process and we will continue to evolve and improve our services.</p> <p>  I wish to respond to the point about interpersonal communications services because that is important.  Currently, there is one line of justification in the general scheme.  Interpersonal communications services are being treated as just another category of service that the media commission should regulate, but we see them as being a very distinct category of service where there is a huge amount of existing Irish and EU law and ongoing judgments from the European Court of Justice on what private companies and what-----</p></speech>

I can jump in there.  I will address content moderation in general given that it was the first issue the Deputy raised.  I included an annexe in my opening statement that addresses some of this and goes to the heart of one of the things that Twitter wants to emphasise, in that we have been much more proactive in the past four or five years in reducing the burden on users to feel that all content moderation is initiated by them reporting content to us and that that is always the starting point of content moderation.  That is not the case at all any more and hopefully into the future that burden on users will reduce further.  At the moment, 68% of the content that we remove for violating Twitter's rules on abuse is proactively surfaced by machine learning.  This goes to a key point, which is that the most effective and scaleable way to do content moderation now and into the future &ndash; although user reports are always helpful from a contextual point of view &ndash; is to deploy machine learning in such a way that it gets better and better at identifying abusive behaviours.  Abusive behaviours are common to all accounts, they are spamming a particular person or they are spamming a hashtag to try to get a topic trending or something like that.  The better we can be at deploying machine learning and looking at abusive behaviours, the less the burden there will be on a user to report things to us and hopefully then the better their experience will be on the platform.</p></speech>

I think length of time is important.  It is right that the committee holds our feet to the fire on that.  I also believe, however, for our platform at least, that the number of views is probably even more significant.  A video that stays online for a few hours but is only seen by a small number of people is probably less impactful than a video that is online for a very short period but is seen by more.  That is how our moderation system focuses on where the views are going.</p><p> Welfare of moderators is a really important issue for us.  Ireland is one of the destinations for tech companies because of the great pool of talent there.  There is a highly competitive industry to attract that talent.  We want to be the best at it.  We provide a mixture of mental and physical wellness supports for our trust and safety workers.  We provide professional support, wellness talks around stress, a programme now around building resilience and whole different range of things.  I am happy to explain more.</p></speech>

I will move on to Senator Malcolm Byrne, who has five minutes.</p></speech>

I will preface my remarks by saying that social media companies can be a force for good.  We were able to see much of that during the course of the pandemic.  Today, however, we are primarily focusing on the question of online safety and how we combat online harm.</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Costello that we need to ensure democratic values are built into the Internet and into online expression and that we should not, in most instances, seek to curb freedom of expression.  Part of our responsibility is that with freedom of expression comes responsibility, however.  In the first instance, our role as legislators is to protect our citizens and those resident here in the online public space and, indeed, cyberspace.  I hope the witnesses would want to do that.</p> <p>  I will follow up on Deputy Mythen's question in order that we can get an idea of the scale of the challenge.  I have a number of questions and I will put them all together.  In the context of 2020, perhaps each of the witnesses might identify the number of individual complaints their companies received in Ireland, that is, complaints from individuals about content, and then the number of profiles they removed as a consequence.  I do not want percentages, I would prefer numbers.</p> <p>  I was conscious of Mr. &Oacute; Broin's point, as covered in the media this morning, around delays to the legislation and addressing the importance of the online safety commissioner.  From a Fianna F&aacute;il point of view, we are talking about asking the Minister to establish the office of the online safety commissioner immediately on a non-statutory basis.  In other words, that office would acquire powers as time passes.  Specifically, if we establish the office of the online safety commissioner on a non-statutory basis here, would each of the companies fully co-operate with it?</p> <p>  I will turn to the question of anonymous accounts and bots, which is obviously an area of concern, and the question of ensuring that individuals are able to identify themselves.  This is in reference to digital identifiers.  Down the line, we may be able to use blockchain and so on to do this.  I refer, however, to using a system whereby somebody must prove his or her identify either directly to the companies or through a digital intermediary.</p> <p>  Mr. Costello might tackle my final question on the challenge around multiple accounts because it is more directed at Twitter.  He spoke about using machine learning and so forth, which is very important.  In a situation where, for instance, an individual is operating nine Twitter accounts or if some individual seems to be linked to multiple accounts, perhaps coming from outside the State from somewhere like Belgrade, for example, do alarm bells sound in Twitter?  Most of us might operate our own Twitter account and possibly a business account or one or two others.  I do not know how some people have time to operate multiple accounts.  Surely, there is a system of alarms whereby Twitter would immediately look into tackling a situation like that.</p></speech>

I ask our guests to be as direct as possible in the answers to the questions they are asked.  I will begin with Mr. Costello on this occasion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.645" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Costello" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021051900002#D00500"><p>That is no problem.  I am happy to jump in there.  I will first address the questions that were directed at us regarding pseudonymity and such.  The key issue here is that pseudonymity is often conflated with abuse.  It is not a precursor or a prerequisite to people being abusive online.  From a Twitter point of view, more specifically, it is not a shield against our rules.  For the purpose of enforcing our policies, Twitter's approach to real name accounts and pseudonymous accounts is exactly the same.  A violation is a violation, no matter the account's identity.</p> <p>  As I mentioned previously, which addresses the Senator's earlier point about people having multiple accounts, which may be engaging in abusive behaviour, our focus is on how the account is behaving, not on the identity the account may have, although that is a data point we can take into consideration.  The Senator mentioned, for example, that we can identify one account, which is reported to us by a user or by a trusted partner or non-profit organisation, and then detect if it is connected to several others.  That would be a violation of our multi-account abuse policy.</p> <p>  The key point here is that pseudonymity is not a shield against our rules.  It does not protect someone from the enforcement mechanisms we have because the enforcement mechanisms are so focused on how accounts behave rather than how they appear.</p></speech>

I will be happy to write to the committee with the numbers.  On the online safety commissioner, we are very happy to work with the committee on that and to explore what co-operation means.</p> <p>  There is anonymity and there is accountability.  The crucial thing is that we have accountability for all our users so that if someone does something that is in breach of our rules or if he or she breaks the law, we are able to identify that person.  I do not think that means a person cannot be anonymous as long as he or she is accountable.  We are in some ways a different platform to the other companies in that ours is a video-driven platform.  A person with a video camera to his or her face might be less likely to be anonymous, which is harder to do, and hopefully, less likely to drive that conflicting and controversial content.</p></speech>

I will try to be as brief as possible.</p> <p>  On the Senator's question around user reports, I do not have the figure.  We publish, on a quarterly basis, the amount of content we remove in each of the categories of our community standards and the portion that is discovered before a user reports it to us.  Again, a key focus is prevalence and how much of this content is actually being viewed on our platforms.</p> <p>  Establishing the online safety commissioner immediately on an administrative basis would be a very good signal to send not just to everyone, but also, in particular, to other member states.  It would signal that Ireland is taking the leadership role presented by the audiovisual media services, AVMS, directive and taking a very proactive approach to regulation in the space.  We would be very keen to co-operate with such a body immediately.</p> <p>  There is a balance to be struck on the point of anonymity.  The approach we take is that we have a real name policy.  If a user or anyone has any doubt around whether somebody is not who they say they are, he or she can report it and we will verify the identity of the individual.</p></speech>

As has been stated, we are setting a global benchmark with this proposed legislation so it is important that we get it right.  I welcome the companies' opening statements and commitments.  I also welcome the financial support that Facebook is giving to the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre, but I do not feel it is sufficient.  Social media, as it evolves, influences the lives of young people in the country.  In that context, the platforms need to take more responsibility and ensure they are a safe place for our teenagers.  Last year, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, brought forward legislation, the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act, that is very welcome but tighter regulation and greater education from the platforms themselves is urgently required.  It has a serious impact on the mental health of the younger generation, especially teenagers.  Are the three companies willing to contribute to a national campaign, in conjunction with the Department of Education, across all schools immediately that will educate pupils about the threats and abuse that exist online and that will do so when they are at a young age?  There is a responsibility on them, as companies that are making money from these platforms, to fund such a campaign.</p> <p>  I was disappointed with the comment about the open Internet.  I do not believe we can have an open Internet, and that is the problem.  There is a responsibility on the companies regarding the information on there.  Take the newspapers or radio stations, any information or news they put out, they have the responsibility to stand over it being 100% factually correct.  In recent months, even journalists who have had articles printed are there to be abused and threatened online, which shows that we, as a country, are going in a bad direction.  There is a serious responsibility on the companies.</p> <p>  Senator Malcolm Byrne mentioned anonymous accounts.  That is an issue we need to look at.  As politicians, all of us are trolled by fake accounts every day of the week and abused and threatened whenever we put anything online.  The companies have a responsibility to deal with that.  One contributor mentioned a multi-account abuse policy.  Will our guests explain this and how it is implemented?</p></speech>

If we can work together as industry, Government and the NGO sector and child safety organisations, which have most expertise in the area, it would be a very good idea.  The Senator is right that education and prevention is key to tackling online bullying.  I also agree that we have responsibility in that regard too.</p></speech>

DCU's FUSE programme is available to all schools free of charge.  It has been rolled out to 130 schools to date.  One thing I was struck by last week was when of the student contributors stated that only 40% of students surveyed were aware that you could report material online.  It is obviously on us to increase awareness of how to report content online.  The FUSE programme is available to all schools.  I think DCU reached out to the schools that were before the committee to offer the programme to them.  All schools should get in touch with DCU.  There is an idea of everyone working together, namely, us, taking our responsibility very seriously and showing what we can bring to the table, NGOs, as Dr. Bertram mentioned, and everyone else.  That is how we can make real progress.</p></speech>

You cannot have one without the other.</p> <p>  On politicians' experience on the platform, we absolutely appreciate that this is a challenge, in Ireland and in every other country where our platform operates around the world.  On the specific question of multi-account abuse, this goes to our focus on the behaviour of abusive accounts.  If we detect that an individual or individuals are running several accounts with the sole purpose of distorting the conversation by manipulating hashtags or abusing others, that sets off behavioural signals for us that indicate it is something that should be looked at.  That is why my statement mentioned that 68% of the content in the accounts that we ultimately remove from the platform are proactively surfaced by machine learning because the machine is able to detect those kinds of behavioural signals.   We absolutely appreciate that.</p> <p>  As a result of the fact that we are cognisant of the experience of people like the Senator and those in high-profile positions who may have overwhelming notifications at times, we are experimenting with features such as safety mode, which was discussed a couple of weeks ago at a company event.  By using behaviour-based analysis, we may be able to detect that an account is getting an awful lot of incoming messages and safety mode would enable the account to automatically block incoming messages from accounts it is not familiar with or that the owner does not follow and that do not follow the owner.  In other words, where there is no reciprocal mutual relationship.</p></speech>

I have three questions on areas of interest to me.  The first relates to content moderation, which is a huge area in the context of online safety.  What led TikTok to decide to keep content moderation in house?  Why does Facebook think it is acceptable to outsource content moderation?  What are Facebook's thoughts regarding practices whereby employees of the outsourced services must sign non-disclosure agreements about their work?  When we discuss things such as online safety, it is very hard to get a clear picture of what is happening if some of the people at the coalface are unable to talk about it.</p> <p>  Last week, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, was before the committee.  It stated that online platforms are effectively facilitating bullying because nothing is done when complaints are made or that there is a really long period between when complaints about content are made and action being taken.  The ISPCC gave the example of a mother trying to get content about her child taken down.  It took months, if not over a year, for that content to be removed.  What do the witnesses say in respect of the claim that the platforms are effectively facilitating bullying because it takes so long to get action on complaints?</p> <p>  My final question is for TikTok.  What is it doing at an algorithm level to prevent harm?  What are its engineers or operations doing with the algorithm?  I am an out LGBT community member.  I follow LGBT TikTok accounts, that is what I am interested in.  Transphobic and anti-trans material is pushed at me all the time.  I report that material.  What is TikTok doing because it seems to me that the algorithm is not working.  I do not want transphobic content, I am a member of the LGBT community.   What machine learning or training is being done to mitigate harm?</p></speech>

As I mentioned, our emphasis on proactivity in content moderation has been developed over recent years and will continue to be developed in the future, such that the burden on users to initiate the reporting process to us is increasingly reduced.  If we can train an algorithm or use machine-learning techniques to better identify abusive behaviours on the platform, such as toxic interactions and so on, we will be better able to tackle how people are exposed to content and how low-quality content appears or is amplified on the platform.  In doing so, we hope that we can encourage and promote a constructive and healthier public conversation on Twitter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.668" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Theo Bertram" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021051900002#F00300"><p>On content moderation, we use both in-house and outsourcing.  We are very proud of our in-house work.  For both the outsourcing and in-house elements, we have requirements regarding wellness and welfare.</p> <p>  I heard the ISPCC's testimony and found it really moving and compelling.  It identified a particular problem.  In the example of the 13-year-old girl the CEO highlighted, he was pointing out that the problem with bullying is that it can be difficult to spot.  It is not instantly visible to one moderator.  It is one thing when we look at an account in the round, in an holistic way, but what happens when someone is doing one thing on one platform, one thing on another, and a third thing on another platform again?  From the point of the platforms, they do not see that broad picture, which is why the CEO of ISPCC, as I understood his case, was saying that something needs to be done for that.  We believe that the solution for us is something we are developing called the community partner channel, which is about trying to get organisations, such as, I hope, the ISPCC, to come in and give us that holistic view.  Nevertheless, I recognise there is an issue we all need to address and it is a challenging one.</p> <p> Finally, on the algorithm, I do not think I have enough time to do justice to the question in this short session.  I would love to talk to the committee about it in more detail.  While homophobic comments in any form are not allowed on our platform, we go beyond that.  We do not just ban anti-LGTB, homophobic or hateful ideas but also do not allow, for example, any content that promotes conversion therapy.  Similarly, the idea that no one is born LGBTQ+ is not allowed on our platform either.  The way the algorithm works is a really interesting challenge.  One thing we want to try to do and learn as a second-generation company is not to build filter bubbles.  We are not just going to give users content that is always exactly the same as the things they have previously agreed with.  We seek to diversify the content, but that should never promote to the user homophobic content-----</p></speech>

We are aware of the hearing of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment last week on this question and I think it was also discussed by that committee again this morning.  I am happy to share a copy of the letter we sent in response to the T&aacute;naiste when he wrote to us outlining the concerns that had been expressed to him.  We have also written the Health and Safety Authority and are happy to engage with that regulatory body, or, indeed, any regulatory body in Ireland, in regard to the issue.  Based on the hearings last week, it may be the case that we will be invited to appear before the enterprise committee to discuss the issue with our partner companies, but that invitation has not yet arrived.</p></speech>

We all use our guests' platforms to get our messages across.  In the context of some of the great social events and movements in recent years, social media has been used really effectively.  On issues such as the marriage equality referendum and climate action, social media platforms have played a really important role.  On the other hand, there is what Senator Hoey outlined, namely, the toxic abuse that happens online.</p> <p>  My first questions are for Mr. Costello.  Some of the horrible anonymous online abuse aimed at journalists in recent weeks has come to the fore.  These are journalists who are just doing their job and they are subjected to harmful anonymous abuse.  It is really important that journalists be allowed to use these platforms to get across accurate information and news.  How can we counteract the abuse they get from anonymous accounts?  Mr. Costello might also respond to Senator Malcolm Byrne's question on the scale of the problem and the number of videos that have been taken down.</p> <p>  Turning to Mr. &Oacute; Broin, I presume I can ask questions specific to Instagram and WhatsApp since, as I understand, they are part of the same company.  Online bullying in WhatsApp groups is very prevalent and I imagine it is much more difficult to moderate because what are almost chain messages are sent on from group to group or person to person.  Screenshots are often taken and sent between groups.  How is that counteracted?  Is there a method of regulating and monitoring it?  This is an important issue.  Instagram has become a platform used for the spread of misinformation, more so than the others.  I refer, in particular, to the vaccine roll-out and the effectiveness of vaccines.  Instagram account holders with quite large followings are unchecked, unmonitored and unregulated in how they spread misinformation.  These are not just expressions of opinion but rather false information that is contrary to public health.  How can that be counteracted?</p> <p>  My final questions are for Dr. Bertram.  I could be wrong, and he can contradict me if that is the case, but I assume that TikTok is one of the most popular platforms with the younger generations, and particularly those who are still in school.  Dr. Bertram may have heard that when secondary schools students appeared before the committee, they asked for safe online behaviour, to protect against harmful material, to be taught to them by online activists.  Would it be possible for the likes of TikTok to reach out to these online activists and resource them in order that they can visit schools and teach students about safe online behaviour?  As Dr. Bertram may have heard, the students who appeared before the committee do not believe that parents or teachers have that connection.</p></speech>

At TikTok, we already work with a large number of creators to help create safety videos.  If I could tie in this suggestion with that which was made earlier, perhaps there is something we can do with TikTok creators in Ireland to help build a set of videos that give support for how to stay safe online for all schools in Ireland.</p></speech>

They are excellent young people who engage with other young people in this space.  It is worth looking into their work.</p> <p>  On misinformation, even before the start of the pandemic, we worked with the HSE to identify what we could do to support getting out authoritative messages that supported their campaigns.  On both Instagram and Facebook, we have also financially supported the Department of the Taoiseach's campaigns.  We address the issue by removing misinformation that can lead to real-world harm, such as claims that drinking bleach can cure Covid.

In that way, we are trying to educate and inform people about what the facts are.  That is why we have the Covid-19 information hub, which contains all the authoritative information.  It is not just we have done that, this is an ongoing thing.  We are working with health authorities around the world, so if there is a new trend or piece of evolving content which is of concern to them, we will react to that.  It is incredibly important.</p> <p>  WhatsApp, as an end-to-end encrypted service, is different.  It falls within that category of communication service I was talking about at the outset.  As an end-to-end encrypted piece, it is more difficult because it cannot be seen.  Only the sender and the receiver have access to it, but there are reporting tools in place in there.  We can keep taking down content, but it comes back to addressing the wider issue and working with the NGOs, the committee, school and academics.  The FUSE programme is one example of that.  I am sure there are other programmes out there.</p></speech>

It is a challenge in Ireland and in all countries where Twitter has a presence.  It is a challenge because those individuals are in high-profile positions and are putting content out there which gets a reaction, and some of that reaction is absolutely unacceptable.  We want to be as proactive as possible to reduce the burden on politicians and journalists to be the ones who feel they have to reach out to us before something is done about that.</p> <p>  Both they and the users who follow them benefit from Twitter, because of their presence on it.  Twitter is uniquely political in its content.  It is uniquely full of journalism and journalistic content.  The more proactive we can be in that respect and the more of a burden we can take off those users, the better, through machine learning and all of these tactics we are trying to deploy and get better at.</p></speech>

If Deputy Munster will allow me, within the legislation, there is this idea of a super complainant scheme which would allow for NGOs, as they do with us, to bring trends or themes they are seeing to the regulator.  It is inevitable the regulator will use that as the basis for its investigations and audits on our services.  That is where one is likely to see more improvement, in terms of looking at how the complaints system works across the board, what the policies are, how the content is removed etc.</p> <p>  It comes down to the question of the effectiveness of the regulation.</p></speech>

We made the announcement in March 2019 of our intention to move our messaging services towards an encrypted basis and since that time, we have been engaging with law enforcement and NGOs around the world, which have expressed concerns about how effective our enforcement tools will be in that environment.  We have not just launched this product or made the switch.  We are engaging with people, because we want to hear their concerns and understand how we can improve the prevention of harm.

I absolutely agree the Bill and the law, when passed, should have sanctions which are meaningful and effective, otherwise that would be a problem.  Our issues with the sanctions, as currently defined, can be split into two categories.  The first would be the international precedent.  Unfortunately, we are seeing a trend internationally whereby sanctions in terms of the throttling and blocking of services and the criminal liability of senior management are incorporated into legislation in countries around the world and they are often used as the first point of call when platforms are deemed not to be compliant with a piece of legislation.</p><p>When countries in the EU or further afield pass laws with such models, they are often exported to other countries, which then point back to the EU and say that because a country there did it, it should be fine for that them to do it too.  Unfortunately, however, the laws are enforced in a different way, with different political agendas and different motivations.</p><p> The other issue we have with, for example, financial sanctions is the potential that they would present an existential issue for start-up platforms or SMEs that are trying to establish themselves, or even platforms that are well known but may not have the same commercial success or footprint as the largest platforms.  There is a concern that those financial sanctions should be proportionate and certain thresholds should be met before they are implemented.</p></speech>

I was speaking in the D&aacute;il.  I happen to think that the concept of social media is quite positive in that it has given us a level of communication which, in my early life, I certainly did not think would be possible in the early 21st century.  I believe it does more good than harm in society.  I may be unusual in that but it is a view I have always held.  That is why it is exceptionally important for those who provide the ever-evolving array of social media platforms, reaching out and connecting to an ever-increasing number of people, both here in Ireland and throughout the world, to act responsibly.</p> <p>  If we place a significant value in the sense of the communicative power that social media affords people, particularly as it allows for voices that did not previously have a role in shaping society, policy and, ultimately, the way humanity evolves, the we must reach the conclusion that social media has been exceptionally powerful in giving voices to people who did not have them 20 or 30 years ago.  The Irish political landscape was essentially denuded of the voice of the individual and social media has done very important work in allowing people to have their say in how our country and our world develop.  That is why it is so important that when people engage in social media, they can trust they are entering an environment that is as safe as possible, on a par with the normal engagement that takes place outside of social media, and that they and their rights be sufficiently protected.  Ireland should lead the way here.  We should be very proud that a number of the world's largest social media companies have decided to base themselves here.  I am very supportive of the proposed legislation, which will, as best it can, create that safe environment, particularly for young people who find themselves in a space that is often challenging because of bullying and so on.</p> <p>  Our guests are representative of the social media industry, if we can call it that.  Do they acknowledge that there is an issue with providing a safe environment online?  How do they propose that we resolve it?  Legislation is necessary - I have no doubt about that - but my fear has always been that when legislation such as that proposed is brought forward, the pendulum swings much too far in the other direction.  Those very voices I mentioned, which can often call power or the performance of a government into question, may be silenced or suppressed.  How can we strike the balance between creating a safe environment where normal, respectful discourse can take place while, at the same time, not shutting down those voices that need to be heard and have been heard throughout the world in places, for example, where there has been terrible conflict?  Social media has been the only mechanism for people to reveal to the world the kinds of atrocities that have been committed in certain places throughout the world.</p> <p>  How can we strike that balance?  Will the proposed legislation before us do so?  I recall legislation put forward five years ago which was designed to criminalise people who cause offence on social media, but who can determine what offence is?  Who will be the arbiter of what is or is not in good taste, or what causes or does not cause offence?  These are big questions we have to ask ourselves in the context of how we should regulate social media in future.  I would like to hear our guests' views on how to strike that balance.  For me, it is the big question regarding what we are proposing to do here.</p></speech>

I will not go over it because I would not be able to put it as eloquently as he did.  There are two key issues.  The more objective we can be in defining what harms are, the better.  As the Deputy said, we have to think of the marginal voices, not just the majority.  There will be important cases where we may not remove certain content from the platform because we are protecting voices that are uncomfortable for some people to hear but where it is important that they are heard.  It is difficult to say what level of exposure teenagers should have to difficult content that deals with, for example, abortion and issues such as that.  The question is how we should protect them from that but also how we can ensure they are educated about those issues.  These are all difficult questions, involving balancing different sets of rights and so on.  It is about objectivity and always ensuring that marginal voices are protected.</p></speech>

It is a really important issue.  To return to Senator Malcolm Byrne's comment on establishing a regulator on an administrative basis, that would be very positive.</p> <p>  Striking a balance is something we have been working on for 15 years.  A recent example relates to the decision of the external oversight board regarding Donald Trump.  The balancing of fundamental rights on both sides of that argument is very difficult to achieve.  In introducing regulation, we should not seek to silence one group or stifle debate.  Debate, and the exchange of views to which it gives rise, is very positive.  We think the general scheme of the Bill allows the regulator the play a role whereby it would have oversight of the systems, ensure we are doing everything we can in regard to fairness and impartiality and keep our users safe.</p></speech>

The reason I emphasised the point on international precedent is because I agree that Ireland is uniquely placed at the moment.  It is in a great position to set a benchmark for how the Internet is governed and regulated.  It is a point of pride for the industry, and even for me to be talking about the issue.  It is for that reason it is so important that Ireland seek to strike the balance that was talked about and to pursue objectivity, in both how it views how content should be moderated and how it views the industry.  Whatever legislation is produced at the end of this process should work for companies of all sizes.  Three companies are represented at this meeting but there are many thousands of others that have many different content moderation models that are not represented here, such as Reddit, Wikipedia and so on, which pursue community moderation.  We are experimenting with that ourselves.</p> <p>  I echo the comments of the other contributors and agree regarding the points on objectivity and balance.</p></speech>

I apologise that I missed some of the meeting.  I was speaking in the D&aacute;il.  The issue I am about to raise may already have been covered.</p><p>When I was verifying my Twitter account, I had to go through the verification process.  When I was seeking to verify my official Facebook account, I had to provide my passport and other information.  Why is that not a standard requirement for all users?  Certainly, the vast majority of the abuse I have received online over the years has been from anonymous accounts.  There is a mechanism in place to remove anonymous accounts.  Why is that not being done?</p></speech>

First, in respect of verification on Twitter, it has been around for several years now.  It is there to authenticate and confirm that a person is who they say they are.  Hopefully, over the next couple of months, users will see us roll out developments in that area.  For example, the public verification process will be reopened so that increasing numbers of individuals can apply for verification and can verify that they are who they say they are, and also that a real individual is behind the account.  That will go some way towards addressing the issue.</p> <p>  We are also nuancing what verification means by potentially rolling out different kinds of labels to enable a user to verify that they are acting as an organisation or a company, an individual, a Government representative, a State-backed media entity, etc. This endeavour to nuance verification labels and to confirm identities is something that we are definitely undertaking at the moment.  Hopefully, users will see some progress on that which will mitigate some of the abuse that people perceive is coming from anonymous accounts.</p></speech>

If I went into a town hall meeting with a cloak over my face and started to abuse everybody there, I would be taken and put outside the door immediately.  Twitter has been around for more than ten years.  Why has it taken until 2021 for this development to be announced?</p></speech>

A person's identity on Twitter has no bearing on the accountability that they have when we enforce our rules.  If someone is engaging in abuse, they will be bounced from the platform and the content they have posted will be removed because it is a violation of our rules that they behaved in that way in the first place, regardless of the identity under which they did it.  To use Dr. Bertram's phrase, there is anonymity and there is accountability, and one is not a shield to the other.</p></speech>

Just last week, I reported a number of cases of abuse just to see what would happen and, as I expected, Twitter did not see any problem with the abuse that was reported.  Twitter's systems just do not work.  It should stop trying to pull the wool over people's eyes.  What is going on is a disgrace and Twitter has been presiding over it for years.  It is not good enough.</p></speech>

Today, Twitter made the same call as Facebook and requested that the proposed legislation to be delayed until the enactment of the EU Digital Services Act.  The Digital Services Act does not make any major policy changes in the harmful content area.  Therefore, I do not see how a delay would have any impact whatsoever.  Any amendments that may be needed could be made at any time in the future.  The call for a delay is contradictory to Facebook's white paper on charting the way forward on online content regulation, which makes strong calls for states to regulate platforms.  Indeed, Mr. &Oacute; Broin stated that Facebook has been calling for this for many years, that it should not be left to social media companies alone and that there should be regulation.  That is completely at odds with how Facebook has lobbied the European Commission over many years on privacy and the code of conduct on hate speech.  What Facebook is telling us here publicly is not what it sought when it lobbied hard behind closed doors against regulation.  That is quite contradictory.  I feel that the call to delay this legislation is essentially what Facebook might get away with publicly.  I would appreciate a comment on why we should delay this legislation.</p></speech>

I was also confused by the headline on RT&Eacute; this morning.  Coming back to our position on this legislation, if the fully resourced and staffed media commission could be established today, we would be more than happy to engage with it on both the AVMS directive aspects and on national legislative measures right across the board.  There are aspects of it, such as the requirements on interpersonal communication services, which we do not think are feasible to implement.  However, what we are saying is that given that we are where we are now, and the Digital Services Act is coming down the track, and from the timeline that I have set out it is likely that it could be in place before the media commission is fully staffed and this legislation is fully implemented, the priority should be to implement the EU online safety law that was agreed in 2018 and to focus on that.  We have identified 17 areas in respect of which the Digital Services Act and the digital services co-ordinator's role are likely to overlap with the role which is set out in the general scheme of the Bill.  It might be more prudent and a more efficient use of resources-----</p></speech>

In fact, online safety legislation in Britain has been delayed by the British Government.  It has been suggested that Mark Zuckerberg threatened to pull investment from the UK.  Records from a 2018 meeting show that he might look elsewhere in Europe to invest.  We have seen the legislation be delayed there.  I do not appreciate the call to delay this most important aspect of the proposed legislation and to focus on the AVMS directive instead.</p></speech>

The European Commission spokesperson has confirmed that not only will the Digital Services Act address illegal online content, but it will also address the systems that platforms have in place for harmful online contact.  Therefore, given that the Digital Services Act is coming down the track, it may be more prudent to focus on that.  If the Government and the members decide to progress with the proposed legislation before us, we simply ask that a separate part of the legislation be created so that the national measures and the European-wide measures could separated out so that there is clarity for citizens in Ireland and those in the EU in respect of their rights and the requirements that are placed on service providers.</p></speech>

The future commission may want to standardise the transparency reporting of social media companies and could ask for the reports to be in the form national reports or state reports.  Currently, the companies publish these statistics in the manner in which they wish.</p><p>Would our guests welcome a standardised transparency reporting system?</p></speech>

In the past year and a half, we launched a dedicated transparency reporting website.  Ideally, every six months, if not more often in the future, updated transparency reports should be on the website, covering not only the legal requests that the company has received and how it has handled them, but also enforcement of our rules, including information about how many accounts we have actioned for violating rules around abuse, harassment, etc.</p> <p>  With respect to the commission requiring certain transparency measures, we would obviously comply with that.  If that is the law in the EU, we will comply with that, no problem.  I would say, however, and this goes to regulators making space for different approaches to content moderation, that if reporting is standardised and the figures and data points we are required to disclose are standardised, that necessarily puts different companies up against one another in a monolithic way.  For example, a large company may have a huge volume of enforcement actions that it has taken and, therefore, smaller companies that approach content moderation in different ways may appear in a negative light by comparison.  There has to be a recognition that different companies have different approaches to policies, content moderation and transparency.</p></speech>

This Bill concerns the regulation of all media.  The main thing I noted in our guests' opening statements was that they touched a lot on advertising and their business models.  Advertising and its regulation can be as prominent in terms of online harm.  The Press Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Feeney, stated that social media is sucking away the resources from newspapers and traditional media as sites such as Facebook draw readers' attention to a newspaper story that is read online.  The newspaper receives no revenue from the reader but Facebook receives the online review.  I agree with the ombudsman's view.  Traditional newspapers that do all the news reporting and employ journalists saw their advertising revenues fall through the floor last year because of the pandemic.  Advertising revenues have fallen by over &euro;300 million for the national titles in this country, from a high in 2007 of approximately &euro;375 million to approximately &euro;60 million last year.  Google and Facebook secured advertising revenue of &euro;425 million in this space in 2019.  How much did the platforms each of our guests represent receive in advertising revenue last year?  Do they agree with a system whereby the social media companies pay the print and television companies for monetising their news content that is posted to the social media platforms?  If social media suck the life out of traditional media, as the ombudsman stated in his report published last year during the pandemic, the sanity, calmness and objectivity of traditional media will be gone and a wasteland will be left behind.</p> <p>  On the issue of advertising and harmful online content, I agree with Professor Conor O'Mahony, the children's affairs special rapporteur, who said this Bill does not go far enough in tackling the meaning of "online harm" in particular areas such as online gambling.  A serious amount of money is spent online by gambling companies on different platforms.  Ms Tanya Ward from the Children's Alliance has spoken about the harm of online advertising by cosmetics companies.  Do any of the companies our guests represent target marketing to children under 16?  Would they agree with a code that bans advertising targeted at under 16s?  Can we start with the representative of Facebook on those four questions and can I get a concise answer to each of my questions?</p></speech>

I can get the advertising revenue number for him and send it on.  There is a fundamental misunderstanding as to how content appears on our platforms.

This issue has been tackled in Australia and our guests know that governments are looking at this.  If the traditional media are dead, social media companies are not going to write the news.  It was a fair question.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Broin agree with a system whereby social media companies would be paying for the monetising of news content online?</p></speech>

We are exploring ways in which we can work with news organisations around the world.  We have done it in the UK and it is rolling out in Germany now.  The US was the first place in which we rolled out a news tab whereby we have made deals with publishers for specific content that appears in that news tab.  It is not the case that we are averse to such a system, that we are walking away from it and throwing our hat in the air.  However, a system must be put in place that recognises where the value is added and how the online ecosystem works.  That is why I was trying to make the point at the beginning about how the content appears on the platform.  We must figure out how to monetise the traffic that is diverted off our platforms onto the news media sites.  That is where the crux of this will be and the news media organisations that figure out how to harness the power of that traffic will come out with a sustainable business model.</p></speech>

I will flag a couple of issues.  I do not think we are involved in the conversation the Senator was having with Mr. &Oacute; Broin but over the past couple of weeks, we have announced that we are going to offer journalists and news organisations the means by which they can generate revenue directly from their Twitter accounts.  People can pay them directly for the work they are producing.  Over the next couple of weeks and months, we will be introducing ways for journalists, news organisations and organisations of all kinds to introduce tiered subscriptions such that a user can have super followers who pay for exclusive access to content that is distributed through Twitter.  In that sense, we are trying to find ways to encourage and reward the people who get the most value from, and contribute the most to, Twitter.</p></speech>

On advertising revenue, we are a much younger company than the others represented today so we are at a much earlier stage.  I do not think we have published our accounts in Ireland yet but when we do, I will be happy to share them.  I cannot give the committee those numbers yet.</p> <p>  We are a platform with 15-second videos.  Some of the things the Senator described are more common on text-based platforms where that content is shared.  We absolutely want to build a sustainable long-term relationship with the news industry.  We are just at the very start of engaging with news providers to work out how they can put their content on our platform and how we do that in a long-term, sustainable way.  We must have a well-financed news industry and I hope we can play a part in that.</p></speech>

I thank our witnesses for joining us.  As my time is limited, I want to hear from each of them and get an understanding of their positions on what Deputy Griffin touched on, that is, online anonymity and the anonymous accounts out there.  These trolls bully with abandon, spread racist and misogynist abuse and attack people based on looks, weight, age, gender and disability.  As well as young people, God forbid if you are a public representative because you will be specifically targeted.  I have spoken to many constituents and it is clear to them that the reporting to social media platforms does not work and that the cost of legal remedies is out of reach of normal people who need the law to be updated in this regard.  We need to make our social media known more for the good in society rather than the toxic, unsafe hellhole they can be for so many.  Anonymous accounts provide a shadow under which these people can hide and facilitate and encourage online abuse.  As it stands, tech companies - forgive me if I am wrong - do not know who millions of their users are.  No matter how good these companies' intentions, the lack of basic information means that any attempt they make to police their platforms and bring offenders to justice is a painful process for them.  Basically, their hands are tied in respect of prosecution before they even attempt to start.  That brings huge concern.  No one should be prevented from using another name, but we have to make it harder for online abusers to hide in the shadows and cause the mayhem they cause.  Information on users is critically important in this respect.  I would like to see tech companies make more of the issue without always needing governments to intervene.  I have heard a lot of words such as "prudent", "proactive", "enforcement" and "exploring" used.  We need to see real action in this regard.  Deputy Griffin talked about three simple steps in respect of verification of identity.  That is hugely important, and we need to start moving swiftly on this.  Furthermore, every user should be made verify his or her identity.  That would be a hugely important step across all social media platforms.</p> <p>  Finally, we need to give users the option to block communication, comments and other interactions from unverified users as a category if they so wish.  We need to see a timeline as to when this will be implemented.  Ms Alex Cooney, CEO of CyberSafeKids, has said self-regulation simply does not go far enough.  Again, I have heard from constituents about this.  Families are seeking support, and it is often a lengthy and difficult battle to find a solution to the problem.  What are the witnesses' positions on this and what specifically do they intend to do about it?</p></speech>

I know he is talking about unverified accounts, but we have blocking tools in place for particular comments, particular words and so on, so we are not walking away from this.  We expect ongoing and tough conversations with the regulator about this but we think that at the moment we have the right balance, in that when the account is set up ID is not required but if there is any suspicion of inauthenticity, from either a user report or our systems in the background, a flag is raised regarding inauthentic behaviour.  We think that is the right balance.</p></speech>

A violation of our rules is a violation of our rules, regardless of the stated identity of the account.  This is demonstrated by the fact that successful criminal prosecutions have arisen from instances in which Twitter has complied with law enforcement where law enforcement has deemed that a criminal threshold of abuse has been crossed and that user information was required.  Pseudonymity is therefore neither a barrier to Twitter's enforcement of its own rules nor a barrier to accountability for criminal behaviour.  I would say-----</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy McEntee, recently passed Coco's law under the name the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020.  How can Twitter help to investigate alleged breaches of this Act by anonymous accounts?</p></speech>

That website has been up for several years.  Because of Dublin's position as Twitter's headquarters for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, it is here where we host a Europe-wide training session, typically annually, which includes An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We work with law enforcement to train its members up on how to submit requests that are properly specced such that we can expedite a case and work with them in as efficient a manner as possible.  There is a dedicated website for such law enforcement requests, which may arise from the legislation the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

I have indulged the Deputy for a little longer than his five-minute slot.  I thank him.  I appreciate his good line of questioning.</p> <p>  It comes to me now.  I thank our guests for their presentations.  They have been most helpful to our work and our deliberations.  To me, social media platforms are currently like the Wild West - anything goes.  I do not accept some of the statements today on the swiftness with which harmful online data are dealt with.  This comes not only from my own experience but also from the experience of many of the witnesses we have had before us when it comes to protecting children.</p><p>I would also make the observation that I see the witnesses' platforms not just as platforms but as moving more into the space of publishers.  When we think about our traditional media outlets, such as newspapers, television and so forth, there are really strict criteria regarding what they can put out in terms of fact-based information and there is also the question of objectivity.  I do not see that currently within the social media cyberspace platforms.  That is a serious part of the work with which we must deal.</p><p> The witnesses we have repeatedly referred to the lethargic attitude and reluctance of social media platforms to remove harmful comments and content that was extremely upsetting and harmful to young people and children.  I have a specific question in respect of a matter to which Mr. &Oacute; Broin has already alluded.  I refer to the fact that there is no timeline for the removal of content.  I will put the same question to Twitter and TikTok the same question.  Do they have specific timelines in terms of how quickly they react and remove content?</p><p> Will the witnesses outline in a sentence or two their interaction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  When An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na goes go to the social media platforms with content it believes is harmful and constitutes harassment to some of their users, how quickly do they respond?  What hoops does An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have to jump through to actually get the response it deserves?</p><p> I will go first to Mr &Oacute; Broin.  I do not expect he has anything more to say in terms of timelines for the removal of content.</p></speech>

He made a very good point about community standards.  Can he explain to the committee exactly what Facebook's community standards are?  I was part of a very interesting debate with the <i>Irish Independent</i>last weekend where two very reputable and highly respected journalists, Mr. Kevin Doyle and Mr. Philip Ryan, talked about exactly that point of community standards.  They have received continuous verbal assaults online, no more than politicians.  They spoke about that very point of going to community standards or making a complaint to Mr. &Oacute; Broin's platform and getting the response that it did not breach the community standards.  Could Mr &Oacute; Broin explain to the committee, and give some specific examples, of what breaches of community standards are for Facebook?</p></speech>

How is content amplified on the platform?  How is it surfaced on the platform?  These are things we are trying to address specifically with machine learning and more proactive measures such that we are prioritising and up-voting or up-ranking, if you want to call it that, the constructive and civil discourse on Twitter and de-amplifing or down-ranking the harmful, toxic and unhealthy engagement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.786" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#A00200"><p>Today we are continuing our module on challenges facing the aviation sector and the purpose of the meeting today is to discuss updates on international aviation and, more particularly, the challenges facing the entire aviation sector and air travel.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee I welcome to today's meeting Mr. Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association, IATA.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus should note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement whereby they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin or both, to participate in public meetings.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to the constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard I am asking members partaking via Teams that prior to making a contribution in the meeting, they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus or the Convention Centre Dublin.  Anyone watching the meeting online should note that Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I, as Chairman, and the necessary staff for the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the committee meeting remotely, I appeal to everyone to bear with us should any technical difficulties arise.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh may now make an opening statement.  I thank him for taking time from his busy schedule to be with us.  Aviation is critical to Ireland, as he is probably well aware, being one of our own.  We are very keen, as a committee, to consider how we can achieve the reopening of the aviation sector as quickly as possible in a safe way.</p></speech>

If I may, I will make a couple of remarks.</p> <p>  Without question this is the most challenging crisis the airline industry has ever faced, and although we have confronted some in the past, nothing has been of this scale.  It is important to point out the crisis is ongoing and it would be wrong to say it is a direct result of the global pandemic.  What we face today is a crisis that arises from restrictive travel arrangements.  To be honest, in the case of Ireland I would describe it as a repressive travel policy that is preventing people from travelling.  We can say that with confidence because in markets where restrictions do not apply, we have seen demand recover generally in line with where demand was in 2019, particularly the US domestic market, where travel restrictions do not apply.  Traffic there is now back to the levels seen in 2019.  In some cases it is beginning to exceed those levels.</p> <p>  We know travel restrictions were introduced for the right reason at the right time but if these restrictions are relaxed or removed, we will see a recovery in demand that will enable airlines to work their way out of this crisis.  What we believe is necessary, particularly in the case of Ireland, is that the EU must align policies.  We would like to see the EU traffic light system reintroduced and applied consistently across the Union.  As a proud Irishman and citizen of Europe, I am disappointed with the way the EU has managed through this crisis, with many different regimes being adopted by governments, which is causing great confusion in the minds of customers and major problems for airline operations.  We would also like to see that where people have been vaccinated, travel restrictions would be fully removed.</p> <p>  In addition, the quarantine arrangements put in place in Ireland are particularly repressive and they should be removed and replaced, if necessary, by a risk-based testing system.  I was particularly interested in listening to the contribution of Professor Mark Ferguson, who has appeared before this committee, and to read comments from one of the co-authors of the Ferguson report, Professor Paddy Mallon, on testing.  There is a case to be made for the use of best-in-class rapid antigen testing in lieu of expensive and difficult PCR requirements.</p> <p>  We also would like to encourage the Irish Government to urgently consider the opening of a travel corridor with the United States.  This is of particular importance to the Irish economy and tourism industry in Ireland.  There is good reason to be optimistic that this could be possible.</p> <p>  Last but not least, in anticipation of a recovery in passenger numbers, it is critical that our border agencies are ready for such an increase.  Airports will not be able to function properly if people arriving in the country or having to depart have to present bits of paper to officials to prove they meet requirements.  There must be a digital solution in order that we can continue to process people who have the right qualifications and authorisations to enter the country without creating massive queues at the border.  On that note, I will pause and allow the committee to challenge me or ask any questions.</p></speech>

We want to probe or drill down into what must be put in place to deal with the matters he raised, particularly as they relate to the common travel area with the UK and antigen testing.  The reopening of the transatlantic routes to the US is also critical to us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.789" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1517" speakername="Joe Carey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#B00100"><p>I welcome Mr. Walsh to this important meeting.  The Oireachtas transport committee has had many deliberations trying to get international air travel back up and running and has produced a report on it.  Mr. Walsh referred to Professor Ferguson's report on antigen testing, something for which this committee strongly advocates.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Walsh give us an overview on the current air travel restrictions imposed around Europe?  How does Ireland measure up in terms of other jurisdictions?  Travel to America is currently prohibited.  America will not let us in.  Obviously, one needs a co-ordinated approach to this and the digital green certificate offers that potential.  Work needs to be done on this, however.  I agree with the need to open an air corridor between Europe and the US in tandem with the creation of the digital green certificate.  Will Mr. Walsh give us an overview of what is happening with regard to air travel restrictions across Europe?</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh is aware of the recent announcement by Aer Lingus, a company with which he is familiar, that it will close its cabin crew base in Shannon.  Given his background and his standing in aviation, it is clear Aer Lingus is in a difficult financial position.  It has received funding from the State with an Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, loan of &euro;150 million but I understand it is losing approximately &euro;1 million a day.  There is a need for a more substantial cash injection to be made to the airline to keep it afloat.</p> <p>  I am advocating that any cash injection deal from the Government to Aer Lingus should come with a proviso that the strategic routes which operate out of Shannon, namely, Heathrow, New York and Boston, are protected.  When Aer Lingus was sold to International Airlines Group, IAG, there was a commitment, signed into the articles of association, that the Shannon-Heathrow slots would be protected for seven years.  That will expire in September 2022.  Would it be justified to seek a further extension, say a ten-year period, of the slots in any deal that would be done with Aer Lingus?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.790" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#B00200"><p>I agree with the Deputy on the digital green certificate.  That would be a step forward.  At IATA, we have argued that there should be a common standard in order that airlines and governments can fully satisfy themselves that people travelling meet the criteria and where somebody has been vaccinated that they can provide evidence of it.  Regardless of what we might think as to whether vaccination should be a requirement for travel, some countries will make it a condition of entry.  We have already heard a number of countries say that it will likely be the case.  Having a robust and verifiable system that can be checked and satisfied is important.</p> <p>  On EU restrictions, I have described the arrangements in Ireland to be repressive.  I have heard people almost cheer the fact that Ireland has the most restrictive arrangements as if it is something good.  I do not see it that way.  This is particularly dangerous for a country like Ireland where the message being sent out is that we do not want people travelling to the country.  For a country that has always been open, as well as dependent on emigration and foreign investment, such a message sent out around the world is particularly worrying.</p> <p>  Other EU countries do not have similar restrictions.  I am living in Switzerland - I accept it is not an EU country - but I have travelled into Spain without any restriction.  One must provide an antigen test before one can travel into Spain.  Coming back into Switzerland, one needs to have a PCR test.  To travel to the UK, where more restrictive arrangements are in place, a PCR test is required or an antigen test and one can self-isolate.  There is not a common standard.  Some countries require PCR testing to be taken within 24 hours of travel, others, 48 hours, and others, 72 hours.  One would think that the EU should be able to align on a simple issue like that.  If it is okay for some countries to accept a test taken within 72 hours, why is it not acceptable for all?  Some require it to be taken by everybody including newborn children.  Others, like Ireland, require the test for children above the age of six.  In some cases, it is for people above the age of 18.  A common standard is not being applied across the EU.  Some countries are more open than others.  In the main, some element of restriction is in place.</p> <p>  It is regrettable that Aer Lingus has had to take the decisions it has.  It must be remembered Aer Lingus is not vying on the transatlantic routes.  The transatlantic operation from Shannon is particularly seasonal.  It has always been heavily dependent on US inbound traffic, particularly so during the summer season.  This summer season is wiped out, the second summer in a row in which Aer Lingus will not be able to bring people from the US into Ireland.  While Irish citizens are restricted in terms of entry into the US under law, there is no restriction on US citizens travelling out of the US or back into the US.</p> <p>  It is deeply regrettable that Aer Lingus had to take this decision but I do not see any way of avoiding it.  It is in a deep financial crisis.  While the Deputy is correct that it had access to an ISIF loan, that has to be repaid.  The damage done to airlines through this crisis is huge with the additional debt burden that has been taken on.  Those debts have to be repaid and this will impose significant restrictions on how airlines operate.  It will be particularly true in terms of the appetite they have for financial risk, which will seriously restrict the level of capacity that comes back into the market once travel restrictions are removed.  I have no inside knowledge of how Aer Lingus is thinking but I do not see how it would be possible for Aer Lingus to recreate the transatlantic network that it operated in 2019 once things get going.  It is going to take many years to see the transatlantic network built up again.</p> <p>  On the Shannon slots, I always said people did not have anything to fear.  I do not have any inside knowledge as to how things are operating now but when I was at Aer Lingus and IAG, those routes were operated on a profitable basis.  People should have nothing to fear.  If the demand is there, I guarantee Aer Lingus will want to serve it.  It always has and I believe it always will.  People should not be concerned about the continuity of that service, provided the Government removes restrictions.  If travel restrictions continue, then it is inevitable that these routes cannot be operated.</p></speech>

His opening statement is quite comprehensive.</p> <p>  I will start with employment support, which is the big issue.  We all accept that for an island like this connectivity is paramount.  We are told throughout this period that it is all about maintaining capacity, particularly in aviation.  When we get to the tail end of this, it is important we are able to maintain that connectivity and, within that, to provide protection for workers and their families.</p><p>In the Irish sense we can speak about a continuation of the existing supports and even beyond that.  I would be grateful for any detail on that.</p><p> Much of this work is about what we can put in place in the current set-up for reopening travel.  Mr. Walsh mentioned a resumption of the EU traffic light system and eventually removing all quarantine requirements.  As he mentioned, the committee did some work with Professor Mark Ferguson, particularly around antigen testing.  He spoke about some of the pilots operating in Britain, specifically, where people flying in would perform serial testing on themselves over ten days or a specific period.  We have called for pilots to use such a process in this period so we would at least have that heavy lifting done.  We have contacted the Government, and particularly the Minister for Transport, about this happening.</p><p> We heard from England's chief medical officer about the possibility of the Indian variant overtaking the Kent variant and we hope this will not affect vaccinations and the protection of people but it is a worry.  We must take that into account.  We should remember on some level that it is Covid-19 that has done this to us.  Mr. Walsh might agree that we must consider the likes of the digital green certificate and rapid antigen tests in order to give us choice.</p><p> I am interested in the idea of the American corridor.  I accept the importance of our relationship with America but has there been any communication about this on the other end?  At present, they obviously have restrictions on us flying there now.  I get that with the passing of weeks, a significant number of people will be vaccinated, allowing more freedom on what can be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.793" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#C00200"><p>I thank the Deputy and agree with him.  Employment support has been critical and I acknowledge that if not for the employment support provided by governments, not just in Ireland but in other countries, the scale of unemployment in the airline industry would be massive.  We were hoping to keep people in employment and with critical skills in place to enable the industry to restart quickly.  As this period of restriction has extended well beyond what anybody expected, and the damage done to the industry is significantly greater than anybody expected, the ability of the industry to recover to the 2019 levels of capacity quickly has reduced to the point where that is impossible.  It will take several years.</p> <p>  We have seen many aircraft retired so they are not available.  Unfortunately, many critical staff have been made redundant and many more would have been made redundant if not for the employment support schemes.  We must very thankful and recognise the supports that governments have provided.  That enables airlines to get moving again, although not at the same scale I would have hoped for if we had this conversation six months ago.  I remain optimistic we will be able to see a recovery in the second half of this year, and this is principally based on the accelerated roll-out of the vaccine and the scientific evidence that the vaccine is having a significant impact on the levels of transmission.  Those levels of transmission are definitely dampening as a result of vaccination.</p> <p>  On the question of serial antigen testing, I listened with great interest to Professor Mark Ferguson when he appeared before the committee.  I am not sure I support the view that people need to be tested every day but a risk-based approach to testing is a very sensible suggestion.  I read the recommendation of the committee on that and it would be great to see the Government act on that recommendation.</p> <p>  I do not have as much data about Ireland because they are not readily available but the UK is providing much data in this regard.  My latest data relate to the period between 25 March and 5 May, when just over 150,000 people travelled to the UK and either had to go into hotel quarantine, similar to Ireland, or self-isolate.  Of those 150,000 people, all of whom were required to do a PCR test on or before their second day from arrival in the UK, 3,749 demonstrated a positive indication.  That is 2.5%.  Interestingly, if we remove people who travelled from India and Pakistan, who accounted for 20% of the people travelling and over 50% of the people who tested positive, the positivity rate was 1.5%.  To put this in a more positive way, 98.5% of people were perfectly fine, had no virus and were not contagious but suffered restrictions as a result of this process.  The figures I have for Ireland comprise a much smaller sample and I am not sure they are up to date.  The figures indicated approximately 3% of people who had gone into hotel quarantine subsequently tested positive, meaning 97% of people who were forced to pay over &euro;1,800 for the pleasure of being locked in a hotel for two weeks were fine.</p> <p>  If we assess these measures, we must consider the risk.  We cannot have a zero-risk approach because it is unachievable.  If people accept a reasonable level of risk, it can be done without the measures that have been put in place.  The quality of testing has significantly improved.  I do not know how many PCR tests members have done but I have done ten in the past two months associated with the travel I have been doing.  I have also done several antigen tests and, fortunately, I have tested negative every time.  Nobody wants to have to go through that just for the privilege of exercising their freedom of movement, which is a fundamental principle of the EU.  That is really what has upset me most.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy's assessment and the committee's recommendation on replacing forced quarantine with a sensible system of serial testing, including on a daily basis.  I am sure people would not mind that as an alternative to hotel quarantine.  It could happen every second day.  It would be a very sensible risk-based approach to the problem we face.</p></speech>

At the outset I mention the devastating news received yesterday that Aer Lingus, an airline with a constant presence in Shannon since 1958, is to permanently close its base there.  That is absolutely devastating for the 130 employees based in Shannon, the region and aviation in general.  There is much work to be done and we will go down fighting.  I know the Taoiseach is to meet airline representatives tomorrow and the airline is seeking support from the Government.  That must be conditional and there is no blank cheque territory for funds, whether in the form of grants or repayable loans via ISIF.  There must be some conditionality built in and this must involve commitments to routes from Shannon and the base there.</p><p>There are a number of things I want to say about yesterday's announcement.  One must look at the chronology, because the Cabinet was due to meet yesterday to consider two things, one of which was the scaling back of mandatory hotel quarantine, which cannot happen soon enough.  It had a purpose in early January when we had 8,000 or so cases of Covid-19 per day but it does not have a purpose now.  The Cabinet was also to consider the digital green certificate and a pathway forward to a resumption of international air travel.  These were the matters on the Cabinet agenda yesterday.  That is the day that Aer Lingus chose to make this announcement.  The company has availed of salary support in the form of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, for the past 14 months and practically all of the Aer Lingus wage bill has been paid for by the Government.  While the Government may not own the airline and that day is gone, it has skin in the game and it needs to call that in as well.</p><p> The digital green certificate will be before Cabinet again next week, as we are getting to the final ratification stage.  It has to be stated repeatedly that this has to be ratified by 27 member states.  This is an EU-wide protocol and set of regulations and it is not the case of Ireland being a laggard in this regard.  There is a political run-in period here of six weeks or so, from the time of ratification across the EU to its implementation.  Can Mr. Walsh inform us if that six-week political lead-in aligns itself with the lead-in period that IATA and all of the airlines it represents need in having hours for pilots, cabin crews back and certified and marketing plans up in place?  It seems to me that on Tuesday, when the Cabinet meets and the ratification process starts in Ireland, the logical thing for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan to say is that the sector is in the starting blocks and that this is its six-week lead-in period.  He should state it is also the lead-in period politically and that we should now get it all aligned.  Can Mr. Walsh tell us if that aligns itself perfectly for his industry?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.802" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#D00200"><p>That is a good comment, provided that there is certainty after the six-week lead-in period that things will start again.  What will kill the industry completely is if we have this reopening and closing of borders again.  The damage that is being done is very significant.  The real challenge that airlines face, and this is particularly true of Aer Lingus, is that the significant cash burn it faces will actually increase as the airline starts to get back up and running again.  One has a combination of costs that it is not currently incurring such as fuel, airport and <i>en route</i>charges that will now become payable at the same time as the airline is waiting for the revenue stream from bookings to come into place.  For many airlines, the most challenging period is not what we have come through but it is what we are facing.  Part of that will be the risk associated with getting going too fast.<br/><br/>I am aware that the Deputy did not ask me a question about the financial support for Aer Lingus but please allow me to comment on that.  Any company taking out a loan will have to assess the conditions associated with that loan, not just the financial conditions but all of the other red tape, and then satisfy itself that it makes sense.  One can put all of the conditions that one likes but that does not mean that the loan will be accepted nor does it mean that one has a strong card to play.  What one has to do, and I am sure this is what the management team at Aer Lingus is looking at, is to provide certainty that if Aer Lingus starts operating on the transatlantic routes again, it will be able to continue to do so because the costs associated with ramping up a transatlantic operation are massive.  It is in that period that the greatest risk is being taken.  If I was looking at additional debt being taken on by the airline I would be very careful about the conditions associated with that because the balance sheet has been significantly stressed and the debt that has been taken on has to be repaid.  For that debt to be repaid, the airline will have to be profitable.  One cannot impose non-commercial restrictive covenants on an airline and hope that it will be in a position to repay the debt.<br/><br/>One needs to be very careful.  I do not see how Aer Lingus can sensibly guarantee the operation of a Shannon transatlantic base, given that the summer season has, yet again, been effectively lost, with the very significant seasonality associated with the transatlantic operation into Shannon.  I agree with the Deputy that it is very sad to see it and it is terrible for everybody involved.  These decisions are not taken lightly by airline management.  Many of these decisions have been forced upon them because of the financial crisis that they face at the moment.</p></speech>

If the Chairman will allow me to extend my comment, the 130 employees based out of Shannon have had their salaries largely paid by the Government, which is the point I wish to make.  The taxpayer has more or less paid the wage bill for the Shannon employees.  On that basis, the Government should have some say if it is paying the wage bill.  There should be some conditionality built into it in order that those employees would at least be strategically located in the Shannon base.</p> <p>  I absolutely get the point here but there is no deflecting blame here because mandatory hotel quarantine had a purpose during the time of peak Covid-19 infection rates of 8,000 cases a day.  This has now been tapered back to 300 or so cases a day and it does not now have a purpose.  Mandatory hotel quarantine, however, has been a catalyst to where we are at today but Aer Lingus senior management also seized an opportunity presented to it by a crisis to withdraw from Shannon.  I just think that the timing of it was chronic.  It was the day on which this issue was to come before Cabinet.  It is on the eve of things reopening.  It will be five or six weeks before planes are back in the sky, so that is also something of a factor.  There are certain actions the Government will take, which are already happening.  The Taoiseach is to meet the relevant parties tomorrow but there needs to be a certain amount of playing hardball with Aer Lingus here as well, because it has done well out of the Government and its wage bill has been fully paid by it.  </p> <p>  It also has shown little loyalty to its staff based in Shannon because the carrot hanging over the staff there since yesterday is that they may be transferred, possibly, to Dublin.  That will not happen because when the company looked at temporary lay-offs within its workforce, the company held on to some staff members who had only come in the door ten or 11 weeks before the onset of Covid-19 pandemic but laid off staff members who had been in Shannon for 30 or 35 years.  They showed loyalty on each occasion to Dublin and Cork over Shannon and this needs to be stated.  We are supportive of Aer Lingus and I will do everything as a Deputy in County Clare and in my position as my party&rsquo;s aviation spokesperson.  We will work on this night and day but we also need to call out some of these truths.</p></speech>

I will move on with Mr. Walsh in my own slot, in which I wish to ask a number of questions.  First, has he met the Government to give his overview on aviation, which is a sector that is such a pinnacle of importance for our economy and if so, at what level has this happened?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.805" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#D00500"><p>Personally, I have not.  This is the first opportunity I have had to discuss these matters as I have only been in position in IATA for the past six weeks.</p></speech>

Can he elaborate on that point?  In that context, the Government is about to announce a reopening time for aviation.  What are the benchmarks that he would like to see?  He spoke about certainty.  I am a Deputy representing Limerick City and Shannon Airport is of great importance to us but there is also a question here if the aviation sector can reopen.  I would like to see goodwill to Shannon to resume both the Heathrow and transatlantic services with the cabin crew in Shannon but until such time as aviation is up and running, it is more difficult to have those discussions.</p> <p>  Taking into account the resumption of the common travel area with ourselves and the UK, Mr. Walsh also spoke about the US, about the digital green certificate and vaccination.  When does he anticipate that Joe Biden as President of America, his Administration and officials, will allow people to fly to the US from Europe without the restrictions?  We are at a point now where the digital green certificate is coming in at the end of June and we are looking at a six-week lead-in period.  Can Mr. Walsh then map out what is the latest time that aviation needs to get the green light in order that it can actually survive?</p><p>I know I am drilling down but I think we need to get into detail.  Could Mr. Walsh map out why he regards Ireland as an outlier?  What does he want to see in the Government's reopening plan that is realistic because at the end of the day, there are public health issues here?  How does he see it operating with the members of IATA in terms of public health, flying in and out of the UK and transatlantic destinations, the timeframe involved, linking in with the digital green certificate and other measures like PCR and rapid antigen testing?  </p></speech>

Regarding the US, if I look at the data the UK has provided, in that six-week period about which I spoke, the positivity rate and the number of people travelling to the UK from the US was 0.7%.  A total of 34 people tested positive for coronavirus.  A total of 99% plus did not have the virus, yet you are locking them up in hotels here.  That is repressive.  A total of 32 people travelling from France to the UK tested positive, yet they are being locked up in hotels in Ireland.  Nobody travelling to the UK from Belgium tested positive, yet people travelling from Belgium to Ireland are being locked up.  Nobody tested positive from Luxembourg.  They are just four countries in respect of which I can give the committee an example of hard data.  For some reason, the Irish Government has decided that these people represent a significant risk to Ireland.  I disagree strongly.  I am not being paid by Aer Lingus.  I have not been paid by it or indeed IAG for some time but I reject the statements made about Aer Lingus.  It would be able to defend itself but-----</p></speech>

It is not being opportunistic.  It is desperate in respect of the measures it is taking, as are airlines across the world, which are faced with very tough decisions.  I have been in tough positions before.  These are not easy decisions to take.  People do not take them lightly.  They are looking at the future survival of the airline and must make decisions that can at best guarantee that they can do that.</p> <p>  The Chairman raised a very important issue in respect of the US.  The most critical issue for Ireland is getting people from the US travelling to Ireland.  I know it would be great to see Irish people travelling to the US.  The US has made clear that it will allow its citizens to travel internationally and return to the US without restriction if they have been vaccinated.  We could approve that tomorrow but Ireland is saying that if someone is vaccinated and travels to Ireland from the US, he or she will have to pay over &euro;1,800 and we will lock him or her up in a hotel for 12 days, escort him or her there courtesy of the Irish Government and make sure he or she does not leave.  That is repressive.  </p></speech>

Growing up, I would have seen his rise.  I think he was in Futura before he came back to Aer Lingus and on to British Airways and IAG and here he is in IATA.  It is great to see another Irish person doing so well in the international aviation industry despite its challenges.</p> <p>  A lot of people will be talking about Shannon for very obvious reasons.  The decision that had to be taken is very regrettable and I understand the angst in the region.  Shannon is so important to that region.  </p> <p>  Mr. Walsh has given us his opening statement.  Were he the Minister for Transport of the Head of Government, what are the three or four things he would do in the next week or ten days to get the aviation industry back up and running?  We sometimes forget that people in Europe can jump on trains and get from country to country without going to an airport but we cannot.  We have a population of less than five million people and in normal times, 33 million people go through Dublin Airport, which is more than six times the State's population.  I do not think we would find too many other countries with those ratios.</p><p>Mr. Walsh has outlined some of what needs to be done in his statement but will he indicate the three, four or five things he would say, as an aviation expert, Ireland needs to do to ensure we have connectivity in the long run?  I am talking about what is needed from a foreign direct investment perspective, a tourism inwards perspective and, equally, a population perspective.  Irish people like to travel and visit other countries and there is a huge Irish diaspora across the world.  Those people want to visit here and people in Ireland want them to come here.  What does Mr. Walsh want us to do, week by week for the next three to four weeks, to get aviation back up to somewhere approaching what it was before?  How long does he think it will take to get back to the 2019 figures?  Will it be in the next five to ten years or does he not see us ever getting back there?</p></speech>

We are likely to get back to the 2019 figures by 2024 at the earliest.  More likely, it will take five years from now, which would be 2026, given where we are.</p> <p>  I have already outlined some of the things I would like to see happening.  There has to be a signal that mandatory hotel quarantining is finished.  It should only be required, if it is required at all, in extreme circumstances.  It cannot be that it becomes the norm, which it has, in effect, become.  Ireland must align with the rest of Europe in terms of having a sensible traffic light system.  Ireland should use its position of influence within Europe to try to get a common position adopted across the EU.  Particularly in a post-Brexit environment, it is disappointing to see the EU fragmented in the way it is.</p> <p>  Ireland needs to look at a testing regime that is risk-based.  It should take on board the recommendation this committee has made in regard to antigen testing as opposed to expensive PCR testing.  The Government has got to make sure, in anticipation of getting things moving again, that people will have a smooth passage into and out of the airports.  That will require technology and the adoption of some form of digital system to allow people to move through airports in an efficient manner.</p> <p>  We have got to change the attitude in Ireland where travel is seen as an evil.  I do not understand that, given how critical travel has been to the growth of the Irish economy.  It has enabled people both on the island and outside it to do business in a way that would not otherwise have been possible.  We have been massively successful in attracting business into Ireland but that requires access to the island.  I really worry about whether the businesses that have relocated here are going to look at other parts of the world.  I am doing that at IATA because there are some countries in which we have offices where the authorities are making it very difficult for us to work.  We are already looking at whether we can relocate those offices to a more business-friendly environment.  Ireland needs to move fast on this.  I can understand the political risk associated with making decisions like these.  I come from an airline background where we have to manage risk on a daily basis.  It is in our DNA and we do it well.  We understand how to manage risk.  It is going to be important for Ireland to make change and make it quickly.

From both their perspectives and the perspective of the Dublin Airport Authority in terms of connectivity and inbound tourism, it is very important that we have tourists bringing their dollars, euro or whatever into the country.  As Mr. Walsh mentioned, it is sad to see those graveyards in Spain and France and in the desert, with thousands of large aircraft parked that will probably not fly again.  Does Mr. Walsh agree that it is likely airlines will be smaller than they were for a long time to come and will have to choose where they fly to and why, based on their available resources?  What do we need to do as a country to ensure we get back the fabulous connectivity we previously enjoyed sooner rather than later?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.841" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#F00400"><p>The Senator has hit the nail on the head.  Airlines will be smaller and, therefore, they will have to look at where they assign the assets they have, which are fewer than they used to be.  Ireland today would be very low on the list given everything I have said in terms of the restrictions.  These decisions are being taken now.  There are airlines that are looking at countries and markets that are beginning to open.  We have seen what has happened in the UK with Portugal going on the green list and the emerging capacity that has gone into that country.  UK airlines are not going to take that capacity out of Portugal and put it into Ireland.  It is going to stay in Portugal and the next country that opens up is going to get some capacity.  That is what is going to happen.</p> <p>  If Ireland is at the end of the queue, there will be very little capacity for it.  That means inbound tourism is going to be significantly choked and outbound connectivity is going to be significantly inhibited.  That is why I say it is urgent that the Government moves on this and does so quickly.  I can guarantee that if the UK adds another three countries to its green list tomorrow, airlines that have capacity will put their aircraft into those markets.  They are aircraft that could potentially have gone into Ireland.  The sooner we do it the better.  We are lagging significantly behind the UK and we are lagging behind several other countries in Europe that have already come out and stated that they will allow people with a vaccination to travel in and out without restriction, or they will remove quarantine for people who can show evidence of a negative test.  We have to get back in line with other countries.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh is representing IATA, which includes as members his former employers IAG and Aer Lingus and also Ryanair, the great enemy of Aer Lingus over the years.  Ryanair has relocated aircraft out of Ireland and Aer Lingus is relocating aircraft to Manchester.</p></speech>

These are aircraft that were operating in the Irish market but will now operate in the UK market.  Every day that passes, more aircraft are likely to be assigned to the UK or elsewhere, particularly in the case of Ryanair, which has incredible flexibility to relocate its aircraft right across Europe.  That is the risk.</p></speech>

He has a unique perspective on the aviation industry given his history with our flag carrier, with IAG and in his current role.  I totally agree with his points on believing the science.  We have a vaccination roll-out that is working and in which people have confidence.  We have PCR testing that has been the gold standard for more than a year, since the start of the pandemic.  We had the report by Professor Ferguson, the findings of which in terms of antigen testing and what needs to be done in that regard were discussed and endorsed by this committee.  We have more than a year of global learning on personal behaviour and how to live with this virus.  That needs to be taken on board.  What Ireland went through last December, January and February was unique to Europe at the time and decisions were made during that period that were quite restrictive.  Given where we are with the science, we now need a roadmap out of those restrictions.  On mandatory hotel quarantine, for example, we need a roadmap to wind it down to be a measure of last resort.  We have the science, vaccinations and testing capacity in place to make that happen and it needs to be done.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for Mr. Walsh.  In regard to testing, this committee - as well as the Covid committee, of which I was also a member - has done a huge amount of work on trying to promote a testing regime within our airports and the aviation industry.  We were always met with a rebuff from the Government on that.</p><p>Can Mr. Walsh comment on his view of the calls for airport and aviation testing and those kinds of options that he sought over the past year and the impact of that?</p><p> Second, could the Government here have done more to protect jobs in Aer Lingus in terms of the supports that were given?  Conditionality in respect of job protection was specified in, for example, Germany, Spain and France, in return for state supports.  I am asking that question in the context of how Aer Lingus operates within the IAG family of airlines.  I am not saying that it is a simple thing but could more have been done to protect the jobs that have been lost in the context of supports that were given, such as a loan of &euro;150 million given from ISIF, to Aer Lingus?  </p><p> Finally, on the digital green certificate which is something we all want to see work well, does Mr. Walsh have any concerns as to the European capacity for an effective ICT regime to ensure this works well from the outset?  This is all about having confidence in this certificate from early on because we all want to support it and get it off the ground.  I would appreciate Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s comments and answers on those issues and I thank him.</p></speech>

I go back 12 months when we started doing the PCR tests and antigen tests had not been developed to a standard which was considered acceptable.  The advances that have been made both in the quality and speed of the testing and the assurance that people can get from testing has been really significant.  One has to admire the science associated both with the vaccine and the testing.  A standard that we believed was acceptable or necessary 12 months ago should not be necessary today because there have been so many developments both in the vaccination and the quality of treatment that we can give in our hospitals.</p> <p>  The fears that we had 12 months ago that the health systems would be overrun, and I am aware that it came close at times, have significantly abated.  I also note that the most vulnerable in most countries have been vaccinated at this stage.  The quality or quantity of risk, whichever way one wants to talk about it, has changed. The mitigation action therefore that one should put in place to address that has changed because one wants to end up with the same residual level of risk and we can do that with a cheaper, more efficient and more comfortable type of test than the PCR one.  </p> <p>  I am aware that the scientists disagree on this and it is great to see that they cannot all agree.  I have seen some thinking to the effect that a rapid antigen test should not be used at all and others who say it is clearly an effective way of testing people, particularly testing someone who is positive, where it does not necessarily guarantee if one has a negative result that one is negative.  It pretty much does guarantee, however, if one has a positive result that one is positive.  Testing has progressed.</p> <p>  The Deputy has asked a great question as to whether more could have been done to protect jobs.  It is always easy to look back and say that we could have done more or done better.  I cannot be too critical and I have to say that I am a great admirer of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who has done a fantastic job. He has responded as best he could in the circumstances and has a very challenging position going forward.  The loan from ISIF is a commercial loan made on commercial terms.  It is great to have ISIF there and as members may be aware, I was for a number of years chairman of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which included responsibility for ISIF.  I understand how it operates and the steps that Aer Lingus would have had to have taken to satisfy ISIF that this was a loan that was worth making and would be repaid.  To be honest, the thing that would have protected jobs more than anything would have been to get international travel going again.  I know that that is a simple answer for me to give but it really is.  Jobs can best be protected by the operation of the airlines.  The sooner that we get the airlines operating, particularly during what is traditionally the peak summer period, the better.  If we miss this summer period then the situation becomes much more grave because then we are going into what is traditionally a low-demand winter period, which will be particularly dangerous for a number of airlines.  </p> <p>  I welcome the supports that governments across the world have given.  Most of that support has been in the form of debt.  That is why if one looks at the industry, we in IATA estimate the debt burden on it to be $650 billion, which is $220 billion of additional debt through this period.  That is increasing by the day.  It is also worth pointing out that most of the financing that airlines have accessed has come from the debt and equity markets.  Shareholders have put in their fair stake and the commercial debt market has been accessed.  What governments have been providing is a small fraction of what the industry has had to access but it is very welcome and if it had not been made available, a number of airlines would have been in severe trouble.</p></speech>

We do not.  We are developing in IATA what we call the IATA travel pass.  We are doing this basically for the industry but much of the work that we are doing can be done on behalf of governments as well.  It requires a central database and it does not have to be a digital green pass.  In Ireland there is a database available for people who have been vaccinated and there is one in the UK.  It would be great to have one across the EU.  In most cases, we can access data that are reliable.  We have an app developed that can be used.  So far we have got approximately 110 airlines signed up to use it.  We are in discussions with a number of governments already, eight or nine of which have said that they will be using it.  We are in discussions with 30 other governments that are interested in using it as a system to enable people to demonstrate that they have met the requirements.  It is possible, if not by relying on governments, but through the public and private sector working together, for an ICT solution to be provided.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh is a person with much experience in running an airline.  Can he tell me what practical import there is from the closure of a base?  Obviously, it does not mean that Aer Lingus will no longer fly in and out of Shannon Airport but it has implications, in particular, for early morning and late evening flights.  Can Mr Walsh provide a little explanation on that point to the committee, please?</p></speech>

One has to crew the base from outside, which would typically mean that the aircraft and crew are starting from another base, which means the first departure depends on the first arrival.  Typically, that means that the first departure will be later than if one had people based in the airport.  It has implications in the timing of the schedule that is operated.  I do not have any inside knowledge as to what Aer Lingus is thinking about but I imagine and expect that it will continue to operate out of Shannon.  The shape of the schedule, however, and the level of activity will be very different to what has been known at Shannon.</p></speech>

One can provide them but normally it means that one is overnighting crews in hotels rather than having them based there.  In many cases, that is what airlines do when there is insufficient activity at the base to justify having people based there.  Aer Lingus has early morning departures, or they certainly did have such departures from a number of European cities but the crew members are not based there.  They operate a late flight in from Ireland and an early departure but they stay in a hotel.  It is not impossible to do it.  I would not say that business people will lose out but it does impact on the schedule because it makes it more complex than if one has people and aircraft based there.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh seemed to indicate he did not think there was any particular threat to them immediately, but are those slots at a particular time?  Are they not early-morning and late-evening slots into and out of Heathrow, which would be particularly valuable, given the demand for business passenger flights in and out of Heathrow because, obviously, it is in London?</p></speech>

He did not do any better.  In fact, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, got more guarantees than Mr. O'Leary did, but Deputy McNamara is right.  In fact, he might remember that the slots Aer Lingus had when IAG required them did not include an early-morning departure out of Shannon.  This was changed because clearly IAG has access to a lot of slots at Heathrow and was able to shuffle its slot portfolio to give a better departure time from Shannon into London, an early-morning departure which, from memory, proved to be particularly attractive and made a big difference to the profitability of the route.  That remains the case with Aer Lingus as part of AIG.  It has access to the slot pool that AIG holds through British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus at Heathrow and it can play around with them to make the most efficient use of the slots.  Therefore, I do not think there is a particular risk.  If business recovers - and I think it will - I am pretty sure there will be a Heathrow slot out of Shannon because, certainly from my experience, that was a very successful way of operating out of Shannon.</p></speech>

One expects it will not be business as usual straight away and that airports will consolidate around key hubs.  For Aer Lingus that is Dublin and, perhaps, increasingly Manchester rather than Shannon and Cork.  Obviously, Ireland is not a Schengen state.  Schengen states will pretty soon allow in American passengers who are vaccinated and can show they are vaccinated.  However, am I right in saying there is nothing to stop Ireland doing that tomorrow morning for persons who are vaccinated?  A number of EU member states are allowing in passengers who are either vaccinated or can demonstrate they have immunity through having contracted and recovered from Covid.  Greece, for example, and I think most other southern EU states are essentially allowing flights as of now.  There is nothing to stop us.  It is merely that we are hostage to the zero Covid fanatics in Ireland.</p></speech>

In fact, the common travel area would not inhibit it either because I suspect the UK and the US will reach agreement on arrangements there that will allow vaccinated people to travel as well, given the level of vaccination in both countries.  No, I do not see anything that would stop the Irish Government moving immediately on this issue.</p></speech>

Most of the risks he has taken have paid off, but one cannot live in a zero-risk world.  It is simply impossible.  Mr. Walsh is also an Irishman so he understands Ireland and Irish politics.  That is clear from the multiple references he has made and the fact that he was chairman of a State board.  How does he account for the way in which Ireland became captured by the zero Covid crew in a way that no other European country did and that we became so understandably frightened of Covid but completely risk-averse such that we were frightened of Covid to the exclusion of almost anything else?  It seemed almost impossible to have any other consideration in Ireland for a number of months.</p></speech>

I cannot figure it out.  It has been one of the things that has surprised me most about this.  I thought Ireland would be quite the opposite, given that as a country we have always been so open to travel and given the number of Irish people who have had to move abroad for work, me included.  I have not been able to go back to Ireland.  I have not been in Ireland since February of last year.  I used to travel into and out of Ireland regularly.  I do not understand it.  It is something we have to address.  I think everybody understands that we had to take measures to protect people early on - I do not think anybody would disagree with that - but, given that we have seen things change, we have to move forward and recognise that as advances are made we should start removing the restrictions that are in place.  I do not see what the fear is about allowing people who are vaccinated enter the country.  There is very little risk associated with that, and the data show that.  The number of people who have tested positive, having entered the country and gone into quarantine, is very low: 3% is not a figure I consider to be high in any way; 97% of people were fine.  As I said, the data are consistent.  There is a slightly different but a much bigger database in the UK, where the figure is 2.5%.  The risk associated with that is perfectly manageable for a country like Ireland and a country like the UK without shutting down the economy and putting so many jobs at risk as a result.</p></speech>

That is not unusual.  In fact, in the case of the Dublin-Heathrow service, there are often pilots and cabin crew in hotels in London to enable the early-morning departures out of Heathrow into Dublin, so it is not impossible to do it.  The question is-----</p></speech>

He is one of the country's most eminent experts in aviation from his role as CEO of IAG, Aer Lingus and British Airways.  I am very interested in having a dialogue with him today on some of the issues at hand.</p> <p>  Regarding the 138 cabin crew and 60 ground staff affected by the Aer Lingus decision in Cork, it is deeply regrettable that this has happened.  My personal view is that this was avoidable.  I am delighted to hear Mr. Walsh refer to the attitude to flying that has developed in the Republic of Ireland.  I find it incredibly hard to digest the damage this is doing to our economy, to inward investment in the country and to the outbound tourism aspect, which was very important to many of the tour operators, which this committee has regularly hosted.  Many of them are now going bust, which is shocking.  I think more than 140,000 people work in aviation.</p> <p>  I wish to put a couple of select questions to Mr. Walsh as somebody who has been working very hard behind the scenes to try to advance the reopening of aviation in Ireland.  The first question concerns the digital green certificate, DGC.  According to Mr. Walsh's read of the DGC, how does he think it will work in a situation in which a family of five are flying from somewhere like Cork Airport to, for example, Paris if they are taking a trip to Disneyland?</p><p>What will happen if the two parents are vaccinated but the children are not?  How will it work out when the digital green certificate is implemented by the European Union?</p></speech>

I am pleased to say IATA has a solution for it.  We have a system called Timatic, an Irish colleague of mine is heavily involved with running it.  Timatic is a central database that includes all requirements for travel - these are typically passport and visa requirements - but it has been extended to include health requirements as well.  They can be accessed by airlines.  Governments can put in those requirements.  In many cases, children will not need to show evidence of vaccination to be able to travel with parents, as has already been stated by several countries.  We are developing an app that airlines can integrate into their own apps.  People will not have to go to several different sources.  An Aer Lingus or even a Ryanair customer using a travel app to check in and fly will have this information.  It can all be done through the airline's app.  It will demonstrate on departure that a passenger meets all the requirements for entry to the country to which he or she is travelling.</p> <p>  We are engaging with governments around the world and passengers should be able to demonstrate the information indicating they meet requirements on arrival, as well as when they go through immigration.  That can be done through one person for the entire family or several people could do it.  We have digital solutions either in development or available to us today that will enable people to travel.  We are very conscious at IATA that we must facilitate families when they are travelling.</p></speech>

I have made the point about stakeholder engagement repeatedly to the Minister for Transport and the Minister of State with responsibility for aviation.  As a Government Deputy, I make it categorically clear that this must happen and people like Mr. Walsh must be listened to when it comes to the decision-making process around reopening.  Is the Republic of Ireland, as an island nation on the western periphery of Europe, on a similar trajectory to our European neighbours with the reopening of aviation?</p></speech>

Ireland is still debating some of these matters and it risks being left behind as the rest of Europe starts moving forward.  It is not just when compared with EU countries, and it also risks lagging behind other countries around Europe and the world.</p> <p>  I should say I am not being critical of the Minister for Transport as I have not sought to meet him.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, reached out to me early in my appointment at IATA to say he is available.  I am six weeks in and I have a long list of things to do.  I took the opportunity to appear before the committee.</p></speech>

We have been doing much work on the aviation sector and we want to work to get it reopened as safely as possible.  Mr. Walsh is a key component in that.  We are delighted he took up the offer of appearing before us today.  We hope this meeting will feed into Government policy and we will get common-sense, practical and safe solutions for the reopening of the sector.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh may be able to give a read from a European level or international basis on something to which I have been trying to get established answers but have found incredibly difficult.  I refer to Ireland's connection with the United States of America and the reopening of the air bridge across the Atlantic to North America, including Canada and the United States.  Where does he believe that is going at present?  Is there any evidence to suggest the Commission is close to brokering a deal to lift the presidential ban in order that European passengers may fly to the United States?  I raised the question of the Schengen area in the D&aacute;il and Deputy McNamara joined in that evening as well.  What is Mr. Walsh's knowledge around diplomatic efforts by the Commission to allow transatlantic passage for Irish passengers to the United States?  Will Ireland be excluded as a non-Schengen country and should we, as the transport committee, be watching this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.881" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#J00700"><p>That is a great question.  It is section 212(f) of the US Immigration and Nationality Act that allows the imposition of this restriction.  It was put in place for the Schengen area before it was put in place for Ireland and the UK, and it was approximately a week or two after the US Government imposed the restriction on Schengen countries that it imposed the restriction on Ireland and the UK.  I do not believe Ireland is at risk of being left behind.  I know the US is considering it but I am not sure the appetite is very strong.</p> <p>  There is a move for this to be done on a reciprocal basis but that would be regrettable.  We must recognise there is major value to Ireland in having inbound US tourism.  These people tend to be the most valuable tourists we get into the country.  There is a very short summer season we can take advantage of if we get things moving.  Equally, I understand that as an Irish citizen, I would love to be able to travel to the US because I have business there.  It is not nice being restricted but we must be pragmatic.  The interests of the country are best served by allowing access to Ireland to US citizens with freedom to travel into and outside the US without restriction because they are vaccinated.  Other European countries are certainly going to do that.</p></speech>

We have waited long enough to take action.  This committee, comprising cross-party Deputies from both the Opposition and the Government, has been very vocal in its support for the aviation sector.  It is now time for those at the Cabinet and those within the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, to recognise that the economic damage being done to Ireland by current policies must be seriously considered, particularly now that we are reaching such an advanced stage in the vaccination process.  I thank Mr. Walsh for the responses.</p></speech>

It goes to the balance that we have argued for.  We must balance the protection of lives with that of livelihoods.  The problem is that livelihoods are being damaged significantly and are likely to suffer permanent damage unless we start moving quickly.</p></speech>

I will speak to the horizon for the aviation sector in general.  When do we expect to be back at 2019 levels?  We might be at 43% of those levels this year.  Within that, how does Ireland compare internationally?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.885" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#J01100"><p>It is difficult to say.  The general view is that domestic markets will recover first and we are seeing that.  There is no domestic market in Ireland or the UK<i>per se</i>but if we look at big domestic markets around the world, China is back above where it was in 2019, as is Russia.  The US is pretty much in line with 2019 and having spoken with chief executives in the US industry, they are confident they will have more capacity in the market this summer than they did in 2019.  One could argue that domestic markets have fully recovered.<br/><br/>The view has been that short-haul leisure flights would recover first, built principally on the belief that the EU would open and there would be a common regime across the EU.  It has disappointed many people that we have not seen that.  The area of business that will lag in recovery is long-haul international.  Ireland is principally looking at the US in this regard and we should get moving and put much effort into this.</p><p>We are going to have to work hard from a tourism point of view to convince US tourists to come back to Ireland and to demonstrate to them that they are going to receive the traditional warm welcome.  There is work to be done there.  It is domestic markets first, so that is no help to Ireland.  On short-haul leisure, if we can get the EU working together, there should be some benefit to Ireland but the real benefit is long-haul, and that is transatlantic.</p><p> To be honest, I do not see the Aer Lingus network recovering to where it was in 2019 until 2024 or 2025.  I do not see the US airlines that served Ireland coming back quickly into the market either.</p></speech>

In terms of the level of supports that have been offered so far internationally, we heard from representative groups in Ireland which said very clearly to us that the Irish Government has not provided the scale of support that has been provided by other states.  Mr. Walsh mentioned earlier that this may not be the case, and I would be interested in his perspective on that.  We have the employment wage subsidy scheme in place and there are similar schemes internationally.  How does Mr. Walsh see the transition?  Will there be further cuts across the board?  What types of subsidies and supports will be needed into the future to sustain the sector in its recovery?  What does the future look like in terms of the ask from the industry on state and other supports?</p></speech>

I would say Ireland's was the least attractive of the three but there was not a huge difference between them all.  If I then look at how airlines accessed financial support, the Spanish Government put in place a loan guarantee scheme with Spanish commercial banks, which IAG accessed through Iberia Airlines and Vueling Airlines to the tune of &euro;1 billion.  We saw Aer Lingus get &euro;150 million through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, whereas for Iberia and Vueling it was &euro;1 billion.  From memory, it was &euro;750 million for Iberia and &euro;250 million for Vueling; these are commercial loans but guaranteed by the Spanish state in the event of a default on the part of the company.  British Airways accessed financing through two different schemes in the UK to the tune of about $2.8 billion.  In terms of scale, obviously, Aer Lingus is smaller than British Airways or Iberia, but in terms of scale and importance, I would argue that Aer Lingus is probably of greater economic importance.  Therefore, while Aer Lingus has accessed funding through ISIF, it is not on a similar scale to what is being made available in Spain or the UK.</p></speech>

There is a concern, and it is a reality we experienced last summer, that international travel might contribute to the spread of the virus.  We saw it in the west of Ireland, with busloads of American tourists, and that gave rise to fear and concern among communities.  We need to get to a place where we can give people confidence and assurance that international travel can happen safely.  Are there tools or examples of where that is done well, in Mr. Walsh's experience?</p></speech>

As I said, significant data are now available, and the UK has a bigger database that I have been able to access.  Of the 150,000 people who accessed the UK in that six-week period, 2.5% subsequently tested positive and half of those were in hotel quarantine.</p></speech>

It depends on how people want to present the data.  We can present the data as showing 3% who were infected as opposed to 97% who were not infected, but the evidence is that the vast majority of people were not and the infection rates were very low.  When there is widespread infection in a country, the WHO recommendation is that we should not stop international travel, and that once the virus is in place, banning international travel has little or no impact.</p> <p>  One can argue about the variants of concern, and that is another issue.  Again, there is the technology with regard to the vaccines, and the evidence that is available today shows that most of the vaccines are effective against the variants.  We all know that viruses mutate and that is how viruses stay alive.</p> <p>  The other thing we have to remember is that the deaths which have taken place are tragic and it is a terrible tragedy for all of the families who have suffered as a result of this, but it is not just that people die from coronavirus.  This is something we live with.  People die from flu but we do not stop the economy every winter because of the outbreak of the flu pandemic and because hundreds of thousands of people die across the world.</p></speech>

I am not a big fan of PSOs.  They have a role to play on certain routes where destinations are not going to be served on a commercial basis.  I cannot see anywhere that would apply in Ireland because I think critical connectivity will be provided on a commercial basis.  It is something that governments will look at and a number of governments have introduced PSOs through this.  There is a role for PSOs but I think it is a small, marginal role.</p></speech>

I am sure everything he said will be counterbalanced by NPHET, the Department of Health and the HSE, which will say that public health lies at the core of everything we do.  I concur with Mr. Walsh in his remarks - I am paraphrasing - that we have a repressive regime and that if we are to have access to and involvement in the digital green certificate and if people are fully vaccinated, then there should be no mandatory hotel quarantine and people should be able to come and go freely.  In the context of Mr. Walsh's last remarks on critical connectivity on a commercial basis, does he see a difficulty for us, as an island nation, in terms of connectivity in a post-Covid world?</p></speech>

Certainly, we are not going to have the same network or breadth of network that served Ireland in 2019 for a number of years to come.  For a number of the new destinations that Aer Lingus announced on the transatlantic routes, I cannot see how Aer Lingus will take the risk of reintroducing those for some considerable time.  There was talk about direct air links to China, and I do not think that is going to happen in this post-Covid environment for many years.  There is a risk that some of the connectivity that existed, or that we hoped for, is not going to be there or will not materialise in the same way.  Without question, connectivity will be set back significantly and will take time to recover.  I do not see any way around that, to be honest.</p></speech>

I know from my experience of working with Aer Lingus, the establishment of services to new destinations such as Seattle, San Francisco, which were building up, led to significant volumes of people travelling to Ireland on business.  Those destinations take time to mature to a point where they are financially viable.  Given that the Aer Lingus transatlantic fleet will be a smaller fleet, it means that some of those destinations will not be served for some time to come.  That clearly must have an impact on foreign direct investment because having connectivity is very important.  While the technology we are using this afternoon is great and enables us to do things, it is nowhere near as good as having face-to-face communication.  I do not buy into the idea that all business will now be done over Zoom, Teams or something else because the quality of interaction is nowhere near as good as when people are sitting in the same room.</p></speech>

It is meant to be that; a passport to travel safely.  I should have put on the record at the beginning of the meeting that I received a briefing from Mr. Peter O'Broin and Mr. Simon McNamara of IATA.  I compliment Mr. Walsh on the IATA travel pass video.  I have put it into the chat group and it is something the committee should also explore.  I should have said that at the beginning.  I apologise for that.  </p> <p>  I am concerned over the air bridge for both Europe and transatlantic services in the context of Aer Lingus particularly.  Mr. Walsh smiled at the deal he got with the sale of Aer Lingus.  I believe Senator Craughwell was one of the only ones who opposed the sale of Aer Lingus along with the former Senator, Se&aacute;n Barrett.  Many of us were concerned about the Heathrow slots.  Does Mr. Walsh think that Aer Lingus will hold firm to its connectivity for Ireland and the importance of Aer Lingus to Ireland?  Where does that stand now?  </p></speech>

Obviously, I cannot speak for Aer Lingus or for IAG.  The Senator will have heard some of the comments I made when I was CEO of IAG that I regarded Aer Lingus as the star performer in the group.  We were delighted with the progress we made.  We delivered on all commitments we gave and in fact exceeded them.  We expanded the transatlantic network faster and far beyond what was originally anticipated.  That was under the leadership of Stephen Kavanagh when he was the CEO and then Se&aacute;n Doyle who took over from Mr. Kavanagh, who is now CEO of British Airways.  Aer Lingus still has significant influence in IAG.  However, the reputation of Aer Lingus has been damaged as a result of what Ireland has done and that will take some time to repair.  From my knowledge, I can assure the committee that there is still a great commitment to Ireland on the part of Aer Lingus.</p></speech>

I am very happy to debate and I think we need to challenge NPHET.  It should be open to challenge and we should not be afraid to push back on the decisions it has taken.  I deal with risk or at least I did in my career as an operating pilot and as a CEO.  The attitude to risk of many of these people is very different.  We know we are required to operate in an environment where we are managing risk.  I find it impossible to accept we can have a zero-risk environment.  The impact of that attitude on some of the decisions taken in Ireland has been deeply regrettable.</p></speech>

We have invited him to appear before the committee again and hope he accepts that invitation.</p> <p>  How has the approach by the authorities here damaged Aer Lingus from a practical perspective?  Mr. Walsh said he thought it was highly unlikely that US airlines would come back into Ireland for some time.  When does he expect them back?  He said the supports Spain is giving to Iberia are much larger than the supports being provided here.  I ask him to define that.  What airlines does he expect to see flying into and out of Ireland over the next year or two?  Will we be very dependent on our indigenous airlines?  Ryanair is still based here.  The Irish public still regard Aer Lingus as a national carrier that provides a very good service.  How critical is it that Aer Lingus and Ryanair come through this and are supported in a large way?</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh spoke about a reduction in service.  Is that a reduction in the number of planes that airlines will fly or a reduction in the number of routes?  What do we need to do initially with the reopening?  Obviously, we want a safe reopening and we want it done in a practical way.  As Mr. Walsh said, there may be occasions when quarantining is needed.  However, with vaccinations and empirical evidence on reductions in incidence, quarantining is not needed as a general policy.  Antigen testing is due to come on board.  I know I am asking for considerable detail, but it is very important for Ireland.  We understand how significant the implications are for Ireland, as an island nation.  We have large airlines based here, Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  I know I am asking a lot, but I think it is the key.  </p></speech>

As I said, the recovery is likely to be in domestic markets, short haul and then long haul.  Aer Lingus has significant dependence on its transatlantic market, which has been very successful.  Consequently, the recovery will take longer for Aer Lingus.  My real concern is that the message coming from Ireland has been very negative, much more so than the message coming from other countries.  The attitude has been that anybody travelling into Ireland must be infected and therefore we should not allow anybody in.  I have not witnessed that to the same degree in any other country I have been dealing with.  It has been particularly damaging to the reputation of Ireland as a destination country, which it is.  We depend heavily on inbound traffic.</p> <p>  My point about US carriers is that there was considerable transatlantic competition with many services being provided by US carriers.</p><p>I do not see them providing the same level.  They will serve Ireland but not to the same degree or with the same frequency of service.  It will probably be more on a seasonal than a year-round basis, which is a risk.  There will be a delay in some cases.  It will probably mean that some of the airlines that we are serving would not serve Ireland as a destination or may only serve it seasonally.  Regarding support, if I look at Iberia, it is probably twice the size of Aer Lingus but received five times the level of financial support from the Spanish Government.</p></speech>

There are 140,000 people employed in aviation.  We, as a cross-party committee, will really put to the Government that we need to look at reopening.  By all means have a quarantine, but it has to be in limited cases.  We should look at expanding testing to antigen tests, having PCR tests instead of quarantine, and ensuring that we have a viable and secure airline and connectivity in the future.
