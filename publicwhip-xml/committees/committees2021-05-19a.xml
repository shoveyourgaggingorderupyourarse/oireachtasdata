    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#B00100"><p>I thank the members and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for participating in today's meeting in line with the exceptional circumstances with which we must deal given the Covid-19 pandemic.  I remind them that apart from myself and members of the committee secretariat, all members and the witnesses are required to participate remotely, within the Leinster House complex where possible.  Today's meeting involves consideration of two matters that are of particular interest to the committee.  The first concerns the employment rights and health and safety of content moderators.  In addition, with the easing of the restrictions relating to the pandemic, the committee is keen to explore issues relating to the reactivation of the economy following the disruption caused by the Covid 19 pandemic.  I hope we can fully cover both items during our meeting.</p> <p>  To assist the committee in considering these matters, I am pleased to welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  He is accompanied by two officials from his Department, Mr. Stephen Curry and Mr. Oliver Gilvarry.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references that may be made to other persons in evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such directions.  The Minister's opening statement has already been circulated to members.  I now invite the Minister to make his opening statement.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to discuss the employment of content moderators and the reactivation of the economy in the context of Covid-19.  As the two issues are quite different, I will speak initially about content moderators and then move on to economic issues more generally.</p> <p>  Although it is a new form of work, we can all agree that content moderation plays a vital role in our use of the Internet and in turn in our everyday lives.  It is hard to imagine what the Internet would be like without them.  Content moderators carry out really important work to protect all of us and we need to ensure they are protected properly in their work.  They prevent the wider distribution of explicit and harmful content and I acknowledge there are specific stressors inherent in the type of work they carry out.  I believe it requires appropriate training, competence, ongoing debriefing and supervision within a well-established, safe and healthy system of work.</p> <p>  In late January, following a request from Deputy O'Reilly, I met a group of content moderators and their representatives to hear from them at first hand.  Following the meeting, I wrote to Facebook setting out the concerns raised at the meeting and the company provided a detailed response to my letter.  I believe this has been shared with the committee recently.  There is a strong legislative regime in Ireland to protect all workers regardless of where they work or the type of work they do in terms of their working conditions, including health and safety.  Employers, no matter what sector they are in, have a duty of care towards employees to ensure that a safe working environment is created.  This includes the management of workplace stressors or psychosocial hazards.  As I said, appropriate training must be provided and employers must carry out a risk assessment with a particular focus on potential hazards relating to content moderation work.  Proper risk assessment, along with mitigation measures, is the foundation of all workplace health and safety.  Promoting positive mental health within the workplace is good for the employees and is also a factor in improving overall business performance and productivity.</p> <p>  For this reason, I urge employees to engage in the first instance with their employer to see how their concerns can be resolved at workplace level.  However, any content moderator concerned for his or her health and safety can contact the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, in confidence and can also contact the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, about broader working conditions.  Where necessary, the resolution mechanisms available from the relevant State agencies can be utilised by both employers and employees.  I am aware that the HSA is addressing matters already raised with it.  As members will appreciate, the HSA is independent in the carrying out of its regulatory function and keeps much of that information confidential.  This includes keeping it from me.    </p> <p>  Moving on to the second topic, which is the reactivation of the economy, I am very hopeful that we can return to something close to normality by late summer.  It has been an extremely long road for everyone - citizens, workers, businesses, friends and family - but I think our patience and resilience have been worth it.  The vaccination programme is picking up momentum administering approximately 270,000 vaccines per week.  Nearly 40% of our adult population has had at least one dose now and we hope to have the vast majority of our adult population vaccinated at least once by the end of June and fully vaccinated by end of September.  Members will be aware that the portal is now open to people in their late 40s to register.  </p> <p>  Within the next two weeks, we expect to be in a position to publish a national economic recovery plan - most likely at the end of May or even 1 June.  The plan will provide certainty for businesses and workers by outlining targeted support for sectors which will continue to be most adversely affected by the pandemic.  It will outline the next steps for the emergency pandemic interventions, including what we will do with the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, reaffirming the Government&rsquo;s commitment to avoid a cliff edge.  At the same time, we all understand that for financial reasons, there cannot be a long tail either.  I think members will agree that the three main schemes &ndash; the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS; EWSS; and PUP - compare favourably with what is on offer in other countries.  Members may be aware that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, published our proposals for a new small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, last week.  This is a cheaper quicker alternative to examinership and with the help of the committee, we hope to have the Bill enacted before the summer recess.  This could save a lot of businesses in the autumn that are viable but need to restructure to survive.  </p> <p>  The national economic recovery plan will help to drive a jobs-rich recovery, help people return to work and assist sectors that have been and will continue to be disproportionately affected by the pandemic.  I am thinking of tourism and hospitality, the aviation sector, arts and entertainment.  The plan will also set out our ambition not just to return to pre-pandemic Ireland but to build a better "normal" - a more inclusive society that is equipped to meet head on the twin challenges of digital and green.  Last Friday, I published updated guidance on ventilation and antigen testing to reduce the spread of Covid in the workplace and help people get back to work and businesses to open and stay open.  </p> <p>  The updated work safely protocol, which was developed in consultation with unions and employers, is the most up-to-date public health advice for the workplace.  It sets out the measures required to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace, including information on how to approach the use of antigen testing.  Our advice is still to continue to work from home where possible but this protocol makes sure every workplace has clear and up-to-date guidance.  It gives clear information on how to use antigen testing appropriately in the workplace.  It sets out that these tests should be used as an additional health and safety measure and not as a substitute for any other precautions.  Employers should also consider how they can improve ventilation in workplaces.  Even simple actions like airing rooms or keeping a window open can make a real difference.  Although we intend to vaccinate the vast majority of the adult population by the end of June, the reality is some people cannot or will not take one.  Vaccination is and will remain voluntary so it is important that employers have guidance on how to manage any unvaccinated workers, particularly in customer-facing roles.</p><p>The document gives some information on that but I accept that it will need to be added to in its next iteration.</p><p> I look forward to members' comments and am happy to answer any questions they may have.</p></speech>

I now invite members to discuss both issues with the Minister.  I remind them to use the "Raise hand" function if they wish to contribute and to take it down when they are finished speaking.  We have a rota and a system.  The first person who has indicated is Deputy O'Reilly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#C00300"><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his opening statement and for meeting with the content moderators.  I know they found the meeting to be beneficial.  It would be brilliant if one meeting with the T&aacute;naiste or anybody else resolved the issues they have.  It will not.  This is an ongoing issue.  It is one on which the committee heard from the content moderators, in particular one by the name of Isabella Plunkett, last week.  I appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste may not have had a chance to hear what she had to say.  If he did not, I encourage him to have a look back at the proceedings because she talked from first-hand experience. </p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste will have heard at the meeting from people who have first-hand experience.  We need to look at the way in which these people are working and the work they do.  They are our first line of defence.  However, we have to ask about the level of trauma these people have to suffer in order for social media platforms to be able to function.  Thinking about this logically, if there were a make of car that every time a mechanic fixed he or she broke a finger, we would take it off the road.  I do not know if the T&aacute;naiste has a view as to how viable the business model is if it requires such a level of trauma and if the consequent supports are not put in place to ensure that people have the opportunity to debrief and to decompress after a shift.  Non-disclosure agreements and conditions that prevent workers from telling their spouse or whoever else is at home when they come home in the evening what it is they have been doing all day are archaic.  They have no place in a modern workforce, yet these are the conditions under which these people are working.</p> <p>  I am aware that Facebook wrote back to the T&aacute;naiste and listed the supports in place, but he will be aware that those supports are not available to the content moderators who work for an outsourced platform.  Does he have a view as to whether a similar level of support should be offered to such workers?  I do not think anything could ever mitigate fully what these poor people have to see in the course of their normal work, but does the T&aacute;naiste have a view on a similar level of supports being available for both outsourced and in-house workers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#C00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question and for introducing the content moderators to me because it was very interesting to hear what they had to say.  I think we all agree that they do a very difficult job.  Some of the work they do can be done through artificial intelligence and algorithms but only a small amount of it.  I am not a tech person but I suspect that for the foreseeable future we will need a lot of this work to be done by a human being and a human brain.  Of course, behind a human brain are human emotions.  We need people who will police the Internet and take content down.  We all see the stuff that gets through so we can only imagine the stuff that does not get through, what it is like and the impact it may have on people.  The Deputy will be aware that I wrote to Facebook about this.  It replied.  I have not met representatives of the company in recent months but this matter will be on the agenda the next time I meet them and I will take an interest in it.  The HSA has its role and will carry out its functions as it should.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy O'Reilly's question, my sense is that if people being outsourced to a company or a contractor are doing the same work as the directly employed people within that company, such as Facebook, they should get the same psychological supports and backup as the directly employed workers.  Now, maybe they are doing different work, but if they are doing the same work, they should get the same psychological and well-being supports.  Like many members of the committee, I think, I am not against outsourcing.  The Government does it all the time.  Departments do it all the time, and very successfully.  However, it should not be done by an employer as a means of avoiding obligations or potential legal liabilities.  That is all I will say about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#C00500"><p>I understand I will have an opportunity to contribute again later when we might get another chance to discuss the content moderators.</p> <p>  As for the notion that we will spend our summer outdoors, it would, as people say, be a lovely little country if only we could put a roof over it.  Last weekend, Dublin City Council put a fence around an open space where people gather.  I fully respect that the residents have issues with people gathering outside their houses but I am also conscious that the Government advice is to go outside and spend the summer outdoors.  I raised this with the T&aacute;naiste last week on Questions on Promised Legislation.  We need a plan and it has to involve toilets and bins.  We can put any nice names we want on them, but it is toilets and bins that will be needed in order that people can enjoy the summer outdoors.</p> <p>  It was put to me during the week that it is almost as if the Government is saying, "Irish people, you just cannot have nice things."  That should not be the case.  If we are to have any kind of summer at all, we need to spend it outdoors.  We do not know when we will be able to have everybody indoors together.</p> <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste comment on what happened in Portobello?  I do not want to see that happen in my area.  I want to see residents respected - of course I do - but, for the want of outdoor toilets and bins, an entire area was closed off.  We cannot keep shunting people around and, at the same time, tell them the message is to go outside if, when they go outside, there is nothing there for them except a fence.  Garda&iacute; have to police people trying to get to one area.  That is a waste of their time and a waste of Garda resources.  Somewhere in the city, while garda&iacute; were standing policing a fence, a crime was being committed.  There has to be a plan to marry the two elements because it is not fair to tell people to go outside but not to go to this or that place and then to move them on all the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#C00600"><p>I definitely do not think the solution to these problems is to close off public areas.  I appreciate that the city council had to make the decision it made and I really sympathise with the residents.  The Deputy can imagine what they have experienced.  This was not just outdoor drinking; it was people urinating and defecating near their homes, and I do not think any of us can condone that.  I remember that in my constituency what kept us sane during the pandemic was the Phoenix Park.  I was there nearly every other day.  There was a suggestion at one point that the park was getting too crowded and it might be a good idea to close it.  The Deputy can be absolutely sure that the public representatives in my constituency responded to that very quickly and said the closure of our biggest park and the crowding of everyone into the small greens was not a solution.  That was not going to work at all and, thankfully, the OPW took the decision not to close the park or to restrict numbers into it.</p> <p>  When we talk about an outdoor summer, it will not be outdoors only.  Increasingly, as people get vaccinated, they can meet up indoors.  I still expect we will have indoor dining in July.  The Deputy is totally right about the toilets and bins, and that is the message we are putting across to local authorities.</p> <p>  Next week, we intend to have two memorandums from the Government.  The first will be on the pathway forward regarding international travel, although the new Indian variants are now causing additional concern.  Nonetheless, it will be a pathway towards the restoration of international travel over the next few months.  The second memo is being brought to us by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, and is all about live events and a whole set of trial and pilot events in June and July - sporting, artistic, musical and cultural, outdoor and indoor - with limited capacity.  We are making those plans and I think that will be good news to people who are dying to see a live event, as I know the Deputy is.  I am too.  It will be of some relief to people working in the sector who have been unable to work and to do their art, essentially, for nearly a year now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#C00700"><p>Yes, but, with respect, other European cities can manage this.  Dublin is a beautiful city.  It is by far and away one of the loveliest places on earth, in my opinion, so why can we not have outdoor spaces that are similar to those available to citizens in cities right across Europe?</p><p>We have many open spaces.  I was really disappointed to see Portobello Plaza closed and to think this might happen to other places, given that we will be spending the summer outdoors.  For those people who will not be dining indoors and who want to stay outdoors, there should be spaces where they can gather, not just places to meet when spending money.  It seems as if those places are disappearing.  We are becoming less and less like other European cities and I do not think that is a good way for us to go.  It comes down to basic facilities such as bins and toilets.  They will make the outdoors much more liveable.  We would like to see some concrete action on that.  I appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste has heard the point but we would like to see more of an instruction being given to local authorities to ensure this is done.</p><p> On the rules regarding indoor dining, I am not a scientist and do not pretend to be, but it makes no sense to me that this is decided purely on the basis of the type of business.  An hotel with a small restaurant and low ceilings will be able to open, whereas a restaurant with high ceilings and good ventilation will not.  The same is true of a pub that has the capacity to put dividers between the tables and so on.  I appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste has met people in the hospitality industry but they are scratching their heads.  If it is going to be based on size, let it be based on size, or if it is going to be based on ventilation, let it be based on ventilation, but that should be based on scientific evidence.  They have not seen evidence and nor have I.</p><p> Will the T&aacute;naiste offer an explanation for the decision, or even some comfort that such businesses will be able to open at the same time provided that they have the facilities?  Nobody wants 100 people to be squashed into a small room with low ceilings.  We are all a bit risk averse at this stage to that kind of scenario.  Nevertheless, a large pub or restaurant with high ceilings and good ventilation is surely as safe as a similar type of venue within an hotel.  I believe it is possible to do it based on size.  It has been based on size or ventilation in other European countries, rather than simply on the type of business that it happens to be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#D00200"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the decision to open hotels before restaurants was based on public health advice and was in line with the advice from NPHET.  We are often criticised for not following that advice and this is one occasion on which we did so to the letter, except for the fact that hotels are opening a few days earlier than NPHET suggested.  It is for a practical reason, not a scientific reason.  I will be frank with the Deputy about that and I have been with the industry too.</p> <p>  We have never closed hotels' dining rooms.  During level 5, when we were all locked down at home, hotels remained open for essential reasons, such as for people who had to stay there because they had nowhere else to stay, and we never closed their restaurants or dining rooms.  If we were to close them now, we would be closing them for the first time.  This was never a problem before.  The problem now arises only because there is a disparity between the way we are treating hotel restaurants and other restaurants.  If we were to turn around and close them now, however, it would not make sense.  We would be saying that people can be served their meals in their rooms only.  I hope and expect that the gap will be for only a couple of weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#D00300"><p>I am not suggesting there should be a delay in opening hotels and I am aware they have been open throughout the pandemic, providing food and essential provisions for essential workers.  Would it be possible to carry out ventilation tests, as was done with classrooms such that classrooms were not all deemed either okay or not okay? Could tests be provided on the extent to which restaurants might be able to accommodate people?  Could the Government examine that?  About 80% of restaurants cannot provide outdoor dining, so they are very anxious, as the T&aacute;naiste will know.  For those restaurants that might have the facilities, with high ceilings, ventilation and so on, could consideration be given to allowing them to reopen at the same time?  I fully appreciate that hotels have been open throughout and do not suggest they should be closed as some kind of catch-up exercise.  In the case of restaurants that have the facilities, would it be possible to give consideration to what I outlined?</p></speech>

My priority now, rather than having a complicated set of criteria for a two or three-week period, is to get the decision to allow restaurants and pubs to open indoors.  If they knew they were going to able to do that in the first week or so of July, that two or three-week period might be more acceptable.  I would be concerned that if we came up with a strict regime to allow them to half-open indoors, they might be stuck with that for months.</p></speech>

The role of content moderator is very challenging.  Ms Isabella Plunkett told the committee last week of the effect it had had on her personally and how it had started to have serious impacts on her life outside her job.  She described the horrible dreams she has and the anguish it causes her, and stated she has had to take the step of taking antidepressants.  Dealing daily with hate speech, racism, images of child exploitation is not a job that anyone should have to do but, unfortunately, it is necessary.</p> <p>  In my opinion, there is a moral responsibility on Facebook to ensure, at the very least, that content moderators are very well looked after.  Facebook is one of the richest companies in the world, worth almost $1 trillion.  It is clear it can well afford to treat staff equally and ensure proper supports are in place well beyond weekly wellness sessions, and to pay them fairly.  If the T&aacute;naiste gets an opportunity in the coming weeks to view a recording of last week's meeting, I encourage him to do so.  The culture of fear that Ms Plunkett described, with content moderators afraid to speak out due to non-disclosure agreements, is quite frankly sickening.  I strongly urge the Government to take action, meet representatives of Facebook and demand it immediately address the issue.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's comments that he intends to meet the company.  If possible, will he outline when he expects that to happen?</p> <p>  Everybody I speak to in hospitality, SMEs or the wider economy acknowledges the substantial and unprecedented supports the Government has put in place while also recognising that despite these supports, thousands of businesses throughout the country remain under significant pressure due to a crisis not of their making.  I have concerns about the debt that businesses are carrying, particularly in the case of SMEs.  The debt warehousing scheme is a very welcome initiative that will improve short-term cash flow for SMEs.  There is no question but that the scheme is very welcome but the timeframe of 12 months is a short period in which to resolve cash flow issues as we emerge from the pandemic, and that needs to be examined.  I appreciate that outstanding liabilities can be paid off following three years at a relatively low interest rate of 3%, but it would save SMEs having to go to financial institutions, where it is difficult to get funding, if the 12-month period could be extended to 24 months.  I would appreciate hearing the T&aacute;naiste's views on that.</p> <p>  The employment wage subsidy scheme is scheduled to run until the end of June.  It has been run at considerable expense to the State but strong consideration needs to be given to extending it until, at the minimum, the end of September and possibly beyond.</p><p>I speak to business owners in Galway city every day.  The scheme is essential for restaurants, hotels and bars, as it gives them the opportunity to rebuild while limiting their expenses.  All members want businesses to survive, rebound from the crisis and develop and grow again.  If we can make the extra investment now, it may prove to be the difference needed for thousands of businesses across the country to get back on their feet and give them the window of opportunity to ensure they can become sustainable before supports are removed.</p></speech>

I usually meet them at intervals of six months to a year, as Facebook is a major employer and taxpayer in Ireland.  I am sure a meeting will happen in the next few months.</p> <p>  On tax warehousing, I hear what Senator Crowe is saying.  It would be strange if we were telling businesses to get Government backed low-cost loans when we could just extend tax warehousing.  That might be the most effective thing for them in terms of cash flow.  It is a matter for the Minister for Finance, as the Senator knows, but I know the Minister quite well and we have had a number of conversations on this issue.  No decision will be made until 1 June.  That is all I can say for now.  I understand the point the Senator made and I agree with it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#E00500"><p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the committee.  The meeting we had with the content moderators was harrowing for all of us.  I congratulate Deputy O'Reilly on having brought the matter to our attention and facilitating their meeting with us and with the T&aacute;naiste, whom I thank for meeting them.  Heinous crimes are being committed in the world, in Ireland and elsewhere.  As the T&aacute;naiste said, these crimes often involve child abuse, rape, torture, murder and God knows what else.  Today, we are talking about supporting content moderators.  I do not know how any human being can survive being exposed to this kind of material, all day every day, without becoming seriously damaged, while not receiving intense support.</p> <p>  Facebook could not continue without the work of the moderators.  I think the T&aacute;naiste said that some of this content is getting through in spite of the work of the moderators.  Is there an issue regarding the investigation by police forces, not just in Ireland but all over the world, of crimes committed and their recordings being put online?  There are real victims out there.  I know some of these crimes occur in war zones, countries without governments and failed states, but much of it is probably happening in the so-called developed world.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste will use his good offices at European level and beyond to get governments to chase this material down and prosecute those who put it online, inasmuch as this can be done.  That is not to take away from the content of our meeting today, which is to support the content moderators in every way possible, but what is happening behind the scenes is awful.  I think there are 1,900 moderators working full time in Ireland trying to deal with this material.  That shows the vast scale of the horrific stuff that is going on.  It strikes me that it is important to go beyond what is happening here.</p> <p>  On the issue of opening the economy, the announcement made by the T&aacute;naiste yesterday about supports for people in non-rateable businesses working from home is very welcome.  It is a matter on which several people have rang me about from time to time.  The extension of the small business assistance scheme to such people is very welcome.  I told a number of people about this yesterday and they were very pleased because they have been under a lot of pressure.  I know the amount of money involved is small, but it is very welcome.  When does the T&aacute;naiste expect that to be up and running?  The press release stated that it would be shortly but he might let us know when.</p> <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste comment on the announcement by Aer Lingus yesterday, which affects Cork and Shannon airports?  Aer Lingus has closed its Shannon operations completely.  In Cork there is work taking place on the runway to coincide with the temporary closure of the base there.  It is a concern and I ask the T&aacute;naiste to comment on it.</p> <p> The pandemic has thrown up all kinds of different issues.  Driver theory tests are being cancelled left, right, and centre.  I know it is not the T&aacute;naiste's area, but people need to drive to work and take part in businesses.  It has been put to me that if the theory tests were to be put off until the company running them has the opportunity to get organised, people could start to do the driving lessons first and do the driver theory test afterwards.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, people must do the theory test first but many people cannot do it and are put out by that.</p> <p>  Another area which is related to this, is about people involved in business and industry needing a small public service vehicle licence.  There was a hiatus for a year during which the requirement was suspended but it now in place again and &euro;2,000 is being sought from self-employed people who are involved in taxi tours, limousine and car hire.  These people tell me they will not have business until May 2022.  They are being asked to pay &euro;2,000 for a licence they cannot use.  This is a business issue which I take the opportunity to bring to the Minister's attention.</p> <p>  Those are the two main points I wanted to raise.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for the work he is doing during these very challenging times.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#E00600"><p>Deputy Stanton makes a good point about the content that is posted online.  There is a criminal justice element to this.  I do not know whether there are protocols that Internet platforms follow and whether they simply take this content down or report it to the authorities in the relevant country.  I will check that because one would think they would have a responsibility in that regard.</p> <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, is working on the online safety legislation and the creation of an online safety commissioner, which is long overdue.  There should be a protocol for the platforms to report potentially illegal content to the relevant authorities, but it is the world wide web and that is not easily done.</p> <p>  On the small business assistance scheme for Covid, SBASC, we anticipate that will open for applications on Friday.  However, just in case something goes wrong, I will say that, officially, it will open next week.  If all goes to plan, however, it will open on Friday and will be run through the local authorities.  The closing date for applications will be 21 July, so businesses have a decent amount of time to make their application.  The scheme applies to any business that had a turnover in excess of &euro;50,000 a year and whose turnover has declined by 75% or more.  These businesses can get a grant of &euro;4,000 to help with their costs.  It is no longer limited to rateable premises, so it includes non-rateable premises and people working from home or a hot desk.</p> <p>  Many people would have heard about the needs of wedding planners, photographers, travel counsellors and on-course bookmakers.  They would largely be covered by this scheme.  I recognise there is an issue with very small businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;50,000.  In order to help them out, we are reopening an old scheme called the micro-enterprise assistance scheme.  That will give very small businesses a grant of up to &euro;1,000 to help with their costs.  That will be run through local enterprise offices, LEOs.  Separate from that, the Minister, Deputy Martin, and I are working on something for the events sector, which is still in real difficulty.</p> <p>  What we expect to do from quarter 3, starting in July, is to move away from different sectoral supports to something that is across the board.  We brought in the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, which are great but had many gaps.  We then created about ten or 20 different schemes to fill those gaps.  Ideally, what we will do from July onwards is to have a single scheme that fits all firms.  However, as we all know, one size does not fill all, so we will probably find we will have the same problem again.  Hopefully, this will not be an issue because businesses will be open and trading.  It should not be as big an issue as it is now in any event.</p> <p>  On Aer Lingus, yesterday's news was extremely unwelcome.</p><p>I met representatives of Aer Lingus in the last couple of weeks.  I was aware that the company planned to do some restructuring but it did not give us any details.  Understandably, it has to give those to its employees first.  The closure of the cabin crew base in Shannon was not expected.  It is down to the pandemic and the fact that people are just not travelling.  It is also down to the restrictions the Government imposed.  It would be remiss of me not to point out that there are many Members of the Oireachtas who still do not believe those restrictions went far enough.  The decision would have been even worse had we gone along with the calls made by some Members.</p><p> Aer Lingus and the other airlines are receiving very substantial support, millions of euro, every week through the wage subsidy scheme.  Airports have also received financial support.  There is no shortage of money going into aviation from government.  I believe it is in the hundreds of millions of euro at this stage.  We have had conversations with airlines about paying them to keep certain strategic routes open but that is not something they are particularly interested in, aside from the fact that this would run into state aid rules and competition rules.  They want to fly their aeroplanes with passengers on them.  They do not want to be paid to fly empty planes.  We are not New Zealand or Qantas.  In the real world, aeroplanes can be moved out of Ireland very easily to places like Manchester.  That is one of the consequences of the very strict travel restrictions we have in Ireland.</p><p> I do not regret imposing those restrictions, by the way.  We have one of the lowest death rates per million population in Europe.  Only Finland and Denmark have seen fewer deaths per million than Ireland, and some of that is down to our very strict travel rules and the fact that we are an island.  However, they have real consequences for real people, including not being able to see families and friends who live abroad and the loss of jobs in tourism and aviation.  The sooner we can get back to flying, the better.  However, we still stand the risk of reseeding the virus into Ireland and bringing in variants and we cannot ignore that risk.  There is real concern around the Indian variants in particular coming from the UK and we have to keep a close eye on that.  </p><p> I will have to pass on the driver test issues and small public service vehicles.  I could give the Deputy an answer but it would probably be wrong.  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, to get in touch with him on that.</p></speech>

I particularly welcome the introduction of examinership-lite and the new approach to work, sick pay, the living wage and so on.  We are seeing the Department responding to a changing environment.</p> <p>  Is the use of antigen testing rather than PCR tests before boarding flights in prospect?  A case is being made that it is being done elsewhere.  </p> <p>  We know changes to corporate taxation are coming.  The challenge for Ireland as we come out of this is to build long-term resilience.  That will involve embedding climate and circular resilience, building a sharing economy and building lifelong learning and digital and remote skills.  These are all changes that we need to make.  To what extent is there an effort under way to mobilise the capacity of the Department's agencies to address these longer term structural changes?  It will need agencies and educational institutions to help companies make the shift.  How will that be approached.  There is always the risk that the urgent will squeeze out the important but there is no doubt that we have to change our model and build new sources of competitive advantage.</p></speech>

NPHET and the Chief Medical Officer do not like it, while the chief scientific officer, Professor Ferguson, is a big fan.  The Government is not ruling it out but for now, we have PCR testing for international travel.  We are not ruling out a move to antigen testing but, without rehearsing the arguments, there are advantages and disadvantages.  The obvious advantage is that antigen tests are cheaper and quicker and will pick up people who are in their infectious stage of the virus where they are shedding virus and are transmissible.  On the downside, they miss a lot of positives and negatives and can give false reassurance.  Given that we are making so much progress with the vaccines, I hope we might not need tests at all.  Perhaps we will get to the point where we can say that being fully vaccinated is enough and not require people to have any form of test.  That is where I would like to be but we have to figure that out between now and next week when the Government agrees its proposals on international travel.</p> <p>  On the wider strategic point, in fairness, the agencies and Department are doing as the Deputy described, even though we have been extremely busy firefighting and dealing with the pandemic over the last year.  Since we have not been engaging in many of the normal activities, such as trade missions and travelling around the country attending major events, we have had a bit of time to do some more strategic thinking.  The remote working strategy was a reflection of that.  An artificial intelligence strategy will come out quite soon.  IDA Ireland also has a new strategy.  Like everyone, the Department and its family of agencies have used the downtime created by the pandemic to do some forward thinking and insurance is part of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1659" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021051900002#F00400"><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his time and his work to date.  Great supports have been provided, in fairness.  My son, who is a student, had a part-time job and he benefited from the PUP which kept him sane.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for the work on the PUP, which was put in place pretty quickly, so well done.</p> <p>  On Facebook, I have received letters from various people.  I had meetings with members of Foxglove and we raised the issue in the committee.  Given that Facebook does not directly employ these moderators, surely there is an onus on the recruitment agency, the company that employs them, and it should be put under pressure to provide proper services and reports for its employees.  Is that something we can look at?  There is a loophole for Facebook because if it is not directly employing these staff, it is not directly responsible for them.  What are their official employers, the agencies that recruit them, doing to support these young people and their mental health?  These are young people because there are no old people in these jobs.  I am too old to get a job as a moderator.  We will let down our young people if we do not get proper structures and supports in place for these content moderators.  Prevention is better than a cure.  All members feel very strongly about this issue.  I will not go on about it; I just wanted to make the point about the middleman.</p> <p>  On local enterprise offices, LEOs, there are more than 248,000 small businesses in Ireland with fewer than ten employees.  That is a huge number of jobs and they are the heart and soul in much of the country.  These companies are often much more reliable than the bigger guys who might let us down by leaving and setting up in other countries, as happened yesterday.  Small businesses are often high quality family companies that take good care of staff.  We should support them more.  The LEOs have done amazing work throughout the pandemic to keep small businesses afloat.  They are under serious pressure, however, and it is clear from my meetings with them that they would love to have extra staff and supports. </p> <p>  On food producers, we are importing a lot of food that we could produce here.  For example, potatoes and garlic are coming from China, Israel and England.  We have a lot of great land that should be used more for growing food, not only mass producing beef and dairy.  We should strengthen our labelling for food production.  Under the current system, a company can import anything it likes, do something small with it, wrap it up and make it look as though it was made in Ireland.  We need to have stronger labelling for food made in Ireland.  I am aware of this from my sister's business which produces cheese.</p><p> If we strengthened labelling, we would strengthen Irish food producing companies. Also, because of the climate emergency, carbon footprint and all of those things, there has never been a better time to have a huge push to buy Irish.  Back in the 1980s there was a great buy Irish campaign and it is time to have another one.  I say to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that a good buy Irish campaign on social media and national media might not be the worst spending that we could do.</p><p>  I cannot emphasise how important Shannon Airport is to the entire region.  The 120 jobs that were lost yesterday are devastating for the families affected.  A lot of those workers have been loyal to Aer Lingus for a long time and it is disappointing to see the lack of loyalty that has been displayed by Aer Lingus to Cork, Shannon or to their staff.  More important is the ripple effect the airport has on a huge region through the generation of many thousands of jobs in the tourism sector.  It is well known that 95% of the people who fly into Dublin go somewhere else and do not spend their money here.  However, the people who come into Shannon and Cork are the people who stay and spend money here.  They keep businesses open and keep people living in rural regions.  If we are serious about regional rebalance I urge the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to sit around a table because they really need to see how important the Shannon and Cork airports are to a huge area of this country.  We cannot talk about extending runways in Dublin while there are no flights coming out of Shannon Airport.  We need those flights to England to connect us with the rest of the world and I cannot emphasise enough how important that is.  They are essential for our mental health in the region, as well as our economic health and it is important that we are given hope.  I believe that the Taoiseach is meeting some people but the four Ministers need to get their thinking caps on and decide what to do specifically for Shannon Airport as it has zero flights at the moment.  We need Shannon Airport to resume flights and thrive again.  When people come to Ireland, the east coast is great but the west has the Wild Atlantic Way and the most visited spots in Ireland such as the Cliffs of Moher and Adare.  The region is massive and, therefore, it is important that the four Ministers I mentioned have an emergency meeting.</p></speech>

Whoever the employer is they have a duty of care whether it is Covalen, Facebook or anyone else.  Under the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012, if one is taking on agency workers, one has to give them the same protections as the people who are directly employed by one.  The same basic working conditions certainly apply.</p> <p>  On the LEOs, again I very much agree.  We are scaling them up.  We are staffing them up.  They have an extra &euro;5 million in their budget this year and we have extended their remit.  They are now responsible for everything ranging from flood relief to businesses to all the new schemes that we have set up.  I do want to keep scaling them up over the next couple of years but I want to do so in a way that is manageable.  Sometimes one can scale up an agency or public body too quickly, ask them to do too much too soon and then things fall over.  So I want to be able to scale up but to do it right.</p> <p>  On the labelling, I am a big fan of Tola cheese, as the Senator knows, and I hope that company is going well.  As labelling is an EU matter under the Single Market, we do not have full control over how things are labelled and how they are not but we have input into the EU.  There are things that producers can do voluntarily but in terms of what the law is around labelling that is a Single Market issue and it is done at a European level.  It is something, however, in which I certainly have an interest as trade Minister.</p> <p>  Finally on Shannon, as the Senator will be aware, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is going to meet Aer Lingus today.  He is going to ask them to defer their decision to close the cabin crew base at least until Aer Lingus sees the Government's plan for aviation, which will be out next week.  What the company is saying, and said in its letter to me on the redundancies, is that it is not just about the pandemic and the travel restrictions.  The airline is also saying that the base has been inefficient for quite some time even before the pandemic.  I think that needs to be explored with it because we would like to see the decision deferred.  If the decision goes ahead, we are going to want to talk to airlines about how we can incentivise them to return.  Airlines are very nimble and bases that are closed one month can often be re-opened the next year and we have seen that particularly with Ryanair.  I know that when I was the Minister responsible for tourism - long, long ago - removing the travel tax really helped to get new routes into the country and frequency scaled up.  The travel tax is now gone but we are going to examine what incentives we can put in place to encourage airlines to return and routes to return.  The Ministers, Deputies Donohue and Eamon Ryan, and I actually spoke about that yesterday just after the Cabinet meeting.  We have started that initial discussion already but all those things will only work when people are allowed to fly and that is the bottom line.</p></speech>

I must record my alarm that the company in question happens to be a subsidiary of a company that is in receipt of very significant State contracts.</p> <p>  With regard to what the Government can do on this, I seek the T&aacute;naiste's view of non-disclosure agreements, the withholding of those from workers and whether they should be published.  Also, should content moderation be regulated as hazardous activity?  Should content moderation be recognised in the health and safety regulation of this country? </p></speech>

I cannot imagine why anyone would be expected to sign any sort of agreement yet not have it.  How do you know you are actually adhering to the agreement yourself if you only get to read the thing once?  If they are not giving a copy of it, that is outrageous.  Any person of course should have a copy of any agreement that he or she ever signs.</p> <p>  It is important to say that non-disclosure agreements cannot be used to prevent content moderators from raising issues of concern about their working conditions or their health and safety concerns.  Non-disclosure agreements tend to be about confidentiality and not breaching confidentiality.  They cannot be used to stop people from raising legitimate concerns about their legal rights and entitlements or health and safety conditions.  Again, without knowing what is in these agreements it is hard to comment on them in any detail.</p> <p>  As for the issue the Senator has raised around health and safety regulation, I will give it some thought.  That is the first time it was raised with me as a possibility that we could reform our health and safety laws in that regard.  We always have to be willing to update our laws as the world of work is changing all the time.  That is something to which I will give some thought and on which I will consult the HSA.  </p></speech>

Obviously he is aware of the serious concerns that were articulated by some organisations in the retail and hospitality sectors on the ability to take back staff and to have a sufficient supply of staff for reopening.  Certainly our Sunday newspapers and a lot of radio airtime have been given over to the issue in recent days.  What is going to be done for these sectors?  What are the issues with these sectors that they cannot get staff?  Is it pay or skills?  Is it time that we had a proper joint labour committee for the retail and hospitality sectors to enable us to talk through those issues?  Some of the issues arise because the pay rate is the national minimum wage or barely above it, so there are difficulties in attracting workers back.</p></speech>

We are in a very different place now than we were when we did the reopening last summer.  I remember hearing last summer lots of anecdotal evidence from employers saying they could not get people back to work because the difference in what they were getting from the pandemic unemployment payment and what they would get for working 30 or 40 hours a week.  Essentially, it would not be enough to encourage them to come back to work.  In the end, however, I did not see very many shops or restaurants that could not reopen.</p> <p>  I am not actually convinced yet that people will not go back to work.  We are seeing the number of people on the pandemic unemployment payment falling fast.  This needs to be assessed in a few weeks' time.  There will always be a small number of people who, for whatever reason, do not accept their job back.  I think, however, the majority will.  It is probably too soon to come to any conclusions about that yet.  Let us see where we stand in terms of the numbers on the pandemic unemployment payment in July and August.  We will have a better read then.  We could be down to maybe 100,000 people.  That is a better base from which to understand this.</p></speech>

That is all set out in law.  They are being challenged in the Supreme Court and we will have to see the outcome of that case.  I hope it will be that these stand up constitutionally and legally.  In that case, we can have more of them.</p> <p>  I would like to see them exist in the meat sector, for example, which is an area of ongoing concern.  There are also plans for them in childcare and we have a successful one in construction.  Much of this will depend on what happens in the Supreme Court and as to whether these stack up constitutionally.</p> <p>  I believe in the voluntarist system.  It is better that we have a system where employers, unions and employees agree to these arrangements rather than having them imposed.  If the State were to do anything, I would rather see it raise the floor for everyone rather than for certain sectors and not others.  Whether it is the living wage or sick pay, I want to do it for everyone and not different sectors.  I do not see why that would not be good public policy.</p></speech>

There has been no reference to it in the contributions so far.  There are no easy answers as to what the Government can do.  It has to act, however.  We know that last December when the economy opened up, the unemployment rate was at 53% for those aged between 15 and 24 years.  There will be no going back to normal for a long time, particularly for young workers.  What are the T&aacute;naiste's thoughts on that?</p> <p>  We now have a situation where workers in certain sectors are forced to take unpaid internships in order to get a start in their chosen career.  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe this is acceptable?</p></speech>

It has affected men differently to women and younger people differently to older people.  Older people have borne the brunt in terms of death and illness from the pandemic.  Young people have borne the brunt in terms of the economic impact, losing jobs, loss of income and the loss of the opportunities to do the things that younger people want to do which is to meet friends and find a life partner.  All those things have been horribly interrupted in the past year.</p> <p>  I do not like the idea of saying men are more affected than women or older people more affected than younger people.  When one examines it, different groups are affected in different ways.  Even when it comes to gender, men are more likely to have died from Covid and twice as likely to have ended up in ICU.  Women have been more adversely affected by domestic violence, mental health issues and the burden of caring.  It is absolutely the case that young people have been affected in a particular way.  It is an economic way as well as other ways.</p> <p>  The figure around youth unemployment is often misleading.  When people hear of 50% or 60% youth unemployment, they think that means that 50% or 60% of all young people are unemployed.  That is not the case at all.  When somebody is in education or training, they are not counted.  The actual youth unemployment rate is 22%.  I accept that is very high and is about double the average for the whole population.  However, probably the best statistic is the loss of employment.  The numbers employed who are young is down about 14%.  The numbers employed who are middle aged or older is down about 6%.  That would give a more accurate reflection as to what has happened.  It is because young people are disproportionately employed in areas like retail, construction and hospitality which are closed.  Construction is back open while retail and hospitality will reopen.  That will deal with most of the problem but by no means all of it.  That is why we need to do more.</p> <p>  As to what we can do, some of it is around better terms and conditions like the move to the living wage.  One has to have a job, of course, before one gets that.  That is why we need to make sure we do it right.  Education and training opportunities are another area.  I am proud that we have more people from more diverse backgrounds in third level and further education than ever before in the history of the State.  That has been as a result of the great work done by the past two Governments, one of which included the Senator's own party.  We need that to continue.  These are the angles we will go on.  Getting the economy back open is how most people will get their jobs back.  That will bring about the biggest fall in youth unemployment, as well as a focus on education and training, and ensuring people have opportunities.</p> <p>  The unpaid internships need to be examined.  I have done it myself and I have had unpaid interns, as the Senator might have too.  I found it beneficial.  There is a big difference, however, between doing something for a few weeks and unpaid labour for an entire year.  We probably need some regulation in this area but I have not quite had a chance to examine it yet.</p></speech>

At this stage, surely we should not be sending the kind of signal that would be sent by extending IDA Ireland to Israel.  Instead, we should be doing the very opposite in terms of the signal that we send internationally.</p></speech>

That is not a political decision.  It is not one that crossed my desk or I signed off on.  IDA Ireland has its own legal authority in these areas.  It was done for good reasons because we have a significant trading relationship with Israel.</p> <p>  My general approach to these things is that we should continue to engage with states.  Sometimes we have trade boycotts.  However, as the Deputy knows himself, there are many states with which we could cut off links that people do not talk about enough.  Israel tends to be the focus of campaigns for boycotts around trading links.  There are many other countries, however, that have serious questions to answer such as Venezuela, Cuba and even some countries in eastern Europe.  For reasons I do not understand, people seem to be silent about these.</p></speech>

I agree with that as both a formal legal position and a moral position.  However, we heard last week that that is precisely what is happening.  The existence of the NDAs, which the workers do not know the exact contents of, is held over them to prevent them from speaking out, talking to unions and so on.  Would the T&aacute;naiste agree that NDAs should be published so that everybody can see what is involved and so that there is full transparency?</p></speech>

As they are agreements the workers have signed, it would then be up to them to decide whether they want to publish details of them.  I would like to see it.  There are reasons NDAs exist.  They are often good reasons relating to protecting people's privacy and confidentiality.  I have worked in jobs in the area of medicine where there were rules around these issues for good reasons.  I would not like to think that NDAs are being used to impose a chilling effect on workers or for them to feel that they are silenced and cannot raise concerns about their rights, entitlements and health and safety.  The short answer to the question is that I would like to see them but it would not be for them to be published publicly.  When an agreement is signed between two parties, it is for them to decide whether to publish them.  I would like to see the content.</p></speech>

A general point that was raised about the conditions facing content moderators was, in effect, the two-tier workforce, with those who work directly for Facebook and have access to proper psychiatric counselling and so on and those who work for various outsourcing companies, such as Covalen and others, who do not have access to that, to wellness coaches and so on.  There are two groups of workers who are being treated in discrete ways as a result of being employed in two different ways.  Would the T&aacute;naiste agree that all of the workers doing the same work should be brought in-house to Facebook so that they have a direct relationship with Facebook and it can be held responsible for their terms and conditions and so on?</p></speech>

It is quite common in business and in the public sector to have core-flex arrangements, with core workers who are needed all the time, then you can flex up or down depending on needs that arise.  That is often done through agencies or outsourcing arrangements.  That should be their purpose.  Their purpose should not be to deny people doing the same work the same standards of protection when it comes to their health and safety and well-being.</p></speech>

I have a final question to give the Minister a chance to clarify an earlier remark he made about Covid deaths.  He said that Ireland had the third lowest number of Covid deaths in the EU and mentioned Finland and Denmark as being lower.  I checked those statistics and it seems that Cyprus, Malta, Estonia and the Netherlands all have lower rates of death, which still puts us in the lower half, at seventh lowest rather than third lowest.</p></speech>

The announcement yesterday was catastrophic for the reason.  The regional balance we talk about will be in tatters if Shannon is not protected.  The T&aacute;naiste said that the Minister is meeting with Aer Lingus today.  There needs to be a better Government intervention.  The T&aacute;naiste said that there was a problem in the regional airports before the pandemic.  I understand that 87% of flights were going from Dublin Airport before the pandemic.  We all understand where we are with the pandemic but we need a plan when we come out of the pandemic for the regional airports.  The Shannon-Heathrow route is crucial for families who live in the mid-west with family abroad and it is also crucial for the foreign direct investment companies that we were lucky enough to attract to the Limerick, Shannon and mid-west region.  This cannot just be left to one Minister.  I am concerned about the Minister with responsibility for aviation policy.  Is his plan not to intervene?  I ask the T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach to personally intervene in this.  I cannot emphasise how important that is, especially the Aer Lingus Shannon to Heathrow route.</p></speech>

I have met the company in the past couple of weeks.  I will get involved again as Minister with responsibility for enterprise.  It is part of my responsibility, in my mind, to make sure that we have good business connectivity from the mid-west to Britain, Europe and America.  The same goes for Cork and other airports.  I will get involved in this aviation issue and am involved in it already.  It would be remiss of me not to point out that Aer Lingus, in its statement, called out our strict travel restrictions as a reason for this base being closed.  There are parties in the D&aacute;il which thought we should have much stricter restrictions.  I understand that it is still the policy of many parties in the D&aacute;il to have even stricter travel restrictions than we have now.</p></speech>

We could be here all day talking about how that happened and who is responsible, but it was lost in any event and it took eight years to get it back.  The issue of connectivity is centrally connected to the issue of jobs.  The T&aacute;naiste and I represent neighbouring constituencies.  Dublin Airport is located in my constituency and it is right beside the Taoiseach's constituency.  We know how important the aviation jobs are.  I echo the issues that were raised today with regard to the need for a plan.  There needs to be a real sense of urgency about this because what could be lost in the space of a couple of months could take years to be recovered.  There is a genuine fear.  It is not just about the jobs, although they are so important, it is also about connectivity.  I do not want to go through it but wanted to put it into the T&aacute;naiste's head that when a route is lost, you lose it quickly and get it back really slowly.  Anyone involved in aviation could tell you that.</p> <p>  I will go back to the issue of content moderators.  The discussion that we are having is interesting and welcome because this is a new type of work.  It is hazardous work, a point which was made previously.  It is a type of work that just did not exist when I was young.  It requires its own set of guidelines.  A joint labour committee may be an interesting way to approach it and there may be other ways.  Separate to it being something new, exotic and interesting, we have the issue of these non-disclosure agreements.  Fionnuala N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in from the Communication Workers Union, which does brilliant work in this space along with Foxglove, cited the chilling effect that these non-disclosure agreements have.  Your boss might give you an agreement, with two minutes to read and sign it, and it might be 80 pages long.</p><p>You sign it because, quite frankly, you have looked at the news and you see the level of youth unemployment coming at you and you think, Jesus I need this job, so you sign the contract.  It is taken from you and then used against you.  You do not have a copy of it, but all you know is that you are constantly prevented from raising issues and having that contract held over you.  It is used as a tool against workers.</p><p> It appears this is not a breach of employment law, and my read of it is that it is not, although employees are entitled to information, but it should be because it is being used against them.  Fionnuala N&iacute; Bhr&oacute;g&aacute;in used the phrase "the chilling effect".  What that means in practice is that workers are afraid to raise concerns.  I fully appreciate that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, exists, and in the course of my other work I had dealings with the HSA.  I know there is voluntarist machinery available that people can use, but the Minister must accept these people exist in an area that is somewhat outside of the normal industrial relations sphere and these agreements are being used to keep the workers in a situation whereby they are afraid to get organised, come together and challenge their employer.</p><p> This is linked to the next issue I want to raise with the Minister, which is youth unemployment.  We know the people who suffered the most during the economic crash, as in, for the longest, and I am not making a hierarchy of people who were battered by what was done to the economy but in terms of the sustained impact, youth unemployment took the longest to recover.  Is the Minister amenable to working on a cross-party basis to ensure that NDAs can be nullified?  We very often do that although people never see it happening.  There is a role for NDAs in some very discrete instances, but the indiscriminate use of them as a mechanism to control workers is not good and it should not be happening.</p><p> Will there be a dedicated section on youth unemployment in the national economic recovery plan?  All of the unemployment that will arise out of the pandemic will be tough to deal with, but we must learn the lesson from the previous crash in that youth unemployment was sustained at a higher rate for longer than in other age groups.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Reilly might fill me in privately some time.  I imagine there is a story to tell there.  I do know how it was regained because it was regained when I was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It was a mixture of the travel tax, route incentives, a growing economy, a marketing budget for Tourism Ireland and fifth freedom rights.  I am sure we can get it back with a similar mix when the time comes.</p> <p>  On the non-disclosure agreements, I cannot understand the concept of asking somebody to sign an agreement and then not allowing them to have a copy of it.  I will check up on the law in that regard.  If it is not illegal, it probably should be.  I just do not understand the concept as to why somebody would be asked to sign an agreement and they are somehow supposed to memorise it.  Even if you want somebody to adhere to an agreement he or she signs, would it not make sense for that person to have a copy of it so that person can remember what he or she agreed to?  There is something very odd and suspicious about people not being able to see an agreement they signed.</p></speech>

It is not that hard to understand.  It is workers having this used as a tool against them to exploit them.  It keeps the union away from them.  We could be here all day talking about the right to organise and union recognition, so let us not go down that road.  I understand completely what it is that motivates a company to do it.  This tool is working very well because the workers were initially terrified of getting organised.  Thankfully, now they are working with the union, which is a very good and positive step.  The situation is designed to ensure the chilling effect is felt by the workers and the impact of that is they will put their head down, do their work and not raise concerns.  We need workers who will raise concerns, especially in this area because of the mental health effects and the hazardous nature of the work they are doing.</p></speech>

Perhaps there is an opportunity to make an amendment to employment law in the coming months or this year to make sure employees are entitled to a copy of any agreement they have signed.  I do not see who in the House could be against that.</p> <p>  In response to the question on the national economic recovery plan, there will be sections both on youth unemployment also a section on gender equality and how that must be part of the economic recovery as well because there has probably been a widening of gender inequality in an economic sense during the pandemic.</p></speech>

It is vital that happens as soon as it is safe to do so.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm this will happen if more than 80% of the population have been vaccinated by the end of June?</p> <p>  I will briefly make two other points.  In 13 days' time hotels and restaurants with outdoor dining will be back trading, as far as the T&aacute;naiste is aware.  When will the Department issue the guidelines for this, because it takes some time to get set up and to organise a range of issues?  We need to get the information urgently.</p></speech>

As a person involved in business myself, I tried to outline how vital it is.  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's positive comments and I would greatly appreciate if he could speak to the Minister for Finance.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

As always, there are four factors.  It is not just the vaccines but also case numbers, which seem to be rising a bit again, the situation in hospitals, which is continuing to improve, and then issues concerning variants.  We do have a concern about the Indian variant.  There is some evidence in the UK of increased transmission and increased hospitalisations as a result of that.  We will see how that develops in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  I believe it is F&aacute;ilte Ireland that draws up the guidelines on outdoor dining and drinking.  It will not be done by us, but we will have an input.  I do not have a date for them, unfortunately, but I appreciate that people need to see them soon in order that they can plan ahead.  To give the Senator a rough idea, it is going to be seated dining only with 1 m or 1.5 m between tables and no more than six at a table.  The six people can come from any number of households.  There will be no rule about a maximum of 15.  If an establishment has the space, then it has the space.  There will not be a requirement to buy a substantial meal.  That will be gone.  We do not anticipate that there will be a limit on the amount of time people can stay.  It will be a lot more practical than what existed before, but that is not finalised yet.</p></speech>

Many of the questions that have been asked today should be asked of Facebook.  Chairman, could we invite in Facebook to ask those questions directly because their employment is really a matter between Facebook and the employees?  Based on some of what the T&aacute;naiste said in his contribution at the start of the meeting, it will be a difficult meeting with Facebook.  It emerged at this morning's meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment that Twitter plans to take a legal challenge to the online safety laws.</p><p>That just shows the challenge we have with some social media companies.  I do not expect the T&aacute;naiste to comment on the matter, given that the announcement was made only in the past hour.  Twitter stated that one of the reasons it is taking the legal challenge is that it will set a precedent across the world, which seems to be a strange argument.</p><p> On Shannon Airport, the T&aacute;naiste stated that a number of political parties pushed for stronger measures.  I have seen that in my county, Tipperary, where two political parties, and one party leader, pushed for stronger measures, whereas now they are calling for answers in regard to why Aer Lingus has taken this step.  Has the T&aacute;naiste spoken to Aer Lingus?  Have we got any reassurance regarding the strategic routes, particularly that from Shannon Airport to Heathrow?  I think that route is up for review in about one year's time.  Have we any reassurances the routes will remain?  It is a significant concern for the general public in the mid-west.</p><p> On the new scheme the T&aacute;naiste announced this week, namely, the small business assistance scheme, I am surprised it has not been raised more often during the meeting, although my colleague, Deputy Stanton, mentioned it.  This is something that the Members of both Houses have been calling for over the past nine months.  They have asked whether something could be done for businesses that are not rateable premises.  It is very welcome that we are doing it.  While it is small money, it will be very significant.  I am delighted that it will, I hope, be open for people to apply on Friday or if not then, early next week.  Is the grant a straight &euro;4,000 or do businesses have to show what fixed costs they have?</p><p> The closing date for the first round was 21 April.  I am aware of a number of businesses in County Tipperary - I am sure there are many throughout the country - that did not apply for the first round.  They were essentially closed in recent months and, for one reason or another, thought they could not apply until after they began reopening, which occurred after the closing date for applications.  Is there any measure the Department provided last summer, such as the restart grant, whereby businesses could apply for the first restart grant when they apply for the new grant?  Is there any way in which businesses might be able to apply for the first small business assistance scheme at the same time that they apply for the second one?  The closing date was 21 April and if businesses are reopening, it would give those that for whatever reason might not have applied for the first round the opportunity to apply.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that while the Minister is very aware of the impact aviation has on the environment in terms of emissions, he is also aware of the essential nature of aviation for an island nation.  He is certainly not anti-airline or anything like that.</p> <p>  To my mind, the crucial routes from Shannon Airport are to Heathrow, the east coast of the US and another EU hub.  That hub was going to be either Paris or Frankfurt and we got the former, which was great, but then along came the pandemic and we lost pretty much everything.  It is a very worrying situation.  Again, Ireland is not Australia or New Zealand; it is very different.  Airlines do not want to be paid to stay on the ground in Europe.  They do not want to be paid to run routes on which there are no passengers.  They will just move the aeroplanes, and that is how the single European sky works.  Unfortunately, that could happen to us and that is why we will need a large and attractive incentive package to get airlines and their routes back.  We can do that only when passengers are allowed and able to travel, and we are just not at that point at the moment for public health reasons.</p> <p>  I am always worried about giving information about grant schemes because there are now so many that I tend to mix them up.  My recollection is that it is a straight grant of &euro;4,000.  An applicant does not have to demonstrate particular fixed costs.  We are not going to ask for insurance bills, utility bills or whatever, but applicants will have to show that their turnover is down 75% or more and that they had a turnover of &euro;50,0000 or more, and they have to commit to reopening or staying open.</p> <p>  As for missing the application deadline, to be honest there is not an awful lot we can do about that.  People miss application deadlines all the time and we cannot just reopen them all the time.  Nevertheless, there are sometimes cases, particularly humanitarian ones, where somebody may have missed the deadline for very good reason, but just not having applied, not thinking it was necessary to apply or not getting around to it would not be enough.  We will consider a bit of flexibility in certain circumstances if there are overwhelming compassionate reasons but that is limited.</p></speech>

It is welcome that there will not be a cliff edge but rather a gradual easing of supports.  There has been a change even in the past two weeks.  The number of people receiving the PUP in County Tipperary on 4 May was more than 18,000, whereas it has now decreased to 9,000.  It has halved already and that is without the hospitality industry having yet reopened.</p> <p>  One issue I have come across with staff and management relates to when people will be returning to work in a normal work environment.  Companies are eager to get people back to work but staff are not as eager to return.  Businesses seek guidance and the guidance remains that working from home is preferable, but the issue of antigen testing is tied in with that.  How can we encourage companies that might not be fully sure about antigen testing to use it or to see it as an option to get staff back to work?  Obviously, there are differences of opinion on all sides and that applies to the workplace as well.  Some companies will view antigen testing as very positive, while others will be unsure about it.  How can the Government encourage companies that are unsure?</p></speech>

Many employers are using it.  We issued new guidance on the issue on Friday last to give employers the strength of a Government document, with the harp on it, that gives them guidance on what or what not to do.  We always say it should be voluntary and staff should not be required to take an antigen test.  It should be done right, using tests approved by the European Commission in particular, and it should be seen only as an additional health and safety measure, not a substitute for getting a PCR test if a person has symptoms.  Similarly, it is not a substitute for social distancing, mask-wearing or any of those measures.</p> <p>  I genuinely encourage employers to take this up because if it is viewed as an additional health and safety measure, it will pick up some cases that might otherwise have been missed, and had those cases not been picked up, they might have caused an outbreak.  It is in employers' interest to have antigen testing in their workplaces.  They can offset it as a business expense against tax and it is not a benefit-in-kind for their employees, so they cannot be taxed on it.  It is not a health benefit in that sense but rather a health and safety measure.  I re-emphasise that if somebody has symptoms, he or she needs to self-isolate and get a PCR test.  Antigen tests are not a substitute for that.</p></speech>

On tradespeople and apprenticeships, we will need a huge number of tradespeople if we are serious about the move towards building, with Rebuilding Ireland, and retrofitting homes.  I worry about the lack of tradespeople.  I spoke to a builder recently who informed me that tradespeople are becoming known as "grey sites" because they all have grey hair.  I recently visited a school, and not one of the children put up their hand when I asked who wanted to be a tradesperson.  We need to do some serious work on this.  We need to make apprenticeships more attractive.  I wish I had been told to marry a tradesman when I was in school because tradespeople are the ones who keep everything on the road.</p><p>I do not know whether we need to issue a PR statement or something around the importance of tradesmen.  They are literally keeping everything we do together, whether it is buildings, transport or whatever.  Where would we be without tradesmen?  I do not know whether they are valued as much as they ought to be and I think we need to do something around that.  We lost a good few tradespeople in the previous recession.  Some of them are in Australia or Canada or such places.  It may be time to consider calling them back, as was done for nurses and doctors.  We will have a shortage of tradespeople to do the work we want done.  We want to get houses built and retrofitted.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to think about that and consider what can be done.  The apprenticeship model must include time in college so that even people from rural areas who want to become a tradesperson get time experiencing college life and living away from home and that kind of thing.  The job itself has changed in many ways.  I am going to move away from apprenticeships and the importance of tradesmen.  I should say tradespeople.  I have female friends who are carpenters and so on but I was reared saying tradesmen.  However, we have to consider tradespeople if we are serious about what we want to do.</p><p> An issue I wish to raise with the T&aacute;naiste relates to the public realm and how space is shared, particularly in the context of the food and hospitality sector.  There is a need for local authorities to create outdoor spaces, not necessarily outdoor dining but outdoor seating and other outdoor spaces such that if a person wishes to sit down and eat something, whether he or she bought it from a restaurant with seating or a restaurant without seating or whatever, he or she can do so.  We really need to consider the public realm.  I think that will not be done properly unless there are urban designers or urban architects in local authorities.  I mean no offence to road engineers and technicians and quantity surveyors.  They are brilliant at their jobs but this task is not part of their profession.  We really need to look at that issue because we want to become like the rest of Europe, where it is normal for villages and towns to have beautiful, safe and aesthetically pleasing places to hang out.  We get the same amount of rainfall as Copenhagen and Amsterdam.  People speak about the weather a lot but it is not as bad as many people think.  We need to consider that.  It will not work if we do not get proper urban designers.  We cannot leave it on the shoulders of people who have been trained as road engineers.  That is really important if we want to get outdoor everything right, which we do because, as a nation, we went outdoors and realised it is bloody amazing.  It is really important to do that.</p></speech>

I know the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, wants to try to speed up the roll-out of rural broadband from seven years to five years.  I believe that with the help of the T&aacute;naiste, we might get it done even faster than that.  It is so important.  Even five years seems like a ridiculous amount of time to have to wait.  I know it takes time for it to be physically rolled out but I cannot over-emphasise how important it is to get broadband into rural Ireland.  I worked from home for the past 14 years.  Members would not believe the stress I had.  At one stage I had to hold my laptop above my head.  The digital hubs are brilliant and have a significant part to play.  Even if one works from home, one needs to go to somewhere to meet people.  Digital hubs are amazing and good work has been done on them by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys.  If the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, wants to try to speed up the roll-out of rural broadband, the more Ministers who can get involved in making that happen, the better.  It is key to everything happening in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

There will just be one chance to reset the compass in terms of climate and the circular economy and that is as we start to reopen.  In practical terms, will this happen?  Will there be audits of enterprise to assess preparedness and setting milestones?  Will more people commit to plastic pledges and 2030 climate pledges?  How will we drive it on?  I will take one example, that of the food sector.  It wastes 1 million tonnes of food each year.  That is equivalent to 3 million tonnes of carbon.  That is one year of the ten-year reduction if we could get cracking on that.  Two thirds of the plastic used is not recyclable.  We could really strengthen Origin Green by having better sourcing and identification of the way production is happening.  How is it going to be driven on in practice?</p></speech>

It is something I would like to discuss in more detail with the Deputy because I have been having those thoughts myself.  One small thing we are doing now is we have opened up the green enterprise fund which the Deputy has probably heard about.  It is approximately &euro;10 million that will fund businesses to do exactly the things he mentioned, such as audits of their energy use, waste and kind of how they operate, in order to reduce waste, energy use and emissions.  That is only a drop in the ocean and a small start because industry accounts for 13% of all emissions and we need to cut them basically by half while still expanding and employing more people.  That is an enormous challenge and probably an issue to which the committee could devote a whole session.  Is that a lazy answer?</p></speech>

It is not just about looking at energy and waste.  The reality is the choice of materials in construction, for example, can have a significant impact in terms of whether they lock up carbon or generate carbon emissions.  There is a need for micro-thinking to start happening at sectoral level within the agencies that are in charge of them.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I will be very brief.  I assume that all members are getting emails from constituents - I certainly am - who are concerned about the emergency legislation that is to be renewed again on 9 June.  They are calling for reviews of this and so forth.  We are moving out of restrictions and lockdown thanks to the work of all involved.  I am wondering whether the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 will be renewed on 9 June as scheduled.  That has an impact on employment, jobs and so forth.</p> <p>  The other thing that has been missing all along is the issue of interpretation.  A query was received yesterday about whether drive-in cinemas are allowed at the moment.  To me, drive-in cinemas are quite safe.  One sits in one's car looking at the big screen and not interacting with anyone.  However, the Garda has interpreted them as not being possible under the current restrictions.  We need to have a debate about how we move forward from here and open up the economy, especially under the various pieces of emergency legislation that were passed by the Houses and that all members want to see rescinded as soon as possible.  That is a very broad issue, but it is a very fundamental and important one.</p></speech>

If the Deputy had told me two years ago that we would live in a country where it was illegal to leave or enter the State for non-essential reasons, that one could not have visitors to one's house or could not meet outside with more than 15 people, I would have thought he was absolutely bonkers.  What has happened in the past year or two is unprecedented.  We overuse that term but what has happened in the past year really is unprecedented.  We want to go to a new normal and build back better, as people say, but one thing I definitely do not want to keep on the Statute Book for any longer than is necessary is this draconian legislation.  Unfortunately, it is still necessary.  We are not out of the woods yet and that is why we will have to extend it.  There will be proper debate on that in the D&aacute;il and I encourage Deputies to speak freely on this issue.  They should not feel that they are against public health or something if they raise these concerns.  Civil liberties matter.  Concerns about civil liberties have almost disappeared in the past year or so and that bothers me.</p></speech>

Thank you for the invitation to meet with the committee today to discuss issues relevant to general insurance in Ireland.  Zurich welcomes the opportunity to be part of this important discussion and to contribute to the work of this committee.  Since our last meeting with the committee in October 2019, we have grown our overall market share to 10% and our business now employs 400 people across our Dublin and Wexford offices.  We remain a proudly Irish business, with 100% local management team focused on the Irish market, writing around &euro;350 million in premiums in Ireland.  We have maintained our AA- financial strength rating, which means Zurich customers can continue to rely on us to consistently deliver on our promise when it matters.</p> <p>  Like all businesses, the impact of Covid-19 was unexpected and unprecedented.  Our immediate priority, when the first lockdown was announced in March 2020, was to support the national effort, protect our employees' well-being and maintain full service to our customers by moving the vast majority of our employees to remote working.  We maintained a robust consumer protection risk framework to manage customer conduct risk and drive positive behaviours.  This framework brings to life our ingrained practice of listening to customers and treating them fairly in line with the Consumer Protection Code and is evidenced by our low level of customer complaints, less than 1%, based on active policies and received claims in 2020. </p> <p>  Claims reputation is particularly important to Zurich.  We strive to provide an efficient and fair claims experience for our customers and our reputation for paying valid claims is a key factor behind our market success over many years.  In line with our existing claims philosophy, Zurich is committed to treating all our customers honestly, fairly and professionally.  We ensured that this approach was applied to all Covid-19-related claims from the beginning.  Our approach to all claims is to investigate the individual facts of each claim, clearly explain policy coverage to the customer and communicate the rationale for our determination on liability to the customer in writing.  Where there is cover, any claims offer is fair and represents our best estimate of the customer's reasonable entitlement. </p> <p>  We offer internal appeals and complaints processes to all customers.  We also advise them of how to bring any complaints to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman of Ireland and, to date, we have been notified of one complaint to the ombudsman in relation to a Covid-19 claim.  Our approach is fully aligned to the expectations set out in the "Dear CEO" letter, issued by the Central Bank of Ireland, CBI, on 27 March 2020, in relation to business interruption claims and the CBI&rsquo;s business interruption insurance supervisory framework.  Zurich is committed to continue to meet the CBI&rsquo;s expectations as set out in the letter and framework, through our dedicated and professional handling of all Covid-19 claims.</p> <p>  I will turn to the new guidelines on judicial awards and the impact on policy premiums.  Let me first say that Zurich welcomes this change as a meaningful step to deliver lower insurance premiums to Irish customers.  I want to take this opportunity to again confirm that we will pass on the benefits of resulting reduced claim costs to our customers.  I am sure the committee will appreciate that there are certain important legal limitations, particularly under competition law, that limit my sharing of any competitively sensitive information or speculating in relation to either future premium levels or Zurich&rsquo;s future pricing strategy.  Each individual insurer will need to independently assess their own view of the impact of the changes and act accordingly.  We have completed our initial analysis of the expected impact of the new guidelines on our future claims costs.  Claims costs make up a significant part of premium, so it is logical any reductions in such costs should positively impact premiums and in the coming weeks we are implementing changes to customer premiums to reflect the impact of this reform action on claims costs. </p> <p>  The new guidelines should lead to material reductions in general award levels.  I also hope they will lead to an increased percentage of claimants accepting Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, awards.  PIAB provides a fair, cost-effective and consistent mechanism to provide compensation to claimants, which benefits all key stakeholders and society at large.  In recent years, Zurich has continued to accept over 90% of the awards made by PIAB.  We have seen a consistent fall in claimant acceptance from approximately 65% in 2013 down to around 50% today.</p><p>The most recent national claims information database, NCID, report on private motor insurance clearly demonstrated that most claimants do not receive a significantly higher award subsequent to rejecting a PIAB award.  It usually takes a further two years to settle the claim, with a marginally higher amount paid to the claimant but with the resulting legal costs adding more than 50% to the average claim cost.  Any action that can be taken to increase PIAB claimant acceptance rates will reduce the future costs of claims in Ireland.  I welcome the ongoing work to reform and refine the work of the PIAB, which could lead to further reductions in insurance costs and, inevitably, customer premiums in a competitive market.  Zurich is committed to continuing to review and adjust its premiums in light of future reform and market developments to ensure we continue to offer fair and competitive prices to our customers.  I look forward to answering questions from the committee.</p></speech>

I now invite Mr. O'Midheach of FBD Insurance to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom&aacute;s O'Midheach" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051900002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  In my brief opening statement, I will introduce FBD and touch on topics of interest to the committee.  I was appointed chief executive officer in January 2021.  I am joined today by my colleagues, Ms Kate Tobin, chief underwriting officer, and Mr. Jackie McMahon, chief claims officer.  FBD was established in the 1960s by farmers for farmers and has built on those roots in agriculture to become a dedicated general insurer serving the needs of our agricultural, small business and consumer customers throughout Ireland.  More than 900 people are employed by FBD across 24 counties.  We are Ireland's only remaining indigenous general insurer and our business is entirely focused on the Irish market.  We hold approximately 10% of the liability, motor and property insurance market in Ireland, as measured by share of gross written premium and we have approximately 500,000 policyholders.</p> <p>  We fully understand and appreciate the impact the Covid-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, on our customers.  During 2020, FBD provided approximately &euro;12 million in rebates to our commercial and motor customers.  We continue to provide rebates to impacted commercial customers, at a total cost of &euro;4 million thus far in 2021.  With regard to business interruption, it was evident from the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic that differing points of view existed concerning the application of business interruption insurance under FBD's public house insurance policy.  In order to determine liability and provide clarity and quantum, we supported the intervention of the courts.  We worked in a collaborative manner to ensure the process was carried out as efficiently as possible, with FBD covering the reasonable costs of all parties involved in the case.  As the committee is aware, judgment in the case was handed down by the Commercial Court on 5 February.  That judgment has provided the necessary clarity in regard to policy cover.  FBD fully accepts liability and we have moved quickly to engage with affected customers.  Interim payments of more than &euro;11 million have been made as we await the final resolution from the courts.  There is a further court hearing scheduled in July to determine how the final elements of claim settlements are to be backdated.</p> <p>  Many publicans in Ireland have been loyal and valued customers of FBD for many years.  We are thankful for their ongoing custom during this challenging period for them.  We are proud that our retention rate among those customers remains high.  We are very supportive of the Government's insurance reform agenda to reduce premiums for consumers, borrowers and businesses.  The average premium for FBD's private car customers has reduced by approximately 20% since 2017.  We continue to monitor our claims experience and claims costs closely, and we are committed to reducing premiums.  This year, we particularly welcome the adoption and implementation of new Judicial Council guidelines for personal injuries awards, which is a very positive step.  While we have yet to see the new guidelines reflected in awards by the PIAB or in the courts, we have been proactive in reflecting their assumed future impact on the premiums currently being quoted to our customers.</p> <p>  I must mention the ongoing competition law investigation by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, into the private motor insurance sector.  FBD takes compliance with the competition rules very seriously and is, of course, working in good faith with the CCPC on its investigation.  We will endeavour to assist the committee as far as possible but, as members will appreciate, we are constrained in terms of what we can say around sensitive competitive dynamics such as pricing, including potential price changes, and our confidential commercial strategy.  I look forward to any questions or queries members might have.</p></speech>

I now invite Mr. Declan O'Rourke of Aviva Insurance Ireland to make an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.103" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051900002#B00500"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to discuss issues relating to business continuity insurance and the recent changes to judicial awards and their impact on policy premiums.  These are issues of significant importance to all stakeholders in the Irish insurance industry and we welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  As the CEO of Aviva's general insurance business, Aviva Insurance Ireland, I cannot respond to questions on mortgage protection, which is a life policy underwritten by a separate Aviva business here in Ireland.  However, I have made available to the committee a short statement from Aviva Life &amp;amp; Pensions Ireland on the impact of Covid-19 on underwriting criteria for life policies, which also clarifies queries on the impact of vaccinations on mortgage protection claims.</p> <p>  Aviva has been operating in the Irish market for more than 240 years.  Our businesses in Ireland are fully owned subsidiaries of the international insurance group Aviva plc, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a member of the FTSE 100 Index.  In Ireland, Aviva currently employs 1,500 people across our offices in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  Aviva Insurance Ireland, of which I am CEO, and Aviva Life &amp;amp; Pensions Ireland are significant general insurance and life players in the Irish market.  We are sustainable and socially responsible insurers that seek to deliver value for all stakeholders, including our customers, over the long term.  We contribute significantly to national sports and community organisations through our sponsorship of the Aviva Stadium and our support of charitable and community causes.  We remain committed to operating in a competitive Irish insurance market that is stable and sustainable for our customers.  We have led the market in supporting insurance reform and we continue to support the creation of a more sustainable and less volatile market, which will assist with both the cost and availability of insurance for all our customers.</p> <p>  We are aware that the issue of business interruption claims is a significant concern to businesses, advocacy groups and policymakers.  As has become apparent through recent legal cases in the UK and Ireland, this is a complex issue and it is widely accepted that no insurance market in the world provides widespread business interruption coverage for a pandemic such as Covid-19.  Aviva Insurance Ireland has approximately 15,000 customers who have cover for business interruption.  The vast majority of those policies do not provide cover for business interruption arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.  The wording used by Aviva in the policies is generally unambiguously clear.  However, we have approximately 50 policies taken out by small businesses where the wording is not as clear.  So far, we have received only a few claims on those policies and we have paid them.  Despite not receiving claims from the remaining customers, we have been very proactive in writing to those policyholders to draw their attention to the cover they have in place and inform them that they may have a valid claim.  We have a small cohort of large corporate policies where a claim may arise in the future.  We are working closely with the brokers on those cases. </p> <p>  Where we have received business interruption claims due to Covid-19, we have provided each customer with a full explanation of our decision in cases where policies did not provide cover.  Only a small number of customers were unhappy with our determination and subsequently  made complaints.  Most of those complaints were resolved by our complaints handling processes.  However, a handful of customers took cases to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  All of those cases have been ruled in our favour.  In summary, the vast majority of Aviva Insurance Ireland's policies do not provide cover arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.  Where they do, or where the policy wording is not clear, covered claims are being paid and all notifications are being dealt with promptly.</p> <p>  Aviva is fully supportive of the Government's action plan for insurance reform and welcomes the implementation of the new personal injury guidelines.  We acknowledge the work done by successive Ministers of State, Eoghan Murphy, Michael D'Arcy and Deputy Fleming, the relentless work of officials at the Department of Finance and the work of Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns.  We also acknowledge that despite opposition from many of its own members and the Law Society of Ireland, the Judicial Council voted to adopt the new guidelines.  The changes will have a positive impact on the cost and availability of insurance for businesses, voluntary organisations and motorists. </p> <p>  While acknowledging the work done, there is still a long way to go before minor awards are on a par with those in many European countries.  For example, one of the largest reductions is for fully recovered minor whiplash, awards for which will move from &euro;16,000 to &euro;6,000.  However, this will still be four times higher than what applies in the UK, where minor whiplash payouts are moving from &pound;4,000 to &pound;1,500.  Many countries do not provide any compensation for minor whiplash.  We believe there is still more to do in both reducing awards and strengthening the scope and remit of the PIAB.</p> <p>  Regarding the impact on premiums of the new guidelines, Aviva has anticipated the changes and reduced premiums in advance of the implementation of the guidelines.</p><p>In an open insurance market like we have in Ireland, there is a clear correlation between premiums and claims costs.  Insurance markets will not allow excessive profits and combined ratios generally gravitate to approximately 95% over the cycle.  As claims costs reduce, insurance companies enter new segments of the market where there is an opportunity to make a reasonable return.  In the Irish market, we are already seeing better availability of insurance in underserved areas.  At Aviva, we see the changes to awards as a positive and an opportunity to grow our customer base, enter new market segments, launch new products and provide great value to our customers.</p></speech>

There are many areas and colleagues will cover other issues so I will keep my questions quite specific.  My question is for Mr. O'Midheach from FBD on something he referred to quite extensively in his opening remarks that I want to tease out, namely business continuity insurance.  I have three questions.  First, why is FBD still arguing over the costs of the test cases brought?  I believe the Central Bank has written to the company on this.  Does he intend to respond?  Second, Mr. O'Midheach said that &euro;11 million in total has been paid out.  Does he not accept that a 5% interim payment is not fair to the businesses considering that most have been closed for 16 months.  Third, FBD is reducing the awards by the amount of Government support received by publicans.  Will it return these moneys back to the State?</p></speech>

Can Mr. O'Midheach provide clarity on that?</p></speech>

The costs saved by FBD by the test cases, rather than multiple cases, means it is in the company's interest as well as the businesses involved to have the issue of costs resolved as soon as possible.</p></speech>

We are awaiting the details.</p> <p>  On the second question regarding the interim payments of &euro;11 million, the 5% payment was an immediate payment to publicans on receipt of any form of representation.  It was an immediate payment prior to a second interim payment, which would be on receipt of some details.  The second payment would cover any costs that are not subject to the quantum hearing that are detailed in the submission.  We will pay the second interim payments.  Those have been engaged on so the Deputy's reference to the first interim payment is essentially an immediate payment without any reference to detail.</p></speech>

There are many different factors for pubs, whether they were wet or dry, the periods it was open, what its trade is like, and how it splits between off-licence sales and on-premises sales.  We asked for an amount of information against which we can evaluate quantum based on what we know now and based on the judgements of the High Court and while awaiting the judgement from the quantum hearing that is working through some of the outstanding issues, we are making a second preliminary assessment.  We are basically turning that around in approximately three days from receipt of the information.  We have established quite a user-friendly portal to assist publicans in submitting the information to us.  Once we receive the information we make an evaluation, send the offer to the publicans and we will revisit that when the quantum hearing is finalised.  Should that be delayed, we can make a subsequent payment once we get further information.</p></speech>

Included in the business interruption contract is a reduction for any sum saved during the indemnity period in respect of charges and expenses that are saved by the business.  Our belief is that would include the Government subsidies and the principle of making an insured party whole and not double paying.  It is subject to the quantum hearing that will be held in July but for the moment, our calculations have reduced the gross sum insured by those sums received from the Government.</p></speech>

My focus will also be on business interruption.  Most businesses are only now, more than a year later, beginning to make their claims.  Without the State acting on their behalf using the taxpayers' money, many of these businesses would not have survived until today.  It has been taxpayers' money that has kept them afloat and put them in a position to make a claim.</p> <p>  I am not too sure whether a similar approach has been taken by all three companies.  It probably affects FBD and Zurich more than it does Aviva.  The methodology used is the liability to the insurance companies is the loss of gross profit less any net savings of expenditure.  Is that fair?</p></speech>

The danger is that if someone has an insurance policy, he or she does not, effectively, qualify for State support.  I do not agree with that as a principle and we need to engage with the Minister on that.

For some larger claims with larger organisations, they may well come in.

My first question relates to when premiums are going to reduce.  In 2019, Mr. Brennan appeared before this committee, along with colleagues from throughout the industry.  They asked us to reduce the cost of claims and to produce legislation, which has since happened.  The judges have done their work and reduced the cost of claims for minor injuries, which are now fully recoverable up to 60%.  Mr. Brennan stated at that meeting that if insurers had not reduced their prices by somewhere in the region of 10% to 15%, the committee should ask a lot of questions.  For liability, he stated it should be higher, and probably close to 20%.  That was based on a 50% reduction in claim awards but, as Mr. Brennan will be aware, the legislation and the decision made by the Judicial Council have raised the limit to 60%.</p> <p>  What I and everybody else want to know is when Mr. Brennan and his company are going to pass on these reductions to policyholders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Brennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051900002#D00700"><p>Unfortunately, I am constrained in regard to anything to do with price signalling.  As I said in my opening statement, we have made a decision on the amount we are going to pass through to customers in the coming weeks.  We are actively working to implement that on a number of platforms.  I cannot say more than that because anything else could be seen as signalling when and to what extent we are going to reduce our premiums.</p> <p>  I recognise that it is really important that the industry responds to this reform.  It has taken us years to get here, and I have to ask the Deputy to allow us a few weeks to implement this and get it across to our customers.  We will not be found wanting.  I appeared before the committee in October 2019 and made some clear statements, which I stand over.</p></speech>

They took effect on 24 April but Mr. Brennan is well aware of them.  People are being charged by his company for renewal of motor or business insurance and are not getting the reduction, despite Zurich knowing damn well that if there is a claim in that policy over the next 12 months, the cost of paying out on that claim is now substantially reduced.  Nevertheless, the company is pocketing the benefit, despite the commitments the industry gave to us.  Mr. Brennan should not try to pretend this is something out of the blue.  Why has Zurich not reduced costs over the past three weeks since these guidelines took effect, and why is it continuing to charge motorists and businesses extortionate premiums despite the level of awards having reduced in these cases by up to 60%?</p></speech>

He stated that his company prices insurance for the following 12 months and that it sets premiums on the basis of what it expects to happen in terms of the number of claims over that period.  Is that the way that insurance is priced?</p></speech>

It is about looking forward to the following 12 months.  I accept that we anticipate, hopefully, a reduced cost of claims, which I welcome.  It is a big reform and we will not be found wanting.  We are going to implement - I have to be careful about what I say - changes to our premiums that reflect these rewards.</p></speech>

I return to what I said in October 2019.  The percentages I talked about then are still appropriate.  I have looked at the most recent national claims information database for 2019 and the same principles apply.  I have to be careful about using numbers during this meeting and I apologise for that.  I do not want to mislead the Deputy.  Certainly, the information on motor insurance suggests that the percentages I quoted in October 2019 are reasonable.</p> <p>  On liability insurance, we are not necessarily seeing the same level of savings coming through because the types of injuries that feed in to those sorts of employers and public liability are of a moderate to severe nature, and there is not the same level of reductions as in the new guidelines.  They are not 50% across the board.  For some injuries, particularly moderate to severe ones, the reductions are lower.</p></speech>

I have carried out a survey in which I asked people to tell me whether their premiums had decreased, increased or stayed the same.  We received more than 1,000 responses from people who have had renewals in the past three weeks since the guidelines came into effect.  Is Mr. Brennan surprised that 61% of them have had an increase in their renewal quotation for motor insurance?  Only 20% of them have seen a reduction, while a further 20% report that their premiums are broadly the same as in the previous year.</p></speech>

On motor insurance, for example, we have seen a 4% reduction in quarter 1 this year on quarter 1 last year, on average, across our policies.  I stress that, like FBD, we have 500,000 customers, so perhaps some of their premiums have changed for other factors.  The vast majority of Zurich customers, however, will have seen reductions in their motor insurance premiums over the past 12 months, not related to the cost-of-injury reforms.</p></speech>

When is Aviva likely to pass on the significant reductions?  It is pocketing large sums as a result of premiums it has been writing over the past three weeks, knowing damn well that the awards that will be paid out, if they are to be paid out on these contracts, will be significantly reduced.  When are motorists and businesses likely to see premium reductions?</p></speech>

Quite a bit of this is already factored in.  We need to be careful on the 60% number, although I accept that in the case of minor injuries, there has been a reduction of 60% in general damages on fully recovered whiplash cases.  As for the moderate and larger cases, however, the latter will probably not change at all, while the moderate ones are dropping by approximately 20% or 30%.</p><p>Over the entirety it will not be anything like 60%.</p></speech>

Is this really what the insurance industry is trying to say now, that it expected this so it started to reduce premiums last year and this has to be counted into the equation?

What I am saying is that in any market there is anticipation in advance.  There is not a single day where everything changes.  There are many factors and pricing is ongoing.  I can obviously speak about the significant price decreases in the past and we have seen significant decreases in the past two years.  Our average premium is back to where it was in 2010.  There has been an awful lot of progress already.  I cannot speak about the future, obviously, but we have seen big moves by the industry at this stage.</p></speech>

The facts are that over the past decade the cost of claims has reduced by 9%, the number of claims has reduced by 45% and premiums have increased by 35%.  One of the most significant things that has happened in the insurance industry in recent years took effect on 24 April.  This is that the cost of claims was reduced by a significant amount.  It was the insurance industry that was begging, screaming, crying, lobbying and looking for this.  It has been delivered.  Over the past three weeks, the industry has not significantly reduced the cost of premium renewal.</p> <p>  I will give an example from one of the surveys.  The premium last year of an individual who has an insurance policy with Aviva was &euro;400.  This person has had no claims, has the exact same cover and has not replaced the car.  We are comparing like with like.  The renewal quotation this year, which was received within the past three weeks, was &euro;730.  The person phoned up and tried to get a better deal.  The person moved company and got insured with FBD for &euro;375.  This was an 83% increase at a time when the Government, the D&aacute;il and the Judiciary have slashed the cost of claims.  What people want to know is when they are likely to see significant reductions in their premiums.  Will Aviva pass on euro for euro the savings the industry will make as a result of paying out reduced claims?</p></speech>

The Deputy needs to look at it over a period of time rather than a three-week period.  We are committed to passing on the savings.  In our view, we have passed on many of them already.</p></speech>

It is easy to say there is a 60% reduction in the minor whiplash cases but there are still a lot of factors in this.  We need to see the behaviour of solicitors, claimants and judges to see where this goes.  For example, quite a lot of judges voted against this so it will be interesting to see where this will land.  The solicitors will try to work with this as much as they can to continue to have high fees.  Claimants are already looking at multiple injuries, and there is some activity to push cases higher with multiple injuries that may previously have just involved one injury.  It is complicated.  It will take time to figure out exactly what the discounts are.  We have passed on almost all of the savings we believe are there now.</p></speech>

When are we likely to see the savings passed on to its customers?  Why have they not been passed on up until now?  Will the company commit to passing on euro for euro savings as a result of the reduction in awards to its customers?</p></speech>

We did a calculation of what the amount ought to be and we have applied that amount.  It has been applied in the case of motor insurance.  Our calculation of that amount has been applied to the rating and it is now live on the market.</p></speech>

I will give another example from the survey of an FBD customer, again comparing like with like.  The same car has not had a previous claim and last year's premium was &euro;550 and this year's premium is &euro;635.  In another case, last year's premium was &euro;1,300 and this year's renewal quote is &euro;1,450.  How are premiums increasing if the savings have been passed on?</p></speech>

Obviously, we cannot reference particular cases.  To some extent, it has to do with the timings.  Was it in recent days or recent weeks?  I am surprised, as were my colleagues, because in general I would have thought with the reductions in recent times that it would be unusual for any one individual, without some other cause, to have an increase.</p></speech>

Their companies, Zurich and Aviva, are in the top seven insurance companies in Ireland.  They are also in the top seven in the UK.  Will the witnesses explain to the committee what are the responsibilities and requirements on their companies since the British Government reduced the cost of whiplash awards?  What do they mean?  How do the companies have to show the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, that they are passing on these savings to consumers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.161" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Brennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051900002#E01500"><p>I will start.  In the UK we have a very small share of the motor market.  It is certainly well less than our motor share here.  The difference is that in the UK the change was in the form of one-for-one guidelines and they can be mapped easily enough.  What we have here is a move from the book of quantum, which is a set of guidelines, and there is not a one-for-one match.  It is going to be very difficult at an individual claim level to say exactly what would have been paid on the claim in the past.  The Deputy mentioned the national claims information database, which contains rich information and tells us the total cost of claims.  This is where we will see the real effect of this coming through.  In the same report, we will see the effect on premiums and the two can be matched.</p> <p>  What has happened in the UK is a one-for-one match, whereby we can see the award under the new guidelines and what it would have been under the old guidelines.  We do not have this here.  They are quite different and there are ranges.  Trying to match them one for one would be quite subjective.  If anything, we could play a game by stating the award would have been higher under the old awards but here is what it is.  The best way to monitor this would be through the national claims information database.  The Deputy has brought a Bill to the D&aacute;il and I suggest we engage through Insurance Ireland to see whether we could add some extra fields to the national claims information database.  It could be another way of monitoring the exact impact of these new awards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051900002#E01600"><p>Let me be clear.  In Britain, Mr. Brennan's company, along with all of the other six largest companies in Ireland, has to satisfy the FCA as to what the cost of claims would have been before the awards were slashed, what the cost of claims are after the awards were slashed, what the premiums would have been if the awards had not been slashed and what they are now.  This is the way the British Government ensured in legislation that the insurance industry passes on pound-for-pound savings.  Mr. Brennan's argument is that Britain applied it to only one issue, which is whiplash.  If it can be done for whiplash it can be done for all other injuries.  Is it not the case that the industry does not want this oversight because without it there is no way to ensure the insurance industry has passed on pound for pound and euro for euro the reduction in awards to its consumers?</p><p>This is the only way we will be able to satisfy it.  All of the companies, with the exception of FBD have to do this in Britain, yet they are resisting this oversight here.</p></speech>

As I said, the national claims information database has become the go-to on data and, rather than creating another process, I would prefer that we try to see can we work with the existing process.  We will provide all of our data to the Central Bank in a very carefully regulated and transparent way to see could we use that to provide the same level of reporting the Deputy and the Oireachtas would like to see.</p></speech>

It is part of the 2018 legislation, which has taken effect.  Let me make it clear.  Does that include that the companies would provide the expected cost of claims prior to the reduction in awards, the cost of claims now, subsequent to the awards being reduced, the premiums if the awards were not reduced and the premiums now, as a result of the awards being reduced?  Is Mr. Brennan saying his company would be open to the national claims database having that information and reporting on it?</p></speech>

I am not aware of the exact details of the case and I have not seen it worked out in practice in the UK.  We would be happy to work on it.  All I am suggesting is perhaps we would work together and engage with Insurance Ireland to find the best way to measure this.</p> <p>  I have been very clear.  We will pass on the benefits, euro for euro, and that is what we intend to do.  I believe the national claims information database already provides the information to cover that at a high level.  I am not sure moving it down to each individual claim is the way to do this and it will create an awful lot of work.  It is quite subjective because, as I said, there is not a one-for-one match between the old book of quantum and the new guidelines.  All I am suggesting is we could try to work together to find a way to minimise cost.  We do not want to create cost for everybody because that cost will ultimately feed into customer premiums, and I am sure the Deputy would agree with that.  It is about trying to find a way to work with the existing process to get the overview that is required and that the Oireachtas would like to see.</p></speech>

These are the regulations and they are quite detailed.  If his company is not aware of what they are in Britain, I can send them on to him.  It is all worked out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.170" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Brennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051900002#F00800"><p>Let me be clear about this.  I am responsible for Irish business.  I have no role whatsoever in our UK business.  I do not understand why the Deputy would expect me to have read through the UK regulations in great detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.171" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051900002#F00900"><p>I am not expecting that.  However, when Mr. Brennan said they are not worked out, my point is that the regulations are here, they are worked out and they are quite detailed.  What I am asking is whether the companies would be satisfied to provide the same information to the Central Bank here?  I have no faith that the insurance companies are going to pass this on, euro for euro.  That is my position, and I hope I am wrong.  What I am not going to do is allow for legislation to be passed, for the Judiciary to do its part and for the insurance companies to pocket much of the benefit from it.  I want to hear from Mr. O&rsquo;Rourke whether his company would be open to having the same level of oversight and requirement that has been legislated for in Britain in regard to providing the information I have just outlined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.172" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051900002#F01000"><p>Again, I am not familiar with the detail from the UK.  I do know individual prices are changed all the time by customer level and at all different levels, so that would be a very difficult thing to do.  There are other ways we can do it.  We can look at the margin of the insurance companies and the particular lines.  If we look at the motor insurance business in Ireland, it has never been a particularly profitable business anyway and I do not see it becoming particularly profitable in the next year.  Most companies are looking to make a margin of five points on it.  I think it can be monitored quite easily over the next period through the national claims information database and through returns from the insurance companies as to the margin they are making on that business.</p></speech>

How they are going to respond in regard to pricing?  What is their response to the FCA predicting that premiums will reduce, so insurers will not lose market share?  What are their views in regard to the legislation that has passed the D&aacute;il and will come before this committee in October to bring the same effect to dual pricing here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.174" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021051900002#F01200"><p>That is a complicated issue and I know, again anecdotally, that the UK is struggling with it.  The objective of it is good and, certainly, protecting vulnerable customers is very important.  Aviva has led the way on this, even as far back as 2019 when we put a cap on the difference between new business and renewal business, which for a direct channel in Ireland is 25%.  That is an important one.  Nobody wants to see a situation where people are being charged large premiums, especially vulnerable people, as it is not right.  We have acted on that.  We have led the market and both regulators have seen that.</p> <p>  That is an important piece but there are other unintended consequences of this.  There is no doubt the people who shop around now get a good deal and they will not get as good a deal afterwards if dual pricing is banned because, at the moment, incentives for new customers to try to encourage customers on board are probably being compensated for by older customers.  That is the way a lot of markets work, including this market.</p> <p>  There is a lot to it.  I know the FCA is grappling with what is going to happen with back books, where there is no new business and where less than 15% of the business is new business.  I know it is grappling with margin versus price and with discounts on new business.  It is having its own tangled web with this.  We need to be careful we do not end up in a situation where, like the health industry, the products are 99% the same but the prices are different and we end up with an awful lot of products.  We would fear that certain players might be able to get involved in sharp practice because there would be quite an opportunity within a very strong regulated market like that.</p> <p>  We all want to protect vulnerable customers.  We monitor our pricing for vulnerable customers versus our overall book to make sure there are no significant differences.  I agree we need to protect vulnerable customers but we need to be careful with the market as well because some unintended consequences could happen.</p></speech>

We monitor what goes on in the UK but much more important to us is the fact the CBI &ndash; the Central Bank - is currently engaged in a very detailed review of the practice here in Ireland, and we expect it to report in the coming months.  I am sure what is happening in the UK will feed into its consideration and deliberations, and we will respond to that.  As I said, we are fully engaged with the CBI.  One of the challenges is that the FCA in the UK has said it thinks it will reduce premiums but, ultimately, if companies have a target profitability level, it will redistribute premiums.  If that is the right thing to do, then that is the right thing to do.  I think we will learn from the FCA and what measures it comes up with, and there are certain things we could look at across the industry here as well.</p></speech>

It was very interesting to hear Mr. O'Midheach talk about FBD welcoming the legal challenge and so on.  While it might have welcomed it, it fought it tooth and nail, and that is the reality.  The Central Bank made it very clear that the Government's announcement for pubs to close was to be deemed not a voluntary closure but an enforced closure.  What did FBD do?  It challenged that in the courts.</p></speech>

It said it was not a forced closure by the State.  Let me get on to the substantial point.  The test cases have happened and FBD has lost the cases.  It argued in court and it lost the cases and we have to find out the quantum.  I engaged with the Central Bank because there was huge anxiety in regard to test cases in terms of the costs and what would happen.  The Central Bank had issued a very clear statement in terms of reasonable cost being covered.  Now, FBD is arguing in regard to that.  I note Mr. O'Midheach&rsquo;s language in regard to reasonable cost.  Is it not the reality that what he believes is reasonable and what the actual legal costs are in some of these cases could be a difference of &euro;1 million?</p></speech>

We have not seen the specifics of what people are believing to be the costs pre the legal cases being heard, and if it is in the nature of &euro;1 million, whether that is spread over the four cases or one individual case.</p><p>When we see the detail, we will see what is generally perceived to be reasonable or unreasonable prior to entry into court.  </p></speech>

I note what Mr. O'Midheach said about passing on the savings arising from the enactment of the judicial guidelines, although there seems to be some evidence to the contrary.  The delays by Aviva and Zurich are simply unacceptable.  As has previously been said, this did not come out of the blue.  They knew this was coming and their foot-dragging is simply unacceptable.  When they get around to passing on the savings, will that happen automatically or will customers need to ask for them?  What will they do for those customers who have taken out premiums since 24 April?  Will there be a rebate for them given that the Judicial Council guidelines took effect on 24 April?</p></speech>

I do not see this as foot-dragging.  We have taken a long time to get to this point.  I have been in this industry for approximately five years and we have been talking about reform for that time.  We have been involved in many reports along the way.  I am delighted to see this day has come.  There are practical reasons the implementation of changes takes some time.  These will feed through automatically to our premium rates.</p> <p>  Many factors feed into insurance rates.  When we look forward, we need to estimate several factors, including, for example, the acceptance rate of PIAB and the chances of whether these cases will be accepted in court.</p> <p>  I am comfortable that we are offering a fair price.  We will adjust that price in the coming weeks to allow for some changed assumptions on what the future injury costs will be.  We need to implement this across multiple platforms.  I am sure the Senator has been involved in areas of government where people wanted to implement something quickly but it needs to be fed safely through the various systems and processes to ensure that those results can be got out to customers.  Right now, we are engaged in implementing it.  We analysed the results in April.  We made a decision on the level of change we would put through and we are implementing that as we speak.</p></speech>

The decrease in the past six months has been the largest decrease I have seen in my career in the industry.  This has been anticipated by the market.  It is happening.  It will continue to happen as we find out the behaviours of the solicitors, the judges and the claimants, and we can be more certain about exactly what the amount is.  That is what happens in any insurance market.</p></speech>

It is simply not acceptable to extend that further and for the insurance companies to say that they now need to see the outcome of decisions in the courts.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about excluding the value of State supports in the business interruption insurance payouts.  I have heard the comments made about the wait-and-see approach being adopted.  Industry representatives are awaiting engagement with the Minister.  I find that extraordinary, given that these statements have been made knowing full well that in personal injury cases, insurance companies are required to provide a statement of recoverable benefit on the benefits that the injured party would have had to claim arising from personal injury, particularly with regard to loss of earnings and social welfare payments.  Arising from that statement of recoverable benefit, the Department of Social Protection is reimbursed by the insurance company in respect of those payments that needed to be made because of the personal injury.  </p> <p>  While FBD, Zurich and Aviva know that they must abide by one set of rules for public liability and employer liability in personal injury cases, are the witnesses now saying that they will abide by a different set of rules that they make up for themselves on the payout of business interruption claims?</p></speech>

There is a set of rules by which we gather the money and pay that.  No such set-up rules exist.  There is no mechanism currently.  That does not exist.  We are quite happy to calculate the amount because it would be clearly determined as a result of the quantum whether we withhold it or not.  If we withheld it, we could clearly calculate it.  Then, we can engage on any mechanism, set of rules or principles after that.  I am not saying that we will not, but there is no set of rules.  In the example the Senator gave, there is a clear set of rules, and established precedent.</p></speech>

However, there is also the point that the current set of rules is very much set up on the basis that somebody is responsible for the accident that led to somebody else claiming or getting benefits from the Department of Social Protection.  However, in this case we are talking about very different circumstances; nobody is responsible for Covid-19.  It is a very different sort of set-up.  We need to understand that the current rules do not automatically apply.  We need to engage with the Minister to understand the grounds on which he believes we should refund these.</p> <p>  I go back to my earlier point.  It is a dangerous principle and we need to be very careful.  People are entitled to something different irrespective of whether they have an insurance policy.  That is an important principle for me and for the industry.  The current one is very much based on if someone is in an accident and it is deemed to be somebody else's fault and they are deemed to be responsible for it and if we are covering that person, we pick up those costs.  That is the legislation that is there.  It is a very different set of responsibilities for Covid-19 because no individual we are insuring is at fault or responsible for Covid-19.</p></speech>

Of course, the very nature of business interruption cover is that it sets out the various types of interruptions.  It does not necessarily attribute blame from what I understand of the cover.  His argument is very much that insurance companies should be entitled to be subsidised by the State because it was not their fault and it was somebody else's fault.  The practice of insurance companies pocketing the payments made by the State has gone on for years in personal injury cases.  Millions of euro were made by insurance companies until legislation was passed in 2013 and enacted in August 2014, which led to having the statement of recoverable benefit and the need to reimburse the Department of Social Protection.</p> <p>  I am not convinced by Mr. Brennan's argument that his insurance company deserves a subsidy because it is not the company's fault or the client's fault, but somebody else's fault.  It is an act of God so to speak.  </p></speech>

I am not saying that insurance companies are not entitled to State subsidies or anything like that.  I was simply pointing out that the current legislation is very much based on a very specific point of law around personal injuries arising from accidents.  I was not trying to say that the insurance company is entitled to this.  I was simply pointing out that this is why it does not automatically apply.  The current legislation does not automatically make this happen.</p></speech>

Obviously, we will urge the Minister of State to engage in those meetings.</p> <p>  My final question relates to the types of insurance products that are available in this country.  Aviva Insurance Ireland's submission outlined the better availability of cover in underserved areas and the anticipation that this will play out arising from the Judicial Council guidelines and the changes that are taking place within insurance.  FBD Insurance and Zurich Insurance have also noted their commitment to the Irish market.</p> <p>  I want to ask the witnesses about insurance cover in the area of leisure and activity businesses.  Do they consider there is a gap in the market now with regard to adventure centres, adventure projects, voluntary projects or groups and leisure centres?  Is there is a gap in the market with regard to coverage for those sectors?  Are the three companies before the committee seeking to provide coverage to these sectors in the near to medium-term?</p></speech>

We have done that.  We have underwritten quite a number of voluntary organisations in the past number of months and we have also added some leisure business.  It is a small amount; we are just being careful.  It is an area in which pretty much all the insurers in Ireland have been badly burned in the past.  We need to gradually look at that, therefore, but we are certainly doing more than we would have done a year ago in a number of those areas.</p></speech>

They have to go to England and further afield.</p></speech>

The Senator spoke about children.  Children will still have to go to court for assessment.  That might be something that would help with childcare in adventure centres, children's play centres and those kinds of areas.  Things could be done there as well.  A review of PIAB is going on now, which is also a really important piece of the jigsaw.</p></speech>

We feel that to make a move into those sorts of areas, we need to see more progress on the duty of care.  One of the big challenges for both voluntary organisations and the leisure sector is the level of duty of care here in Ireland.  As things stand right now, we do not have any immediate plans to expand into those particular areas.  As the Senator said, they have been serviced over the years, mainly with more specialised companies from outside Ireland, mainly the UK.  I believe that will continue to be the case for the immediate future.</p></speech>

Given our situation as an Irish stand-alone insurer, FBD Insurance is very cautious about entering into new sectors, particularly where we do not have expertise.  As the situation changes over time with the claims experience in some of those areas, we would seek to expand.  It would usually be into areas that are adjacent to the business we underwrite at the moment, however.</p> <p>  We provide insurance for some voluntary organisations.  We ensure men's sheds, usually related to the locations of our local offices, and we also insure the Tidy Towns.  One of the major game changers around this will be the review of the Occupier's Liability Act 1995 and whether anything can be done on duty of care to balance the interests between small business owners, their patrons and their employees.</p></speech>

Does Mr. O'Midheach accept that the benefit of taxpayers' money, paid to small businesses and their employees by Government subsidies, ought to go to the small businesses for which they were intended rather than to large insurers such as FBD Insurance?</p></speech>

They have, therefore, been in receipt of those payments.  We have deducted those payments from the gross sum to make the insured party whole.  By the same token, I do not believe it is anybody's intention that they ought to benefit by those in addition to being made whole for the gross sum.</p></speech>

That is the reasoning behind providing these Government subsidies.  I am of the view that it is wholly and grossly unfair to do this to these businesses, which are already suffering.</p></speech>

There is, therefore, no benefit from insurance.</p> <p>  The debate then about making the Government whole is a distinct issue, which we have covered in previous discussions about mechanisms and rules.  The insured party would be made whole, however.</p></speech>

We have at this stage communicated with all the public house claimants.  We had quite a process to ensure we could communicate with all of them.  Regarding claims where we have received information from publicans, the figure concerned is 220, or about one fifth of what we have overall.  We have received information from those people.  Slightly fewer than 85 have accepted, and then we have a similar number where the offer is currently with the people concerned.  The remaining claims are then at the stage of being assessed.</p></speech>

If Mr. McMahon does not get a chance to get those figures before the end of the meeting, he could furnish them to the committee afterwards.  It will be important for the committee to see them.  Turning to the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019, how is the insurance industry preparing to implement that legislation in full?  What impact is it anticipated that will have for those affected?  It is a pity in many ways that the Government dragged its heels in this regard.  I refer in particular to the ambiguity in respect of the potential for this initiative to have been of benefit to those impacted by the pandemic.</p></speech>

Much detailed work has been undertaken in that regard in the past six or seven months.  We are ready to implement the Act on 1 September.  The main impact for customers is that they will be able to see their claims and premiums information for the previous five years.  The advent of this legislation is going to change the nature of insurance.</p> <p>  One of the unexpected consequences may be more pieces of paper in a renewal package - perhaps another four or five documents on average.  Customers will see more questions being asked, because the insurer's responsibility to ask specific questions has been increased, and that will happen.  Insurers will, therefore, ask more questions as part of the renewal process and in respect of new business concerning policies.  However, I reiterate that we are ready and we will be going live on 1 September in respect of the final stages of the Act.</p></speech>

Insurance companies, of course, have a legal obligation to report fraud so it can be investigated.  It is not incumbent on them to carry out the investigation, but they do have that legal obligation to report such instances.  From the figures I see here, in 2019 there were 63 reports of fraud, while in 2020 there were only 48 such reports.  Given all the bluster and everything we heard in media reports over the years regarding how significant an impact fraud was having, do the witnesses agree that the number of reports is quite small?  Can they explain why that would be the case?</p></speech>

The process identified 345 claims that warranted further investigation by our specialist team dealing with potential fraud.  Of those 345 claims, there were 68 cases where we suspected some element of fraud.  I underline the fact that it was only a suspicion of potential fraud.  On further investigation of those claims, there were 13 claims where we felt there was sufficient evidence of fraud to be of material assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and those cases were referred on.  Again, I cannot speak for the industry as a whole, but 13 claims out of 68 would, from my understanding, be above our market share, but that is all I say in respect of Zurich.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to have this exchange of views.  I used to be my party's spokesman in this area once upon a time a long time ago.  I must not have had too much of an effect, because we are still dealing with the same problems.  Does Insurance Ireland regulate the level of risk that may be undertaken by the various insurance companies?  I refer to the cover given, for instance, for business interruption or whatever it might be.  What is the story in that regard?  Could someone enlighten me?</p></speech>

He was appealing to judges to bring injury awards down to European levels.  We have finally got there, or we are on the way.  We still have a bit to go, but there has been progress in those years.  To answer the Deputy's question, Insurance Ireland does not do that.  It is an open market and Insurance Ireland has nothing to do with the cover provided by individual insurers.</p></speech>

I was wondering about that point, because if the activities of one or more of the insurance companies were of an overly risky nature, that might have an impact on the entire industry.</p></speech>

I posed a question to the Minister some years ago because I was given information to the effect that several lenders had taken insurance cover against some risks.  In fact, it was alleged at the time that those lenders were going to get paid by two different bodies.  One of those groups was the public, and the other was the insurance companies.  What is the story behind that?</p></speech>

Typical examples include directors' and officers' insurance, which would cover the boards of those companies, professional negligence insurance, which would cover financial institutions for cases of negligence, mis-selling, etc., and crime cover for possible instances of theft, in addition to normal insurance policies.  There are quite a few possibilities.  It would depend on what the action was, but typically in financial institutions we see many negligence actions.  We also see quite a bit of crime.</p></speech>

A reply to a parliamentary question stated that some are covered in the high-risk category, but the Minister was not sure how many or what percentage were covered.  That set off alarm bells because insurers would not have to cover too many.  All they needed was to cover two or three big risks, or maybe one really big risk, to result in a serious chasm in the entire insurance sector.  To what extent were payouts undertaken in respect of high-risk financial transactions or speculative transactions?  Are insurance companies still covering those?</p></speech>

Most of those insurers would be offshore.  One would not understand fully and one would not even see it in the Irish insurance numbers.  The answer the Deputy got about not knowing the answer was probably the correct one.</p></speech>

My immediate suspicions were aroused as to what extent cover might be offered to people who are trading in a fashion not in accordance with the rules, and who may have been compensated and drew down the cover.  I certainly would like to feel that Insurance Ireland was looking at these kinds of situations.  For example, would there be an assessment by the insurance company as to the potential for reckless trading?  What would be done in that situation?  Would the insurance company say "Okay, you are looking for cover for &euro;10 million or &euro;20 million, this is what the premium will be and we will cover you"?</p></speech>

In the event that the action was not determined to be an illegal act but it was a high-risk act - otherwise they would not be looking for cover in the particular situation - can Mr. O'Rourke give us any indication as to how those issues are greeted nowadays?  Does the insurer come out to the front door to meet the person seeking the cover, or does the insurer hide in the office and pretend that the person does not exist, hoping that he or she will go away?  Does the insurer just pay out when the time comes?</p></speech>

Is it taken as granted?  Do the companies ordinarily proceed with the cover or do they refer to anybody to examine it?  Do insurers say to themselves, "I do not think this is a very good risk and we should not have it"?  I pursued this issue ten years ago.  I came to the conclusion that there could have been a serious amount of cover offered for various high-risk financial transactions, which were unsafe or highly speculative.  I believe since that claims might have been paid.  In response to an earlier question Mr. O'Rourke said they would have been small amounts and it would be very small in the context of the Irish industry, and so on and so forth.  Like bookies with a bet they do not want to handle, they could have lay off the risk to a European insurer.  I am not trying to trivialise it.  I became familiar with all of these routes at the time, and I have one more.  Will Mr. O'Rourke clarify the degree to which the insurance companies evaluate the liability they take on in some of these circumstances, and especially with medium- to high-risk financial transactions?</p></speech>

Stockbrokers, banks and funds, for example, will be insured around the world and they have global insurers with expertise in the area.  They will know, for instance, whether an investment fund is high risk, are moms and pops investing, is it specialist investors who can take care of themselves, if investors need to be protected, what are the chances of a claim, and what types of things do they invest in.  Those specialist underwriters will figure out a rate.</p></speech>

It is a question I asked insurance companies some years ago.  Many small business people and private citizens have a number of vehicles for which they require insurance cover.  Some families may have up to 20 vehicles depending on the size of the family.  I inquired as to whether fleet insurance was available.  Immediately, the insurance companies threw up their hands and said, "Not at all, not under any circumstances, and how could you even consider a thing like that?"  I am not so sure I was given the right reply, but maybe Mr. O'Rourke could elucidate further on it.</p></speech>

A number of insurers offer multiple car discounts.  We offer a loyalty discount.  If the customer covers both their house and car we give discounts on both and free travel.  If they are classic cars there are schemes that take care of that and the premium is much lower because the cars are driven very little.  There is an array of options.  The local broker will probably be able to answer the question better than the insurers.  We would know bits and pieces of each one and what we offer ourselves but the brokers tend to know all of the products out there.</p></speech>

Most brokers would not add a profit margin to a quote.  They get the quote from us and then they add certain fees they charge their customers for doing certain things.  It is an actual fee and they would disclose it to the customer.  They would not normally add a profit margin to the premiums we send to them.</p></speech>

The information he has given the committee is that we can see insurance premiums coming down.  He said there is evidence of that.  The evidence I see in my office is that insurance premiums are going up.  I am not saying the majority are going up but the ones I see are.  I have an example to hand where the individual is insuring a car and nothing has changed except that he and the car are a year older.  His insurance last year was &euro;470 and this year it is &euro;608.17.  Given that there was very little driving going on over the past year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, other than in local areas, and given that there is a 50% no-claims record on this particular premium, why has it increased?  I know Mr. O'Rourke will say he cannot comment on individual cases but all the other cases are the same.  Nothing has happened to justify any kind of an increase in those cases.  If anything has happened, it is that the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, has said that insurance premiums will come down.  That is not what we are experiencing in our offices.  In spite of everything the witnesses said this afternoon, I hold to the position that insurance premiums have gone up for a considerable number of people.</p></speech>

In six quarters, the NCID showed that premiums dropped by 9%.  The CSO figures up to the end of 2019 and from 2020 onwards are showing a further 7% drop.  That is a 16% decrease overall.  There will always be some-----</p></speech>

I have referred to one such case. The individual in question is a loyal Aviva customer but he is expected to pay &euro;138.17 more than he paid last year.  I would say this is the same for everyone.  This person has been reading the newspapers and watching media coverage showing the indicators that insurance premiums are going down.  Like Mr. O'Rourke said, the overall percentages are going down.  Why then would customers like the man to whom I referred be facing an increase in premium?</p></speech>

This man, a customer of Aviva for years and with a no-claims bonus in place, has been told his premium is going up by &euro;138.  Mr. O'Rourke can cite statistics and analysis and the whole lot but there are too many people like this man coming into my office and telling me they cannot get insurance or, as in his case, that their premium has gone up.  Nothing Mr. O'Rourke has said today explains the increase in this individual's premium, which is similar to what is happening in other cases.</p></speech>

I just do not understand this argument we have had here for years abut insurance premiums.  Regarding the decision of the Judicial Council, Mr. O'Rourke said that quite a number of the judges voted against the proposals and his concern now is that they might ignore the proposals and continue in their old ways.  That is what I am taking from what he said.  He also referred to solicitors and how they might be into activities that would retain their high levels of fees.  That is a throwback to when we first started this discussion.  The solicitors blame the insurance companies, the insurance companies blame the solicitors, everyone blames the judges and the customer gets screwed.  It seems we are back in that territory again.</p></speech>

The PIAB is an independent State body set up to assess injuries.  For all of us, it is the best place for injuries to be assessed.  However, out of 30,000 cases that go into the PIAB, only 6,000 get assessed there.  I am not saying these things will happen but it is really important that we keep an eye on them.  That figure of 6,000 needs to increase and it is in everyone's interest that it does.  Right now, there is no incentive if a case comes out of the PIAB and the legal costs go from &euro;800 to &euro;16,000.  There is no barrier to stop that happening.  We just need to be careful with the structures that are in place and that behaviours do not change to cause obstructions.</p></speech>

The complaint I have received is that most design team members are required to carry a minimum cover of &euro;6.5 million.  I presume that is public liability cover for the various developments they are involved in.  They currently can only get &euro;1 million to &euro;2 million coverage and as they exceed &euro;2 million, there is a 400% or 500% increase.  They are being asked to sign off on housing estates and developments that have been completed.  Without them having the cover, many councils and voluntary housing agencies will simply not get the sign-off that is required by law.  It is interesting that when they are dealing with insurance companies regarding fire cover, there is a clause in one of the policies, which states: "We will not make any payment for any claim, or part of a claim or loss, arising directly or indirectly due to the combustibility or potential combustibility of fire protection performance of any type of panelling, cladding, facade or other material used in the surface, roof or interior of any building including, but not limited, to any associated core filter signage and insulation".  Is that a clause that any of the companies are familiar with?</p></speech>

This has become a very specialised area.  Any company that has been involved in the area will need to provide cover outside Ireland to protect themselves.  The Chairman spoke of the large sums insured that are involved.  It sounds very like international global reinsurance type-wording.  Again, what happened with the Grenfell Tower is the reinsurers are saying they do not want to provide cover for these after all that has happened.  They have seen the risk and they do not want to provide cover, particularly to cladding.  As I said, I am not an expert in the area but that does sound like international reinsurer type-wording to me.</p></speech>

How reinsurance tends to work is that companies will take the risk up to a certain amount and will reinsure anything above that with these large global reinsurers.  They would be quite insistent, I imagine, in an area like that that their wording would be passed on.</p></speech>

One tries to get diversity.  One would try to avoid putting money on deposit at the moment because of negative interest rates but there are times when it is necessary to have access to it if, for example, there are a couple of large claims coming up.  One needs to know the cash is available in the company's bank account.  Generally one tries to invest in something that hopefully has a positive yield with a longer term.</p></speech>

I am an architect and academic at the UCD school of architecture, planning and environmental policy.  My expertise is the science of prevention because although the virus is biological, the pandemic, which spreads from one person to another, is highly environmental.  Buildings are key to suppressing the pandemic.  Prevention is about managing people and managing air.  Vaccines alone cannot end this.  They need the support of a parallel prevention plan.</p> <p>  Looking at buildings in Ireland, we see the following.  More than half of the people who died were infected in just 0.03% of buildings.  Over half of the cases in workplace outbreaks have been in just 150 buildings.  Infection in overcrowded private homes is twice the rate of uncrowded homes.  One in four school buildings has had a Covid-19 index case in the past four months.</p> <p>  The problem is infected air.  We now understand that risk of transmission is predominantly indoors and very specific to certain buildings and indoor air conditions.  These conditions are preventable, and this knowledge is key to stopping infections and to opening buildings at low risk.  Most transmission is not from hands touching surfaces, it is from inhaling infected air.  Masks are the only protection at close range.  Outdoors, the virus is diluted and blown away.  However, in buildings and vehicles, it can build up, fill a space, linger for hours and infect many people.  Viral particles in the air behave a little like smoke and must be cleared out.</p> <p>  Many countries are achieving low-risk social and economic activity using prevention policies that manage people and their air.  These strategies include the following: providing public health information; reducing occupancy, that is, the number of people; limiting certain activities; setting indoor air standards; measuring unsafe, stale air; improving ventilation and filtration; and, sometimes, doing structural or engineering works to buildings.</p> <p>  Indoor air can be measured and managed.  This week, international researchers said &ldquo;preventing respiratory infection, like reducing waterborne or food-borne disease, is a tractable problem&rdquo;.  Indoor spread is measurable and controllable.  They warn that. &ldquo;For decades, the focus of architects and building engineers was on thermal comfort ... initial investment cost, energy use, and ... performance ... [and] infection control was neglected.&rdquo;  This was not always the case.  Ireland regulated overcrowding in bedrooms to prevent TB.  Before the modern era of energy efficiency and airtightness, architecture and public health were very closely aligned and that is why ventilation is regulated.  However, the balance has shifted away from disease prevention as the current regulations aim only to &ldquo;provide adequate ventilation while limiting energy use and avoiding occupant discomfort&rdquo;.  One hundred years ago, Chicago suppressed the 1918 pandemic with targeted measures, including building inspectors who signed off on ventilation as a condition of trading.  The city of Chicago reopened within six weeks.  There was no second wave and no vaccine.</p> <p>  With regard to the focus on what is high risk, international evidence points very clearly to which buildings and activities are high risk and where to target resources.  There is a significant body of research from theoretical and experimental sciences and building case studies.  Super-spread events, where many people are infected at once, indicate the particular environmental conditions of spread.  This means that targeted suppression can be very effective, as seen in Japan and other places.</p> <p>  There is a need to target the clusters.  Covid-19 has very particular characteristics.  Most people do not spread the virus to anyone else.  It is said to be &ldquo;highly over-dispersed&rdquo;, meaning spread is not a factor of average contacts.  Suppressing the pandemic, therefore, is less about rules for people and more about rules for places.  This is an opportunity to target interventions because most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, so the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare super-spread events.  These super-spread conditions can arise in any enclosed space with two people or many.  Indoor risk is about the building, its management and operation, the number of people and the activity.  There are strong seasonal factors because indoor air quality changes with the weather, the season and the operation of the building.  Infection risk indoors can be reduced by 50% with increased airflow, and by almost 90% with airflow, filtration and wearing masks.  Although data in Ireland are limited, the patterns of Covid spread are very similar to other countries, so public health measures can be targeted to have the most impact.</p> <p>  I will now look at the high-risk areas.  With regard to vehicles, high levels of ventilation and filtration are critically important in cars, vans, buses and aircraft.  An outbreak on an aircraft into Dublin last summer resulted in 13 cases on the aeroplane and 59 cases in total, across six HSE regions.</p> <p>  With regard to housing, infection rates are double in overcrowded private homes, according to the CSO data.  A significant number of infections happen within households, and rates are higher in households with children.  Inadequate space in institutional and shared housing is high risk, such as in dormitories, hostels and emergency homeless accommodation.  Direct provision centres have had 82 outbreaks with an average of ten cases each.  Traveller and Roma housing have had 423 outbreaks with an average of 12 cases.</p> <p>  With regard to schools and childcare, more than one in four schools has had a Covid index case since February and, in total, there have been almost 2,500 cases linked to 579 outbreaks in schools.  Last week alone, there were 61 outbreaks in schools, which was 20% of all outbreaks.  Of 633 cases linked to outbreaks last week, more than one third, or 36%, were in schools and childcare facilities.  There have been almost 2,000 close contact cases in childcare and after-school facilities since last July and 342 outbreaks in approximately 900 childcare buildings, that is, more than one third of childcare facilities have had an outbreak.</p><p>In hospitals, nursing homes and residential care, 55% of the people who died from Covid-19 in Ireland, were infected in fewer than 0.03% of all buildings.  A mere 667 buildings accounted for the infections that led to more than half of the deaths.  There have been 600 outbreaks in 581 nursing homes, but it is very uneven.  In Kildare, 87% of all nursing home deaths were in just a quarter of the buildings and that needs further investigation.  Inadequate ventilation is linked to poor respiratory health in older people.</p><p> More than half of all infections in workplace outbreaks were in meat and food plants.  There were nearly 3,500 cases in outbreaks with an average of more than 40 cases per building in those.  There have been 96 outbreaks in construction.  One meat plant alone had an outbreak with 226 cases.  One construction site outbreak had 148 cases.</p><p> I will deal with indoor dining, bars, gyms, places of assembly.  Some places have significantly higher risks, particularly where people are indoors in close proximity for long periods of time and without masks, such as in restaurants, pubs, theatres, cinemas, hotels, and entertainment and sports venues.  An outbreak in a caf&eacute; in Cork resulted in 57 cases.  At an extreme level, one breach in hotel quarantine in Australia directly resulted in 18,000 infections, 800 deaths and a 112-day lockdown.  Breaches in buildings can have a very significant impact.</p><p> Certain activities have higher risks, including exercise in gyms and for sports, singing in choirs and at religious events, and shouting, because they generate aerosols and involve deep breathing.  A recent outbreak in a gym in Canada resulted in 480 cases and it spread to 49 workplaces.</p><p> This knowledge provides an opportunity for more sure-footed policies.  Eliminating unsafe conditions protects everyone, including children, people with compromised immunity and those not vaccinated.  It also mitigates the risk of variants, and of super-spread events.  Vaccines alone cannot provide enough headroom for reopening.  A prevention plan is needed.</p><p> Safe indoor air has many measurable benefits for health and well-being.  It mitigates all respiratory illness, including flu, and future-proofs for another pandemic.  Aside from all these benefits, good indoor air quality is a legal requirement of workplace health and safety.</p><p> This understanding of transmission and prevention has significant implications, and indicates a need for fundamental review of some incorrect assumptions in public health policy; public health information; reopening plans; sectoral rules; tracking and tracing procedures; epidemiological modelling; and building standards, inspection and enforcement.  To ensure that policy is consistent and scientifically up to date, an active multidisciplinary approach is needed.  It needs collaboration and engagement across disciplines including biomedical, epidemiological, environmental, sociological and other sciences.</p><p> Further analysis of these patterns of spread and investigation of buildings is needed.  There must be a risk-based approach to target interventions and effectively use limited resources.  If this virus were in water or food, the response would be to take samples, investigate the source and eliminate the problem.  So it must be with infected air.</p><p> This is a third way that steers a scientific course between lockdown and uncontrolled spread.  However, it requires a paradigm shift so that public health policy is evidence based and responsive to new knowledge.  There needs to be a shift in perception that we cannot afford the cost of control, because the economic costs of infections can be enormous and may well exceed costs of containment.</p></speech>

Over the past 150 years the link between science, the development of interventions, and organisation of public authorities has increased the success and public understanding of public health.  It is time for ventilation and its impact on air quality to be seen through a similar lens.</p> <p>  We spend up to 90% of our time indoors and this pandemic is a disease of buildings.  Regardless of where we see the balance between fomite, close or long-range transmission, the impact on health of our indoor environment has been thrust into focus.</p> <p>  Ventilation is a critical factor in reducing the risk of long-range airborne transmission, particularly in enclosed spaces.  Often simple strategies that ensure adequate ventilation can help to reduce the spread of Covid-19 in many settings, including homes, schools, workplaces, public buildings and vehicles.  Moreover, these strategies can also reduce the risk of superspreading events where many people become infected at the same time.  It is an important part of a layered strategy to reduce transmission and should, of course, be used in conjunction with other measures.</p> <p>  As the science and our understanding of this disease has developed, ventilation is increasingly recognised as a critical factor in this multi-layered approach.  While it is an important component of any building, ventilation sits within a rapidly changing landscape.  The climate emergency is driving changes in regulations and fundamentally how our buildings are being asked to perform.  We are about to undertake a wholesale upgrade of our existing building stock that will have dramatic impacts on the performance of every building we occupy.  Our lifestyles and how we spend our time indoors continue to change.  Technology is rapidly evolving, giving us more insight into how our buildings perform and how we manage them.  The science related to indoor air quality continues to evolve and its impact on our health and well-being deepen.</p> <p>  Ventilation in buildings and how it impacts our health, in this case Covid-19, is not a field of absolutes.  We must not let perfection be the enemy of the good.  We already know many of our buildings do not perform as intended.  We all have experience of them.  Poor indoor air quality already costs us every day.</p> <p>  According to the EPA, 300 cases of lung cancer per year in Ireland can be linked to radon in our homes and workplaces.  According to the Asthma Society of Ireland, 380,000 people currently live with asthma in Ireland, a disease we know is significantly exacerbated by poor indoor environments, such as damp and dusty homes.  Every four minutes someone is admitted to hospital with asthma.  This disease alone costs the State &euro;472 million per year.</p> <p>  Ventilation impacts in a very real way our health and well-being, the learning outcomes of our children in school, lost days at work, lost rent and income to landlords and the State through disrepair and vacant properties as result of condensation and damp, and in other ways.  The pandemic has brought into stark perspective the impacts ventilation can have in disease control.</p> <p>  It is time for a significant shift in how we, as a society and State, view the air we breathe and start to value it the same way we value the water we drink and the food we consume.  The role of ventilation in fighting this pandemic and the additional benefits it brings must be brought further forward in our strategies and communication.</p> <p>  We need to mobilise professionals and provide signposts and advice for every building owner to access consistent and technically correct information on ventilation - information that is already available.  This would enable them to work with and get the best out of what they have and develop strategies to improve their buildings over time, not just for Covid-19 now and into next winter but for all the other benefits it brings.</p> <p>  We need better enforcement of regulations on ventilation in our new buildings and the development of better standards and guidance for our existing ones.</p> <p>  Ventilation in buildings needs to be at the centre of not just this pandemic but in everything we do in buildings.  It is a subject matter that has an impact on all Departments, including the Departments of Education, Health, and Environment, Climate and Communications.  The dividends of getting this right will repay our effort many times over.</p></speech>

I agree that we expect water to be treated and the principle of treating our air makes common sense.</p><p>I have travelled by train to Dublin all of the time during this pandemic and part of the requirement of Irish Rail is that the windows are left open.  That is done for a clear reason.  The principle of how air is treated is very important.  I understand that in the building we are in now, unfortunately because of the pandemic we cannot use the committee rooms where our engagement with the witnesses would normally happen.  My understanding is that at least one company approached Leinster House last August seeking to carry out a ventilation exercise in the committee rooms and the Chambers.  As an institution, we want to see people getting back to work but we should be leading by example.  It is regrettable that the Houses of the Oireachtas did not engage more with this principle and use the Oireachtas as an example of how people can return to work safely.</p><p> I am interested in hearing our witnesses' views on the industry standards and the quality and perhaps Ms Hegarty might respond .  There is obviously a difference between ventilation and filtration.  High efficiency particulate air filter, HEPA, filtration is seen as the Rolls-Royce model of equipment that would do what we all want to see in terms of clean air.  Where are we as a country in embracing this?  Are we very much behind the curve?  Is there a European model?  I believe that Germany is particularly ahead when it comes to this, that there are air ventilation systems in the Bundestag and that most schools and public buildings in Germany have very clean and properly ventilated air.  Is there a better example than the German one in Europe?  Ms Hegarty might talk to us about that.  Can she also reflect on how far behind we are as a country in this area of protecting public health?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.353" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Conway for his question.  The most important thing we need to get across today is that much of this can be dealt with by way of clear public health information and good guidance.  We live in a temperate climate.  We are not the United States of America, where there is a great deal of air conditioning.  Most of our buildings are naturally ventilated so that people can improve things dramatically by just understanding the risks here in buildings and vehicles.  Most of our buildings are small ones with openable windows.  In particular, in the seasons when we are not heating or not having to heat a great deal, this can be addressed very easily at little or no cost.</p> <p>  In the winter season, we definitely need to start monitoring air because people are closing up buildings and there is a high risk of infection.  In our larger buildings, we have mechanical or other systems and people need technical advice.  We are talking in particular here about places like shops that are using wall and ceiling-mounted air conditioning units.  These are very dangerous because they are not bringing in fresh air but are recirculating cool dry air and they have been connected with outbreaks where they are blowing air around the room.  Again, this is an area where advice could help.</p> <p>  Larger buildings that have mechanical ventilation systems are often switched to recirculate the air to save energy.  If that is the case they need to be checked and may need upgrades on filtration or on equipment.  There are separate risks there.  </p> <p>The Senator mentioned HEPA filtration.  This involves very low technology portable filtration fans that people can buy, sometimes for &euro;100 or a little bit more for a classroom, that would be very suitable for places like nursing homes and childcare settings where perhaps people cannot wear masks or where there is a concern about vulnerable children or older people being in draughts or uncomfortable conditions.  These are plug-in portable fans that can be very effective.  Even from where we are now, there are very simple strategies that can be used in many places, with advice.</p> <p>  We also need to be very careful where people are selling systems at present, which may not be effective, are not regulated and which could possibly produce harmful by-products that are dangerous to health.  There is an unregulated area at present in which systems are being advertised, sold and installed without being proven to be effective or giving a benefit and which may be very expensive.  This is a technical area which needs to be resolved.</p> <p>  On the question of Germany, it has been dealing with this and has put forward an investment of several hundred million euro in order to improve schools and public buildings.  Monitoring air can be a first step.  This can be done very cheaply and carbon dioxide monitors are small and portable at a price of between &euro;100 and &euro;200.  They can be fitted to classrooms, office buildings and shops very easily.  They are light and can be moved around.  Spain is using these quite extensively in schools, as are other countries. </p> <p>  There are many low technology solutions and advice that can be taken at very little cost.  There will obviously be larger buildings that need specific targeted interventions where they have been identified as risk areas.</p></speech>

Does she believe that the Government is taking this issue seriously?  Ms Hegarty stated that this is very much an unregulated area.  The first thing we need to do, therefore, is to introduce regulations to make the testing and monitoring of air part of what we do, in the same way that we test and monitor water.</p> <p>  On the systems that are being used, clearly it is worrying if there are some that are not up to scratch.  Many people have engaged with and purchased equipment motivated by the right reasons.  Clearly then, a job of work has to be done to bring in some sort of regulation and approved recognition for systems, standards and so on.  Does Ms Hegarty believe that this work is now being taken seriously and is being done?  As a committee, should we be making recommendations to the Government in this area?  What is her advice be to us on that?</p></speech>

I do not feel that the response has been adequate or that the public health message has been clear.  The vast majority of people to whom I speak do not know why it is important and if they have heard the word ventilation, they do not understand why it is significant.  Many of the policy and sectoral documents advocate improving ventilation if appropriate or if possible.  They do not explain that it is absolutely critically key as a first defence.  There are also a number of other flaws across this issue.</p> <p>  One is that sectoral guidance is left to the sectors to write.  Whether it is sports, construction, childcare, nursing homes, shops, hairdressers or dentists, the sectors are writing their own guidance and a scientific review is not being done on whether that is consistent, correct or up to date.  A significant number of documents out there are scientifically incorrect and out of date.  People are doing their best and what they think is appropriate but are doing the wrong things.  This needs a more co-ordinated approach and needs to align with epidemiological modelling, which is to understand the changes in how we model the spread of disease because this is not a disease of averages.  Very targeted interventions could be much more effective than blanket restrictions.</p></speech>

If it is already working successfully in other countries, is there a particular model that Ms Hegarty would recommend?</p></speech>

That would make a considerable difference.  Obviously the focus of NPHET is on hospital buildings and on mitigating risk there.  Hospitals are only 86 of our 2.5 million buildings.  The focus in hospitals is different to the focus on what is happening in the community.  It is also important to note that hospital buildings generally, particularly the newer buildings, are built to a very high standard of ventilation.</p><p>Even within that, we do not have rules within the hospital sector that will protect staff in terms of higher quality personal protective equipment, PPE, for those staff still working behind Perspex screens in some places without masks.  Again, that is not a protection.  A suite of measures are needed, especially within sectors.  There needs to be consistency and the measures should be based on scientific principles rather than what is convenient in a given sector.</p></speech>

Initially, when the expert group started to meet, the minutes and reports of the meetings were published online.  There are minutes of the meetings of 2 February, 5 February and 8 February.  Then it stops and no minutes or reports are published on the website.  Why is that the case?  I assume the group has met several times since then.</p></speech>

The reporting of the group moved from the National Public Health Emergency Team to the senior officials group in Government.  The group is no longer reporting to NPHET.  That would have changed in March, although I do not have the exact date in front of me - it may have been in April.  I understand the reports produced by NPHET will be published but I do not think they are on the website at the moment.</p></speech>

I hear what Ms Hegarty said about the group originally reporting to NPHET but now reporting to the senior officials group that was set up to manage Covid-19.  If the minutes of the meetings are not being published, we cannot see what is being discussed or what recommendations are being made.  Is this something the group has raised?  Were the members of the group aware that the minutes of the meetings stopped being published on 8 February?</p></speech>

We understand the HSE website is slow to publish minutes generally.  It takes some time to get them up.  As such, the reports have not been published yet.  Our understanding is that the plan is to do so.</p> <p>  On a certain date we stopped reporting to NPHET and moved across to the senior officials group.  At that point, public reporting of reports and minutes ceased.  That does not mean those reports and minutes are not kept on record within the group.  They would be available to be published somewhere if that was the decision.</p></speech>

My point is broader.  I am not saying it directly to this group because it is not the responsibility of the group to ensure the reports and minutes are published.  I accept that minutes are taken and records are kept.  However, it is important that they are made public so that we can learn from them as well.

I will repeat the point.  I have no difficulty with the witnesses.  I am saying that in terms of process, public education and access to information it would be better if the minutes of the meetings were published so that we could see them.  For the purposes of preparing for this session, I was able to see the minutes for 2 February, 5 February and 8 February.  Then it stopped.  Is that something the group could take up with the HSE?  Can they ensure that the information on whatever meetings that have taken place since then is made publicly available?  Both witnesses have made a strong contention that there is a lack of awareness and education in respect of ventilation.  If an expert group is in place, I imagine it would be beneficial to the expert group and the witnesses that what has been discussed is made publicly available.</p></speech>

I know we are putting a focus on this because of Covid-19.  The witnesses expressed the view that air management and air quality was a greater issue than Covid.  Obviously, in a pandemic it becomes a major issue to better manage air quality and prevent the spread of this virus.  However, it has wider implications for the health of people and in other areas.  In terms of the overall management of air quality where do we rank in Europe?  Are there data?  Have studies been done on how we rank?  Is it correct to assume the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has overall responsibility for the management of air quality?  Has each Department responsibility in law to publish air management or air quality plans?  Is there an obligation on each Department to manage this in their buildings and so on?  Is that a requirement of each Department at this point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.377" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#D01800"><p>I will address the question on data first.  It is difficult to measure buildings.  We have buildings in use that are 200 or 300 years old.  We have buildings that have been adapted over time.  We have new buildings and some that have energy upgrades.  People have used them in different ways.  Sometimes they are used in a more crowded way than they were designed for or for a different purpose.  It is difficult to make comparisons.</p> <p>  We do not have ventilation regulated centrally in any way in Europe.  Each country regulates its standards.  Obviously, there is the factor of the local climate and other conditions.</p> <p>  Some other countries are doing far better in the pandemic response, especially Asian countries that have adopted this approach right from the beginning.  Countries like Vietnam, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan and China have responded with a clear message on ventilation as prevention.  They did this from the beginning of the pandemic.  Western countries, especially English-speaking western countries, have been especially slow and, I would say, resistant to adopting this as part of the pandemic response.  We can see the outcomes in comparing cases and deaths across the two different regions.</p> <p>  Who is responsible?  Responsibility is scattered.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has standards for new buildings.  As we know, we have self-certification of new buildings, so certifying compliance is in the control of the developer or owner and not necessarily picked up anywhere independently.  Having standards and performance are two different things.  We can have an issue with the people who operate the building not knowing how it should be considered and so they may block up vents or overpopulate rooms.  The remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage stops at construction.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has some responsibility in respect of air quality standards.  The Health and Safety Authority has a role under workplace health and safety.  Then again, not every building is a workplace.  There is inconsistency and there has not been a focus on this.  Building regulation standards only tend to change in response to an event.  If there is a structural collapse, a fire or some other emergency, we tend to react and have new regulations.  We have not had an issue with air quality since the tuberculosis era.</p> <p>  We have drifted into a medical response to issues, whereby we medicate and treat the illness rather than prevent it.  We have probably had 50 years of this, building from the oil crisis.  We have not had the experience of SARS or other pandemics that some other countries have had in more recent years.  Now is the time to react to this event and take it seriously.</p></speech>

This issue has major implications.  I am interested in the application of ventilation.  I visited a lot of schools in my constituency prior to Christmas and the way in which the age of the building influenced how the school managed ventilation was really interesting.  With the ultra-modern, state-of-the-art buildings, big and bright and with a huge amount of natural light, which is really healthy, and quite open indoor plaza spaces, I got a sense that they were very well ventilated from a design and engineering point of view.  In the schools that were 30 or 40 years old the ventilation consisted of wide open entrance doors, windows open in every classroom, cold classrooms and children and teachers wearing warmer clothes.  That is simply unsustainable.  As we move forward now, particularly into retail and hospitality spaces, the role of ventilation is critical, whether or not it is with a view to dealing with a further pandemic at some stage down the road.  We know indoors is a no-no, but what have we learned about the obvious hospitality activities of eating and drinking and how we can apply those lessons to those areas?  What kind of advice are the witnesses now in a position to give?  What are we learning?  What is the halfway house or even the quarter-way house between fully open-air, which is almost but not completely impossible in the Irish context, and indoors, which is impossible in the context of a pandemic?  What kinds of lessons have we learned?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.381" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#E00400"><p>As for schools, the age of the school building obviously has an impact.  A lot of older schools built before perhaps the 1970s were designed with the memory of TB still alive.  They have good cross-ventilation, higher ceilings and more space.  A lot of that has been squeezed down and engineered out, I think, and some of those older buildings may have had retrofits involving sealed windows and partitions and other things, which have made them more dangerous.  What the schools did between August and Christmas was very commendable in that they were really the only ones to take this seriously in the autumn.  However, in the absence of any way of measuring safe air quality, the schools probably over-ventilated in a lot of cases, that is, they opened all the windows and the classrooms were very cold and uncomfortable because school management did not know when to stop.  If we provide CO2 monitoring in schools, we can find a happy balance because we can assess in real time whether risk conditions are rising.  Then we can open the windows for 15 minutes or take the class outside for 15 minutes, prevent risk and keep people comfortable.  That is the only option for next winter because children will not be vaccinated, so the schools need a plan for autumn and it needs to start immediately to be in place by winter.  The nursing homes probably fit in that category as well.</p> <p>  As for retail and hospitality, all buildings can be made safe.  Once we start measuring, we can target the risks.  Clearly, many buildings are low-risk because, otherwise, the pandemic would be even worse.  The issue, therefore, is how we find the conditions that are dangerous and deal with them.  This is not perceptible to humans.  I was in a large building yesterday with a CO2 monitor.  It felt reasonably comfortable at all times, yet when I looked at my CO2 monitor the reading went from safe to unsafe within five minutes in a different part of the building.  That would not have been perceptible to anybody not carrying a monitor to check air conditions.  As humans, we cannot guess at this, no more than we can guess at safe water.  We need to start monitoring.  People do not stay very long in retail environments and they wear masks, so the key issue in retail is to keep the numbers low, keep the air moving and protect the staff, particularly those who are there for longer periods and perhaps using back areas, storerooms and break rooms where they take off masks.  They can be the danger areas.</p> <p>  Hospitality is probably the most challenging sector, but that is not to say it cannot be dealt with.  It is the most challenging because people sit close together across a table, breathe the same air, tend to stay a long time and do not wear masks and a lot of buildings have been adapted and changed over the years and tables can be very close together.  Every building needs to be looked at differently and individually within a framework of good advice on the spacing of tables, particularly filtration and localised filtration to tables, which may be a good option for restaurants.  That is the HEPA filtration we spoke about earlier.  It basically comprises just a fan and a filter which cleans virus particles and other particles from the air continuously while people are in the room.  Then it is a matter of taking particular care of staff, back areas, toilets and cold rooms.  The means by which people travel to hospitality environments can be as high-risk as the actual building they enter.</p></speech>

How would Ms Hegarty see it being put on a structured, formal basis in terms of feeding into any future plans in the autumn and the winter?  That is the first matter.</p> <p>  My second point is about public transport: trams, the DART, trains and buses.  They are back up to 50% capacity now.  What kinds of data does Ms Hegarty have on that?</p> <p>  An obvious area which was connected with antigen testing recently is stadiums.  Are there any data on the air quality in the stands of a GAA, rugby or soccer ground?  Has the expert advisory group come up with any advices in that regard?</p></speech>

It is just to feed into what she says.  I see all the windows open.  I just feel that that stems from perhaps not a particularly scientific approach.  How can we assist public transport companies towards best practice in this regard?  They cannot be faulted because we are learning all the time, but how could they be assisted with this?  What technology could we put at their disposal?  In other words, how could we make public transport reasonably reassuring for the public in greater numbers - or can we at all - in terms of air quality?</p></speech>

The first is to improve airflow such that if vehicles have systems installed they are on full fresh air and not recirculating air that could have virus in it and in order that there is a good throughput of air all the time, that occupancy is managed such that there is no overcrowding and that people wear good masks, not lightweight ones.  The general position in places such as Taiwan and now Austria is that everybody wears a higher standard of mask and does not have a haphazard view of masks.  There are two things-----</p></speech>

For protection from aerosol particles, that is, the very fine, lighter particles, which is what we are talking about, N95 or higher protection masks are recommended.  Some countries have moved to those, and the examples of that are in Asia, specifically Taiwan.  The masks are being provided by the Taiwanese Government.</p></speech>

The blue paper-like masks are surgical masks.  The two issues with masks are filtration, that is, the material used, and fit.  Surgical masks are often not a very good fit in that there are gaps around the edges which make them ineffective against aerosol particles.  As I was saying, the Taiwanese Government mass-procured all their masks, people there are provided with a certain number of masks at very low cost every two weeks and everybody wears a very good mask.  Some parts of Europe have required such masks on public transport or in retail or other establishments.</p></speech>

In Japan, there is sort of silence rule on public transport because infected people put less of the virus into the air if they are not speaking or shouting.  We should give people the simple advice that not speaking or speaking in a very low voice can reduce risks.</p></speech>

The advice I am giving is based on the information I have gathered from speaking to other people, including aerosol physicists and people who work in occupational health.  That is the point I am making about it being a multidisciplinary issue.  It is very important that all of these people are around the table for our risk assessment to balance everything.  In the early stages last year, there were concerns about supplies and procurement.  There were concerns about people buying up supplies which would not then be available to people in the hospitals.  Those things have changed over the course of the year.  Similarly, in making these kinds of decisions, there must be a balance between risk and availability.  This may involve equipment, masks and the settings in which people are.  We must also consider whether cheaper and easier mitigations are available.</p></speech>

There were two questions as people reached for an understanding of how we implement this.  The reality is this is very complex to do.  We have to get down to basics.  Good public information and awareness about the benefits of ventilation will go a very long way in getting people to be aware of their surroundings.  I look on the screen in front of me and see that every single person is in a different environment right now.  We can learn a lot from the world of retrofitting.  We need bespoke solutions for each individual room and building.  That is the hard reality.  There is no easy road with regard to ventilation in existing buildings.  One needs professionals, people who are capable of assessing risk and people who understand health and safety at work.  People need to go into spaces, look at them and understand how to get the best out of those buildings.  It goes back to the idea of perfection being the enemy of the good.  We can look for the perfect solution for every building but the reality is that we have to start somewhere.  The best place to start is with awareness.  We have to get people to understand and be cognisant of the air they breathe.  We can start to develop advice and tools over time to enable people to get the best out of what they have and, eventually, develop strategies to improve those buildings over time.  That is the point I wanted to make.</p></speech>

The first outlined the details of the actions of the expert group.  The second looked in more detail at the best advice available at the moment.  A point which has been made here a couple of times is that good advice is already available right across the sector.  We have seen such advice from American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, ASHRAE, from the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, CIBSE, and from the Federation of European Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Associations, REHVA.  Many international organisations are already producing very good advice.  From a solutions perspective, the expert group is not reinventing the wheel.  A lot of that information is already available.  That is being reported.</p></speech>

It is an invisible thing, a natural thing we do every second of the day without thinking about it.  Even getting people to be cognisant of the air we breathe is very difficult indeed.  This pandemic has certainly brought that into focus but issues of indoor air quality and poor health are slow burners.  They are not as dramatic as the pandemic so we do not see it.  I apologise; what was the second part of the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

Most of them are in line with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, documents and other advice that was out there.  The advice in the first two reports went to NPHET.  It sat with NPHET.  Since then, we have reported to the civil servant group.  We have moved away from reports and towards letters to the civil servant group.  These letters are more specific to given sectors.</p></speech>

It seems crazy to have an expert group looking at this area, making recommendations and advising the Government when no one is hearing about it.  That just does not make any sense at all.  It is something the committee should take up.</p> <p>  I am very short on time.  May I ask Ms Hegarty what are the short-term immediate solutions for household ventilation?  She said that one can deal with 50% of the problem by improving airflow.  With regard to improving air filtration, what kind of costs are we talking about in this regard in either a domestic setting, a school setting or a small business?  I am thinking of the hairdressers and retail outlets opening up this week or last week.  What are they doing about that?  Have they had any direction or guidance from any State agency as regards what they should do about ventilation?</p></speech>

This does mention ventilation.  I have been reading quite a lot of sectoral guidance since May of last year when the construction industry produced its first set of advice.  These documents come across as official guidance and people in the sector are taking them as official because they have yellow covers and an official <i>imprimatur</i>.  They are often highly inconsistent and unscientific however.  Other than the work safety protocol, I do not know of any clear advice for anybody opening a shop or small business.  I believe many people mean well but are not doing the right things.  In some cases, they may be making the situation worse.  It is really important that a clear message goes out.<br/><br/>With regard to households, again I suspect that a lot of infection was happening in cars, as well as in homes.  When people are told not to meet or that two households can meet together, the risk does not relate to whether two or three households are involved but to the air conditions in the room.</p><p>It is the equivalent of inviting a smoker into one's home.  How would someone deal with that situation?  How would it be worse if there were ten people in the room and two of them were smoking?  People must understand the logic of that.  It can be very dangerous in a car with two people.</p></speech>

There has been a strong belief in some quarters that this is not how it transmits but the science now tells us otherwise.  Second, there has been no joined-up thinking between the expert groups in that they operate independently and do not collaborate so people in different disciplines use different terminology and possibly have mistaken beliefs sometimes.  I have come across people who assume that improving ventilation means that we put engineering and equipment into every building and that this is not feasible.  That is not what this is about.</p> <p>  The word "ventilation" has been seen as another add-on beyond distancing, masks and hand washing instead of being seen as core to everything.  Thinking of it as ventilation, it has not translated into "this is about how we use buildings."  It is much more than ventilation.  It is about how people move around in buildings, how many people are in the building, how long they stay for, whether they are wearing masks and whether they are more vulnerable.  A targeted approach that picks out the really high-risk areas would be much more effective than a lockdown.  It would involve an incremental approach involving prevention, particularly schools, childcare, nursing homes and indoor dining and hospitality, over the next few months while the weather is good.</p></speech>

We are talking about quite a broad spectrum of typologies.  Things like hepa filtration and single-room occupancy have been issues in hospital settings for at least a decade.  Businesses and schools are a different consideration than homes.  I know there has been some research in Ireland on the very poor ventilation quality in our homes.  While this may not necessarily speak to Covid transmission, it certainly speaks to the level of asthma we have.</p> <p>  Regarding how we arrive at our building standards, the original Building Control Act provided for a Building Regulations Advisory Board where experts would have joined together to advise the Department about what is appropriate.  That seems to have been disbanded.  Do the witnesses think a mechanism like that would have been useful in the past year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.417" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#G00500"><p>The Building Regulations Advisory Board is there in statute.  It was disbanded in about 2012 and has not been in operation since.  This is a major failing because individual buildings are being reviewed in isolation when they are all connected.  In the case of the new build-to-rent apartment standards, I do not believe there was due consideration of the impact of taking out cross ventilation, lowering ceiling heights so there was less volume, making spaces smaller and removing lobbies to corridors so that there was more of a risk, as we have seen in buildings with long corridors such as the quarantine hotels in Australia, of pressure build up in rooms with long corridors where there are heavy fire doors and one gets airflow conditions that cannot be predicted.  This has caused cross contamination in quarantine hotels in Australia.  Daylight standards have been reduced, balconies have been taken out, which means it is difficult to purge ventilate a room, and more people are sharing lifts than is probably appropriate for public health.  An independent building regulation advisory board that works openly and transparently with a lot of high-level expertise would be very helpful because often a change is made in one area without recognition of the impact and these things are all connected through architecture, be they climate change, the pandemic, cost saving or daylight.  The lack of an open board or possibly a mechanism for those kinds of discussions has been detrimental.  It would be good to see that resumed.</p> <p>  To answer the question about ventilation, we have had improving energy performance requirements over the past ten or 15 years driven by the energy performance and buildings directive from Europe but the ventilation standards have been very slow to catch up in parallel with that.  Ironically, some of our newer buildings that are more airtight may be higher risk for Covid than some of our older buildings.</p></speech>

Ireland is leading the way here.  In our latest revision of building regulations under Part F, we need an independent validator or inspector of ventilation systems in all new homes.  That is to be applauded.  We are the first country in Europe to go that far in saying that all new buildings need to be inspected by somebody independent.  This is definitely to be welcomed.  Unfortunately, this falls down a bit because the t's and i's have not been crossed and dotted and there is no central database where that information is held and can be audited.  As of today, we do not know how many homes have been inspected and we certainly do not know how many of them have passed or failed.  The devil is in the detail with that kind of stuff that really adds power to those regulations.  In some ways, our ventilation regulations are pretty good and are certainly in line with many other countries.  What is key is inspection, policing and making sure the supply chain is delivering.</p></speech>

We have talked about ventilation systems.  I know a lot of the discussion is about simply opening windows and making people aware.  We will be dealing with more and more mechanical items, particularly in newer buildings where there is an airtightness requirement.  As far as I am aware, there has never been a conviction for proprietary building materials that are incorrect or badly certified.  Is that a concern?  I think Ms Hegarty mentioned that there are products on the market that are not fully compliant or do what they say on the tin.</p></speech>

What I have spoken about here is hepa filtration - a very basic fan and filter that people can run very safely just drawing the air through it while they are in a room, be it a cr&egrave;che or bedroom.  This is advisable everywhere and could be a good solution for many buildings and businesses.  Other systems are available.  There are very specialist systems to do with UV light, which may have some specialist installations and are sometimes used in hospitals and other specialist locations, that may have applications in other buildings here but require specialist independent advice and installation.  There are other systems on sale in Ireland that use light, ionisation and other systems that have not been regulated for this purpose and may not be effective.  Some systems produce by-products like ozone, which is damaging to the lungs.  People are selling systems that do this.  They are also selling systems that operate when the room is empty, which is of limited use.</p><p>If you are going to bring people into a restaurant for the evening, for example, using these systems before people arrive is of very limited benefit.  Airing the place well before people arrive and having filtration around the room would be very effective and safe.  Using some kind of other system may be an expensive option and may not be effective.  It is important that advice coming from the Government be very clear so that people who are struggling in their businesses and well intended are given good advice.</p></speech>

How long does Ms Hegarty think we will be wearing masks in settings, particularly public transport and workplaces?  The guidelines for the lockdown will be eased in time but could we still be wearing masks on public transport in a couple of years' time?</p></speech>

We need to be very cautious opening, in risk assessment terms, with a small percentage of the population vaccinated.</p> <p>  Masks are by far the best protection we have.  The highest risk is close to somebody who is infected.  Another strange characteristic of this disease is that most of the people who get infected are infected by somebody who does not know that they are ill.  You are infected by somebody who is either pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic.  He or she is not showing symptoms.  That is why it has been so difficult to tackle this disease around the world.  Other illnesses may have something that demonstrates symptoms and people stay at home, but not with this one.</p> <p>  Masks are by far our best defence because they do two things.  They stop somebody who may be infected putting virus into the air and they protect the other person who is breathing.  They are also cheap, low-tech, manageable and visible.  Unlike some other places where they are removing mask restrictions, we should be very careful about rowing back on that because people have been very compliant here with wearing masks.  Wearing masks might be more of an issue in specialist settings.  Clearly, people in Asia wearing masks on public transport as a matter of course has been very effective.</p> <p>  Somebody asked about entertainment and hospitality.  A trial was run at a concert in Germany last summer where people were put in very good quality masks and very good ventilation was put in the building.  They found they were both effective mitigation measures for a large crowd gathering for a concert.  Some of this may come down to what mitigation measures people are willing to accept to have more social contact.  There is a balance here rather than going back to the way things were.  It is about adapting to things that will work so that we can have social and economic activity, in the main, by targeting specific areas and accepting mitigation measures that are effective but yet allow us to do most of what we want to do.</p></speech>

There are certain shopping centres - I am not going to name the company - that do not have any windows whatsoever.  How well-ventilated and safe are these places, particularly if people congregate there?</p></speech>

I did some spot checks in supermarkets using a CO2 monitor and, with a little bit of effort, most of them would be relatively safe.  Some of the concerns about people being infected in supermarkets is because the people are not going anywhere else, but that does not mean that they were not in another unsafe setting, maybe on transport or in their own home, that they did not realise was unsafe.</p> <p>  In terms of workers in supermarkets, I would have a concern that in some places people are still working behind Perspex, which is not safe, and that they are sharing break rooms and toilets where they are not aware of the dangers of spread caused by just going on a break with another staff member or going to changing rooms.  We notice very clearly a classroom or a supermarket and less so the back areas of locker rooms, staffrooms, toilets, lifts and corridors where the risk might actually be because there are pockets of dead air, somebody has passed through earlier and somebody comes through later and moves into the same space.  We need a more joined-up approach more broadly than just the supermarket.</p></speech>

The relative safety or not of those environments should be quite easily determinable because they have big mechanical ventilation systems where you can set how much fresh air those buildings get.  If they are not capable of delivering that, then that is an engineering problem but it should be a determinable risk.  I would be confident if they were inspected and those involved worked with the available advice that is out there, those buildings should be able to be made relatively safe.</p></speech>

As we know, half of the deaths that took place in the South of Ireland were in nursing homes.  How much of a factor was the lack of ventilation in residential nursing settings?  How can we remedy the situation in the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.428" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#H00800"><p>We do not have records on the air quality in any of these buildings at any given time.  All we can do is look at the patterns of spread, the speed of spread and the fact some buildings are much more highly impacted than others.  They are all clues that this virus is airborne and has lingered in the air.  I have also looked pretty closely at some of the other nursing home outbreaks in the Netherlands and especially in Canada and the same patterns are there of very rapid spread.</p> <p>  The conditions in nursing homes are quite particular and this is the reason we have had the problem.  They tend to be underventilated because people are looking to keep warm. The operators are largely private and they look to save money on energy.  Nursing homes are often in converted or subdivided buildings that maybe, when they were changed, ventilation was not considered properly or vents were blocked up.  The people who are there are more vulnerable.</p> <p>  The climate makes a considerable impact.  I did not get into it today but the spread of the initial phase of the pandemic was in very particular climate conditions across North America, Europe, Iran, Wuhan and Japan where the air temperature was between 5&deg; and 11&deg; Celsius outside with low absolute humidity.  There was a very strong pattern to that.  In those particular climate conditions, which would be typical of Ireland in heating season, if you bring that air indoors and heat it to 20&deg; for comfort, it is incredibly dry, and dry low humidity air is connected also with a higher risk of Covid in indoor air conditions.  So you have a perfect storm of overheated buildings, underventilated very dry air, people who are most susceptible and certain buildings.  Unlike in homes where people have showers and there is cooking, which puts moisture in the air, that does not happen in nursing homes.  There is a low occupancy and those activities are not happening close to patients, so you probably had people whose noses and throats dried out, and mucus is a person's first protection against this.  For a whole series of reasons it is quite explainable what happened in nursing homes.  More and more evidence shows, to my mind and certainly from speaking to people working in lots of different disciplines ranging from medicine to physics and chemistry, there is an alignment that plausibly explains why the areas were at risk and, more importantly, how we can prevent it happening again.</p></speech>

My sinuses are particularly irritated by dust and particles of all descriptions.  It is of the utmost importance to address the needs identified.  It is necessary to avail of technology in every way possible, particularly in the context of hospital wards, nursing homes, public transport, taxis and cars.  To what extent have the delegates managed to monitor the quality of available technology, whether it involves a backpack-type installation that can be carried around and placed in a room when required or is part of the building?  To what extent do these appliances do what they are supposed to do?  In other words, do they trap all particulate matter, some or 90%?  How effective is the technology?  Does it prevent the spread of viruses such as Covid?  To what extent has it been possible to test this, if such tests have been carried out?</p></speech>

The first phase involves removing the pollutant in the first instance, which requires the replacement of stale air with air that is typically from outdoors.  If that outdoor air is not safe enough, filtered outdoor air is used.  That is the first defence.  The second is when polluted air cannot be removed wholesale from a space.  In that case, recirculation through filtering of the space is the next solution.  This is where we start to talk about HEPA filters, be they portable or part of the building.  Where air is recirculated, the pollutants are passed through effective filters to deal with them.  The next phase is to deactivate the substance one is seeking to prevent from entering.  This is where we start to talk about technology such as UV lights, which can kill viruses.</p> <p>  All these technologies, in the right circumstances and appropriately used, have been able to show complete effectiveness at removing pollutants from spaces but they have to be appropriately specified.  One has to understand what one is trying to achieve with them in the given space.  A good example is HEPA filter recirculation through portable devices.  Those devices can typically remove close to 100% of viruses in a single air pass.  While they are very effective, their ability to be effective in a space depends on how much air they are capable of moving in a given period.  Therefore, they have to be appropriately sized and located in the right spots, and so it goes.  The simple answer to the Deputy's question is that these technologies are capable of dealing with almost every issue we face, be it Covid or another pollutant, in these spaces; the challenge is using them appropriately.</p></speech>

To what extent has evidence been produced?  Has it been made available to the witnesses?</p> <p>  I am aware that there is an efficacy rate of almost 100%.  To the extent that technology is of the quality required to remove 100% of viruses, it is possible not to have draughts, including for schools, without having draughts.  We all had air conditioning in the form of draughts in our houses 40 or 50 years ago but that has changed over time.  I will outline an experience I had in Europe some years ago.  When I went back to my hotel, I never looked at the air conditioning and went to bed, woke up in the middle of the night gasping for breath, presuming I was suffering from various terminal illnesses that were going to change my life, and almost panicked.  I had to look around in the dark for the switches to turn them on.  I could not believe the difference when the tension went.  It had never happened to me before.  I went back to sleep and everything was rosy and perfect.  As a result of my experience, I realise that there is a need for some kind of standard.  This could apply to aircraft also.  I see no reason in the world why it could not apply with 100% effectiveness.</p> <p>  Depending on the size of the equipment and the size of the building or dwelling in which it is used, it can work with 100% effectiveness and clean the air of viruses, which is the vital issue at this stage.  What essential examination of the devices has taken place?  What evaluation of the cost has taken place?  Could Mr Jones point us in an appropriate direction in addition to having the committee taking it upon itself to talk to the Government and set up a structure that deals with this kind of thing as a matter of urgency?

Even if a device is capable of removing 99.9% of viruses in a single air pass, its ability to be effective in a space depends on whether it is appropriately sized.  A recent study showed that four or five HEPA filters are needed in a single classroom of a particular size to deliver effective control.  The first port of call should always be fresh air, or fresh outside air.  Another point to remember is that if air is being recirculated, one may be removing particulates and viruses but one is not dealing with other pollutants.  While dealing with one problem, another can build up, such as humidity, VOCs, chemicals in the air, and other pollutants or gases.  That is why I say there is a hierarchy.  We try to deal with ventilation with a view to removing pollutants in the first place, replacing them with fresh outside air.  If that is not enough, we start to look to other technologies.  The challenge is determining when fresh outside air is not enough and there is a need to supplement it.  If organisations such as schools are to invest in HEPA filters, how do they know they are at a point at which they need to do so?  The devices are not cheap for a school.  If a school has 20 or 30 classrooms and two or three HEPA filters are needed per classroom, a big investment will be required.  How does the school know it is in a position to need those types of products?</p></speech>

I thank Ms Hegarty and Mr. Jones for attending our meeting this morning.  I have read their statements with interest.  We have had an interesting discussion, yet part of me believes it is one we should have had months ago.  We very much feel we are facing the final furlong of the Covid crisis.  Maybe the witnesses share this view.  Covid will still be here after the crisis but we feel we are in the final stage of getting people vaccinated and restoring normality to the country.  The discussion we are having today would probably have been very much worthwhile last autumn or early last winter when people were more inclined to be indoors and we were facing the peak Covid period.</p> <p>  I have several points for the witnesses.</p><p>Their statements have convinced me.  Ventilation is something I was interested in anyway.  Is some of what they are saying at odds with a policy direction that the Government has pursued in recent years, namely, retrofitting homes and building energy rating, BER, certification?  There is a rush among anyone who wants to sell a house at the moment to get to a C, a B or, better again, an A grade and there are incentives to those building homes to put in mitigating measures such as insulation etc.  One now sees very few homes with chimneys, which traditionally were the source of ventilation in Ireland before the more modern systems, as they created updrafts.  In my house, if the fire is lighting the sitting room door will slam in because of the updraft it creates.  That is not a feature in many Irish homes being built nowadays and it certainly is not a feature in apartments.  I will put that question to Mr. Jones, as it is the kind of technology he deals with.</p></speech>

Had I been asked that question maybe even five years ago I would have said that yes, many of the practices and policies were at odds with what we are discussing today but I really do not think that is the case now.  Ventilation and indoor environmental quality is very much aligned with the goals of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the plan for retrofitting our buildings.  It is a core tenet of it.  Certainly under the deep retrofit programmes carried out, there is quite extensive auditing of ventilation systems.  It was one of the first organisations to take up this independent validating of ventilation systems as part of that programme.  While it may not be perfect, it is certainly moving in the right direction and there is no reason for it to be at odds.  One of the key selling points for improving our building stock is the improvement to the indoor environment.  That is one of the core tenets of the SEAI's approach to selling retrofitting.</p></speech>

I have two questions for Ms Hegarty.  One is on HEPA filtration in aircraft.  There is a debate under way at the moment and we are at the cusp of international air travel resuming.  From everything I have read, HEPA filtration in aircraft claims to be 99.7% effective, yet there is a caveat that it depends on whether the air you are breathing in has actually gone through the filtration system.  If it is from the passenger in front or behind, it is a different story.  Does Ms Hegarty believe international air travel, with its extensive network of HEPA filtration, is safe?</p> <p>  Many pubs in Ireland have massive air filtration systems in their ceilings.  They were probably brought in before the smoking ban.  Many have become obsolete yet they are massive pieces of infrastructure bolted onto the ceilings of pubs which have not been used in many years because of the smoking ban and most places do not using them any more.  Do those systems have a function?  Might they be upgraded or repurposed when pubs reopen so that it will be safe when people are congregating and drinking indoors?  I ask because it will not always be possible for everyone to always be outside, going by what Irish weather is like.  </p></speech>

They will not be vaccinated for the autumn.  When people speak about a return to normality, one quarter of the population will not have protection and will be vulnerable for the rest of this year.  In my view, whatever money needs to be spent on schools is money well spent because it will keep the rest of society open, as well as keeping education and the economy open.  It is critically important that there be a plan for schools over the summer in order that they can operate comfortably and safely for next winter.  The discussion about population protection with vaccination rates at 80% refers to 80% of adults.  That is, at best, 60% of the population.  Regardless of the vaccination programme over the next number of months, a prevention plan in ventilation is critically needed.  Vaccination on its own will not allow things to reopen; it is mathematically not possible.  </p> <p>  On BER certificates, I completely concur with Mr. Jones on the regulations in place now.  However there is a very weak link in terms of compliance and enforcement because the sector is still left to regulate itself.  This is too important to be left to the sector.</p></speech>

Some pubs may have great systems, and let us find out where they are so we can open them.</p> <p>  On aircraft, there has been a lot of different information.  It depends on the age of the plane, the number of people in it and how good the system is.  It seems that some of the risk is when it is parked at the gate, when it is taxiing and when people are getting on through air bridges.  It appears that unsafe air conditions can arise there rather than in mid-flight.  We need more information.  In principle, were people to be wearing good quality masks on aeroplanes and were there independently verified ventilation and filtration, it would be possible to engineer a relatively safe solution if the industry was minded to do that.    </p></speech>

They were fascinating and it something I was not aware of.  I appreciate their highlighting the importance of eliminating infected air with good ventilation.</p> <p>  At this stage of the pandemic, when everyone is exhausted after lockdown and after a long, tough winter, many people seem to have lost hope.  The reopening of society and reconnection with community is incredibly important now but based on what we have heard today, it seems that we as a health committee need to start planning around the implementation of ventilation systems that will operate as we come out of the summer into the winter once again.  This information is extremely important and I totally agree about schools.  It is critical at this point.  We need to focus long and hard on how we will protect young people and children.  In her opening statement, Ms Hegarty rightly stated "Vaccines alone cannot provide enough headroom for reopening", and I fully agree with her in this regard.  </p> <p>  I have a couple of questions and I ask the witnesses to forgive me if I am repeating some of them as I lost the line earlier and could not hear some of the meeting.  To follow up on Deputy Durkan's question on the cost for schools, do the witnesses have any idea about that?  I think it needs to be made a top priority.  What would the witnesses like us, as a committee, to do to support them in the work they are doing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.444" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#K00800"><p>On cost, as a very first measure, for less than &euro;1 million every school could have one CO2 meter that could be moved around.  There are about 4,000 schools so it would be well within that cost.  That would also raise awareness as a first step and identify dead areas and hot spots.  If every classroom needed a monitor, which is probably where we need to move, it would be considerably more because there are probably tens of thousands of classrooms.  There is a balance of identifying risk and areas that need to be watched.  Even with a change of wind direction, conditions in a classroom can go from low to high risk pretty easily, so it needs active monitoring.</p><p>As for filtration, some classrooms are well designed for cross-ventilation and may be relatively low risk, but others may have smaller spaces for special needs education, childcare or early years education where people might not be wearing masks and filtration would be a better option.  The exercise would need to be done on how that money was spent.  Germany is spending a lot of money on this area, as are American schools.</p><p> We do not have as big a challenge as many other places because we have a mild climate and we naturally ventilate our buildings.  In America most of the schools are mechanically ventilated.  We have an easier problem to fix or maybe we have buildings that are more responsive to be able to deal with high-risk situations quickly.  Measuring is part of it.  I do not have an assessment of the cost for every school.  Basic information could probably go a very long way.  </p><p> Regarding supporting the work, I will speak personally because I cannot speak for the group.  It would be very beneficial if there was a forum for multidisciplinary engagement.  As things stand, the people dealing with behavioural science, the people dealing with the medical side, the people calculating the epidemiological projections and the people dealing with ventilation all work in isolation.  There is no sharing of knowledge or information that would help people to refine what they are doing to use the resources more strategically.  </p><p> The key point in all of this is that we do not need to prevent every case to stop a pandemic.  We do not need to deal with every building.  We just need to do enough to get the R-nought below 1.  Very strategic activity in places where people gather in large numbers, on public transport and in particular high-risk settings such as meat plants, could have a very substantial impact overall.  It is not a case of spending money on every building or changing everybody's home.  It is about advising people how to live more safely so that they can make strategic decisions that are safer.  It is the cumulative effort of that, along with targeted measures somewhere else.  It is just a proactive approach, using what we have and using it wisely.</p></speech>

Almost no resources, whether that is time or money, are allocated to improving ventilation and creating awareness of the impacts of ventilation on health.  This does not just apply to the pandemic.  It applies beyond the pandemic to health in general, as I pointed out in my opening statement.  Money spent improving awareness and outcomes through ventilation for this pandemic has other benefits too.  Getting this right will pay us dividends well beyond the pandemic.</p></speech>

We have many older buildings which are providing vital services.  I am on the board of a hospital that was initially built in 1741.  While it has undergone considerable adaptation, it is still an old building.  Likewise, many of our public facilities are old buildings.  If the witnesses were doing a national plan on this issue, what areas would they prioritise to get the changes that are required for filtration and air ventilation?</p> <p>  Unfortunately, many people contracted Covid in the past year in nursing homes and community hospitals.  What major changes need to be made in those facilities?  Should we set a timeline for each of those facilities to reach the required standard?  What level of investment is required to get that done?  Nursing homes are normally kept very warm and there is not a sense that fresh air is circulating in the place.  Is that an area we should now be prioritising?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.449" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021051900002#L00500"><p>I will answer the questions in reverse order.  Nursing homes, community hospitals, long-term care facilities and that kind of institutional housing, including direct provision and other similar locations, really need to be considered in the same way as schools should be for the autumn.  This is a new disease and vaccination is also new.  The duration of immunity is unknown, particularly in older populations and among people who might have a low response to vaccination.  I would definitely have a concern about nursing homes, care homes and community hospitals.  There could be a further problem in the autumn.  In the same way that schools need to be preparing now, those buildings should be considered as representing an upcoming risk in the autumn.</p> <p>  As Mr. Jones has said, there are international standards that we can plug into if they are adopted.  In particular, we cannot assume that an engineer or an architect will be available to every business and building owner.  People need to be able to pick up and read simple advice to allow them to make careful decisions, whether that is turning off a unit in a hairdressing salon or opening a back door in a shop, restaurant or wherever.  Beyond the technical advice, it is very important that practical guidance is given to people about some of this.  </p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about older buildings.  There are only 86 hospital buildings.  It is well within the resources available to look at each of those buildings and carry out an assessment of where the risk areas are.  The entire building may not have a problem; there may be pockets of risk.  In the short term, simple implementation measures could be made even within days in some cases.</p></speech>

Does major work now need to be done to those nursing homes, even though many of them are less than 20 years old?</p></speech>

However, the regulations we have are very generalised for natural ventilation.  Even design performance may not reflect the actual performance.  How they perform on paper may not be what happens in reality.  What happens this morning may be compliant, but with a change of wind direction, a very still day, somebody not opening a window or somebody blocking a vent this afternoon, it could become very non-compliant.  It is impossible to say where the problem is.</p> <p>  As we also have a system of self-certification, it is impossible to know who signed off on that building and whether they did a careful assessment, whether they gave good advice to the people who are running the building or whether a subsequent change was made without any professional input, for example, changing doors, adding partitions, doubling up on rooms or something else.</p></speech>

We do not have anything like that in the building sector.  We have a system whereby owners and developers hire people to sign off on buildings and, in the main, they are not independently verified.</p></speech>

They are well managed and covered by the likes of the Office of Public Works, OPW, the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, the HSE, the Department, and HIQA.  They all have structures above them and within them that are capable of resourcing the kind of advice and help that they need.  A colleague of ours in the UK, as part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, SAGE, coined the term this week that the success of this summer will come down to three "Vs", namely, vaccines, variants and ventilation.  That is a pertinent point at the moment, in that what will make or break us for the next two quarters will be how successful we are with vaccines, how variants impact on that and how we deal with our buildings.</p></speech>

We have started to introduce terminology within regulations around matters such as capacity, recognising that it is not okay to just meet minimum requirements for ventilation and that there needs to be some flexibility inherent within buildings.  That is very welcome.  Regulators in the UK are currently revising their ventilation regulations.  They have looked at them again in light of Covid.  We have had a commitment from building standards authorities in Ireland that, in the next revision, they will be cognisant of disease control in regulations for buildings.  The thing to be aware of when talking about regulations is that we are typically talking about flow rate, which is the amount of air moving in buildings.  There is sometimes quite a difference from what we would call background ventilation, to maintain reasonable levels of general air quality, and the volumes of air that we are looking to move to limit risks of infection.  We need to be in a space where our buildings are capable of doing both.</p></speech>

We need to look at our apartment and hotel regulations, as well as at other settings.  I have particular concern about the reduced standards for apartment sizes that were brought in about three years ago, which do not have cross-ventilation or balconies and have up to 20% less volume of air than they would have had previously.  We need to be concerned about the deregulation of standards.  It merits a review in light of the pandemic.</p></speech>

Ms Hegarty spoke about how Chicago suppressed the 1918 pandemic with targeted measures, including building inspectors who signed off on ventilation as a condition of trading, and the city reopened within six weeks.  Here we are 100 years later and we are almost starting again, going by some of the evidence that was given today.  There was some mention of the situation in Australia.  We are aware of the strict quarantines involved there.  Regarding the Irish quarantine, I am conscious that we are taking away people's liberties because of the health concerns.  Are the witnesses aware of particular criteria, especially related to ventilation, in some of the hotels selected so far?  Has that come into consideration when a hotel is assessed?  We have all stayed in hotels where, for instance, the windows did not open, so one relied primarily on the air conditioning and so on.  Are the witnesses aware of that as an issue?  Regarding the strict approach taken in Australia, the witnesses have mentioned the fire doors, and how that trapped the air within that corridor.  Do the witnesses have any recommendations for that?</p> <p>  I do not know what the witnesses' experience of most aeroplanes is, but many of them are fairly dirty, and filthy in some cases.  It is a while since I have been on a plane.  After getting off a plane, you usually have a cold or something else a couple of days later.  It is down to people sneezing or coughing on the planes and down to the ventilation systems.  The witnesses said there had to be an independent verification system.  Maybe they will expand on that.</p> <p>  The figures at the start of Ms Hegarty's opening statement state that half of the people who died were infected in 0.3% of the buildings.  Over half of workplace outbreaks have been in just 150 buildings.  One in four school buildings have been affected.  It has been mentioned that we are at the end of the road with Covid.  I do not think so if we are talking about one in four school buildings having a Covid-19 index case in the last four months.  Would the witnesses accept that we need to be much more targeted, especially in those 150 buildings?  I imagine that if I knew where those 150 buildings were, I would be a bit wary of going in and out of them.  I presume some are hospitals and nursing homes.  Do the witnesses think it would be helpful for people to be able to make those judgments?  Do they think there should be some sort of targeted intervention now, at this stage, when we are rolling out the vaccine?  I do not think this is going away any time soon and we may face another wave.  If we have buildings where there is a particular problem, should there be some sort of focus on those buildings?</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the schools.  It makes sense to have some sort of supports for those schools from the Department, especially where there is overcrowding in the classroom and for the old buildings.  Do the witnesses have recommendations for some sort of fund for schools?  They mentioned the carbon dioxide meter.  Is that a minimum that they are saying should be introduced in schools?</p></speech>

They will be able to ventilate adequately for the risk, so they will save on heating bills.  The Chairman mentioned testing in Chicago.  I recently noticed that San Francisco has posters in windows of business premises where they have had an independent inspection.  Somebody has come out and given advice.  It is not just about inspecting the building but about public confidence to go back to enter those businesses again.  They have posters in the windows to state that the building was inspected on a certain date, which system they are using, or if the door has to be open, the filter has to be on, or whatever the requirements are.  There is really good public health information.</p> <p>  Regarding the quarantine hotels, we have a lot of information from Australia and New Zealand about risk factors there, very strongly indicating that traditional hotels with rooms off long corridors with air conditioning are a bad idea for disease spread.  It is not a minor risk.  The outbreak in Victoria was purely down to a hotel breach and 800 people died as a result of that breach.  Perth recently had a five-day shutdown following a hotel quarantine breach.</p><p>They are now looking more broadly at non-city centre locations akin to low-rise buildings or even caravan parks, that type of setting, for their permanent quarantine facilities in Australia.  It also means one takes away the risk of city centre staff members living in overcrowded conditions themselves whereby outbreaks can spread or who perhaps have a second job or use public transport.  Outside city locations seem to be better, as do hotels with opening windows and not air-conditioned hotels.  It is getting away from that corridor model.  We have plenty of advice from Australia that could be adopted here from what they have learned.  Can the Chair remind me of the final point? </p></speech>

It comes down to the operation of that individual aircraft.  Is it serious enough that there needs to be independent monitoring?  I suppose that is a political decision.  Data would help in all of this.  The HSE is gathering data from every outbreak.  They know which schools, cr&egrave;ches and hospitals have had outbreaks but those data are not available.  Anything I have quoted today is from publicly available sources.  I do not have access to any more but there is a lot more available.  I think we have to start using those data, rather than having them in a filing cabinet somewhere.  That is how risk assessment could be done and how targeted interventions could be done.  They have data about cases related to travel, quarantine, hotels, schools, childcare facilities and nursing homes.  If it is a case of inspecting buildings, clearly that is an indication of where to start.</p></speech>

If there is anything else that the witnesses feel they have not had a chance to expand on this morning, we would appreciate it were they to send it in writing to the committee.  It was a useful intervention this morning.  A lot of information was provided that hopefully people will take on board in their own lives, particularly those at home.

All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus should note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement whereby they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin or both, to participate in public meetings.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to the constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard I am asking members partaking via Teams that prior to making a contribution in the meeting, they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus or the Convention Centre Dublin.  Anyone watching the meeting online should note that Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I, as Chairman, and the necessary staff for the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the committee meeting remotely, I appeal to everyone to bear with us should any technical difficulties arise.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh may now make an opening statement.  I thank him for taking time from his busy schedule to be with us.  Aviation is critical to Ireland, as he is probably well aware, being one of our own.  We are very keen, as a committee, to consider how we can achieve the reopening of the aviation sector as quickly as possible in a safe way.</p></speech>

If I may, I will make a couple of remarks.</p> <p>  Without question this is the most challenging crisis the airline industry has ever faced, and although we have confronted some in the past, nothing has been of this scale.  It is important to point out the crisis is ongoing and it would be wrong to say it is a direct result of the global pandemic.  What we face today is a crisis that arises from restrictive travel arrangements.  To be honest, in the case of Ireland I would describe it as a repressive travel policy that is preventing people from travelling.  We can say that with confidence because in markets where restrictions do not apply, we have seen demand recover generally in line with where demand was in 2019, particularly the US domestic market, where travel restrictions do not apply.  Traffic there is now back to the levels seen in 2019.  In some cases it is beginning to exceed those levels.</p> <p>  We know travel restrictions were introduced for the right reason at the right time but if these restrictions are relaxed or removed, we will see a recovery in demand that will enable airlines to work their way out of this crisis.  What we believe is necessary, particularly in the case of Ireland, is that the EU must align policies.  We would like to see the EU traffic light system reintroduced and applied consistently across the Union.  As a proud Irishman and citizen of Europe, I am disappointed with the way the EU has managed through this crisis, with many different regimes being adopted by governments, which is causing great confusion in the minds of customers and major problems for airline operations.  We would also like to see that where people have been vaccinated, travel restrictions would be fully removed.</p> <p>  In addition, the quarantine arrangements put in place in Ireland are particularly repressive and they should be removed and replaced, if necessary, by a risk-based testing system.  I was particularly interested in listening to the contribution of Professor Mark Ferguson, who has appeared before this committee, and to read comments from one of the co-authors of the Ferguson report, Professor Paddy Mallon, on testing.  There is a case to be made for the use of best-in-class rapid antigen testing in lieu of expensive and difficult PCR requirements.</p> <p>  We also would like to encourage the Irish Government to urgently consider the opening of a travel corridor with the United States.  This is of particular importance to the Irish economy and tourism industry in Ireland.  There is good reason to be optimistic that this could be possible.</p> <p>  Last but not least, in anticipation of a recovery in passenger numbers, it is critical that our border agencies are ready for such an increase.  Airports will not be able to function properly if people arriving in the country or having to depart have to present bits of paper to officials to prove they meet requirements.  There must be a digital solution in order that we can continue to process people who have the right qualifications and authorisations to enter the country without creating massive queues at the border.  On that note, I will pause and allow the committee to challenge me or ask any questions.</p></speech>

We want to probe or drill down into what must be put in place to deal with the matters he raised, particularly as they relate to the common travel area with the UK and antigen testing.  The reopening of the transatlantic routes to the US is also critical to us.</p></speech>

The Oireachtas transport committee has had many deliberations trying to get international air travel back up and running and has produced a report on it.  Mr. Walsh referred to Professor Ferguson's report on antigen testing, something for which this committee strongly advocates.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Walsh give us an overview on the current air travel restrictions imposed around Europe?  How does Ireland measure up in terms of other jurisdictions?  Travel to America is currently prohibited.  America will not let us in.  Obviously, one needs a co-ordinated approach to this and the digital green certificate offers that potential.  Work needs to be done on this, however.  I agree with the need to open an air corridor between Europe and the US in tandem with the creation of the digital green certificate.  Will Mr. Walsh give us an overview of what is happening with regard to air travel restrictions across Europe?</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh is aware of the recent announcement by Aer Lingus, a company with which he is familiar, that it will close its cabin crew base in Shannon.  Given his background and his standing in aviation, it is clear Aer Lingus is in a difficult financial position.  It has received funding from the State with an Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, loan of &euro;150 million but I understand it is losing approximately &euro;1 million a day.  There is a need for a more substantial cash injection to be made to the airline to keep it afloat.</p> <p>  I am advocating that any cash injection deal from the Government to Aer Lingus should come with a proviso that the strategic routes which operate out of Shannon, namely, Heathrow, New York and Boston, are protected.  When Aer Lingus was sold to International Airlines Group, IAG, there was a commitment, signed into the articles of association, that the Shannon-Heathrow slots would be protected for seven years.  That will expire in September 2022.  Would it be justified to seek a further extension, say a ten-year period, of the slots in any deal that would be done with Aer Lingus?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.473" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#B00200"><p>I agree with the Deputy on the digital green certificate.  That would be a step forward.  At IATA, we have argued that there should be a common standard in order that airlines and governments can fully satisfy themselves that people travelling meet the criteria and where somebody has been vaccinated that they can provide evidence of it.  Regardless of what we might think as to whether vaccination should be a requirement for travel, some countries will make it a condition of entry.  We have already heard a number of countries say that it will likely be the case.  Having a robust and verifiable system that can be checked and satisfied is important.</p> <p>  On EU restrictions, I have described the arrangements in Ireland to be repressive.  I have heard people almost cheer the fact that Ireland has the most restrictive arrangements as if it is something good.  I do not see it that way.  This is particularly dangerous for a country like Ireland where the message being sent out is that we do not want people travelling to the country.  For a country that has always been open, as well as dependent on emigration and foreign investment, such a message sent out around the world is particularly worrying.</p> <p>  Other EU countries do not have similar restrictions.  I am living in Switzerland - I accept it is not an EU country - but I have travelled into Spain without any restriction.  One must provide an antigen test before one can travel into Spain.  Coming back into Switzerland, one needs to have a PCR test.  To travel to the UK, where more restrictive arrangements are in place, a PCR test is required or an antigen test and one can self-isolate.  There is not a common standard.  Some countries require PCR testing to be taken within 24 hours of travel, others, 48 hours, and others, 72 hours.  One would think that the EU should be able to align on a simple issue like that.  If it is okay for some countries to accept a test taken within 72 hours, why is it not acceptable for all?  Some require it to be taken by everybody including newborn children.  Others, like Ireland, require the test for children above the age of six.  In some cases, it is for people above the age of 18.  A common standard is not being applied across the EU.  Some countries are more open than others.  In the main, some element of restriction is in place.</p> <p>  It is regrettable that Aer Lingus has had to take the decisions it has.  It must be remembered Aer Lingus is not vying on the transatlantic routes.  The transatlantic operation from Shannon is particularly seasonal.  It has always been heavily dependent on US inbound traffic, particularly so during the summer season.  This summer season is wiped out, the second summer in a row in which Aer Lingus will not be able to bring people from the US into Ireland.  While Irish citizens are restricted in terms of entry into the US under law, there is no restriction on US citizens travelling out of the US or back into the US.</p> <p>  It is deeply regrettable that Aer Lingus had to take this decision but I do not see any way of avoiding it.  It is in a deep financial crisis.  While the Deputy is correct that it had access to an ISIF loan, that has to be repaid.  The damage done to airlines through this crisis is huge with the additional debt burden that has been taken on.  Those debts have to be repaid and this will impose significant restrictions on how airlines operate.  It will be particularly true in terms of the appetite they have for financial risk, which will seriously restrict the level of capacity that comes back into the market once travel restrictions are removed.  I have no inside knowledge of how Aer Lingus is thinking but I do not see how it would be possible for Aer Lingus to recreate the transatlantic network that it operated in 2019 once things get going.  It is going to take many years to see the transatlantic network built up again.</p> <p>  On the Shannon slots, I always said people did not have anything to fear.  I do not have any inside knowledge as to how things are operating now but when I was at Aer Lingus and IAG, those routes were operated on a profitable basis.  People should have nothing to fear.  If the demand is there, I guarantee Aer Lingus will want to serve it.  It always has and I believe it always will.  People should not be concerned about the continuity of that service, provided the Government removes restrictions.  If travel restrictions continue, then it is inevitable that these routes cannot be operated.</p></speech>

His opening statement is quite comprehensive.</p> <p>  I will start with employment support, which is the big issue.  We all accept that for an island like this connectivity is paramount.  We are told throughout this period that it is all about maintaining capacity, particularly in aviation.  When we get to the tail end of this, it is important we are able to maintain that connectivity and, within that, to provide protection for workers and their families.</p><p>In the Irish sense we can speak about a continuation of the existing supports and even beyond that.  I would be grateful for any detail on that.</p><p> Much of this work is about what we can put in place in the current set-up for reopening travel.  Mr. Walsh mentioned a resumption of the EU traffic light system and eventually removing all quarantine requirements.  As he mentioned, the committee did some work with Professor Mark Ferguson, particularly around antigen testing.  He spoke about some of the pilots operating in Britain, specifically, where people flying in would perform serial testing on themselves over ten days or a specific period.  We have called for pilots to use such a process in this period so we would at least have that heavy lifting done.  We have contacted the Government, and particularly the Minister for Transport, about this happening.</p><p> We heard from England's chief medical officer about the possibility of the Indian variant overtaking the Kent variant and we hope this will not affect vaccinations and the protection of people but it is a worry.  We must take that into account.  We should remember on some level that it is Covid-19 that has done this to us.  Mr. Walsh might agree that we must consider the likes of the digital green certificate and rapid antigen tests in order to give us choice.</p><p> I am interested in the idea of the American corridor.  I accept the importance of our relationship with America but has there been any communication about this on the other end?  At present, they obviously have restrictions on us flying there now.  I get that with the passing of weeks, a significant number of people will be vaccinated, allowing more freedom on what can be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.476" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#C00200"><p>I thank the Deputy and agree with him.  Employment support has been critical and I acknowledge that if not for the employment support provided by governments, not just in Ireland but in other countries, the scale of unemployment in the airline industry would be massive.  We were hoping to keep people in employment and with critical skills in place to enable the industry to restart quickly.  As this period of restriction has extended well beyond what anybody expected, and the damage done to the industry is significantly greater than anybody expected, the ability of the industry to recover to the 2019 levels of capacity quickly has reduced to the point where that is impossible.  It will take several years.</p> <p>  We have seen many aircraft retired so they are not available.  Unfortunately, many critical staff have been made redundant and many more would have been made redundant if not for the employment support schemes.  We must very thankful and recognise the supports that governments have provided.  That enables airlines to get moving again, although not at the same scale I would have hoped for if we had this conversation six months ago.  I remain optimistic we will be able to see a recovery in the second half of this year, and this is principally based on the accelerated roll-out of the vaccine and the scientific evidence that the vaccine is having a significant impact on the levels of transmission.  Those levels of transmission are definitely dampening as a result of vaccination.</p> <p>  On the question of serial antigen testing, I listened with great interest to Professor Mark Ferguson when he appeared before the committee.  I am not sure I support the view that people need to be tested every day but a risk-based approach to testing is a very sensible suggestion.  I read the recommendation of the committee on that and it would be great to see the Government act on that recommendation.</p> <p>  I do not have as much data about Ireland because they are not readily available but the UK is providing much data in this regard.  My latest data relate to the period between 25 March and 5 May, when just over 150,000 people travelled to the UK and either had to go into hotel quarantine, similar to Ireland, or self-isolate.  Of those 150,000 people, all of whom were required to do a PCR test on or before their second day from arrival in the UK, 3,749 demonstrated a positive indication.  That is 2.5%.  Interestingly, if we remove people who travelled from India and Pakistan, who accounted for 20% of the people travelling and over 50% of the people who tested positive, the positivity rate was 1.5%.  To put this in a more positive way, 98.5% of people were perfectly fine, had no virus and were not contagious but suffered restrictions as a result of this process.  The figures I have for Ireland comprise a much smaller sample and I am not sure they are up to date.  The figures indicated approximately 3% of people who had gone into hotel quarantine subsequently tested positive, meaning 97% of people who were forced to pay over &euro;1,800 for the pleasure of being locked in a hotel for two weeks were fine.</p> <p>  If we assess these measures, we must consider the risk.  We cannot have a zero-risk approach because it is unachievable.  If people accept a reasonable level of risk, it can be done without the measures that have been put in place.  The quality of testing has significantly improved.  I do not know how many PCR tests members have done but I have done ten in the past two months associated with the travel I have been doing.  I have also done several antigen tests and, fortunately, I have tested negative every time.  Nobody wants to have to go through that just for the privilege of exercising their freedom of movement, which is a fundamental principle of the EU.  That is really what has upset me most.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy's assessment and the committee's recommendation on replacing forced quarantine with a sensible system of serial testing, including on a daily basis.  I am sure people would not mind that as an alternative to hotel quarantine.  It could happen every second day.  It would be a very sensible risk-based approach to the problem we face.</p></speech>

At the outset I mention the devastating news received yesterday that Aer Lingus, an airline with a constant presence in Shannon since 1958, is to permanently close its base there.  That is absolutely devastating for the 130 employees based in Shannon, the region and aviation in general.  There is much work to be done and we will go down fighting.  I know the Taoiseach is to meet airline representatives tomorrow and the airline is seeking support from the Government.  That must be conditional and there is no blank cheque territory for funds, whether in the form of grants or repayable loans via ISIF.  There must be some conditionality built in and this must involve commitments to routes from Shannon and the base there.</p><p>There are a number of things I want to say about yesterday's announcement.  One must look at the chronology, because the Cabinet was due to meet yesterday to consider two things, one of which was the scaling back of mandatory hotel quarantine, which cannot happen soon enough.  It had a purpose in early January when we had 8,000 or so cases of Covid-19 per day but it does not have a purpose now.  The Cabinet was also to consider the digital green certificate and a pathway forward to a resumption of international air travel.  These were the matters on the Cabinet agenda yesterday.  That is the day that Aer Lingus chose to make this announcement.  The company has availed of salary support in the form of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, for the past 14 months and practically all of the Aer Lingus wage bill has been paid for by the Government.  While the Government may not own the airline and that day is gone, it has skin in the game and it needs to call that in as well.</p><p> The digital green certificate will be before Cabinet again next week, as we are getting to the final ratification stage.  It has to be stated repeatedly that this has to be ratified by 27 member states.  This is an EU-wide protocol and set of regulations and it is not the case of Ireland being a laggard in this regard.  There is a political run-in period here of six weeks or so, from the time of ratification across the EU to its implementation.  Can Mr. Walsh inform us if that six-week political lead-in aligns itself with the lead-in period that IATA and all of the airlines it represents need in having hours for pilots, cabin crews back and certified and marketing plans up in place?  It seems to me that on Tuesday, when the Cabinet meets and the ratification process starts in Ireland, the logical thing for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan to say is that the sector is in the starting blocks and that this is its six-week lead-in period.  He should state it is also the lead-in period politically and that we should now get it all aligned.  Can Mr. Walsh tell us if that aligns itself perfectly for his industry?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.485" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#D00200"><p>That is a good comment, provided that there is certainty after the six-week lead-in period that things will start again.  What will kill the industry completely is if we have this reopening and closing of borders again.  The damage that is being done is very significant.  The real challenge that airlines face, and this is particularly true of Aer Lingus, is that the significant cash burn it faces will actually increase as the airline starts to get back up and running again.  One has a combination of costs that it is not currently incurring such as fuel, airport and <i>en route</i>charges that will now become payable at the same time as the airline is waiting for the revenue stream from bookings to come into place.  For many airlines, the most challenging period is not what we have come through but it is what we are facing.  Part of that will be the risk associated with getting going too fast.<br/><br/>I am aware that the Deputy did not ask me a question about the financial support for Aer Lingus but please allow me to comment on that.  Any company taking out a loan will have to assess the conditions associated with that loan, not just the financial conditions but all of the other red tape, and then satisfy itself that it makes sense.  One can put all of the conditions that one likes but that does not mean that the loan will be accepted nor does it mean that one has a strong card to play.  What one has to do, and I am sure this is what the management team at Aer Lingus is looking at, is to provide certainty that if Aer Lingus starts operating on the transatlantic routes again, it will be able to continue to do so because the costs associated with ramping up a transatlantic operation are massive.  It is in that period that the greatest risk is being taken.  If I was looking at additional debt being taken on by the airline I would be very careful about the conditions associated with that because the balance sheet has been significantly stressed and the debt that has been taken on has to be repaid.  For that debt to be repaid, the airline will have to be profitable.  One cannot impose non-commercial restrictive covenants on an airline and hope that it will be in a position to repay the debt.<br/><br/>One needs to be very careful.  I do not see how Aer Lingus can sensibly guarantee the operation of a Shannon transatlantic base, given that the summer season has, yet again, been effectively lost, with the very significant seasonality associated with the transatlantic operation into Shannon.  I agree with the Deputy that it is very sad to see it and it is terrible for everybody involved.  These decisions are not taken lightly by airline management.  Many of these decisions have been forced upon them because of the financial crisis that they face at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.486" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#D00300"><p>I thank Mr. Walsh for his comments.  If the Chairman will allow me to extend my comment, the 130 employees based out of Shannon have had their salaries largely paid by the Government, which is the point I wish to make.  The taxpayer has more or less paid the wage bill for the Shannon employees.  On that basis, the Government should have some say if it is paying the wage bill.  There should be some conditionality built into it in order that those employees would at least be strategically located in the Shannon base.</p> <p>  I absolutely get the point here but there is no deflecting blame here because mandatory hotel quarantine had a purpose during the time of peak Covid-19 infection rates of 8,000 cases a day.  This has now been tapered back to 300 or so cases a day and it does not now have a purpose.  Mandatory hotel quarantine, however, has been a catalyst to where we are at today but Aer Lingus senior management also seized an opportunity presented to it by a crisis to withdraw from Shannon.  I just think that the timing of it was chronic.  It was the day on which this issue was to come before Cabinet.  It is on the eve of things reopening.  It will be five or six weeks before planes are back in the sky, so that is also something of a factor.  There are certain actions the Government will take, which are already happening.  The Taoiseach is to meet the relevant parties tomorrow but there needs to be a certain amount of playing hardball with Aer Lingus here as well, because it has done well out of the Government and its wage bill has been fully paid by it.  </p> <p>  It also has shown little loyalty to its staff based in Shannon because the carrot hanging over the staff there since yesterday is that they may be transferred, possibly, to Dublin.  That will not happen because when the company looked at temporary lay-offs within its workforce, the company held on to some staff members who had only come in the door ten or 11 weeks before the onset of Covid-19 pandemic but laid off staff members who had been in Shannon for 30 or 35 years.  They showed loyalty on each occasion to Dublin and Cork over Shannon and this needs to be stated.  We are supportive of Aer Lingus and I will do everything as a Deputy in County Clare and in my position as my party&rsquo;s aviation spokesperson.  We will work on this night and day but we also need to call out some of these truths.</p></speech>

I will move on with Mr. Walsh in my own slot, in which I wish to ask a number of questions.  First, has he met the Government to give his overview on aviation, which is a sector that is such a pinnacle of importance for our economy and if so, at what level has this happened?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.488" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#D00500"><p>Personally, I have not.  This is the first opportunity I have had to discuss these matters as I have only been in position in IATA for the past six weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#D00600"><p>It would be very important that he meets the Government and it is something on which we would work with him.</p> <p>  Second, Mr. Walsh spoke about Ireland having the most oppressive travel policy anywhere in the world.  Can he elaborate on that point?  In that context, the Government is about to announce a reopening time for aviation.  What are the benchmarks that he would like to see?  He spoke about certainty.  I am a Deputy representing Limerick City and Shannon Airport is of great importance to us but there is also a question here if the aviation sector can reopen.  I would like to see goodwill to Shannon to resume both the Heathrow and transatlantic services with the cabin crew in Shannon but until such time as aviation is up and running, it is more difficult to have those discussions.</p> <p>  Taking into account the resumption of the common travel area with ourselves and the UK, Mr. Walsh also spoke about the US, about the digital green certificate and vaccination.  When does he anticipate that Joe Biden as President of America, his Administration and officials, will allow people to fly to the US from Europe without the restrictions?  We are at a point now where the digital green certificate is coming in at the end of June and we are looking at a six-week lead-in period.  Can Mr. Walsh then map out what is the latest time that aviation needs to get the green light in order that it can actually survive?</p><p>I know I am drilling down but I think we need to get into detail.  Could Mr. Walsh map out why he regards Ireland as an outlier?  What does he want to see in the Government's reopening plan that is realistic because at the end of the day, there are public health issues here?  How does he see it operating with the members of IATA in terms of public health, flying in and out of the UK and transatlantic destinations, the timeframe involved, linking in with the digital green certificate and other measures like PCR and rapid antigen testing?  </p></speech>

Regarding the US, if I look at the data the UK has provided, in that six-week period about which I spoke, the positivity rate and the number of people travelling to the UK from the US was 0.7%.  A total of 34 people tested positive for coronavirus.  A total of 99% plus did not have the virus, yet you are locking them up in hotels here.  That is repressive.  A total of 32 people travelling from France to the UK tested positive, yet they are being locked up in hotels in Ireland.  Nobody travelling to the UK from Belgium tested positive, yet people travelling from Belgium to Ireland are being locked up.  Nobody tested positive from Luxembourg.  They are just four countries in respect of which I can give the committee an example of hard data.  For some reason, the Irish Government has decided that these people represent a significant risk to Ireland.  I disagree strongly.  I am not being paid by Aer Lingus.  I have not been paid by it or indeed IAG for some time but I reject the statements made about Aer Lingus.  It would be able to defend itself but-----</p></speech>

It is not being opportunistic.  It is desperate in respect of the measures it is taking, as are airlines across the world, which are faced with very tough decisions.  I have been in tough positions before.  These are not easy decisions to take.  People do not take them lightly.  They are looking at the future survival of the airline and must make decisions that can at best guarantee that they can do that.</p> <p>  The Chairman raised a very important issue in respect of the US.  The most critical issue for Ireland is getting people from the US travelling to Ireland.  I know it would be great to see Irish people travelling to the US.  The US has made clear that it will allow its citizens to travel internationally and return to the US without restriction if they have been vaccinated.  We could approve that tomorrow but Ireland is saying that if someone is vaccinated and travels to Ireland from the US, he or she will have to pay over &euro;1,800 and we will lock him or her up in a hotel for 12 days, escort him or her there courtesy of the Irish Government and make sure he or she does not leave.  That is repressive.  </p></speech>

The level of vaccination in the US is very high.  Why do you want to lock up people who have been fully vaccinated when the scientific evidence shows that vaccination does suppress the transmission of the virus?</p></speech>

Growing up, I would have seen his rise.  I think he was in Futura before he came back to Aer Lingus and on to British Airways and IAG and here he is in IATA.  It is great to see another Irish person doing so well in the international aviation industry despite its challenges.</p> <p>  A lot of people will be talking about Shannon for very obvious reasons.  The decision that had to be taken is very regrettable and I understand the angst in the region.  Shannon is so important to that region.  </p> <p>  Mr. Walsh has given us his opening statement.  Were he the Minister for Transport of the Head of Government, what are the three or four things he would do in the next week or ten days to get the aviation industry back up and running?  We sometimes forget that people in Europe can jump on trains and get from country to country without going to an airport but we cannot.  We have a population of less than five million people and in normal times, 33 million people go through Dublin Airport, which is more than six times the State's population.  I do not think we would find too many other countries with those ratios.</p><p>Mr. Walsh has outlined some of what needs to be done in his statement but will he indicate the three, four or five things he would say, as an aviation expert, Ireland needs to do to ensure we have connectivity in the long run?  I am talking about what is needed from a foreign direct investment perspective, a tourism inwards perspective and, equally, a population perspective.  Irish people like to travel and visit other countries and there is a huge Irish diaspora across the world.  Those people want to visit here and people in Ireland want them to come here.  What does Mr. Walsh want us to do, week by week for the next three to four weeks, to get aviation back up to somewhere approaching what it was before?  How long does he think it will take to get back to the 2019 figures?  Will it be in the next five to ten years or does he not see us ever getting back there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.522" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#F00200"><p>That is a great question.  We are likely to get back to the 2019 figures by 2024 at the earliest.  More likely, it will take five years from now, which would be 2026, given where we are.</p> <p>  I have already outlined some of the things I would like to see happening.  There has to be a signal that mandatory hotel quarantining is finished.  It should only be required, if it is required at all, in extreme circumstances.  It cannot be that it becomes the norm, which it has, in effect, become.  Ireland must align with the rest of Europe in terms of having a sensible traffic light system.  Ireland should use its position of influence within Europe to try to get a common position adopted across the EU.  Particularly in a post-Brexit environment, it is disappointing to see the EU fragmented in the way it is.</p> <p>  Ireland needs to look at a testing regime that is risk-based.  It should take on board the recommendation this committee has made in regard to antigen testing as opposed to expensive PCR testing.  The Government has got to make sure, in anticipation of getting things moving again, that people will have a smooth passage into and out of the airports.  That will require technology and the adoption of some form of digital system to allow people to move through airports in an efficient manner.</p> <p>  We have got to change the attitude in Ireland where travel is seen as an evil.  I do not understand that, given how critical travel has been to the growth of the Irish economy.  It has enabled people both on the island and outside it to do business in a way that would not otherwise have been possible.  We have been massively successful in attracting business into Ireland but that requires access to the island.  I really worry about whether the businesses that have relocated here are going to look at other parts of the world.  I am doing that at IATA because there are some countries in which we have offices where the authorities are making it very difficult for us to work.  We are already looking at whether we can relocate those offices to a more business-friendly environment.  Ireland needs to move fast on this.  I can understand the political risk associated with making decisions like these.  I come from an airline background where we have to manage risk on a daily basis.  It is in our DNA and we do it well.  We understand how to manage risk.  It is going to be important for Ireland to make change and make it quickly.  The damage that is being done is significant and it is increasing every day.</p></speech>

From both their perspectives and the perspective of the Dublin Airport Authority in terms of connectivity and inbound tourism, it is very important that we have tourists bringing their dollars, euro or whatever into the country.  As Mr. Walsh mentioned, it is sad to see those graveyards in Spain and France and in the desert, with thousands of large aircraft parked that will probably not fly again.  Does Mr. Walsh agree that it is likely airlines will be smaller than they were for a long time to come and will have to choose where they fly to and why, based on their available resources?  What do we need to do as a country to ensure we get back the fabulous connectivity we previously enjoyed sooner rather than later?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.524" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#F00400"><p>The Senator has hit the nail on the head.  Airlines will be smaller and, therefore, they will have to look at where they assign the assets they have, which are fewer than they used to be.  Ireland today would be very low on the list given everything I have said in terms of the restrictions.  These decisions are being taken now.  There are airlines that are looking at countries and markets that are beginning to open.  We have seen what has happened in the UK with Portugal going on the green list and the emerging capacity that has gone into that country.  UK airlines are not going to take that capacity out of Portugal and put it into Ireland.  It is going to stay in Portugal and the next country that opens up is going to get some capacity.  That is what is going to happen.</p> <p>  If Ireland is at the end of the queue, there will be very little capacity for it.  That means inbound tourism is going to be significantly choked and outbound connectivity is going to be significantly inhibited.  That is why I say it is urgent that the Government moves on this and does so quickly.  I can guarantee that if the UK adds another three countries to its green list tomorrow, airlines that have capacity will put their aircraft into those markets.  They are aircraft that could potentially have gone into Ireland.  The sooner we do it the better.  We are lagging significantly behind the UK and we are lagging behind several other countries in Europe that have already come out and stated that they will allow people with a vaccination to travel in and out without restriction, or they will remove quarantine for people who can show evidence of a negative test.  We have to get back in line with other countries.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh is representing IATA, which includes as members his former employers IAG and Aer Lingus and also Ryanair, the great enemy of Aer Lingus over the years.  Ryanair has relocated aircraft out of Ireland and Aer Lingus is relocating aircraft to Manchester.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Walsh comment on how devastating it will be for us in the long term if we do not take action soon on this?</p></speech>

These are aircraft that were operating in the Irish market but will now operate in the UK market.  Every day that passes, more aircraft are likely to be assigned to the UK or elsewhere, particularly in the case of Ryanair, which has incredible flexibility to relocate its aircraft right across Europe.  That is the risk.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#F00900"><p>I thank Mr. Walsh for addressing the committee today.  He has a unique perspective on the aviation industry given his history with our flag carrier, with IAG and in his current role.  I totally agree with his points on believing the science.  We have a vaccination roll-out that is working and in which people have confidence.  We have PCR testing that has been the gold standard for more than a year, since the start of the pandemic.  We had the report by Professor Ferguson, the findings of which in terms of antigen testing and what needs to be done in that regard were discussed and endorsed by this committee.  We have more than a year of global learning on personal behaviour and how to live with this virus.  That needs to be taken on board.  What Ireland went through last December, January and February was unique to Europe at the time and decisions were made during that period that were quite restrictive.  Given where we are with the science, we now need a roadmap out of those restrictions.  On mandatory hotel quarantine, for example, we need a roadmap to wind it down to be a measure of last resort.  We have the science, vaccinations and testing capacity in place to make that happen and it needs to be done.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for Mr. Walsh.  In regard to testing, this committee - as well as the Covid committee, of which I was also a member - has done a huge amount of work on trying to promote a testing regime within our airports and the aviation industry.  We were always met with a rebuff from the Government on that.</p><p>Can Mr. Walsh comment on his view of the calls for airport and aviation testing and those kinds of options that he sought over the past year and the impact of that?</p><p> Second, could the Government here have done more to protect jobs in Aer Lingus in terms of the supports that were given?  Conditionality in respect of job protection was specified in, for example, Germany, Spain and France, in return for state supports.  I am asking that question in the context of how Aer Lingus operates within the IAG family of airlines.  I am not saying that it is a simple thing but could more have been done to protect the jobs that have been lost in the context of supports that were given, such as a loan of &euro;150 million given from ISIF, to Aer Lingus?  </p><p> Finally, on the digital green certificate which is something we all want to see work well, does Mr. Walsh have any concerns as to the European capacity for an effective ICT regime to ensure this works well from the outset?  This is all about having confidence in this certificate from early on because we all want to support it and get it off the ground.  I would appreciate Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s comments and answers on those issues and I thank him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-19a.531" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021051900002#G00200"><p>Testing has progressed significantly.  I go back 12 months when we started doing the PCR tests and antigen tests had not been developed to a standard which was considered acceptable.  The advances that have been made both in the quality and speed of the testing and the assurance that people can get from testing has been really significant.  One has to admire the science associated both with the vaccine and the testing.  A standard that we believed was acceptable or necessary 12 months ago should not be necessary today because there have been so many developments both in the vaccination and the quality of treatment that we can give in our hospitals.</p> <p>  The fears that we had 12 months ago that the health systems would be overrun, and I am aware that it came close at times, have significantly abated.  I also note that the most vulnerable in most countries have been vaccinated at this stage.  The quality or quantity of risk, whichever way one wants to talk about it, has changed. The mitigation action therefore that one should put in place to address that has changed because one wants to end up with the same residual level of risk and we can do that with a cheaper, more efficient and more comfortable type of test than the PCR one.  </p> <p>  I am aware that the scientists disagree on this and it is great to see that they cannot all agree.  I have seen some thinking to the effect that a rapid antigen test should not be used at all and others who say it is clearly an effective way of testing people, particularly testing someone who is positive, where it does not necessarily guarantee if one has a negative result that one is negative.  It pretty much does guarantee, however, if one has a positive result that one is positive.  Testing has progressed.</p> <p>  The Deputy has asked a great question as to whether more could have been done to protect jobs.  It is always easy to look back and say that we could have done more or done better.  I cannot be too critical and I have to say that I am a great admirer of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who has done a fantastic job. He has responded as best he could in the circumstances and has a very challenging position going forward.  The loan from ISIF is a commercial loan made on commercial terms.  It is great to have ISIF there and as members may be aware, I was for a number of years chairman of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which included responsibility for ISIF.  I understand how it operates and the steps that Aer Lingus would have had to have taken to satisfy ISIF that this was a loan that was worth making and would be repaid.  To be honest, the thing that would have protected jobs more than anything would have been to get international travel going again.  I know that that is a simple answer for me to give but it really is.  Jobs can best be protected by the operation of the airlines.  The sooner that we get the airlines operating, particularly during what is traditionally the peak summer period, the better.  If we miss this summer period then the situation becomes much more grave because then we are going into what is traditionally a low-demand winter period, which will be particularly dangerous for a number of airlines.  </p> <p>  I welcome the supports that governments across the world have given.  Most of that support has been in the form of debt.  That is why if one looks at the industry, we in IATA estimate the debt burden on it to be $650 billion, which is $220 billion of additional debt through this period.  That is increasing by the day.  It is also worth pointing out that most of the financing that airlines have accessed has come from the debt and equity markets.  Shareholders have put in their fair stake and the commercial debt market has been accessed.  What governments have been providing is a small fraction of what the industry has had to access but it is very welcome and if it had not been made available, a number of airlines would have been in severe trouble.</p></speech>

We do not.  We are developing in IATA what we call the IATA travel pass.  We are doing this basically for the industry but much of the work that we are doing can be done on behalf of governments as well.  It requires a central database and it does not have to be a digital green pass.  In Ireland there is a database available for people who have been vaccinated and there is one in the UK.  It would be great to have one across the EU.  In most cases, we can access data that are reliable.  We have an app developed that can be used.  So far we have got approximately 110 airlines signed up to use it.  We are in discussions with a number of governments already, eight or nine of which have said that they will be using it.  We are in discussions with 30 other governments that are interested in using it as a system to enable people to demonstrate that they have met the requirements.  It is possible, if not by relying on governments, but through the public and private sector working together, for an ICT solution to be provided.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh is a person with much experience in running an airline.  Can he tell me what practical import there is from the closure of a base?  Obviously, it does not mean that Aer Lingus will no longer fly in and out of Shannon Airport but it has implications, in particular, for early morning and late evening flights.  Can Mr Walsh provide a little explanation on that point to the committee, please?</p></speech>

One has to crew the base from outside, which would typically mean that the aircraft and crew are starting from another base, which means the first departure depends on the first arrival.  Typically, that means that the first departure will be later than if one had people based in the airport.  It has implications in the timing of the schedule that is operated.  I do not have any inside knowledge as to what Aer Lingus is thinking about but I imagine and expect that it will continue to operate out of Shannon.  The shape of the schedule, however, and the level of activity will be very different to what has been known at Shannon.</p></speech>

One can provide them but normally it means that one is overnighting crews in hotels rather than having them based there.  In many cases, that is what airlines do when there is insufficient activity at the base to justify having people based there.  Aer Lingus has early morning departures, or they certainly did have such departures from a number of European cities but the crew members are not based there.  They operate a late flight in from Ireland and an early departure but they stay in a hotel.  It is not impossible to do it.  I would not say that business people will lose out but it does impact on the schedule because it makes it more complex than if one has people and aircraft based there.</p></speech>

He did not do any better.  In fact, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, got more guarantees than Mr. O'Leary did, but Deputy McNamara is right.  In fact, he might remember that the slots Aer Lingus had when IAG required them did not include an early-morning departure out of Shannon.  This was changed because clearly IAG has access to a lot of slots at Heathrow and was able to shuffle its slot portfolio to give a better departure time from Shannon into London, an early-morning departure which, from memory, proved to be particularly attractive and made a big difference to the profitability of the route.  That remains the case with Aer Lingus as part of AIG.  It has access to the slot pool that AIG holds through British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus at Heathrow and it can play around with them to make the most efficient use of the slots.  Therefore, I do not think there is a particular risk.  If business recovers - and I think it will - I am pretty sure there will be a Heathrow slot out of Shannon because, certainly from my experience, that was a very successful way of operating out of Shannon.</p></speech>

One expects it will not be business as usual straight away and that airports will consolidate around key hubs.  For Aer Lingus that is Dublin and, perhaps, increasingly Manchester rather than Shannon and Cork.  Obviously, Ireland is not a Schengen state.  Schengen states will pretty soon allow in American passengers who are vaccinated and can show they are vaccinated.  However, am I right in saying there is nothing to stop Ireland doing that tomorrow morning for persons who are vaccinated?  A number of EU member states are allowing in passengers who are either vaccinated or can demonstrate they have immunity through having contracted and recovered from Covid.  Greece, for example, and I think most other southern EU states are essentially allowing flights as of now.  There is nothing to stop us.  It is merely that we are hostage to the zero Covid fanatics in Ireland.</p></speech>

In fact, the common travel area would not inhibit it either because I suspect the UK and the US will reach agreement on arrangements there that will allow vaccinated people to travel as well, given the level of vaccination in both countries.  No, I do not see anything that would stop the Irish Government moving immediately on this issue.</p></speech>

Most of the risks he has taken have paid off, but one cannot live in a zero-risk world.  It is simply impossible.  Mr. Walsh is also an Irishman so he understands Ireland and Irish politics.  That is clear from the multiple references he has made and the fact that he was chairman of a State board.  How does he account for the way in which Ireland became captured by the zero Covid crew in a way that no other European country did and that we became so understandably frightened of Covid but completely risk-averse such that we were frightened of Covid to the exclusion of almost anything else?  It seemed almost impossible to have any other consideration in Ireland for a number of months.</p></speech>

I cannot figure it out.  It has been one of the things that has surprised me most about this.  I thought Ireland would be quite the opposite, given that as a country we have always been so open to travel and given the number of Irish people who have had to move abroad for work, me included.  I have not been able to go back to Ireland.  I have not been in Ireland since February of last year.  I used to travel into and out of Ireland regularly.  I do not understand it.  It is something we have to address.  I think everybody understands that we had to take measures to protect people early on - I do not think anybody would disagree with that - but, given that we have seen things change, we have to move forward and recognise that as advances are made we should start removing the restrictions that are in place.  I do not see what the fear is about allowing people who are vaccinated enter the country.  There is very little risk associated with that, and the data show that.  The number of people who have tested positive, having entered the country and gone into quarantine, is very low: 3% is not a figure I consider to be high in any way; 97% of people were fine.  As I said, the data are consistent.  There is a slightly different but a much bigger database in the UK, where the figure is 2.5%.  The risk associated with that is perfectly manageable for a country like Ireland and a country like the UK without shutting down the economy and putting so many jobs at risk as a result.</p></speech>

That is not unusual.  In fact, in the case of the Dublin-Heathrow service, there are often pilots and cabin crew in hotels in London to enable the early-morning departures out of Heathrow into Dublin, so it is not impossible to do it.  The question is-----</p></speech>

He is one of the country's most eminent experts in aviation from his role as CEO of IAG, Aer Lingus and British Airways.  I am very interested in having a dialogue with him today on some of the issues at hand.</p> <p>  Regarding the 138 cabin crew and 60 ground staff affected by the Aer Lingus decision in Cork, it is deeply regrettable that this has happened.  My personal view is that this was avoidable.  I am delighted to hear Mr. Walsh refer to the attitude to flying that has developed in the Republic of Ireland.  I find it incredibly hard to digest the damage this is doing to our economy, to inward investment in the country and to the outbound tourism aspect, which was very important to many of the tour operators, which this committee has regularly hosted.  Many of them are now going bust, which is shocking.  I think more than 140,000 people work in aviation.</p> <p>  I wish to put a couple of select questions to Mr. Walsh as somebody who has been working very hard behind the scenes to try to advance the reopening of aviation in Ireland.  The first question concerns the digital green certificate, DGC.  According to Mr. Walsh's read of the DGC, how does he think it will work in a situation in which a family of five are flying from somewhere like Cork Airport to, for example, Paris if they are taking a trip to Disneyland?</p><p>What will happen if the two parents are vaccinated but the children are not?  How will it work out when the digital green certificate is implemented by the European Union?</p></speech>

I am pleased to say IATA has a solution for it.  We have a system called Timatic, an Irish colleague of mine is heavily involved with running it.  Timatic is a central database that includes all requirements for travel - these are typically passport and visa requirements - but it has been extended to include health requirements as well.  They can be accessed by airlines.  Governments can put in those requirements.  In many cases, children will not need to show evidence of vaccination to be able to travel with parents, as has already been stated by several countries.  We are developing an app that airlines can integrate into their own apps.  People will not have to go to several different sources.  An Aer Lingus or even a Ryanair customer using a travel app to check in and fly will have this information.  It can all be done through the airline's app.  It will demonstrate on departure that a passenger meets all the requirements for entry to the country to which he or she is travelling.</p> <p>  We are engaging with governments around the world and passengers should be able to demonstrate the information indicating they meet requirements on arrival, as well as when they go through immigration.  That can be done through one person for the entire family or several people could do it.  We have digital solutions either in development or available to us today that will enable people to travel.  We are very conscious at IATA that we must facilitate families when they are travelling.</p></speech>

I have made the point about stakeholder engagement repeatedly to the Minister for Transport and the Minister of State with responsibility for aviation.  As a Government Deputy, I make it categorically clear that this must happen and people like Mr. Walsh must be listened to when it comes to the decision-making process around reopening.  Is the Republic of Ireland, as an island nation on the western periphery of Europe, on a similar trajectory to our European neighbours with the reopening of aviation?</p></speech>

Ireland is still debating some of these matters and it risks being left behind as the rest of Europe starts moving forward.  It is not just when compared with EU countries, and it also risks lagging behind other countries around Europe and the world.</p> <p>  I should say I am not being critical of the Minister for Transport as I have not sought to meet him.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, reached out to me early in my appointment at IATA to say he is available.  I am six weeks in and I have a long list of things to do.  I took the opportunity to appear before the committee.</p></speech>

We have been doing much work on the aviation sector and we want to work to get it reopened as safely as possible.  Mr. Walsh is a key component in that.  We are delighted he took up the offer of appearing before us today.  We hope this meeting will feed into Government policy and we will get common-sense, practical and safe solutions for the reopening of the sector.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh may be able to give a read from a European level or international basis on something to which I have been trying to get established answers but have found incredibly difficult.  I refer to Ireland's connection with the United States of America and the reopening of the air bridge across the Atlantic to North America, including Canada and the United States.  Where does he believe that is going at present?  Is there any evidence to suggest the Commission is close to brokering a deal to lift the presidential ban in order that European passengers may fly to the United States?  I raised the question of the Schengen area in the D&aacute;il and Deputy McNamara joined in that evening as well.  What is Mr. Walsh's knowledge around diplomatic efforts by the Commission to allow transatlantic passage for Irish passengers to the United States?  Will Ireland be excluded as a non-Schengen country and should we, as the transport committee, be watching this?</p></speech>

It is section 212(f) of the US Immigration and Nationality Act that allows the imposition of this restriction.  It was put in place for the Schengen area before it was put in place for Ireland and the UK, and it was approximately a week or two after the US Government imposed the restriction on Schengen countries that it imposed the restriction on Ireland and the UK.  I do not believe Ireland is at risk of being left behind.  I know the US is considering it but I am not sure the appetite is very strong.</p> <p>  There is a move for this to be done on a reciprocal basis but that would be regrettable.  We must recognise there is major value to Ireland in having inbound US tourism.  These people tend to be the most valuable tourists we get into the country.  There is a very short summer season we can take advantage of if we get things moving.  Equally, I understand that as an Irish citizen, I would love to be able to travel to the US because I have business there.  It is not nice being restricted but we must be pragmatic.  The interests of the country are best served by allowing access to Ireland to US citizens with freedom to travel into and outside the US without restriction because they are vaccinated.  Other European countries are certainly going to do that.</p></speech>

We have waited long enough to take action.  This committee, comprising cross-party Deputies from both the Opposition and the Government, has been very vocal in its support for the aviation sector.  It is now time for those at the Cabinet and those within the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, to recognise that the economic damage being done to Ireland by current policies must be seriously considered, particularly now that we are reaching such an advanced stage in the vaccination process.  I thank Mr. Walsh for the responses.</p></speech>

It goes to the balance that we have argued for.  We must balance the protection of lives with that of livelihoods.  The problem is that livelihoods are being damaged significantly and are likely to suffer permanent damage unless we start moving quickly.</p></speech>

I will speak to the horizon for the aviation sector in general.  When do we expect to be back at 2019 levels?  We might be at 43% of those levels this year.  Within that, how does Ireland compare internationally?</p></speech>

The general view is that domestic markets will recover first and we are seeing that.  There is no domestic market in Ireland or the UK<i>per se</i>but if we look at big domestic markets around the world, China is back above where it was in 2019, as is Russia.  The US is pretty much in line with 2019 and having spoken with chief executives in the US industry, they are confident they will have more capacity in the market this summer than they did in 2019.  One could argue that domestic markets have fully recovered.<br/><br/>The view has been that short-haul leisure flights would recover first, built principally on the belief that the EU would open and there would be a common regime across the EU.  It has disappointed many people that we have not seen that.  The area of business that will lag in recovery is long-haul international.  Ireland is principally looking at the US in this regard and we should get moving and put much effort into this.</p><p>We are going to have to work hard from a tourism point of view to convince US tourists to come back to Ireland and to demonstrate to them that they are going to receive the traditional warm welcome.  There is work to be done there.  It is domestic markets first, so that is no help to Ireland.  On short-haul leisure, if we can get the EU working together, there should be some benefit to Ireland but the real benefit is long-haul, and that is transatlantic.</p><p> To be honest, I do not see the Aer Lingus network recovering to where it was in 2019 until 2024 or 2025.  I do not see the US airlines that served Ireland coming back quickly into the market either.</p></speech>

In terms of the level of supports that have been offered so far internationally, we heard from representative groups in Ireland which said very clearly to us that the Irish Government has not provided the scale of support that has been provided by other states.  Mr. Walsh mentioned earlier that this may not be the case, and I would be interested in his perspective on that.  We have the employment wage subsidy scheme in place and there are similar schemes internationally.  How does Mr. Walsh see the transition?  Will there be further cuts across the board?  What types of subsidies and supports will be needed into the future to sustain the sector in its recovery?  What does the future look like in terms of the ask from the industry on state and other supports?</p></speech>

I would say Ireland's was the least attractive of the three but there was not a huge difference between them all.  If I then look at how airlines accessed financial support, the Spanish Government put in place a loan guarantee scheme with Spanish commercial banks, which IAG accessed through Iberia Airlines and Vueling Airlines to the tune of &euro;1 billion.  We saw Aer Lingus get &euro;150 million through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, whereas for Iberia and Vueling it was &euro;1 billion.  From memory, it was &euro;750 million for Iberia and &euro;250 million for Vueling; these are commercial loans but guaranteed by the Spanish state in the event of a default on the part of the company.  British Airways accessed financing through two different schemes in the UK to the tune of about $2.8 billion.  In terms of scale, obviously, Aer Lingus is smaller than British Airways or Iberia, but in terms of scale and importance, I would argue that Aer Lingus is probably of greater economic importance.  Therefore, while Aer Lingus has accessed funding through ISIF, it is not on a similar scale to what is being made available in Spain or the UK.</p></speech>

There is a concern, and it is a reality we experienced last summer, that international travel might contribute to the spread of the virus.  We saw it in the west of Ireland, with busloads of American tourists, and that gave rise to fear and concern among communities.  We need to get to a place where we can give people confidence and assurance that international travel can happen safely.  Are there tools or examples of where that is done well, in Mr. Walsh's experience?</p></speech>

As I said, significant data are now available, and the UK has a bigger database that I have been able to access.

It depends on how people want to present the data.  We can present the data as showing 3% who were infected as opposed to 97% who were not infected, but the evidence is that the vast majority of people were not and the infection rates were very low.  When there is widespread infection in a country, the WHO recommendation is that we should not stop international travel, and that once the virus is in place, banning international travel has little or no impact.</p> <p>  One can argue about the variants of concern, and that is another issue.  Again, there is the technology with regard to the vaccines, and the evidence that is available today shows that most of the vaccines are effective against the variants.  We all know that viruses mutate and that is how viruses stay alive.</p> <p>  The other thing we have to remember is that the deaths which have taken place are tragic and it is a terrible tragedy for all of the families who have suffered as a result of this, but it is not just that people die from coronavirus.  This is something we live with.  People die from flu but we do not stop the economy every winter because of the outbreak of the flu pandemic and because hundreds of thousands of people die across the world.</p></speech>

I am not a big fan of PSOs.  They have a role to play on certain routes where destinations are not going to be served on a commercial basis.  I cannot see anywhere that would apply in Ireland because I think critical connectivity will be provided on a commercial basis.  It is something that governments will look at and a number of governments have introduced PSOs through this.  There is a role for PSOs but I think it is a small, marginal role.</p></speech>

I am sure everything he said will be counterbalanced by NPHET, the Department of Health and the HSE, which will say that public health lies at the core of everything we do.  I concur with Mr. Walsh in his remarks - I am paraphrasing - that we have a repressive regime and that if we are to have access to and involvement in the digital green certificate and if people are fully vaccinated, then there should be no mandatory hotel quarantine and people should be able to come and go freely.  In the context of Mr. Walsh's last remarks on critical connectivity on a commercial basis, does he see a difficulty for us, as an island nation, in terms of connectivity in a post-Covid world?</p></speech>

Certainly, we are not going to have the same network or breadth of network that served Ireland in 2019 for a number of years to come.  For a number of the new destinations that Aer Lingus announced on the transatlantic routes, I cannot see how Aer Lingus will take the risk of reintroducing those for some considerable time.  There was talk about direct air links to China, and I do not think that is going to happen in this post-Covid environment for many years.  There is a risk that some of the connectivity that existed, or that we hoped for, is not going to be there or will not materialise in the same way.  Without question, connectivity will be set back significantly and will take time to recover.  I do not see any way around that, to be honest.</p></speech>

I know from my experience of working with Aer Lingus, the establishment of services to new destinations such as Seattle, San Francisco, which were building up, led to significant volumes of people travelling to Ireland on business.  Those destinations take time to mature to a point where they are financially viable.  Given that the Aer Lingus transatlantic fleet will be a smaller fleet, it means that some of those destinations will not be served for some time to come.  That clearly must have an impact on foreign direct investment because having connectivity is very important.  While the technology we are using this afternoon is great and enables us to do things, it is nowhere near as good as having face-to-face communication.  I do not buy into the idea that all business will now be done over Zoom, Teams or something else because the quality of interaction is nowhere near as good as when people are sitting in the same room.</p></speech>

It is meant to be that; a passport to travel safely.  I should have put on the record at the beginning of the meeting that I received a briefing from Mr. Peter O'Broin and Mr. Simon McNamara of IATA.  I compliment Mr. Walsh on the IATA travel pass video.  I have put it into the chat group and it is something the committee should also explore.  I should have said that at the beginning.  I apologise for that.  </p> <p>  I am concerned over the air bridge for both Europe and transatlantic services in the context of Aer Lingus particularly.  Mr. Walsh smiled at the deal he got with the sale of Aer Lingus.  I believe Senator Craughwell was one of the only ones who opposed the sale of Aer Lingus along with the former Senator, Se&aacute;n Barrett.  Many of us were concerned about the Heathrow slots.  Does Mr. Walsh think that Aer Lingus will hold firm to its connectivity for Ireland and the importance of Aer Lingus to Ireland?  Where does that stand now?  </p></speech>

Obviously, I cannot speak for Aer Lingus or for IAG.  The Senator will have heard some of the comments I made when I was CEO of IAG that I regarded Aer Lingus as the star performer in the group.  We were delighted with the progress we made.  We delivered on all commitments we gave and in fact exceeded them.  We expanded the transatlantic network faster and far beyond what was originally anticipated.  That was under the leadership of Stephen Kavanagh when he was the CEO and then Se&aacute;n Doyle who took over from Mr. Kavanagh, who is now CEO of British Airways.  Aer Lingus still has significant influence in IAG.  However, the reputation of Aer Lingus has been damaged as a result of what Ireland has done and that will take some time to repair.  From my knowledge, I can assure the committee that there is still a great commitment to Ireland on the part of Aer Lingus.</p></speech>

I am very happy to debate and I think we need to challenge NPHET.  It should be open to challenge and we should not be afraid to push back on the decisions it has taken.  I deal with risk or at least I did in my career as an operating pilot and as a CEO.  The attitude to risk of many of these people is very different.  We know we are required to operate in an environment where we are managing risk.  I find it impossible to accept we can have a zero-risk environment.  The impact of that attitude on some of the decisions taken in Ireland has been deeply regrettable.</p></speech>

We have invited him to appear before the committee again and hope he accepts that invitation.</p> <p>  How has the approach by the authorities here damaged Aer Lingus from a practical perspective?  Mr. Walsh said he thought it was highly unlikely that US airlines would come back into Ireland for some time.  When does he expect them back?  He said the supports Spain is giving to Iberia are much larger than the supports being provided here.  I ask him to define that.  What airlines does he expect to see flying into and out of Ireland over the next year or two?  Will we be very dependent on our indigenous airlines?  Ryanair is still based here.  The Irish public still regard Aer Lingus as a national carrier that provides a very good service.  How critical is it that Aer Lingus and Ryanair come through this and are supported in a large way?</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh spoke about a reduction in service.  Is that a reduction in the number of planes that airlines will fly or a reduction in the number of routes?  What do we need to do initially with the reopening?  Obviously, we want a safe reopening and we want it done in a practical way.  As Mr. Walsh said, there may be occasions when quarantining is needed.  However, with vaccinations and empirical evidence on reductions in incidence, quarantining is not needed as a general policy.  Antigen testing is due to come on board.  I know I am asking for considerable detail, but it is very important for Ireland.  We understand how significant the implications are for Ireland, as an island nation.  We have large airlines based here, Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  I know I am asking a lot, but I think it is the key.  </p></speech>

As I said, the recovery is likely to be in domestic markets, short haul and then long haul.  Aer Lingus has significant dependence on its transatlantic market, which has been very successful.  Consequently, the recovery will take longer for Aer Lingus.  My real concern is that the message coming from Ireland has been very negative, much more so than the message coming from other countries.  The attitude has been that anybody travelling into Ireland must be infected and therefore we should not allow anybody in.  I have not witnessed that to the same degree in any other country I have been dealing with.  It has been particularly damaging to the reputation of Ireland as a destination country, which it is.  We depend heavily on inbound traffic.</p> <p>  My point about US carriers is that there was considerable transatlantic competition with many services being provided by US carriers.</p><p>I do not see them providing the same level.  They will serve Ireland but not to the same degree or with the same frequency of service.  It will probably be more on a seasonal than a year-round basis, which is a risk.  There will be a delay in some cases.  It will probably mean that some of the airlines that we are serving would not serve Ireland as a destination or may only serve it seasonally.  Regarding support, if I look at Iberia, it is probably twice the size of Aer Lingus but received five times the level of financial support from the Spanish Government.</p></speech>

This was a mutually beneficial meeting.  I see it as the start of a number of engagements.  I assume that there will be follow-up with the Government, which is important.  Let us hope that over the next week that we see a reopening plan that happens in a safe way, where our aviation sector can get off the ground and we can get back to what we do well, which is being a small, open economy.  There are 140,000 people employed in aviation.  We, as a cross-party committee, will really put to the Government that we need to look at reopening.  By all means have a quarantine, but it has to be in limited cases.  We should look at expanding testing to antigen tests, having PCR tests instead of quarantine, and ensuring that we have a viable and secure airline and connectivity in the future.  I thank Mr. Walsh.</p></speech>
