Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, Members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I will ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure we are adhering to this constitutional requirement. </p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.</p> <p>  Before we begin our public engagement, we considered the minutes of our meetings of 11 and 16 February at our private meeting last week. Standing Order 107(3) requires that the minutes are agreed in public session.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As previously agreed, the minutes will be published on the committee&rsquo;s web page.</p> <p>  Today we engage with officials from the Office of Government Procurement to examine the 2019 Appropriation Accounts for Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. David Moloney, acting Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer, Office of Government Procurement, and Mr. David O&rsquo;Brien, principal officer, Office of Government Procurement.  I welcome them to the meeting and thank them and their staff for the briefing material they prepared for the committee.</p> <p>  I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing to avoid background noise or feedback.  I also ask that they use the button to raise their hand when they wish to contribute and then put it down.  I also remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off. </p> <p>  Before starting, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards reference you may make to other person in your evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Witnesses should also be aware of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. </p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.      </p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask that Members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I would ask the witness to state their name the first time they contribute.</p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030200002#A00500"><p>As members are aware, procurement of goods and services by public bodies is a highly complex process that can be challenging from both a technical and legal point of view.  Public procurement covers a vast range of goods and services from administrative supplies such as stationery and paper through to large scale and complex projects in areas such as information technology, capital works and the purchase of drugs.</p> <p>  A sustained focus on public procurement over the past number of years, both by my office and by the Committee of Public Accounts, has driven a significant improvement in public procurement practice across the whole public sector.  As a matter of policy, I have drawn attention to any situation in an audited body where we identified procurement of goods and services that was not compliant with relevant national and EU rules, and where the aggregate value of the spending was in excess of &euro;500,000 in a year.  The committee has followed up on such cases, seeking additional explanations, and clear outlines of plans to address the problem.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has responded to recommendations made.  As a result, we have seen improvements such as improved tracking by many public bodies of their procurement, including identifying cases where procedures followed were not competitive and-or not compliant; and more transparency by public bodies in their annual financial statements about situations where there has been significant non-compliant procurement, and the reasons for that.  With the exception of the health service, there has been a downward trend in the level of non-compliant procurement requiring disclosure in the accounts of public sector bodies subject to audit by me.</p> <p>  Competitive and open procurement is generally considered to be the best way to ensure that a public body has secured good value for money spent.  It should also allow legitimate suppliers who are interested in the business opportunity to submit bids for consideration, and to have those bids evaluated in an equitable and fair way.  Public bodies need to take a strategic approach to their procurement activity to ensure these benefits are achieved.  Competitive procurement needs to be followed up by careful contract agreement and effective contract management.  </p> <p>  Members will be aware that some procurements carried out without a competitive process can still be considered compliant with procurement rules.  Within the existing procurement rules, there are a number of types of circumstances where purchasing may take place without a competitive process.  Examples of such purchases include where only a single supplier providing a required service can be identified; the purchase of proprietary or branded goods; where there is a genuine urgency; or where there are specific security considerations.  Public bodies availing of such options need to be able to demonstrate that it is appropriate to do so, and that good value for money has nevertheless been achieved.</p> <p>  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, was established as a separate Vote in 2014.  It was created through a merger of units that previously existed in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and in the Office of Public Works.  The OGP has responsibility for service-wide procurement policy and procedures, sourcing systems and data analytics.  It also seeks to put in place shared framework agreements and contracts for the purchase of goods and services by public sector bodies.  The OGP aims to provide information and support to public sector bodies through account managers and help desk staff.</p> <p>  The 2019 appropriation account for Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement records gross expenditure of &euro;16.1 million.  This represented a small increase, of around 4%, on the prior year outturn.  The expenditure was incurred on a single programme, with the bulk of the spending accounted for by salaries and other pay costs.  The OGP had a surplus to surrender of &euro;2.4 million at the end of 2019.  The underspend fell into two areas: pay, with an underspend of &euro;2 million or 13%; and procurement consultancy and other costs with an underspend of &euro;589,000 or 24%.  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account for 2019.</p></speech>

The committee is tied by Covid-19 restrictions and his opening statement is quite lengthy.</p><p>I ask Mr. Moloney to summarise it and keep within five minutes because we are tied to a two-hour limit for our meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030200002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to make a statement.  The statement is lengthy and I will try to skip through it.  If members have questions on the parts that I skip, I am happy to take them.</p> <p>  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, is a division of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that has at its core the management of public expenditure at sustainable levels and responsible and responsive public management and governance.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General said, &euro;2.4 million of the &euro;18.4 million allocation from the Exchequer was surrendered at the end of the year but this was mostly due to delays in recruiting staff and longer than expected start-up times in a number of key projects.</p> <p>  The programme for procurement reform commenced in 2013 and since then, great progress has been made.  The OGP works with sector partners in health, local government, education and defence to source goods and services that are common throughout public service, such as ICT, professional services and cleaning.  The sector partners themselves source sector specific goods and services.  We estimate that &euro;6 billion of procurement addressable spend falls within the remit of the OGP and other central purchasing bodies.  While the OGP is charged with developing the policy framework and associated guidelines, it is up to the contracting authorities to ensure they adhere to these rules.  The OGP does not have a policing role in compliance and nor does it have the remit to review individual public procurement processes.</p> <p>  The procurement arrangements put in place by the OGP cover a broad range of services and it helps its clients with complex legal arrangements under the European procurement regime.  At the same time, these arrangements drive real value for money for citizens, not only delivering savings that can be reinvested in the delivery of front-line services but also supporting sustained participation by small and medium-sized enterprises.  The OGP provided advice to the public sector on Brexit and issued information notes highlighting the various steps public bodies could take to prepare for the impact of Brexit, including a focus on tender documentation, contract management and contingency planning.  The OGP also has responsibility for providing policy guidance to the construction sector under the capital works management framework, which consists of a comprehensive suite of guidance and template documents implementing Government reforms in construction procurement.</p> <p>  The impact of Covid-19 on the national development plan has been significant and the OGP has provided guidance to public bodies in managing the contractual issues arising and determining how to manage tender competitions under way.  These steps have helped public bodies and the industry to respond well to the new working environment, particularly in protecting infrastructure projects under the national development plan.  A review of the capital works management framework is under way and a key focus for the construction industry in 2021 will be on improving productivity.</p> <p>  Ensuring SMEs can successfully compete for public contracts is critical in public procurement.  In this context, the OGP also supports the Minister of State in his quarterly meetings with the SME advisory group and works to address the concerns of industry bodies.  The OGP gathers comprehensive information on procurement spending and tendering throughout the public service, which shows that 53% of spend in 2018 was directly with SMEs and that 92% of spend was with firms based in Ireland with a median tender size of &euro;100,000.</p> <p>  The operational work of the OGP is focused on establishing and servicing procurement solutions, such as overarching framework agreements and commercial solutions for all public bodies as well as the procurement of bespoke goods and services for individual clients.  Framework agreements operate by aggregating demand from the whole of the public service and are established through open competitive processes.  In this way, they offer the potential to realise significant efficiencies.  Framework agreements are often broken down by lots into geography, specialism or contract size to encourage SME participation at local level.  In the years since 2014, frameworks and contracts put in place by the OGP and its sectoral sourcing partners have already enabled savings estimated at &euro;570 million for the State.  At present, the OGP has more than 121 framework agreements in place and in 2019 it completed more than 1,000 competitions.  The work of the OGP touches on many aspects of citizens' lives.  It covers a broad range of issues, such as contracts for electric vehicles, a framework for legal services, electricity framework agreements, a framework for robotic process automation and arrangements for rapid build housing.</p> <p>  The HSE has been very active in contributing to the national response to Covid.  The OGP has liaised with the HSE, utilising its personal protective equipment supply lines and securing equipment for non-health front-line public sector workers.  A team was established to support the establishment of emergency site facilities with the HSE.  The OGP, with others, launched a web page to capture offers of assistance and equipment from businesses and other organisations seeking to provide supplies and services in support of the national response to Covid.  A number of OGP staff volunteered-----</p></speech>

As the OGP continues to develop, it will maintain a strong focus and engagement with industry clients and suppliers to promote the benefits of excellent procurement.  As part of the programme for Government, the OGP will continue to find innovative ways to incorporate green and social considerations in its procurement solutions.  Working with its clients, the OGP will continue to provide a broad suite of solutions to procurement issues.</p> <p>  Promoting better planning, earlier engagement and robust post-award contract management will mean the State is better equipped to deliver real value for Government spending, not only ensuring there are cash savings through the arrangements put in place but also that public sector buyers access the right goods and services at the right time and that rigorous quality assurance is in place.  I thank the committee for its time and I look forward to answering questions.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Moloney for his presentation.  I also thank him and all of his staff for the work done in this area.  As he outlined in his report, they have saved the State money.  I want to raise an issue that is not referred to in the report.  It is with regard to the mechanism for dealing with urgent decisions.  When we faced into the pandemic urgent decisions had to be taken on products such as personal protective equipment. PPE.  Is there a mechanism for dealing with this?  The tendering process takes a bit of time.  With regard to personal protective equipment, ventilators and medication, was a process in place to deal with the urgency?  Did we get all of what we required?  Did the hospital services get all of the equipment they required in a timely manner?  Was the process delayed because of how we now structure the tendering process?  Will Mr. Moloney outline areas where improvements could be made when urgency arises or where there is a need for immediate decisions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030200002#B00700"><p>I thank the Deputy.  It is a basic principle of public procurement that competitive tendering should be used except in justifiably exceptional circumstances.  Notwithstanding this, the procurement rules do provide flexibility to contracting authorities in times of extreme urgency arising from events that are unforeseeable by the contracting authority.  Of course, the Covid pandemic is an example of such an unforeseeable event.  The OGP has been very involved in helping and advising the various contracting authorities on this and has issued notes and guidance on it.  Of course, the use and justification for non-competitive procurement is a matter for each contracting authority to decide.  For example, the health sector would decide how to implement it within the health sector but the OGP is available to all public bodies to offer advice.  Any time non-standard procurement is used it is notified.  Contracts valued at more than &euro;25,000 are notified to the Comptroller and Auditor General and published in the appropriation accounts of the bodies concerned.</p> <p>  Since the start of the pandemic, we have been very involved in working with HSE and others in trying to address the issues the Deputy has raised.  The chief procurement officer, Mr. Paul Quinn, is with me and he can give more detail on the operation on the ground of these experiences.</p></speech>

Do we need to have a better structure in place to deal with this kind of situation into the future?  What lessons have we learned over the past 12 months in dealing with it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Quinn" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030200002#C00200"><p>I am the Government's chief procurement officer.  In terms of lessons learned, what was very important during this period was the speed with which the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, and the health system acted.  It is coming up on a year since the OGP issued guidance to all the public service bodies regarding the flexibilities it had within the procurement laws and the procurement directives.  What that allowed was for public bodies to move ahead under the situation that people found themselves in of extreme and unforeseeable urgency to produce that which they needed to do.  It extended not only into the health service but beyond that to other bodies like the Garda, the prison services, direct provision centres and eventually into education.  People needed to do things to enable the services to citizens to continue.  We issued guidance almost a year ago, literally within days of the start of the pandemic on 22 March.  That supported people in doing that which they needed to do.  About a week later the European Commission followed up with a similar piece of guidance that supported people in doing what they needed to do.</p> <p>  The Deputy's question about what we learned is an important one.  I would draw attention to a couple of things.  These are lessons we have shared with the OECD and the European Commission.  Importantly, the structures we established under the reform guise helped enormously in the entire system pulling together.  It enabled my office at the centre, working with players like health, education and local government, to procure that which was needed and to leverage arrangements that were required.  In particular, the health system moved ahead very quickly, as we know, to procure personal protective equipment, PPE.  My office worked across the remainder of the public service to consolidate their needs and we were able to leverage off those arrangements with the health system to ensure people like the Prison Service, direct provision centres, etc. were able to get that which they needed very quickly.</p> <p>  We played a huge role not only in providing advice but also providing a mechanism for co-ordination.  It is a similar story across other countries internationally but Ireland's scale and the fact we had established these arrangements for co-operation and collaboration under the reform banner paid dividends during that time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030200002#C00300"><p>On Brexit and the effect it has had on the tendering process, what difference has that made with regard to contracts?  Has it made any difference or is there a situation where we need to be more careful because of the new rules that apply as a result of Brexit in dealing with contractors or suppliers from the UK?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030200002#C00400"><p>In general terms, one of the things we have with regard to Brexit is several agreements.  There is the agreement between the EU and the UK, which agrees that there will be access to each other's markets in terms of public procurement so that companies from the EU can compete for public procurement in the UK and <i>vice versa</i>.<br/><br/>There is a changed situation.  We have barriers to trade that were not there before, particularly logistical barriers, non-tariff barriers and the imposition of VAT in respect of trade.  There are greater challenges in that regard but the OGP has been involved over recent years in trying to encourage businesses to prepare for those greater challenges.  It has issued advice on that and engaged with its governance structures and with the small and medium enterprise advisory group.  It is early days yet.  In principle, we have equal access in terms of procurement but undoubtedly there will be challenges ahead.</p></speech>

The trade and co-operation agreement under Title VI deals with public procurement specifically and goes somewhat beyond the Government procurement under the World Trade Organization rules.  We do not anticipate substantial issues arising with regard to procurement rules <i>per se</i>, but the challenges in terms of the regulatory environment, the customs environment and rules of origin are already creating issues that are quite perceivable for anybody who does their shopping in any of the UK multiples or sees products coming through there.  We see the wrinkles in terms of those arrangements actually starting to arise.  They will arise for Government too in terms of challenges in customs declarations and ensuring people are aware of the delays that can occur now at ports.<br/><br/>We have seen some issues, especially on the construction side where, because of some of the challenges, we have seen a slowdown in certain materials that travel either from or through the UK.  They are likely to result potentially in increased costs as well as potential delays in terms of slowdowns.  Those costs will probably arise from the administration of the customs arrangements more so than anything arising because of tariffs or duties because there is a free trade element to the trade and co-operation agreement.  Rules of origin also apply which look into the materials and their origin that flow from the UK.  Putting a badge &quot;Made in the UK&quot; or &quot;Made in the EU&quot; requires the fulfilling of certain rules of origin, which means where do all the component parts come from and is it genuinely either a UK product or an EU product?  Some of those technicalities are starting to create challenges, ultimately, from a regulatory, customs and rules of origin perspective.  Beyond that they are trade issues rather than public procurement matters.  We do not anticipate substantial issues arising from a public procurement perspective.</p></speech>

The way we calculate savings is set out in a methodology agreed when the OGP was established, so that is what we do.  We can certainly provide the committee with a breakdown of those savings and how they are calculated.  They are in the major areas.  When we think about the OGP and what it has done, we have gone from a situation where many thousands of people procured goods and services on behalf of the State at relatively low levels of expertise in terms of the people who were procuring goods and services and increasing that level of expertise and to some extent aggregating the procurement activities across-----</p></speech>

We do not hold information centrally on the final spend against a contract amount.  That information would be held by the public bodies themselves.  I will give the Deputy a sense of why that is the case.  There are approximately 8,000 public service bodies out there who contract for small and large amounts.  We do not have the capacity to hold that information; it would be far too voluminous for us to hold or gather.</p></speech>

I wish to pick up on some of the points raised by Deputy Burke on cases of overspending.  I understand that with more than 8,000 bodies, the office cannot monitor every contract.  However, I want to tease out the responsiveness of the OGP to the more systemic issues.  What capacity has the office to receive feedback either on the original procurement process, how it is working or where it has not met expectations?  Out of the 8,000 bodies, what proportion of them overspending would give rise to questions about the systems that the OGP had in place in the first instance?  I invite the witnesses to talk us through some of the office's safeguards.</p></speech>

From the perspective of the OGP, the attempt is to strengthen procurement through pushing out appropriate guidelines and strengthening expertise.  In terms of the policing or auditing of contracts, the Comptroller and Auditor General has responsibility for that.  Indeed, as is clear from his opening statement, his office takes that responsibility very seriously and brings issues arising to the attention of the Accounting Officers, in terms of commentary on the appropriation accounts, and to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts.  In a sense, that oversight aspect is delivered in that way.  In terms of systematic issues that come up and that need to be addressed in the context of the general public procurement guidelines and how they might be improved, we maintain an awareness of issues that arise and seek to strengthen and improve our guidelines as those issues come into view.  Mr. Quinn may have more to add to that.</p></speech>

We have engagement forums, as the Comptroller and Auditor General said in his opening statement, and we have a number of account managers who go out and engage with those larger public bodies on their public procurement plans to see how they are doing, what supports we can provide to them and how we can better support them in delivering their procurement responsibilities.  In addition, we maintain a very large register of offerings on our website so if a public body needs audit services, tyres for vehicles or new ICT systems, for example, they can go to our website and get information on the supports they may need to ensure that they are living within the policies and legal responsibilities that are placed on them.  In addition, our website contains lots of guidance, helpful information notes and lots of templates to support people in doing what they need to do in terms of public service obligations for public procurement.</p></speech>

What I am curious about is the process by which, if any, that is then formally fed back into a formal or periodic review process.  It sounds like it is there but perhaps not as formalised as I am describing.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General wish to comment?</p></speech>

Internal audit and the audit committee of a public sector body should also be, on a fairly systematic basis, going through the procurement that is undertaken by the relevant Department.  There are systems in place to capture where contract overruns are occurring.  The difficulty is to aggregate it, which is exactly what the Deputy has put her finger on.  The requirement on public sector bodies to disclose information about where they have non-compliant procurement is really the key to getting that information on a regular basis directly from the individual bodies.</p></speech>

We compile a report on an annual basis in relation to that and see how we can help, both from an operational perspective but also from a policy perspective.  I must caution that it is only one input into our overall procurement plans and inputs but it does form part of one and is a very formal process.  It features in our annual planning and it also features in how we engage with public bodies from a policy and operational perspective.</p></speech>

Obviously it is essential that there is a clear and transparent public procurement process in any modern democracy and it is really heartening to see the savings that have emerged, of approximately &euro;570 million, since the office's establishment.  I would like to get into that a little deeper if I can.  A parliamentary question tabled in 2013 sought an update on the office's establishment and the addressable spend.  I ask Mr. Moloney to clarify something for me.  He spoke about a State spend of &euro;7 billion, for which OGP is relevant but if one goes back to 2013, the equivalent figure seems to have been &euro;9 billion.  Reference was made to an addressable spend and I ask the witnesses to help me out.  What is the difference there?</p></speech>

A few things have moved on since 2013.  Since that period, the expenditure profile has changed somewhat.  While I do not have the details of what the Deputy has in front of her, if I recall it correctly, we made a distinction between the overall procurement spend of public bodies and what we call the addressable spend.  The difference between the two relates to a number of things we exclude because they would be excluded under public procurement, including, for example, inter-agency expenditure.  For example, some bodies would count in their non-pay expenditure moneys they grant or pass on to other public service bodies.  The system pushes money out from the centre through a grant system and a lot of that would not be procurable.  Other things that would not be procurable would include, in the standard fashion, rent and rates.  Again, they are not included.  A large sum that we also excluded was money reimbursed for pharmaceuticals through the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, which accounts for approximately &euro;1.1 billion or &euro;1.2 billion.</p></speech>

Returning to the savings and the profile of that, I appreciate Deputy Colm Burke has asked for a greater breakdown of it but looking at it systemically and on the basis of international comparison, when an office of this kind is established, there is a certain amount of capture one can get in the first instance simply by streamlining the process.  There is a proportion of savings one will get from that and then perhaps there is an additional proportion of savings to be had just by capturing a better value for money than had previously been the case.  Is it the case that Mr. Quinn expects that amount of &euro;570 million to remain approximately static?  At what rate does he expect it to grow or has it captured the savings which are available to be captured at this point?  Is that a reasonable question?  Does Mr. Quinn know what I mean?</p></speech>

There is an early win for procurement aggregation, is how I would put it.  That arises by looking at the holistic needs of the entire public sector and ensuring that, for example, the price a small school out on the Aran Islands is paying for its electricity is the same as what we can procure it for say, the Revenue Commissioners.  Part of what the OGP has been able to do in enabling its savings has been to ensure things like that do happen.  We look at the needs of the entire public sector, from small bodies to large ones and ensure we get those benefits from aggregation.  That has to be balanced then with the reality that we cannot over-aggregate-----</p></speech>

We have to look at ensuring small businesses also have an opportunity so while we aggregate, we then disaggregate into lots and we allow lotting to happen to find the right kind of balance between those things.  What it does do is it enables small bodies, typically, to benefit from the buying power of larger public bodies and that is where a lot of that happens.  It does also become cyclical in that during better economic times, it is more difficult to deliver incremental savings and during tougher economic times, one generally finds markets are hungrier.  It does become somewhat baked into the base and our savings numbers probably peaked in the early years.  When I look at a breakdown year by year, which we will provided separately as the Deputy has requested, in 2016 and 2017 when the office got up and running at scale and we were delivering a lot of new frameworks for the public sector that people were buying into, we delivered a lot more in savings than we have done over the past number of years.</p> <p>  There are a lot of other benefits that accrue from the centralisation of public procurement other than simply saving money.  It is part of the picture but it also enables things like secondary policies like green and social to be implemented.  It give a far more credible offering out there to the markets that we know what we are about, that we are dealing with things in a much more professional way and it delivers a lot of administration savings because, as the Secretary General said earlier, all these individual public bodies were off doing their own thing - excuse the expression - whereas now, not only the OGP but our partners in the health system, in local government, in defence and education are procuring on behalf of the entire system and that reduces a lot of administration costs as well, which are available to public bodies.</p></speech>

I know the OGP cannot either because I understand it is being judicially reviewed.  I am not sure if that has concluded.

Therefore, the costs did not fall solely to the State but we did pick up a higher proportion than the other party.  Those costs were finally settled in December 2020.  The final cost was just a shade, that is, a few euro under &euro;360,000.</p> <p>  As to the Deputy's question on learning from it, there has been an amount of learning from it.  In particular, as Mr. McCarthy said in his opening statement, public procurement is an extraordinarily complex area and is extremely legalistic.  That makes it very difficult for practitioners, particularly when one sees that the courts at various levels can sometimes have different rulings themselves.  It shows some of the complexity of interpreting the rules but we always learn from what we do, what goes well and what does not.  Undoubtedly, there are some learnings from that particular case that we have codified and shared because there were some learnings from it, as there always are in relation to these things.</p></speech>

I am aware that this can be for various reasons but I seek the OGP's perspective on ensuring that people are complying with procurement rules.  In some cases those roll-overs and extensions last several years.  Therefore, from the OGP's point of view, how is that dealt with, how is it prevented from happening and how do we ensure the public purse is getting value for money?</p></speech>

The rules are really clear and what the OGP can do is set out those procurement frameworks and allow people to understand, through the materials it provides, what those rules say.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General said earlier, there are a number of exceptions where non-competitive procurement is allowable - proprietary, urgency, etc. - but there are really very limited exceptions.</p></speech>

We have people on the policy side who would not conduct public procurement competitions and they would provide policy advice.  We have key account managers who are in the field.  The number of people who actually run competitions in conjunction with public service bodies is approximately 150.  Again, the competitions vary in size and complexity.  For example, there could be very large, critically important, strategically important competitions-----</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  As we are almost out of time, I have one other question.  It is in regard to the promotion of the use of environmental and social considerations in public procurement.  Can Mr. Quinn give some examples of contracts where the OGP has been successful with that, where it is relevant?</p></speech>

For example, we have recently put in place an electric vehicle framework for both cars and small vans.  We have run competitions to support the education sector to buy its electricity from 100% green sources.  Other examples would be that we have just put in place a framework for furniture with the HSE that would include reuse of materials as part of the furniture provided, but also life-cycle management by ensuring effective disposal.  We would have a broad range of examples where we have already incorporated that, although there is a lot more to be done.</p></speech>

Is the OGP aware of any incidents like that in the Irish case from our purchases?</p></speech>

I know there were a lot of potential suppliers which appeared in the marketplace and had to be looked at from a due diligence perspective.  Most of the expenditure in that space would be a matter for the HSE, so it may be able to give the Deputy more information.  At the end of the day, the OGP procurement arrangements were through another supplier and we had no issues.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Mr. Moloney referenced the issue of ensuring that SMEs can successfully compete for public contracts, which is critical in the public procurement process.  I ask what type of issues and concerns have been raised with the OGP and the Minister by the SME advisory group.  What steps is the OGP taking to address the concerns from the different industry bodies?</p></speech>

In some respects, the facts speak for themselves in the sense that more than 50% of value goes to SMEs, and that is a constant year-to-year figure.  Of course, we work with the SMEs very intensively through the SME advisory group, so there is constant interaction at that level.  There are a number of different issues that have been raised over time, such as the size of the contract lot and the emphasis on aggregation.  As I said in my statement, one of the things we provide for is for lots to be broken down on a specialty and geographical basis in order to support SMEs and sectors.  Mr. Quinn works more intensively on a day-to-day basis with the SME advisory group and he may wish to add to that.</p></speech>

In the interests of time, I will mention a couple of issues.  The SME advisory group meets quarterly and has the key groupings in there, so we get the right people around the table with the Minister of State and my office to ensure there is good dialogue in regard to these matters.  Over the past number of years, their main concern was less about the bureaucracy and more about ensuring bidders and businesses understood how to engage in public procurement.  We worked with the main industry bodies to develop a communications strategy and to roll it out in conjunction with bodies like the Small Firms Association, IBEC, ISME, CIF and so on, and we have hosted quite an amount of information sessions and training sessions in conjunction with InterTradeIreland to ensure bidders could engage in public procurement and be successful in public procurement.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Quinn agree?</p></speech>

It is on our website.  It looks at the median level of contract opportunities that are published across the public sector.  For most public contracts, the contract value is somewhere of the order of &euro;100,000.  That is the median value.  Some are bigger while others are smaller.  A figure of &euro;100,000 is not huge and the turnover requirement is not more than two times the contract value so one is talking about a business that would have a turnover of somewhere of the order of &euro;200,000 as the median contract size.  It is not that these opportunities are not achievable or attainable by smaller bodies.  Obviously, we break our own arrangements into lots.  A total of 78% of all our frameworks, and we do big stuff, are broken down into smaller lots to enable businesses to compete.  Approximately 67% of all suppliers on OGP frameworks - again, these are bigger arrangements - are SMEs.</p></speech>

There is a senior officials group specifically that has dealt with Covid from the start.  I sit on that group.  One of the issues that was discussed at that group was sustainability of supply.  A group has been formed across the key Departments, including the Department of Health and the HSE, to discuss how we achieve a more sustainable solution in the medium to long term.  It brings in lots of issues associated with trade policy, etc.</p></speech>

I have just left a meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  There has been much debate around the impact of public procurement on the affordability of housing.  I know Dublin City Council's quantity surveyors have essentially said that the public procurement process adds a significant amount of time to the overall procurement process but the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland has indicated that in the area of professional fees, often through public procurement, one could pay double what the private sector might pay.  I know the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland has said that we have allowed a situation to arise where we rule out risk but we are paying a very heavy price for that.  Could the witnesses comment on the area of value for money in public procurement?  While it is important to ensure nepotism and corruption do not happen, is it delivering value for money for public procurement?</p></speech>

A lot depends on the area and the particular housing type and mix.  In respect of the issues referred to by the Deputy with regard to differences in what Dublin City Council might see as the average cost of housing and what the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland might see or indeed the work of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, on the type of housing, they show very different numbers.  In particular, if we go back to the IGEES reports on housing, we see a study of the price that was paid or the cost of building housing.  That was considerably lower but the issue does turn around the quality and mix of housing and whether one is comparing like with like.</p></speech>

It went out for public procurement and came back at &euro;580,000 because many of the people with whom the agency had been speaking in advance were unable to participate.  It does not seem as though Mr. Quinn is reflecting many of the concerns we are hearing on the ground that public procurement is leading to an increase in price.  That might be acceptable if it is delivering extra quality or reducing risk but we should acknowledge it and it should be considered as something that is preventing the delivery of services.</p></speech>

When we look at the prices we actually paid, we can see that they have not necessarily been higher.  In fact the research on prices has shown that housing built on public land has been cheaper.  We know there are real issues in terms of building apartments on brownfield sites in urban areas and that there are costs, which have been set out in some detail by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.  I know the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is looking at the experience of Dublin City Council in respect of going to procurement for particular types of sites and development in a market that is highly constrained.  It is a matter of concern for us as well in terms of-----</p></speech>

I am not hearing the reform of public procurement for which many public bodies are calling.</p></speech>

We are looking at innovation in construction in the NDP review.  A construction sector subgroup chaired by my Department is looking at those issues.  We are seeking to drive through change because change is needed in terms of innovation in construction.  The reality is that we live in quite a supply constrained environment and I suspect the procurement price that Dublin City Council is seeing with regard to particular sites for particular types of housing developments reflects that.  The prices we have actually paid for public land, as evidenced in the IGEES report, paint a different picture.  We must unpack that.  It is a concern but we must unpack it and see what is really driving those changes and differences in cost.  A lot of that may be about the type of development we want to achieve on brownfield sites, particularly high-density development.</p></speech>

I wish to ask about the existence of the EU procurement directive.  I profess to be somewhat ignorant on this issue but I will seek the witnesses' guidance.  I understand that Article 20 of the directive allows for reserved contracts for certain types of entities.  I am speaking specifically about social enterprises or those people who operate within the disability sector.  My understanding is that this provision of the directive is not being operated in Ireland.  I am seeking some sort of appraisal or response from the witnesses from the OGP with regard to whether it is being operated.</p><p>If it is not possible to answer my question within the timeframe allocated to me today, could there be a report of some written correspondence to the committee about whether or not disability-focused organisations are being excluded from applying for reserved contracts?</p></speech>

The Irish regulations transpose faithfully the obligations under the procurement directive of 2014.  Article 20 will be transposed into Irish law.  Those facilities and the ability to use reserved contracts is there for public bodies to use.  Whether they are employing that or not, I have no substantial awareness of Article 20 being used by many public bodies, if any.  The OGP, in its frameworks, would not typically operate in that space so we have not deployed Article 20 provisions for reserved contracts.  We can provide information on the facility but the implementation of it would fall to individual public bodies, to decide to reserve specific contracts.  I am aware of one that was done but it was relatively small, where a local cleaning contract was reserved for local entities.  There could be many more examples of that practice but they have not come across my desk.</p></speech>

Is that the case?</p></speech>

The OGP could not make an arm's length decision for a public body about what mechanism they should use to procure services, nor would we.  We do not police the use of various different arrangements under public procurement law.</p></speech>

It is not a leading question but it would be worrying if we are not using reserved contracts to encourage certain categories of workers who are able to access them.  One would hope that the OGP would be as proactive as possible, especially in the disability sector and social enterprise.</p></speech>

They are closely aligned.  The directives have to be transposed into the relevant law of the country so minor changes would have to be made.  The main provisions are there within Irish law as they are in the directives.  The issue with the use of reserved contracts is that they are usually quite niche and targeted.  If one takes something like a cleaning service, that I just mentioned, a public body may want, for specific reasons, to deploy Article 20 and to use a reserved contract for something that it is trying to do.  I was aware of a large construction contract that used it because it wanted to use the local community for its site offices since it was a disadvantaged area.  That was an appropriate use of Article 20.  The issue with the scale at which the OGP operates is that our commercial cleaning framework is pitched at a different level and would encompass more than &euro;200 million in annual spending on cleaning services.  That is why there are certain things that can be done at a smaller, local scale and the mention of local authorities and local bodies is quite appropriate, where they would deploy such mechanisms.  It is not that we do not use them but that they would not be generally appropriate in what we do.</p></speech>

I want to highlight one area and ask the witnesses' views on it.  Some &euro;14 million was paid to Roqu for Chinese ventilators.  I understand that might have been done by the HSE.  The standard of the machine was not the standard specified by the HSE.  I understand that an internal audit was done.  How would lessons about procurement be fed back to the OGP to enhance risk assessment even in an emergency scenario?  I accept that this was done early in the pandemic but it was not done directly with the producer.  A third party was involved and there was a host of other issues.  How does that kind of issue feed into enhancing procurement and lessons learned?</p></speech>

It is not what we do on an ongoing basis, either centrally or through most public procurement.  At the time, the market forces were very different.  My strong recollection of where things where at that time was that there was a scramble, not only in Ireland but across the world, to procure necessary supplies, especially medical supplies such as PPE and ventilators.  The normal good functioning of public procurement, how it operates and due diligence would have to be examined as the balance of risk and speed were played out.  There will be lessons to learn about it.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General said that he would look specifically at this in a special report.  How would that feed in to lessons if there was a glaring case such as that?</p></speech>

Both the internal audit and the audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General will undoubtedly highlight issues.  That will highlight issues and feed into policy, how emergency procedures are conducted and what aspects and procedures need to be followed in all cases.</p></speech>

To say that two-stage tendering in and of itself is necessarily a bad approach would be incorrect and that there may be circumstances in which it does need to be used.  It may be really difficult to ascertain the full cost without doing certain works in advance, or certain designs.</p></speech>

It is very easy to say we spent 10% extra on a project, but the real question is why we spent 10% extra.  It is a matter of having the information associated with that.  Our experience of trying to derive that information in the past was that it is very difficult to derive because many issues play themselves out regarding responsibility for variances that arise in public works.

While I see the potential in such an office, I would have thought its remit would include all the things we have heard today that the OGP does not do, including providing direction on indemnification or in respect of assessing previous winners of State contracts for their carrying out of responsibilities in order that the office can advise other public bodies not to re-employ those who fail to live up to contracts or whatever.  I do not see any of that having been done.</p> <p>  My questions are specifically on the Covid-19 period.  I understand the OGP sits on a high-level task force and has a role advising the Government regarding procurement related to Covid-19.  This procurement has over the past year made heavy use of the negotiated procedure, which appears to be no procedure at all.  I seek clarification as to whether there is any obligation on the Government to publish contracts negotiated under this procedure, the timeframe for publication that is required and whether there are consequence if those timetables are not met,</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.161" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Moloney" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030200002#K01300"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  Before Mr. Quinn comes in on some of the operational aspects of that question, it is important to understand the role and nature of the Office of Government Procurement and the manner in which it has driven savings through the system.  Each Accounting Officer, that is, each person who is responsible for spending public money has complete responsibility for spending it.  The OGP in no sense comes in and takes over his or her responsibility and nor does it police the individual contracts.<br/><br/>There is a huge amount of information out there on the contracting bodies and it would be desirable to be able to access it but that is a huge undertaking.  In the national investment office, NIO, we have established a revised capital projects tracker under the spending review series.  We have looked at a huge number of different areas of expenditure.  We attempt to do a lot of <i>ex post</i>evaluation but, to be fair to the OGP and the people in it, they are in a position where their input is advisory and they help in driving a huge number of frameworks which Accounting Officers and organisations can make use of and a huge number of sourcing competitions, as we referred to in these statements.  It may seem the OGP does not do things one might have thought it would do but that is because the responsibility for the spending of money rests with Accounting Officers and contracting parties.  That is not to say we cannot improve it as we go along but it is important to know that.  I hand over to Mr. Quinn to deal with the remainder of the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

I appreciate there may be a desire for additional information to be gathered and that is a reasonable expectation.  However, we would have to invest in additional capability to make that happen.</p> <p>  Coming back to the question the Deputy asked regarding notices, in terms of the arrangements that people have made on an emergency basis, they are required to publish notices and to make those arrangements available to their internal audit bodies.  There is no obligation under public law at the moment for any public body to publish a contract in its entirety.</p></speech>

Mr. Quinn will be aware that the Department of Education used this negotiated procedure to procure the services of an individual vendor, which provided the basis of the leaving certificate for 60,000 students.  If those services were required again this year, would the OGP believe that the negotiated procedure would be appropriate in this instance, given that the Department has had a year to prepare?  Would the OGP believe the use of the same vendor would be appropriate, given the debacle that ensued last year?</p> <p>  We also had the issue of the negotiation process with the firm ViraPro, in relation to hand sanitisers.  A number of anomalies were found in respect of the procurement process there.  The frameworks in place are drawn up by either the OGP or its sister organisations in health, education, defence or local government.  Are they essentially paper-based exercises or do they fulfil a function in terms of ensuring that what is contracted is what is received?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.164" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Quinn" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030200002#K01600"><p>They are obviously not paper-based exercises because of the amount of money that flows through them.  People draw down services and goods through them all the time and in significant volumes.  It falls to the contracting authorities to manage those arrangements, to ensure they are getting what they paid for and to raise issues where they are not.</p> <p>  Coming back to the questions around the Department of Education and the ViraPro question, they are both matters for the Department of Education.  We set out in the documentation sent to the committee in advance that there are possibilities under the procurement law to exclude parties that have not performed in contracts.  To be reasonable to suppliers, however, that has to be proven and acted upon by the public bodies.  It cannot be on the basis of conjecture, statement or assertion.  People have to exert their rights and, once they do so, those parties can be excluded from further public procurement competitions in certain circumstances but they also have to be given the opportunity under law to self-clean.</p></speech>

People understand that a lot of the procurement rules had to be set aside due to the speed and nature of the pandemic.  We have been aware for six or seven months that vaccination centres would be needed and a number of organisations did offer their premises for use as vaccination centres.  In England and other countries, churches, cathedrals and various locations have been used as centres but not so in this country and these places were offered for use free of charge or just to cover costs.  Mr, Moloney has confirmed that his body has a seat on the high-level body that deals with this matter.  For example, the Protestant churches offered their venues.  Why was this offer not availed of?  There has been talk that these venues might not be suitable and hygiene has been mentioned.  Some community facilities would be of the same standard or maybe higher than some of the hotels and so on that are being used.  I want a straight answer as to why community and church facilities were not availed of.</p></speech>

I think we can all understand the complexity of rolling out vaccinations on the scale that we are planning to roll it out and the uncertainties about what the size and scale of vaccination centres should be, what the role of GPs and pharmacists would be, whether it was a one-jab or two-jab vaccination and how the ordering for vaccinations would affect the facilities required and where they would be required.  We have some sympathy with it being a very complex issue and I am sure the issue gets resolved in different ways in different contexts.</p></speech>

I understand that the Pfizer vaccine must be stored below minus 70&deg; Celsius but it is being brought to centres that do not have a cold storage facility and used within a few hours.  All of the other vaccines can be used at the typical kitchen fridge temperature, so a standard fridge will be used to store them.  I do not see the complexity.  I have seen some of these venues that are being used and the cubicles being constructed.  They could be constructed in five or six halls, within a stone's throw of the house where I live in Portlaoise, that are not being used and it is the same in County Offaly and other counties.  Many venues have been offered and are available.  For example, school halls have been available, community facilities that are closed up and churches.  We have not heard a credible explanation from anybody to date.  Mr. Moloney mentioned the complexity but I do not see the matter as being that complex.  Without trying to simplify things, if a venue is large enough, has parking facilities, and all of these places have huge parking facilities, and one can store the vaccine then I cannot see why the very same cubicles cannot be put in the same as they were in Cork City Hall.</p> <p>  I want to discuss the nature of the contract and two tenders for the national children's hospital, which have caused a lot of problems.  We have had representatives of the hospital in here.  For example, there are almost 700 of what is termed hearings between the contractor, BAM, and the body that has been set up to arbitrate on this, the employers' group.  I take no pleasure from saying the following.  I am more concerned since the day of that meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts than beforehand in terms of what is happening with the hospital.  If the tender was being rolled out again, would Mr. Moloney avoid the two-tier or two contract nature of the project or would he strongly advise, in his role as the Office of Government Procurement, that it would be avoided in the future?</p></speech>

The issues around the national children's hospital, as we are all aware, are very significant.  There have been many issues around it.  One of the issues is around how well defined the project was to begin with and, subsequent to changes in the definition of the project, one of the things that we have done, under the public spending code, is we have tried to bring much more clarity to those initial gates of decisions leading up to the tender process.  I think that that is one of the major learnings from the national children's hospital and all that went on there.</p> <p>  As the chief procurement officer said earlier, there are circumstances where a two-stage procurement process may be advisable and, in particular, those circumstances might be where it is simply not possible to know how one wants to finally secure what one wants to secure without engaging in a first-stage process.  </p></speech>

It is a fact that there are up to 700 of what were described, here in this room, as hearings by the witnesses from the national children's hospital board and the Department of Health.  Does that not tell us that the nature of that contract is substantially flawed?</p></speech>

One of things around the national children's hospital contract is that we realise that there are a lot of lessons to be learned about the management of bespoke megaprojects.  That is something that we are trying to absorb into our public spending code, into our processes, into the various gates that we have set out within that for public procurement and, in particular, for projects over &euro;100 million.  In fact the Minister is going to Government today with a set of proposals to strengthen assurance and to bring in greater expertise in relation to those megaprojects.  So, we agree that there are considerable lessons to be learned and we are trying to do that.</p></speech>

My final questions concern social and environmental clauses in terms of public procurement.  How much leeway have we about including these clauses in terms of EU Single Market rules?</p> <p>  We have had some discussion on the environmental and green elements that are being incorporated into contracts but very little discussion on the social element.  As a public representative, workers who are working on small and large projects that are part of Government or State contracts have complained to me that they are not receiving the proper rate for the job and do not get an overtime payment or proper holiday pay.  Some of these workers are on bogus self-employment even though they are employers or employees.  They have asked me why has all of this has happened when it is a public contract.  Have we been weak in terms of doing that?  Have we less control in terms of putting in the workers' rights element?  For example, the need for more apprenticeships, ensuring that they are targeted at disadvantaged groups, ensuring that the rate for the job is paid in terms of the established trade rates, ensuring that there is proper holiday pay and ensuring that there is no bogus self-employment.  What is the situation?  Why is this going on?  This situation has pertained for as long as I have been around and has gone on for years.</p></speech>

They require people to keep records of how they have paid people, who they have employed so they are fundamental requirements of public contracts.  Again, the enforcement of that is essentially through complaints to the contracting authority or to the WRC.  So, again, those cases would be taken in that way.  We would not have visibility on them necessarily here.</p> <p>  On the range of other issues that the Chairman has raised, there is some limited flexibility within the EU procurement frameworks in relation to social clauses and environmental clauses.  Mr. Quinn has already pointed to some instances where green environmental issues have been taken on board.  To the extent that they are taken on board, it is really the contracting authority that has to decide to do that.  Perhaps that will change over the next three years as we roll out and implement the programme for Government commitments and take on board Government policy, including the new climate action plan.  </p></speech>

Is he saying that the contracted body, be it a Department or State agency, has the power to say to a contractor that has the contract for a particular project that it must do X, Y and Z when it comes to working conditions?  Is that correct, "Yes" or "No"?</p></speech>

Mr. Moloney said the office did a review of the two-tender process.  Did that review conclude that it cost more as a consequence or was that a contributory factor?  We were told there could not be another competitive process for the second part, which was largely building the hospital, because it would elongate the building of the hospital and consequently, we got tied in.  Did he conclude that it cost more as a consequence of that?  What was the finding?</p></speech>

There is quite a range of factors in there that created the situation where there was cost escalation.  There has been no finding that the use of the two-stage process alone caused the escalation in respect of costs.  There is no specific finding that that has been a specific driver of cost escalation.</p></speech>

Mr. Quinn is saying it is appropriate to use these two-stage processes but we could not do a second competitive tender so how would he know that?</p></speech>

As the Secretary General said, the use of two-stage projects can arise for various reasons.  In that case, meeting the timeline was an enormous contributor to the use of the two-stage arrangement.  There may be other situations.  For example, if works are being done at an historic site, the use of a two-stage contract would be absolutely necessary in circumstances where one may not be in a position to foresee what might be under the ground when digging starts on an historic site.  There may be cases where there is a need to run two-stage processes because one may not always have the time to do a specific set of preliminary works, pause while a tender is run and then proceed with a second tender.</p></speech>

First, does the Office of Government Procurement procure all services for the State?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Quinn" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021030200002#M01000"><p>I cannot say all services.  The OGP was set up to procure common services, whether that is ICT, cleaning or security services, vehicle servicing and all that kind of stuff.  It is common stuff but, typically, extraordinary stuff would be left to individual public bodies.</p></speech>

Do we procure that work or are they just the go-to people?  Does the OGP have any role in that?</p></speech>

That may be one that the NTMA has done itself and not through our office, to my knowledge.  As we have so many contracting bodies out there and run thousands of procurements I do not see them all but to my knowledge, we do not.  That would be an important enough one that it would come across my desk in terms of something we were doing, so to my knowledge no, we do not.</p></speech>

Obviously, there have been some developments today on stockbroking nationally with the Central Bank applying fines and so on.  If we are in a contract with Davy, what options have we got to sever such contracts or examine the implications of what occurred today?  Mr. Quinn might drop us a note on that.</p> <p>  Second, is there anything in European law or Irish law which insists upon us awarding tenders to people or giving fair consideration for tenders from organisations or companies that have a track record of litigation against the State in previous contracts?</p></speech>

I do not think people exerting what they might see as their legal rights through the courts could be seen as a reason to exclude them.  There are no specific provisions in European law that would exclude people who may take a case against the State.</p></speech>

The question was if there is anything forcing us to consider them.  I have made the point, and I might be over-simplistic, that if somebody builds me a house and sues me after the fact I am unlikely to use that builder for my next house.  We have had situations where people with that sort of track record in taking litigation against the State - actions against the State on previous contracts - have then been awarded further contracts.  While I appreciate the individual's rights I am interested in our rights as a State.  Are we allowed use our own common sense and experience to acknowledge and take into account that somebody has a track record of going legal?</p></speech>

That would be helpful because it has come up time and again with various bodies and Departments.  I understand some of them are necessary but with regard to others it is a bone of contention, particularly for suppliers who, when they see something up on eTenders and they are not successful, find that something has not even been tendered.  It is important for me and, presumably, the witnesses, that we see that good processes are followed to ensure that there is a competitive nature in all tenders.</p></speech>

I have a question and a "Yes" or "No" answer will do.  Last March and April, when there was an understandable panic in trying to get personal protective equipment into the country, something that stood out was that we did not have a native supply.  We did not even have a supply within Europe.  There was a worldwide shortage.  I understand that some companies in the country are now producing personal protective equipment and this is good.  Are there mechanisms to give them an edge with a native contract in terms of ensuring security of supply?  We had a problem with flying cargo on passenger planes from China, which is not the best way to do things.  It was the best that could be done in the circumstances and ten out of ten to everybody involved.  Is there a mechanism whereby we can try to retain the native suppliers and encourage this?  Perhaps Mr. Moloney might answer this.</p></speech>

The Minister and the Minister of State are here to update the committee on the safe and sustainable reopening of schools, plans for the 2021 junior certificate, leaving certificate and applied leaving certificate and the implementation of the key recommendations in the joint committee report, The Impact of Covid-19 on Primary and Secondary Education.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that both the Minister and the Minister of State will be invited to make an opening statement followed by questions from committee members.  The committee will publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.  The Minister will have five minutes followed by the Minister of State who will have three minutes.  The questioners will have six minutes per question, including the replies.  I ask members to discontinue after six minutes.  </p> <p>   Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks by the Chair.  It is imperative that they comply with all such directions.  </p> <p>  Before I call the Minister to make her opening statement, I note we have a number of officials present.  I ask that they only respond to a technical point of information when necessary because this meeting is only of two hours' duration.  I ask officials not to comment on Government policy as they are not witnesses before the committee.  I call the Minister for five minutes followed by the Minister of State for three minutes. </p></speech>

As the Chair has outlined, I will share my time with the Minister of State.  We are joined by a number of departmental officials.  With me in Kildare House are Mr. Dalton Tattan, Ms Aoife Conduit, Ms Yvonne Keating, Ms Anne Tansey and Mr. Neville Kenny while, remotely, Ms Deirdre Shanley, Ms Martina Mannion and Mr. Hubert Loftus are joining us from Athlone and Tullamore .</p> <p>  The committee in its invitation has set out an ambitious list of topics to discuss today, many of which have seen considerable developments in recent weeks.  These include the return of students to in-person learning as well as arrangements for the State examinations in 2021.  As Deputies and Senators know, yesterday saw the return of approximately 320,000 students to their classrooms, 60,000 of whom are the leaving certificate class of 2021, and approximately 260,000 in the first four years of primary school.  This was a hugely positive day for many students, their families and school staff and one which has been much anticipated.  Importantly, yesterday also saw special schools return to full in-class provision having operated on the basis of 50% attendance since 11 February.  In addition, special classes at primary and post-primary level have been operating at full capacity since 22 February. </p> <p>  Over the next number of weeks, we hope to see even more students return to school, including 260,000 primary school students in the more senior classes on 15 March together with fifth year students at post-primary level.  Subject to continued progress in maintaining reduced community transmission levels, the remaining post-primary students will return to school on 12 April following the traditional Easter break.  </p> <p>  We have made progress over recent weeks in returning to classrooms.  The phased approach, which has been building on the earlier phases when special schools and special classes reopened, has been possible with the progress made across communities in bringing the community transmission levels of Covid-19 down.  We certainly need to maintain our efforts to contain the virus and I welcome the deputy chief medical officer, CMO's, advice to school communities and, more generally, that we must maintain our vigilance so that we can get all of our students back to in-school person provision.  </p> <p>  Yesterday saw the return of the leaving certificate year students to their classrooms.  They return with the clarity and choice that the recent Government decision on the approach to be taken to their leaving certificate examination provided.  The work undertaken by the members of the advisory group on the State examinations in the lead-up to the Government decision was very beneficial in ensuring all voices could be heard and could input into the deliberations.  The work in ensuring that students can choose to sit an examination, or avail of an accredited grade, continues intensively within my Department and the State Examinations Commission, SEC, and will involve continued engagement with the education partners.</p> <p>  Deputies and Senators will be aware that a document entitled, A Guide to State Examinations and Accredited Grades for Leaving Certificate 2021, was issued by my Department last week and it provides a useful outline to students, their families and schools as to how the examination process and the accredited grades process will work.  There will be significant further information and guidance issued to students and schools over the coming weeks.</p> <p>  There are differences to the arrangements in 2021 when compared to last year.  A full suite of examinations operated by the SEC will be run, starting with the oral and practical components in the coming weeks, subject to prevailing public health advice.  The examinations will take place in line with their traditional June timetable and that timetable has been published.  In addition, the accredited grades system this year will be ultimately completed by the SEC with my Department carrying out the preliminary stages of the work pending necessary legislative amendments.  I intend to bring proposals for relevant legislative amendments to Cabinet shortly and to seek to have the relevant provisions drafted as a priority.  I will also seek the assistance of this committee in ensuring the relevant Bill can progress through the required legislative Stages as expeditiously as possible.  </p> <p>  Across both Houses, I am sure we are united in the view that we want to see our leaving certificate class of 2021 progress to the next stage of their lives in as normal a fashion as possible, acknowledging the challenges that they and the education system as a whole have faced.  </p> <p>  The third principal area that the committee had highlighted for discussion today was in its report, The Impact of Covid-19 on Primary and Secondary Education.  I have read the report, including its recommendations, and to highlight the pace at which events have unfolded since the report was published in January, many of the recommendations in regard to the reopening of schools or the leaving certificate have been, or are being, addressed.  We are also making progress in the other areas which the report focussed on and I am happy to provide any updates on the recommendations committee members may wish to discuss as we work through the session.</p> <p>  Finally, I acknowledge the work undertaken across school communities in recent weeks and particularly in the lead-up to yesterday in ensuring many students are now back in their classrooms with their teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and support staff.  I look forward to seeing all students back in their classrooms over the coming weeks.  I invite the Minister of State to address the committee.</p></speech>

Mar is eol d&uacute;inn, t&aacute; Seachtain na Gaeilge faoi l&aacute;n seoil agus ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id &aacute;r dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire.  B&iacute;mis br&oacute;d&uacute;il as &aacute;r dteanga dh&uacute;chais agus &uacute;s&aacute;idimis &iacute; chomh minic agus is f&eacute;idir.</p> <p>  We have seen the challenges faced by students, staff and families in recent weeks.  I recognise the work of all these groups in dealing with the difficulties created by Covid-19.  Our education system, as we know, is built on partnership and when everyone works together then all obstacles can be overcome.</p><p>It is well established that remote learning is particularly challenging for students with additional needs and there is a risk of regression and loss of key skills.  While additional supports can make a difference, nothing will replace the effectiveness of in-person, in-school education.  It was for this reason the Government was determined that special education would be given priority in terms of support and school reopening.</p><p> Special schools were prioritised to reopen on 11 February on a 50% attendance basis.  All special classes returned to in-school learning on a full-time basis from 22 February.  Special schools returned to full-time in-school education yesterday, 1 March.  It was a significant and welcome development which saw more than one third of primary schools and one quarter of post-primary schools open for children with special education needs in special classes, in advance of any return to mainstream education.</p><p> As part of the living with Covid-19 plan, NPHET has recommended a phased and cautious return to school over the coming weeks.  Work will continue to ensure that all students with special education needs in mainstream school can return to the classroom.  It is essential that as a society we continue to make progress in curbing the spread of the disease to allow all of our children to return to school as quickly as possible.  The whole school community is working, including updated public health guidance and a framework document which outlines temporary time bound staffing arrangements, the application of substitution arrangements, time bound temporary arrangements for pupil attendance, information on school transport options, childcare provision and other matters.</p><p> The Minister, Deputy Foley, all in government, our officials and I are aware the return to classrooms for students with additional needs and their families is much more than just a return to learning.  We are aware that some families and school staff still have concerns about the return.  All of the decisions made by Government over the past year have been about meeting the twin aims of protecting public health and delivering essential services such as education in the most appropriate way for all students.  In politics, we may not always agree but I know all committee members are united in wanting to see our country emerge from Covid-19 restrictions successfully and as soon as possible.</p><p> In recognising that pupils with additional needs can find it harder to engage in remote learning, the Department has also put in place a supplementary support scheme to provide for some home based one-to-one support for such pupils.  The supplementary programme for eligible pupils in third to sixth class will be extended by a further two weeks or an additional ten hours.  Schools have been asked to prioritise deployment of their special education teaching, SET, resources to facilitate the engagement of pupils with special education needs, SEN, in third to sixth class.  This will necessitate further collaboration between the special education teachers, SETs, and class teachers to establish current priority learning needs among those pupils.</p><p> I am determined to ensure an enhanced summer programme for children with special educational needs in summer 2021, as successfully happened last year.  This programme provided a strong foundation to support students in advance of their return to in-school learning in September 2020 following the long summer break.  It also allowed schools and staff to identify and address educational regression in students so as to make the transition back to school easier for these students and their families.</p><p> Since my appointment, we have successfully run that expanded summer provision programme, secured a record &euro;2 billion budget for special education, opened a new special school, provided the resources for the creation of 1,200 additional special class places next year and worked to put special education first as part of school reopening.  We know that challenges remain and I am determined to tackle these.  As I said, I am happy to be here today to engage with the committee, to hear its perspectives on those issues and provide updates or further information where we can.</p></speech>

One of the key concerns for school staff is that if a Covid-19 case arises, it be dealt with swiftly and decisively and that we rid the school of it as quickly as possibly.  Significantly scaling up testing and tracing is crucial to that.  I refer to a specific element of that.  I noted in an article in yesterday's<i>The Irish Times</i>that an expert group reporting to NPHET is likely to recommend the use of antigen testing in school settings, which would be complementary to PCR and not a substitute for it.  Has the Department considered what role antigen testing can play in schools in making them as safe as possible?  If NPHET recommends its use, on foot of the expert report, will antigen testing be used in schools?</p></speech>

At present, antigen testing has not been recommended.  The Deputy will be aware there are mixed views on antigen testing.  However, I am conscious there is an expert group under the leadership of Professor Mark Ferguson of Science Foundation Ireland conducting-----</p></speech>

The report is due for completion sometime this month.  Certainly, we will utilise antigen testing if NPHET recommends it.  We have been flexible and resilient in terms of introducing in schools any measures requested from a public health point of view.  We have introduced them at different stages throughout the reopening of schools and we would do that going forward.</p></speech>

I ask that the Minister of State answers as briefly as possible.  Parents of children with additional educational needs in mainstream feel they have been forgotten by the Department.  At a previous meeting, I said that Sinn F&eacute;in wanted a phased return and special education should be the number one priority.  That seemed to be the view of the Department, despite the difficulties.  However, from the Minister of State's statement, and from what is happening, those children do not seem to be a priority.  There does not seem to be any mention of priority for children with additional needs in secondary schools.  Does the Minister of State think it is right that a student in first or second year with additional needs would have to wait until 12 April, almost six weeks from now, before they can get back into the classroom?  There must be some way to get them in-school support in advance of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.232" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021030200002#B00800"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire might be aware that approximately 1.5% of children internationally have special education needs, SEN.  It is the same in Ireland.  They are the children with the most complex needs.  Approximately 8,500 children with special education needs, SEN, are in primary school and approximately 4,500 of those are back.  Approximately 4,000 who are in third to sixth class are not yet back.  As I said in my opening statement, special education teaching, SET, is prioritising the children in those years.</p> <p>  Other children with special education needs, SEN, with less complicated needs, are integrated into a mainstream class.  Many of them are high impact, low incidence, such as dyslexia.  They were never envisaged as the first cohort, as a priority, as they are well integrated into mainstream.</p><p>According to the Department and following agreement with education stakeholders, part of the rationale for that is that it is in the best interests of these children to come back as part of mainstream because they are so well integrated into mainstreams.  There are approximately 10,000 children with SENs who will return to full classes in due course with all other students.  The other rationale, of course, is the cautious phased approach that NPHET has recommended.  It remains my absolute intention for all children with SENs to get back to school as soon as possible.  We have the supplementary programme, which I have mentioned, to support these children in the interim and we have extended the supplementary programme for a further two weeks for children in third to sixth classes.</p></speech>

I do not agree with her.  I understand the point she is making, but these children have additional needs and remote learning is very challenging for them.  It is a pity that they have had to wait so long.  Some of them have to wait for six weeks.</p> <p>  My final question is for the Minister, Deputy Foley.  There are many issues still to be resolved with the leaving certificate.  Clarity is needed on course work, mock examinations and music practicals.  One thing I cannot understand is if students who decide to sit the exam are, for whatever reason, unable to do so, they will not get a second chance even though the availability of a paper B in the case of illness or bereavement has been built into the system for many years.  I do not understand that decision.  I refer to replies received to parliamentary questions.  Is it the case that, for example, if Cork or Kildare goes into a localised county lockdown in June, all students in the affected county would lose the option of sitting a written exam?  That seems to me to be removing the choice from students.  If they follow public health advice in the context of having to self-isolate or a localised lockdown, they will not have the chance to sit the exams for which they prepared so hard.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that decision.  Can she confirm whether students will be given a second chance to sit the written exams in the case of a localised county level 5 lockdown?</p></speech>

I ask the Deputy to allow the Minister to briefly reply.  If she has further information, she can send it to the committee secretariat and it will be forwarded to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.</p></speech>

On the issue of what is being provided for students, as we are currently in the midst of a pandemic, they were given the opportunity to choose the calculated grades process and, in addition, to sit the written exams in June with all that entails if they so wish.  Those are the two options that are being provided for students.  In the midst of a pandemic, it is a fair option.  It allows students the opportunity to choose one or both and it makes provision from a public health point of view as well in terms of what may happen going forward.</p></speech>

I particularly welcome the officials from Athlone, Tullamore and Dublin.  T&aacute; comhghairdeas tuillte ag gach duine because it is a significant achievement to have schools reopening again, particularly when we have got through such a difficult time in recent weeks and months.  We are here today to speak in particular about the reopening of schools and that being done in a safe and sustainable manner.  It is great to see that special schools are reopening at full capacity this week and that junior infants, senior infants, first classes and second classes have come back at primary school level.  A clear map has been provided.  An outline has been issued whereby students will return to school on 8 March, 15 March, 29 March and 12 April, by which stage all students will have fully returned to school.  That is a provisional schedule which depends on good public health guidelines being maintained and the numbers coming down.  I am very happy to see that leaving certificate students will have the option to sit exams or get accredited grades.</p> <p>  I am very happy that the supplementary programme has been extended by ten hours.  I welcome the commitment to the summer provision programme.</p> <p>  I spoke to the principals of several secondary schools last week.  One of them in particular acknowledged the ease with which students returned to school and acknowledged the work that has been done by the Departments, the Minister, the Minster of State and their teams, in conjunction with principals and parents, to facilitate that.</p> <p>  Is there potential for first year students to take part in a one-week or two-week introduction to school programme during the summer?  First year students have not had the opportunities that students would normally have in terms of exploring their schools.  I know that several secondary schools are running such a programme at the moment.   Perhaps that could be considered under the heading of inclusion.  It would also be of assistance on the counselling side of things for first years coming into school.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for the Minister, Deputy Foley.  Does she have any update for schools in respect of air monitors and meters?  On leaving certificate reform, is there any update on the senior cycle review advisory report?  We have a great opportunity to consider the review of the leaving certificate and, potentially, ways to use continuous assessment to better effect. </p> <p>  Finally, I was very fortunate to have an opportunity yesterday to raise the issue of a school in my local area.  I represent Roscommon and Galway.  I refer to the DEIS band 1 school in Ballinasloe, which does not meet the current requirements in terms of classroom space and size.  The school is awaiting a new school building.  Will school building projects be accelerated?  If schools cannot currently maintain physical distancing, how are they going to go forward?</p> <p>  I thank our guests for their time and say "well done" to them on the roll-out to date.</p></speech>

In terms of air monitors and the whole question of ventilation and so on, significant guidance was issued to schools when they returned in September.  Updated guidance was provided at the end of November or in early December.  As I stated, there was significant review of all mitigation measures pertaining to schools in advance of the recent return to school.  The advice under the current approved guidelines is that windows should be open before class and at the end of class and, at a minimum, during class.  At very best, school staff should use their best experience.  Having worked in classrooms, I am conscious that there is excellent expertise available within schools in that regard.  However, I acknowledge that a high-level advisory expert group is looking at areas of ventilation not just within the school setting, but in other settings as well.  It is due to make its findings known in the not-too-distant future.  If there is a specific recommendation for any new or additional mitigation measures, then we will certainly adapt, as we always have, in the context of any new issues or new measures that we are asked to put in place.</p> <p>  On the senior cycle review, to the best of my information, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is currently finalising its report.  I look forward to the report insofar as it is likely to form the basis for further discussion, as well as, ultimately, for decision making.  The Senator is correct that there is a new light shining on the senior cycle, given the current environment in which we are living.  I await that report.  </p> <p>  On the specific issue she raised of a DEIS band 1 school in her constituency and the schools building programme, we are progressing apace with the school building programme.   Even in the midst of the pandemic, we are looking forward to the completion of more than 200 building projects this year.  We anticipate the commencement of at least 145 projects in June or July.  We are continuing apace with what is a very important programme within the Department.  The building programme is required to meet the needs of school communities.</p></speech>

I have a query on a programme that might potentially be one for the summertime.</p> <p>  I have one final comment on the Central Applications Office system.  We are putting in programmes to support students who are applying to the CAO.  Engagement with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will be crucial, especially if we are going to look at spaces.  I understand there has been an increase of over 6,700 applications in the CAO programme this year.</p></speech>

Approximately 14,000 took up summer provision last summer.  It was expanded to Down's syndrome children, post primary and preschool.  Work is ongoing for this summer and we are looking to expand it further.  I am working with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, on the other matter.</p></speech>

I will break my contribution in two pieces.  One is for the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and the other for the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for giving clarity on the choice to leaving certificate students.  It is something we all sought and spoke about within the committee confines.  We sent a request to the Minister indicating that was what was needed.  The outcome is much appreciated, taking on board the views of everyone involved within the education world.  It is certainly the best possible solution.</p> <p>  I am glad that the roadmap to schools fully reopening has started.  I have a slight concern for those between first and third years in secondary school because it is still over a month before they will have the opportunity to return to school.  Will the Minister look at those who cannot sit the junior certificate this year and who will be going into a transition year programme?  I think the transition year programme will need to be looked at for the next school year in terms of a little catch-up with the world of academia.  The Minister might comment on that.</p> <p>  I have some concern for those children who come from more vulnerable backgrounds.  We need to support them in transitioning back into school.  I know in some cases they have not really transitioned from September to Christmas.  I know the Minister is looking at advancing DEIS supports and the school completion programme, which is important work.  I am glad that has come back to the Department of Education.  The Minister might comment on that.</p> <p>  The committee is examining the issue of school bullying and the impact on mental health.  Does the Minister have comments on that?  That comes back to mental health supports for students, especially for those coming back into school having had difficult experiences because of bereavement through Covid-19 or having had to mind siblings when parents were working, etc.</p> <p>  My last point relates to the schools building programme.  I am delighted to see so much progress.  I am glad one of the schools to benefit will be St. Paul's Secondary School in Monasterevin.  As the Minister knows, I always take the opportunity to ask about the new build that is badly needed at secondary level in the Newbridge and Kildare areas.  They are the particular points I wish to raise.  The Minister said there would be a review of the school transport scheme.  Any update on that from the Minister would be welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021030200002#D00600"><p>In the first instance, I will address the question on students from first year to third year.  In the broader mix, and with the best will in the world, I would love to have all students back in one go, but that is not possible in the current circumstances living with Covid-19.  The recommendation based on the expert advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team is that we would take what the deputy chief medical officer has called a cautious and phased approach to reopening our schools.  For this reason, we are limited to the manner in which we have reopened the schools.  We are hopeful that community transmission can be kept under control.  I acknowledge that there is a burden of responsibility on all of us within the community to ensure we progress positively.  If we continue to progress positively, we will see the successful reopening on the other dates, including 15 March and 12 April, respectively.</p> <p>  The Senator referenced the transition year programme.  I acknowledge that reconfigured or new guidelines issued this year for the transition year programme and how it could operate in our schools.  We will be cognisant of the need to look at specific programmes like that.  We will be cognisant of the need for measures to make time for learning that has been lost.  All of that will come in due course.</p> <p>  I was asked about DEIS supports and supports for children with particular challenges in that respect.  I am conscious of that and of the importance of supporting children who experience disadvantage.  A total of 887 schools are in the DEIS programme and they cater to more than 185,000 students.  Committee members may be aware that we made an announcement on the 1-point reduction in class size in urban DEIS band 1 primary schools.  Reference was made to the school completion programme.  We have looked at introducing measures whereby we can now extend the school completion programme to include 14 urban primary and 14 post-primary DEIS schools.  There is also a 5% increase in funding for school completion programmes.</p> <p>  From the point of view of educational disadvantage, we have introduced a measure to reduce enrolment in DEIS post-primary schools from 700 to 600.  This would allow for qualification for an additional deputy principal within those schools.</p> <p>  Tied up with that is the reference made to well-being, which is highly important in the education sector.  We have a strong well-being policy in the Department.  In our most recent budget we made funding available for an additional 110 guidance counsellors and 17 additional National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists.  I confirm that NEPS is continuing to work on a parallel basis with schools.  In addition to its online work, on-site visits have commenced as well.  We are conscious that in the context of well-being at the start of the year a strong emphasis was placed on the return to school and how it would affect the well-being of students as they returned.  That continues as students return.  Throughout the entire school year, there is a strong focus on well-being from that point of view.</p></speech>

It is welcome that we have choice available now.  I know it has not been easy so it is important for all of us to recognise the amount of work that has gone into that.  Obviously, there are still questions outstanding in respect of out-of-school learners.  I know that is something the ISSU would like to have clarity around.  Some students may be unable to sit an examination because of the pandemic.  What is the impact on them?  Others do not have access to continuous assessment.  The Minister might outline if she knows at this stage what will happen in that respect.</p><p>Obviously, they need to make sure that they have a qualification at the end.</p><p> Those who might leave school after the junior certificate traditionally tended to go into apprenticeships.  If the junior certificate will not go ahead, what facilities are being put in place to ensure that those students meet the criteria for these apprenticeship programmes that previously would have required the student to attain certain levels of grades in order to progress to other programmes?</p><p> I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Foley, on her recent announcement about DEIS urban band 1 schools.  I, along with every committee member, made representations for that class size reduction in primary, secondary and vertical schools.  The move is very welcome.  While my constituency might not have DEIS urban band 1 schools, there is still an amount of disadvantage there.  We are going to potentially see an expanding divide.  As Senator O'Loughlin outlined, those children from first year to third and fourth year will have been out of school for a significant amount of time.  There are children with disadvantage across all schools.  Will we be looking at increasing home school liaison, for instance, in order to make sure that over the coming years that the disadvantage these children may be feeling now does not become a problem as they approach the junior and leaving certificates?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021030200002#E00200"><p>I endorse the Senator's remarks about ISSU, the Irish Second-Level Students Union.  It continues to be a positive contributor to the advisory group.  I acknowledge the role of students, as well as all the partners in education, who sat around the table and gave many long hours and days.  They gave so much of their own time, whether they were representatives of parents, teachers, students, managerial bodies or SNAs.</p> <p>  There will certainly be an accommodation for out-of-school learners.  A process is being developed with regards to giving access to them to the absolutely maximum extent possible.  That was an issue last year but we are most determined that measures will be put in place to accommodate them.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, due to the fact that exams would have to be run in parallel, from a public health point of view, it would not have been possible to run both junior certificate and leaving certificate exams at the one time.  What will prevail this year will be exactly the same as last year.  Students will receive a certification of completion from the Department.  There will also be assessments run in the schools prior to that. </p> <p>  We will also be fixing our attention on how adult learners and early school-leavers could be accommodated later in the school year, should they wish to avail of an examination.  That would be for later in the year, however.</p> <p>  I am conscious of the points raised by the Senator on DEIS.  The Department is intent on putting particular emphasis on DEIS, notwithstanding the announcement we made yesterday on the pupil-teacher ratio, school completion programmes and staffing in DEIS schools.  On the point of time lost, it is also my intention that we would, like last year, have an enhanced summer programme for numeracy and literacy.  I am looking very much to doing that this summer.  It is an area in which we will continue to work and focus on in the Department.  We will look at all measures, including the Senator's point about home school liaison officers, that might need to be incorporated going forward.</p></speech>

Does that mean there might be negative consequences for those children with special needs who are back at school?  When she says "prioritise", does she mean that there will be a lessening of the availability of special education teaching resources to those children from junior infants to second class who are actually back at school?</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Foley, referred to the fact that legislation will be needed to achieve the accredited grade systems completion by the State Examinations Commission.  What exactly is it that requires legislative change?  While I understand the Minister's desire to have it all put through as expeditiously as possible, there is frustration in the Oireachtas about the lack of time made available to the D&aacute;il and Seanad to properly scrutinise legislation.  Will she guarantee that this legislation will be before the Oireachtas in time for us to have proper debate and scrutiny, not all Stages in one day and that kind of thing which does not inspire confidence in the political system?</p></speech>

Obviously, we have to trust schools to best manage their special educational teaching resources.  In the budget, we got 235 extra new teachers for special classes, 23 special school teachers and 145 special education teachers.  There are now 18,000 special needs assistants.  There are enough resources there for the schools to be able to manage and prioritise those children from third to sixth class who are not yet back in school, as well as looking after the children with special needs who are back in school.</p></speech>

This year it is our intention that the calculated grades process will be overseen by the State Examinations Commission and, henceforth, it would be known as the State Examinations Commission accredited grade.  To make that possible, it is necessary for legislation to provide that oversight from the commission.  The legislation will also deal with other issues like, for example, a provision for teacher indemnity.  It will include provisions to prohibit the canvassing of teachers during their work with the accredited grades process.  It will not be problematic legislation.  The Senator would be more expert on that but it is really just to tie up these specific issues.</p></speech>

I know there is a difference in the process in that the State Examinations Commission will be finalising the grades.</p><p>We are using a system this year that will give students the option of taking whichever is the best between their accredited grades and leaving certificate grades in any given subject.  Is it reasonable to believe that the accredited grades will be lower than the leaving certificate grades in reality?  Will this system reassure students and inspire in them confidence in the quality of their eventual grading?  Giving students the best of both worlds sounds good, but will people have confidence in leaving certificate qualifications if accredited grades can trump them?</p></speech>

The Senator is correct, in that students will have the opportunity to avail of one or both.  A slight difference from last year is that the portal that students use to opt into the calculated grades process will open much earlier this year during the week of 8 March, thereby affording them the opportunity to choose one or both processes.  There will be another opportunity in April, at a date yet to be confirmed, to revise their choices if they so wish.</p> <p>  It is my preference and determination to encourage as many students as possible to take the written examinations in June.  By having the chance to avail of both options, they will be able to make the best of their opportunities and situations.  That will be a positive step forward.  Given that we are in a pandemic, it is only right and proper that students be afforded the choice.</p> <p>  There is no valuing of one process over the other.  When they receive their leaving certificate results, there will be just one set of results and it will not stipulate whether they came from calculated grades or written examinations.  They will be of equal measure, which is only right and fair, given that these provisions are being made in acknowledgement of the loss of in-person learning of five months last year and two months this year.  The two processes carry equal weight.</p></speech>

We had a long discussion about passing the pupil-teacher ratio reduction on to DEIS schools.  That was announced.  We asked that the Minister waive the leaving certificate fee.  That has been done.  We asked that school profiling not form part of this year's calculated grading system.  The Minister has ensured that.  We also asked that she provide guidance for second level schools in advance of their return in order to deal with the issue of mock examinations.  That has been done as well.  It is only fair to put on the record the Minister's delivery of measures that were called for.</p> <p>  The students returning to school have lost out on in-class teaching.  It is important to emphasise the phrase "in-class teaching", given that teaching has been ongoing, albeit remotely, which has its own difficulties.  Will the Minister speak about the Department's analysis of the effects of this loss on children?  What scientific research has the Department undertaken to ascertain what damage has been done to children by not having in-class learning?  As a result of that analysis, what supports does the Department believe need to be put in place?  I do not necessarily want to talk about a feeling the Department has.  Rather, I want to hear about actual analysis that has been undertaken.</p></speech>

I also appreciate his commentary on in-school and remote teaching and learning.  It is important to acknowledge that remote teaching and learning have been ongoing while it has not been possible for all students to attend school in person, notwithstanding the fact that it is the best experience for all concerned that this teaching and learning be done in schools in person.</p> <p>  Regarding the monitoring of how students have experienced the loss of in-person learning, we have direct evidence showing that the provision of remote teaching and learning has been more successful on this occasion than previously.  Significant guidance was made available in advance and considerable work was done in schools to prepare.  While all of that was positive, I recognise the Deputy's points.  My Department's inspectorate has monitored educational provision by schools in both the remote and on-site schooling contexts.  The research carried out by the inspectorate has captured a range of perspectives, including those of principals, teachers, parents and students, on how schools have operated, the teaching and learning being done, pupils' experience of school and their engagement with learning and so on.  The research includes surveys of different stakeholders, discussions with school principals and inspectors meeting a variety of student and parent focus groups.  A number of reports on the research have been published on the Department's website and more publications on foot of further research are expected in the near future.</p> <p>  We are conscious that we are still in a learning process in terms of how students have fared in the current circumstances.  As a consequence of that, we will put suitable measures in place accordingly.</p></speech>

In the UK, there is a &pound;1 billion catch-up fund for children and young people.  Is it the Minister's intention to advocate for a fund that would do some of the work to help children who have been damaged - I use that word, but another term would be "negatively affected" - by the lack of in-class teaching to catch up?  Can we expect a catch-up fund from the Department to finance the repair of the damage that has been indicated by its reviews?</p></speech>

As the Deputy alluded to, we made significant announcements yesterday about supporting and improving the situation in DEIS schools.  It is my intention to offer an expanded provision of summer schemes in numeracy and literacy to benefit students who feel that they have been negatively impacted.</p><p>I recognise the specific point made by the Deputy in terms of the funding that has been made available in Britain.  There are a variety of views as to how that has been received in Britain by education stakeholders.  It is, therefore, important that we find our own mechanisms going forward.  In the first instance, however, it is most definitely my intention to begin programmes of that nature in the summer, particularly with regard to numeracy and literacy, but much more expanded than we had last year.  Other measures that are required will be put in place on foot of the studies we have done and those which are ongoing. </p></speech>

I believe it was said in the opening remarks that education is built on partnership.  While, of course, I welcome and acknowledge the work the Minister and the Minister of State have done on their stated plans since the beginning of January, it would be inappropriate of us not to make a general comment as regards what occurred over the last number of weeks.  The statement that education is built upon partnership is somewhat in tatters at this point.  Does the Minister, Deputy Foley, in particular, acknowledge that is a common perception held in the public domain, particularly among parents and parents of children with additional educational needs.</p> <p>  I want to follow what Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in had to say in his very appropriate questions about departmental research on the long-term effects of students not being in the classroom, particularly those at an educational disadvantage or who have addition needs.  In the coming months and years, we as a legislative body and a committee must place a priority on and invest in the need to build up resilience in those student numbers to assess properly, in the first instance, as Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in said, the long-term or medium-term affects, but also the additional supports in which I feel we must now invest within the education sphere to try to catch up.  Could the Minister please make a general response to that?</p> <p>  I then have a number of specific questions for the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.</p></speech>

I am frank and honest enough to concede that when a wide variety of stakeholders, which includes parent, student and teacher voices, representatives of special needs assistants, SNAs, and managerial bodies are around the table, one will have a variety of different and competing views and experiences.  That is as it should be.  At the end of the day, however, it is the job of the Government and the Minister to listen to all those views and work through them, learn from those experiences and, ultimately, make a decision.</p> <p>  I want to put on the record, as I have at every possible opportunity, my acknowledgement of the long-term consistent and generous engagement of all the partners in education over what has been a difficult and trying time for all of society, and all the different sectors within society, not least education.  I am, therefore, unequivocal in my acknowledgement of the positive input of the partners in education in regard to what we have achieved.</p> <p>  Regarding disadvantaged-----</p></speech>

I appreciate the Minister's response, however.</p> <p>  I want to focus on this as my time is limited.  I am sure there will be an opportunity to come back to it later.  However, my question-----</p></speech>

I am not clear as to what the point is.  Perhaps he would like to elaborate on it rather than making a broad statement.</p></speech>

There was a proposal by the Minister and the Department of Education for students to return to the classroom.  They did not; it is now March and they are only just returning.  I am not having a go at the Minister by any means.  I am suggesting the statement that education is built on partnership, which I believe was spoken by the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, really does not ring true.  The partnership did not allow for the return of students to classrooms at an appropriate time, particularly for our exam year students.  That is notwithstanding any other difficulties, particularly with regard to children with additional educational needs.</p></speech>

The approach had to be taken because of that.  However, it was also clearly outlined by NPHET that accommodation could be made for certain sectors.  That has taken some time.  As I said, there are a variety of views around the table but we move forward positively.</p></speech>

I want to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, about that very important point made by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in before me on the research required to determine the effects of long-term absence from classrooms for children with additional needs.  When does the Minister of State expect that such a report will be provided to her?  When might it be provided to us as a committee so we can try to assist her in implementing it?</p> <p>  I acknowledge the &euro;2 billion in additional budget that has been provided to the Department.  Of course, I really believe that we should have our special education teachers back in the classroom at the moment.  While only half of the students have returned, I accept that has presented profound difficulty for students and parents.  I cannot help but feel, however, there are, perhaps, at this moment, unknown problems which will no doubt manifest themselves very soon within the education sector.  Does the Minister of State have a comment on that?</p> <p>  I have one final point to make.</p></speech>

Obviously, children with special needs were always a concern for the Government.  That is why special schools originally went back on 11 February to 50% capacity.  They are now, thankfully, at 100% capacity since Monday.  Special classes have been back since 22 February and, as the Deputy knows, so too have junior infants up to second class.  There are children with special educational needs, SENs, within those classrooms, but obviously, everybody is not back.</p> <p>  Progress reports are given at the summer provision, which we are expanding this year.  There were 24,000 children eligible for it last year and 14,000 took a place.  We extended and expanded it to Down's syndrome, post-primary and preschool children, and hope to expand it further this year.  That will help in terms of regression.  Those progress reports will be given to the schoolteachers in September when those children go back.  It is really important that we try to do everything we can to support them.</p></speech>

The first thing I want to look at is safety within the schools.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify something for me on the 40% reduction in personal protective equipment, PPE, that was talked about earlier in the year.  Has that now been addressed?  Is that 40% cut not going to happen?</p><p>I will ask each question separately, if that is okay.</p></speech>

The PPE provision for schools is to be provided in three tranches.  The first tranche was from last September to Christmas and the second tranche began in January.  Obviously, there were additional costs in September for particular provisions that had to be purchased, be it hand sanitiser or extra equipment in schools ranging from something as small as additional bins to whatever might be needed, so additional funding was made available there.  Those start-up costs were not necessary in the second tranche starting in January and that is the reason there was a reduction in funding.  Point for point, however, the funding is the same.  There was never a question of a 40% reduction.  It was just an acknowledgement that the start-up costs, as it were, incurred in September would not be incurred in January in the second term.  All the moneys that need to be provided for PPE are most certainly currently being provided and will be provided as part of the third tranche also.</p></speech>

No school will be without any PPE it requests.</p> <p>  With regard to testing and tracing, will there be serial testing for all school staff this time?  What improvements have been made in the school tracing since last year to ensure we can keep any outbreak that occurs contained?</p></speech>

I mentioned earlier that all the processes and measures we have in place were reviewed by public health officials prior to the return to school.  Regarding the specific measures in place should an incident arise in a school, we have enhanced school teams, with public health being supported by personnel from the Department of Education.  There is also a facility whereby any testing that takes place in school will be fast-checked or "red-batched", as it is called, so it gets priority testing.  There is also a seven day per week helpline available to all principals to support them if any incidents occur in a school.  There is significant support in schools should any incident occur there.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that this is to be improved.  Will staff who are performing intimate caring roles be given medical-grade masks now?</p></speech>

The public health decisions will still be made by public health officials.  That is where the expertise lies.  I wish to be clear and upfront about that.  Public health will be supported by staff from the Department of Education but all public health decisions relating to what happens in a school and how a situation in a school is managed will be made by public health officials.</p> <p>  As part of our new procedures medical-grade masks are being made available to all teachers and SNAs in special schools and classes and to SNAs in school settings, as well as anybody who is not in a position to maintain the 2 m distancing.</p></speech>

It has been said, and I believe it, that there is an inequality with regard to the mainstream schools with young people who have special educational needs.  I see it even in my constituency in terms of one school being able to meet the needs of students with special educational needs while another is not.  It is very confusing for parents.  They feel a sense of injustice and inequality in that regard.  The Minister spoke about 20,000 students and when we have brought back so many other students, they find that difficult to accept.</p> <p>  However, I am constrained in the amount of time I have, so I wish to ask a question about the leaving certificate.  The Department's document, A Guide to State Examinations and Accredited Grades, lays out in detail how teachers should arrive at the grade, but there is much less detail on how the grades will be standardised other than to state that they will be adjusted based on the class performance in the junior certificate.  Will anything else be used to change the grades issued by teachers?</p></speech>

There is currently a tender process for a contractor.  The issues the Deputy referred to will be worked out with the SEC, but it is likely we are looking at, similar to the junior certificate, achievement for the cohort of 2021, similar to last year, the achievement of leaving certificate over the past four years, subject by subject, and the teacher's estimated grade.  However, the finer detail of that will be worked out by the SEC.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister and the Minister of State.  I realise that the times have been tough for both of them, but with the return to schools and the leaving certificate situation being resolved there is much to be grateful for.  I thank both of them for the work they have done.</p> <p>  The Minister and Minister of State will have received the joint committee report on the impact of Covid-19 in primary and post-primary schools.  I have a question for the Minister relating to hot school meals.  I have spoken about this in the past.  I was a teacher like her and we acknowledge that disadvantage is in all towns and communities and in most, if not all, schools.  I welcome the fact that the hot meals programme and the funding for it were maintained throughout the crisis, as well as the work many schools did in providing food parcels to students who were in need.  Is it the intention of the Department to expand that programme in the future?  I believe there is merit in expanding it whereby it would be available to all students in all schools.  Will the Minister make a quick comment on that?</p></speech>

The pilot scheme in 2019 benefited approximately 6,700 students at a cost of &euro;2.5 million.  A further &euro;5.5 million was made available in the last budget.  That means the students who heretofore were availing of the cold lunch option are now in a position to avail of the hot lunch option.

The Minister also instigated a review of school transport and that is welcome.  There may have been some initial delay because of Covid-19, but I understand that the terms of reference for the review have been established.  I would like an update on the status of and progress being made on that endeavour.  I hope it will be in place for next year's intake of students.</p></speech>

It is my hope and expectation that we will have an interim report in the short term and there will be scope to conduct a more in-depth report later.  I am mindful, however, of the need to progress this issue as expeditiously as possible.

I reiterate those comments.  All of us on this call acknowledge that remote learning is no substitute for on-site learning or in-class teaching.  Several speakers have said that and I add my voice to theirs.  The April date must be considered for children with an ASD diagnosis or special educational needs.</p> <p>  My final question concerns a site for a new special school in Cork.  I have raised this issue several times with the Minister of State.  I understand a meeting took place last week, but I am not sure who met the Minister of State and her officials.  What was the outcome of that meeting?  Has anybody in the Department contacted the Cope Foundation regarding the next stage of this process?  I understand representatives of the Cope Foundation have twice written to the Department to try to progress the case for a new special needs school in Cork, but I am not sure if they have received any response yet.  If she can, will the Minister of State clarify if that meeting took place?  Have any efforts been made to communicate with the Cope Foundation in the interim to update it on where we stand regarding this project? </p></speech>

He is aware that several meetings took place last autumn between the Department, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, the school management and the Cope Foundation, which is a patron of Scoil Aislinn special school located on the Boreenmanna Road in Ballintemple, Cork.  Those meetings explored the possibility of expanding Scoil Aislinn special school, as well as other options, including the suitability of using Montenotte House as a location to facilitate, hopefully, the enrolment of children without a school placement.  A meeting with the Cope Foundation was due to be held in February and I will get details on that for the Deputy.  It is important that we try to work with an existing school regarding school places.  The NCSE is aware of about 20 children who are not in school, require special school places and are now availing of the home tuition scheme.  I will send details of the meeting in February to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I am aware that short-term and long-term solutions are being explored.  As the Minister of State acknowledged, though, about 20 children will potentially be getting home tuition in September.  Everything must be done to investigate possible short-term solutions to allow those children to get in-school teaching.  Medium and long-term options are great as well, if they exist and involve a greenfield site or the conversion of a building, but we must emphasise the provision of a short-term solution to this case.  I look forward to the update.</p></speech>

Those movements were welcomed by all.</p> <p>  I welcome the certainty the recent decision on the leaving certificate has given to the 60,000 leaving certificate students impacted by the pandemic, school closures and the lack of in-class tuition.  Three different choices are being offered to those students, and I anticipate that will cause some organisational and management difficulties in our schools.  Has the Department looked at the possibility of recruiting extra teachers temporarily to ensure our students have the optimum benefit in this regard?  I say that because many of these students have been adversely impacted.  They missed five months of in-class teaching last year and then two months of this academic year.  Some level of support must be provided to these students.  Has any planning been done in this area?</p> <p>  This development will also create problems by overburdening class teachers who will be trying to deal with three cohorts of students in one classroom.  Some students will sit the traditional leaving certificate, some will avail of accredited grades and others will choose a combination of those two options.  Stress, difficulties and pressures will ensue.  We must ensure that students come out of this experience better than ever and that the disruption they have suffered is made up for insofar as that is possible.  What has been done in that regard?  Are there plans in place to address any problems which may result?</p> <p>  The report of the joint committee which examined the impact of Covid-19 on primary level education identified a disparity in funding for primary and second level schools and in school leadership posts.  What steps are being taken towards ending these disparities?  What progress has been made?  Has an assessment been made of the short-term funding needs of schools at primary and second levels in respect of allowing the safe and continued reopening of those schools?  </p> <p>  My final question focuses on the possibility of future school closures and the likelihood of some students being forced to self-isolate or restrict their movements.  Has consideration been given to the development of an online learning programme to include supports for disadvantaged students in accessing digital services and adequate broadband?  That is an issue for many communities throughout the State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021030200002#J01100"><p>On the matter of the provision of additional resources in schools, especially for leaving certificate students, it must be acknowledged that we were more cognisant of that issue as we moved forward in our planning this year.  More than 1,000 additional posts were made available for second level schools.  That has been a major increase in support in our schools.</p> <p>  On teachers being overburdened and potentially having to deal with a cohort of students wishing to take the written exams in June and another cohort opting for the accredited grades process, we were mindful of trying to accommodate both those groups within a class.  That is to take nothing away from the superb efforts made by teachers via remote learning and the huge demands now being placed on teachers in person.  Operating in a Covid-19 environment is difficult; I fully accept that.</p><p>In an effort to accommodate that, in the case of the accredited grades process, estimated marks and all associated information will not be uploaded by teachers until quite significantly into the month of May.  That will afford students the opportunity to continue their learning, whether they are opting for the written examinations in June or the accredited grades process, and for teachers to continue their teaching.  There will not be a conflict in terms of the need for students to be wholly involved in the learning processes within the classroom.  That accommodation of extending the date for the provision of estimated grades as late as possible is very helpful.</p><p> Regarding the issues of funding set out in the committee's report, it is important to acknowledge that significant capitation funding has gone into schools over the past two years or so.  There are two types of capitation funding, namely, funding for the day-to-day running of schools and the ancillary grant.  Last year, there was a 2.5% increase in the capitation budget, which followed a 5% increase in 2019.  In addition to that increase, significant funding was poured into schools to cover all the additional measures that are required this year in the context of the Covid-19 crisis.  That is necessary to ensure that certain schools would not be at a disadvantage and that all of them would be able to meet the challenge of the crisis equally.  It is significant funding, as I said, and includes &euro;56 million made available for PPE, hand sanitiser and so on and &euro;34.7 million for enhanced cleaning in schools.</p><p> In terms of the disparity the Deputy mentioned between primary and post-primary schools, it is self-evident that there is a very definite difference between primary schools and second level on a unit base level, in that post-primary school buildings are larger and have a smaller pupil-teacher ratio and more specialist rooms.  There is a higher cost at post-primary for heating, lighting, cleaning etc.  The disparity that exists reflects all of those specific issues.</p><p> On the question of the need for additional assistant principal I, AP1, posts, an announcement was made yesterday regarding posts within the DEIS scheme, where the threshold requirement for the appointment of a deputy principal has reduced from 700 pupils to 600.  That is a very positive step forward for DEIS schools.  The provision of leadership posts and posts of responsibility in schools is kept under constant review and is regularly the subject of discussions with school staff and representatives.  We will continue to do that and, as I said, we have made significant strides in regard to DEIS schools.</p></speech>

I commend them on the fact that schools have started the process of reopening.  As they know, I share the view of the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Muldoon, that all schools should be open, that the policies we are implementing at present are damaging to children and that when we come to look back on this time with the benefit of hindsight, children will say they were let down by adults during this period.  Nevertheless, I commend the fact that the process of reopening has begun.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, in respect of children with additional needs, after which I will put a question to the Minister, Deputy Foley.  Last Friday, I met parents of children with additional educational needs who are in mainstream national schools.  Those children, who are in second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth classes, will not be going back to school until Monday week.  The parents are very concerned that their children with special educational needs have been discriminated against compared with children with similar needs in special schools, who are already back.  I said to them that I would emphasise to both the Minister of State and the Minister the importance of trying to ensure that we get children with special educational needs back to school as soon as possible.</p> <p>  A question that was raised with me by the parents was whether the supplementary support scheme that is operating can be regarded as appropriate in circumstances where there are special needs assistants going from one house to another.  They made the valid point that this appears to be even more questionable from a public health point of view than what would be happening if children were back in school.  They asked me to emphasise that from their point of view, the supplementary support scheme is not working.  Is there anything the Minister of State can say to alleviate the concerns of these parents regarding the supplementary support scheme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021030200002#K00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I share his concern about the possibility of regression for children with special needs.  Fortunately, children in special schools and special classes are now back full time, as well as junior infants up to second class.  On 15 March, the other classes will also be back.</p> <p>  Regarding the supplementary programme, it is a voluntary scheme that is open to all students in special schools and classes, including those with the greatest need.  It provides a maximum of five hours per week, for four weeks, of one-to-one teaching and learning in the home outside of school time.  One of the issues we are looking at and on which we are working with the education partners is the fact that the support is provided in the evenings and at weekends.  We hope to be in a position to provide a supplementary programme within the school setting.  We spent &euro;30 million on PPE for teachers last year, and will spend the same this year, and they are working with very small numbers.  Like any decision the Department makes, this arrangement is based on public health advice.  We would not be putting forward a programme in the first instance if we did not have the safety of the children and families involved at the forefront of our consideration.  I hope that has provided some clarity for the Deputy.</p></speech>

My next question is for the Minister and it relates to the return of schools.  Fifth-year students will return on Monday week, as will the remainder of national school classes.  The Minister will appreciate that for children in first to fourth year at secondary level, a return date of 12 April, which is six weeks away, is a long time to wait.  Can she offer an assurance to those students and their parents that if things improve, the return date will be kept under review?  The Minister would acknowledge that children have been damaged by not being back at school.  Public health advice is paramount but we also have to take into account the health concerns of children, which include not just physical health concerns but the other health concerns associated with their development.</p></speech>

I acknowledge it as an indisputable fact that students are best served when they are in school.  Notwithstanding that, we are living in the reality of a Covid-19 pandemic in which all of society in this country, within reason, is closed down.  It is a significant endorsement of the importance of education in Irish society that education and childcare are the only sectors open during the current restrictions.  When we reopened the schools in September last year and there was uninterrupted learning through to December, we closely followed the public health advice and the input of NPHET.  In this instance, the latter has advised that it is looking for a cautious and phased return to school.  While I would wish that we were in a position to have more children and young people in school, it is on the basis of the advice from NPHET that we are proceeding as we are.</p><p>It is worth making the point that when schools were stood down, as I stated earlier, it was because of the mobility of 1.1 million people.  Schools in themselves are seen as places of low transmission, and this has been echoed on a number of occasions and as late as this past weekend by Professor Philip Nolan, the deputy chief medical officer and others.  It is, of course, our absolute agenda that schools would further reopen on 15 March and again on 12 April.  However, there is a burden of responsibility being placed on all of society to ensure that can happen.  The deputy chief medical officer has made it very clear that we must continue to see improvements and numbers coming down.  We must see hospitalisations decreasing and we have seen very good news on that again today.  Society must invest in this instance to ensure our schools can reopen fully and as quickly as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1657" speakername="Eileen Flynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021030200002#L00200"><p>I will start with a few questions for the Minister, Deputy Foley.  I heard the word "equal" six or seven times from the Minister's notes but it is not a word we should be throwing around when we know it is not true.  I say this with much emotion because there are so many schools in Ireland that do not have equal funding and which are struggling.  These are very disadvantaged schools, one of which is Our Lady of the Wayside in Bluebell, Dublin 12.</p> <p>  I have a question about the disadvantage experienced by children who have not had equal access to the education system during the pandemic because they have no technology, such as phones.  I know of one case involving a woman who must go to a school every Monday at 1 p.m. to get her children's homework.  There is another family sharing one iPhone.  I have been very vocal about the digital divide for many weeks and it is not something we need to look at during the pandemic.  As we will need to look at it in future, what has the Department done to bridge the digital divide?  I would appreciate an answer on this because it is everything but equal access when children do not have the technology to access school material.  How can the Minister guarantee the calculated grades will not be prejudiced towards marginalised communities or bias against people from ethnic minority groups?  I would appreciate a reply on that.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in spoke about research and unless I am wrong, the Minister said that remote learning is easier this time around.  I would like to know more about that research.  I support Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's comments on catch-up funds, which may support young people.</p></speech>

The Senator spoke about the digital divide and I am very conscious of it.  In the past year alone and throughout the pandemic, over &euro;100 million in financial resources have been made available to schools specifically with regard to information, communication and digital technology, etc.  This was to afford schools the opportunity to purchase digital platforms or, as I have seen in the vast majority of schools, necessary equipment.  As late as December 2020, &euro;50 million was expedited to schools so they would have funding available for the purchase of digital equipment, including tablets and laptops.  A variety of schools have purchased equipment that is loaned to students and which students have utilised throughout the pandemic.  I regard this as a very positive use of the funds made available.  If there are specific cases of this not happening or not being possible for whatever reason in different schools, I am keen to be made aware of them.  As I have said, substantial funding has been made available and used in that respect in a variety of schools.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to the accredited grades system and indicated that it should not disadvantage young people from different backgrounds or marginalised or minority backgrounds.  It was the experience in the system last year that it was blind to gender, background etc.</p> <p>  I indicated that remote learning is working more successfully this year than it did last year.  The closure of schools was sudden last year and there was a lack of preparedness because it was so unexpected, and one can understand that.  This year considerable work was done with schools, including the publication of guidelines that were worked through with all the partners in education, including teacher representatives, managerial bodies and students.  Everybody was around the table working out the guidelines and platforms to be used by schools, as well as the contact required between parents and schools.  All those guidelines were agreed and the platforms were put in place.  That is exactly what I meant with respect to the preparedness for remote learning working better this year than it did last year.  Is this going to work perfectly in all cases?  That is absolutely not a guarantee that can be given and there will always be difficulties.  As I stated, it is in no way a replacement for in-person teaching and learning.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about funding being made available for catching up.  Again, I have said that I am conscious of particular cohorts of students being especially disadvantaged because of Covid-19.  I have said it is my intention to make enhanced summer schemes available this year, as we had last year, with a focus on numeracy and literacy.  The Senator is aware that yesterday I announced a further expansion of the school completion programme, which is of enormous benefit to many students.  A further 28 schools are to be included in that programme.  There is also to be an increase in funding for school completion programmes and the DEIS schools will see a one point reduction in class sizes.</p></speech>

I apologise to Senator Flynn.</p><p>I have a couple of questions for the Minister.  I have no doubt that she and her officials have read the committee report on the impact of Covid-19 on primary and secondary schools, and the disparity between funding for primary and secondary schools.  I raised the issue of vice principals in primary schools with the Minister on a previous occasion and I am aware it was also raised with the unions.  I refer in particular to schools which have no permanent deputy principal.  Secondary schools may have 300 or 400 students and a full-time deputy principal.  A primary school could have 700, 800 or 900 pupils but no permanent deputy principal post.  Has the Minister had any time to examine this?  Perhaps in future negotiations with the INTO and coming up to budget time she might consider this.</p></speech>

I appreciate the point he made on principals.  There are issues around teaching principals, which I was very cognisant of as part of the school reopening plan.  Additional days were made available to support the work of teaching principals in recognition of the particular difficulties they faced in managing many additional responsibilities due to Covid.</p> <p>  On making an adjudication as to whether an additional post should be made available at deputy principal level in primary schools, considerations of that nature would be for the budget going forward.  I am mindful of the case the Chairman has made and it is something I will give due consideration to.</p></speech>

In recognition of the work they have done, it would be very welcome.</p> <p>  The committee will carry out an examination of leaving certificate reform, following our Covid report.  Have there been any conversations within the Department at Government or official level with the unions on reform of the leaving certificate as it currently stands?  I am on the public record as having said the leaving certificate is outdated and genuine reform is required.  Most members of the committee would agree.  What are the Minister's views?  Has any work been done by her colleagues and officials or those at Government level on this issue?</p></speech>

It is currently finalising its report which will be submitted to me and officials in the Department.  We will study it.  I am conscious that it will most certainly provide a springboard for further discussion and an ultimate decision in terms of how we will progress with the senior cycle.</p> <p>  It is fair to say that the current circumstances in which we find ourselves and the accommodations we have made in light of Covid-19 for the leaving certificate classes of 2021 and 2020 have shone a light on the senior cycle.  I await with anticipation the report from the NCCA and, as I said, it affording us an opportunity for further discussion with partners in education and being a vehicle for advancing decision-making.</p></speech>

I refer to the High Court decision today to dismiss legal action over calculated grades.  I ask the Minister to comment on both issues.  I have another question on air monitors before she concludes.</p></speech>

It is a fairly lengthy decision and will take some time to review.</p> <p>  The Chairman's second question related to the leaving certificate exam for 2021.  I wish to acknowledge that, as I said previously, this year students have a choice.  The accredited grades system and the opportunity to do written exams addresses instances where, for whatever reason, a student has opted to take a written exam but is unable to do so.  Such students then fall under the accredited grades system.</p></speech>

What is the up-to-date position on that?  Some schools have said they should have ventilation.  It is up to individual schools and teachers to open or close windows, but there are no ventilation monitors.  We have received correspondence from quite a number of companies which said ventilation systems can be installed quite easily.  I am not sure what work the Department has done on this.  Perhaps the Minister could update the committee on that.</p></speech>

They were recently reviewed prior to the current return to school.</p> <p>  The guidelines on ventilation issued in September, and updated in late November and early December, made reference to having windows open before and after classes and at points during classes, and teachers using their best judgment.  That advice still pertains, but we are mindful that a high level advisory expert group is carrying out a study on ventilation not just within the education sector but in general.  I understand it is due to make its findings public in the not-too-distant future.  Should there be some different guidance offered or new mechanisms or measures are required, we will address that.  We have done that very assiduously at every stage where public health advice has asked us to amend, change or add to any measures in schools, and we will do similar on foot of this report should there be a need to change.  I want to emphasise that the current advice available to us is as I have outlined.</p></speech>

Is the Department aware of this issue?  Is it taking moves to address it?  We receive a number of queries in our office about this issue every year.  This year the problem is particularly acute.  I do not know if it is Covid related, but there is certainly a scarcity of places in second level across north Dublin and I wonder if the Minister could respond to that.</p></speech>

Senator Dolan and I will speak next.</p> <p>  I did not get a chance to respond to the Minister of State on a couple of issues relating to mainstream schools.  We have all had much correspondence regarding the fact that many may have to wait for a number of weeks.  First, is she willing to look at an alternative where they may come in earlier if public health advice will allow?</p> <p>  Second, will she also give assurances there will not be backsliding and, therefore, in a position where schools close?  Is this it now?  Will these special schools stay open?  That is the kind of clarity people require.</p> <p>  I do not want to be a negative Nelly about ventilation.  It is, however, becoming more recognised that the kind of human activity in which we are engaged, which is not running in parallel with nature, may force us into these pandemics.  When we consider ventilation, it is beyond looking at a review of mitigation measures for this pandemic, but at what we actually need to do to future-proof our schools against more public health problems.</p></speech>

Planning permission has expired.  What is the longest-running school building project at stage 2B?

The immediate challenge for us, however, is how we ensure this impact is temporary and not permanent.  While I acknowledge the Minister mentioned the &euro;2 million, it is hugely important, therefore, that money is front-loaded into the mental health services, and the interface between mental health services and education, to ensure the proper interventions are made.  If we delay in those interventions, the long-term economic and social costs for us, as well as the human cost for the children, is unthinkable as it is at the moment.  That is my main ask from the Minister.</p></speech>

In fairness, two of them were responded to very clearly.  On the last one, however, my understanding of the responses we have been given is that if there is a localised lockdown in a particular country, exams may not happen and there will not be a second opportunity.  I have no issue with public health providing advice that something cannot happen because it is not safe or whatever.  However, I believe this issue can be resolved.  This is an ordinary course of the leaving certificate where a person has a paper B.  I do not see why that cannot be facilitated, whether it is for a localised lockdown or a student who is self-isolating.  That person might not even be ill.  He or she might be perfectly capable of sitting the exam and may have put huge work into preparation for oral examinations and all the rest.  We need to fix this.  It does not seem to me to be contrary to public health advice or beyond fixing.</p></speech>

I remind them of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the places in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public proceedings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.

The meeting will conclude within two hours.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to make an opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by the Minister of State with responsibility for public procurement and eGovernment, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and a number of our officials.</p> <p>  The group comprises a significant number of Votes, as the Chairman outlined, including: Vote 11 - the Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances; the Votes for a number of offices under the aegis of my Department, including the State Laboratory - Vote 14, the Public Appointments Service - Vote 17, the National Shared Services Office - Vote 18 - and the Office of the Ombudsman - Vote 19; Vote 15 - the Secret Service; Vote 39 - the Office of Government Procurement ; and Vote 43 - the Office of the Chief Government Information Officer.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, is happy to address issues relating to the Office of Government Procurement and the Office of the Chief Government Information Officer, and I will address questions regarding the other Votes.</p> <p>  I note that a detailed briefing has been supplied by my Department's officials, who were assisted in this task by their colleagues in a number of bodies under the aegis of the Department.  Further detailed material is also contained in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2021, which was prepared by my Department.</p> <p>  Covid-19 has presented unprecedented challenges to officials, Members of this House and the general public.  Arrangements for business continuity and flexible working have ensured that essential public services can continue to be delivered, while also ensuring that the general principles of safety, health and welfare are adhered to.  Officials from my Department, and in bodies under the Department's aegis, have played a central role in responding to the challenges of this crisis, and I take this opportunity to thank all parties involved for their collective efforts in this regard.</p> <p>  In an overall context, the 2021 total gross allocation for the public expenditure and reform, PER, group of Votes comprising of nine distinct Votes shows an increase of 3% on the 2020 allocation.  The overall gross figure for 2021 is approximately &euro;858 million compared with &euro;829 million in 2020.  This is largely driven by an increased Estimate provision to Vote 12, targeted minor increases to enable the delivery of essential services such as additional HSE recruitment, and to meet the additional salary costs associated with the Public Service Stability Agreement.</p> <p>  I will touch on the individual Votes in a little more detail.  The structure of Vote 11, the PER Vote, remains unchanged in 2021, with two strategic programmes focused on the two main strategy goals of the Department, namely, to manage public expenditure at sustainable levels in a planned, balanced and evidence informed manner in order to support Ireland's economic, social and climate goals and to drive reform and innovation across the civil and public service to improve services to the public and enhance strategic policymaking and public governance structures.  The Department has kept its overall 2021 budget flat and has reallocated resources across a number of expenditure subheads to meet 2021 priorities.</p> <p>  The most significant changes to programme subhead budgets are as follows.  Subhead A9 funding for pensions for bodies under the aegis of the Department increased by &euro;700,000 to &euro;1,150,000.  This will assist with additional pensions costs incurred by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Institute of Public Administration, IPA.  Subhead A3, the ESRI grant subhead, has increased by &euro;225,000 to &euro;3,000,000 to support the institute in carrying out additional social research in 2021.  The allocations for subheads A8 and B5, the programme consultancy subheads, have reduced by &euro;383,000 in total.  Subhead B7, the reform agenda subhead, was reduced by &euro;542,000 to &euro;648,000, which is sufficient to meet its requirements this year.</p> <p>  In relation to other Votes, the Estimate for Vote 12 - superannuation and retired allowances, which is the largest Vote, accounts for the vast majority of the envisaged increase in PER Vote group expenditure in 2021.  Year-to-year variations in the expenditure of this Vote are primarily driven by the number of pensioners on the payroll, the number of individuals who will opt to retire before reaching their compulsory retirement age and whose years of service and grade or pay level are variable and uncertain.</p> <p>  The Estimate I am proposing today for Vote 12, involving a gross provision of &euro;666.268 million, represents an increase of just over &euro;26 million, or 4%, on the 2020 gross Estimate.  This increase reflects an increase in the number of pensioners on the payroll and the number of civil servants reaching retirement age in the year.</p> <p>  Other bodies under the aegis of the Department, such as the Public Appointments Service, PAS, the National Shared Services Office, NSSO, and the State Laboratory, provide important services to large numbers of clients across the civil and public service.  A modest increase to the State Laboratory's 2021 Estimate will allow the laboratory to meet additional forecasted demand for tariff classification advice in 2021, and also enable the laboratory to provide an analytical service to the HSE in relation to e-cigarettes.  The Public Appointments Service - Vote 17 - has received a modest once-off increase in the current year to assist the HSE with increased recruitment demand arising from the pandemic.  The NSSO has played an important role in the reform of public services in recent years through the delivery of human resource shared services and payroll shared services to clients across the civil and public service.</p><p>The 2021 NSSO allocation will enable the continued provision of HR and payroll shared services and also enable the office to progress the roll-out of financial management shared services.</p><p> The Estimate provision for the Office of the Ombudsman will allow the various constituent offices to deal with their respective workloads and enable continued investment in ICT modernisation, which will support the office to meet the challenges of delivering essential services to the public remotely at this time.</p><p> Procurement is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s public service reform agenda.  The State procures goods and services costing in the region of &euro;8.5 billion each year.  In this context, it is essential that the public service operates in a co-ordinated and efficient way and delivers sustainable savings for the taxpayer.  Some of the key OGP initiatives supported by the 2021 Estimate include: improving procurement capability in the public service; further developing, implementing and actioning a medium-term strategy for construction procurement, including the capital works management framework, CWMF; supporting Future Jobs Ireland and the climate action plan through focused procurement policy initiatives; the development of a new national eTenders system; and the delivery of commercial skills training across the public service.  </p><p> Finally, 2021 marks the second year of the Office of the Chief Government Information Officer, OGCIO, as an independent Vote - Vote 43.  It was established in 2020 with an Estimate of &euro;21.7 million net, all of which came from Exchequer neutral funding transfers from other Votes.  The Estimate for 2021 will rise by 5%, which is largely funded via Exchequer neutral transfers of &euro;1.1 million from other public sector bodies.  This Vote serves to drive the digital transformation agenda across Government while providing and developing pan-public service ICT infrastructure, service delivery models and cross-government applications.  The OGCIO is facilitating a sustained and wider spread adoption of the build to share suite of services as set out in the public service ICT strategy and endorsed by the Civil Service Management Board, CSMB, with Departments contributing to the funding of services received.  This approach to Exchequer-neutral funding means that ICT costs can be suppressed across the wider system as a result of labour specialisation, economies of scale and the elimination of duplication.</p><p> I am happy to present the 2021 Estimates for the public expenditure and reform group, approval of which will allow the individual Votes to continue to meet their responsibilities and deliver essential services.  The Minister of State and I are both happy to answer any questions that arise.</p></speech>

The first thing I wish to focus on is procurement.  There is a lot of concern out there regarding Government spending and buying from companies during this pandemic, particularly where the goods it has bought have then proven to be faulty or not up to scratch.  We saw that with the purchase of faulty ventilators from two separate companies.  One transaction with a company called Shenzhen Prunus, which cost the taxpayer almost &euro;5 million, involved buying 250 units.  After a number of those units failed tests, all 250 units were quarantined.  Can the Minister confirm whether they are still in quarantine or have been destroyed, and whether the taxpayer has received a refund regarding this?</p> <p>  In a second transaction, 300 ventilators were bought from Roqu Media International.  That company specialised in entertainment services, not the provision of medical equipment.  That contract cost &euro;14.1 million.  This company organised festivals in Saudi Arabia yet at the same time, it seemed okay to give it &euro;14.1 million to purchase ventilators.  To anyone who has seen the documentary, it is very clear that this is Ireland's answer to Fyre Festival.  This deal was supposed to cost &euro;35 million and we know Roqu Media International was not the actual manufacturer, which was Shenzhen Probe, but it acted as the intermediary.  In actuality, it was an intermediary of another intermediary called Shanghai Lingang Group, an arrangement that was not made clear to the HSE at the outset.</p> <p>  Can the Minister confirm how many of these ventilators were faulty and were any of them used?  Let us put this into context.  We need to remember that at this time, there were communities in local areas trying to raise enough money to pay for PPE for their local nursing homes or whatever else they felt was necessary, yet at the same time, we see a festival organiser get &euro;14.1 million.  That is simply not good enough.  I would really like to hear the Minister's clarifications regarding that issue.</p> <p>  I have also seen an internal document that looks at the risks relating to Roqu Media.  We see that it was red flag after red flag yet the purchase went ahead.  This was done internally in the HSE.  It said that there was a risk that expenditure of this magnitude would be wasted, that the quality of the machines was not to the standard specified or expected by the HSE, that there were no CE marks on the machines and there were issues relating to the variation in standards involving multiple machines being supplied from multiple manufacturing sites.  This was red flag after red flag so I would like to hear the Minister's clarification on this issue.</p> <p>  I understand that this same company was also involved in other schemes where the plug had to be pulled.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister's views on companies that have continuous issues regarding the quality or standard of what they provide and whether there is any concern regarding them being able to apply for and win more procurement contracts.  Is it the Minister's view that this highlights weaknesses in Ireland's procurement regime and, if so, what is he going to do to ensure that our light touch regulation, which is what it has been called, becomes a bit more hands on?</p></speech>

The first thing to say is that the Office of Government Procurement is not a policing or regulatory body.  It is a policy body that provides advice on how State money should be spent along with guidelines and suggestions for suppliers that have been vetted to contracting authorities.  I understand that the body that purchased these ventilators is the HSE.  The HSE would have been the contracting authority.  The HSE is responsible for spending its own money.  It has its own Accounting Officer and is subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and to being cross examined at the Oireachtas Committee on Health.  Primarily, that would be the method of oversight of the health budget or the HSE spend.</p> <p>  I cannot really comment on the particular circumstances of that supplier to that contracting authority because I am not aware of the details but we must acknowledge the extreme urgency of the situation in which we found ourselves last summer.  We were facing a situation where we had a new virus and did not know the extent to which the numbers could increase to a point where they would overload our hospital system.  We could see what was happening in Italy on television and there was a rush to acquire PPE, ventilators and other equipment to prevent a calamity.  In those situations, there is room within the procurement rules for emergency procurement of equipment and supplies so that we do not have to go out to a full tender.  If somebody's house is on fire and one needs a bucket of water, one is not necessarily going to have a tender to obtain buckets.  Of course, there are limits to how emergency procurement can proceed but, generally, it seems to have worked very well.</p></speech>

Yes, we were all extremely concerned, as we still are, hence the reason we need to ensure certain things.  As the Minister of State said, the Office of Government Procurement is a policy body.  We need to make sure we have the right policies in place so that when we do have something like this - when our house is on fire - we are not bringing a bucket full of flammables but are actually bringing a bucket full of water.</p><p>Let us consider the ventilators, for example.  What if people needed those ventilators?  We spent millions of euro and had ventilators that did not work.  This was in a global pandemic.  This is why we have policies and why we need to make sure that our policies work.  I acknowledge the issue of non-competitive procurement practices and I understand that they can be needed in times such as a pandemic but we need to look at this situation very clearly.  With regard to companies that fail so greatly and so gravely in times of absolute need, we must ensure that they are not going to be used again and again, and that these issues keep arising.  That is definitely something I would be concerned about.</p><p> I would also push back on the whole concept of the non-competitive procurement practices.  What kind of data collection is there for these non-competitive practices?  How frequently are they used?  Who are the most frequent users?  What is the value in a given year?  What reasons are cited for going outside a competitive process?  I am aware that the OGP has provided guidance to contracting authorities on purchasing during the pandemic without a competitive process via a so-called "negotiated procedure".  That is one of the ways of going about the competitive tendering process but are the Minister and the OGP aware of the total number and value of procurement contracts for Covid-19 related spending in 2020 and 2021 that took place via negotiated procedure and without prior publication?  Is the office aware of anyone who is collecting this data centrally?  This is very important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021030200002#C00200"><p>The total volume of goods or services that were obtained outside of a contract or normal procurement rules is known by each of the contracting authorities.  The OGP does not keep track of each individual procurement contract that is taken out.  Even in the case where an emergency procurement is done because the contracting authority is in an emergency situation, they are still required to audit all of those procurement activities.  The Accounting Officer is still required to account for all of them and the Comptroller and Auditor General can investigate all of them.</p> <p>  The Deputy is absolutely right to be concerned about the probity of public expenditure to make sure that money is not misspent.  That certainly applies.  In an emergency situation, however, the normal checks and balances that take place initially can be delayed or circumvented to deal with a critical situation.  Overall, I believe that it worked remarkably well last summer.  Many organisations contacted the OGP and the State to offer to the HSE equipment and PPE at no cost or at a reduced cost.  The OGP worked to take all of those offers and to go through them all.  It was extremely helpful.  Overall, I feel that we had a successful emergency procurement.  There certainly will be instances where things went wrong, and these must be investigated.  We must find out what happened in those cases and they should be audited.  If there was any wrongdoing, of course that should be punished.  We need an emergency procurement system for emergency situations.  I hope and expect that any questions arising from the HSE's purchasing are carefully examined at the health committee.</p></speech>

Obviously we need to have a system in times of pandemic, but we do also need to be careful.  When one sees that this company then went for another tender, it is very concerning.</p> <p>  I have one final question on expenditure for the Minister because I know other members need to get in.  Previously the Government put &euro;4.7 billion into Bank of Ireland and, as a result, now has a 14% shareholding in that bank on behalf of the people.  We have seen the news, which I am sure we can all agree is very disturbing, that 103 branches will be closing, North and South.  This affects mainly isolated and rural areas.  The national recovery plan is based on balanced, regional development.  With these bank branches closing in the more isolated and rural areas such as Oughterard, County Galway, surely this is not good for balanced regional development.  What can the Minister do with regard to this happening?</p></speech>

I acknowledge the significant public concern as a result of the Bank of Ireland announcement.  None of us want to see bank branches closing because we realise just how important they are for the communities they serve, for personal customers and for business customers.  On the role of the Government, as the Deputy has pointed out, the Government is a minority shareholder in Bank of Ireland, with a 14% shareholding.  A relationship framework agreement is in place that governs that relationship.  As a result of that agreement, the Government does not interfere in the day-to-day commercial decisions made by the bank.  We want to ensure that financial services are provided in communities around the country.  In that regard, we welcome the new partnership agreement being entered into by Bank of Ireland and An Post.  Arising from the bad news on the closure of branches is an opportunity for the post office network, some of which is under strain as the Deputy and colleagues on the committee will be well aware.  I also believe there are opportunities in this regard for credit unions to continue to expand the range of services they offer.  The Government will do all it can to provide a supportive environment and a framework for the continued provision of services.  It would be wrong of me, on behalf of the Government to say that we can control the decisions made by the Bank of Ireland on individual branches because we simply cannot.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021030200002#C00500"><p>I apologise that I was not available for the start of the meeting.</p> <p>  Apropos of the previous discussion on procurement, we must recognise that in an emergency we need to have an emergency procurement process.  Whether it has operated effectively or efficiently remains to be seen, but it needs to be in existence.  Inevitably, emergencies occur and in an emergency it is not possible to go through a two-month or three-month tendering process.  In fact, it could be found that the procurers were negligent if they put people's lives at risk and the public would not tolerate it.  I would, however, like to know a little bit more about the extent to which emergency procedures are available and what covers the procurers in the process in that event. </p> <p>  On the banking system, particular challenges arise now.  I am not certain that they will be resolved easily.  At a time one bank is withdrawing completely from the market, another bank is closing down more than 100 of its counter services.  This is a big challenge and a disadvantage to many people who are dependent on the banking system.  We need to make sure that we have something to offer.  I will come back to some comments I have made in the past at our meetings.  I am not so sure that we have any influence at all as a committee, and I believe that we should.  Our views should be taken into account but they are not.  They were not taken into account when it was decided to close one banking establishment altogether.  We were told after the event, the same as the employees.  I do not believe this is good practice, especially in the aftermath of the bailout of the banking system, some by this jurisdiction and some by other jurisdictions.</p><p>The fact remains that either the finance committee or an appropriate committee has a function and a valid commentary in these situations or it has not.  If we have not, that is fine.  We may have to deal with it in another way.  Likewise, with regard to the Bank of Ireland, the employees were not warned beforehand and the appropriate committee was not warned beforehand, as far as I am aware.  We did not know anything about this.  The decision is taken arbitrarily.  I believe we must examine the basis on which these arbitrary decisions are taken.</p><p> The banks will say it is on the basis of the need to look after the shareholders and so forth.  We have to raise a red flag and say that while we are not shareholders, we represent shareholders and constituents alike, and some constituents may be shareholders.  It is important that some type of good established practice be put in place to ensure we do not continue swimming in the dark, as it were.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021030200002#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  They are points he has made on many occasions.  I was a member of this committee for many years and took part in many of the hearings it had with the banks.  We had many robust exchanges.  We made progress on some issues and did not make progress on others.  However, it is true that the Government is not directly involved in running the banks, even those in which it has shares.  We have an interest, of course, in the services they provide and the impact of any changes in those services on the economy and the communities that are supported by those services.</p> <p>  The banks are operating in a very challenging environment at present, as the Deputy would acknowledge, given the interest rate environment and the lack of returns that are available at this point.  We need to ask ourselves why a bank such as Ulster Bank, which has been in this country for 160 years, or its parent company NatWest Group would make the decision to depart from the Irish market.  We must think very carefully about the issues which led to that decision, because it has been a difficult and bad week for the customers and staff of Irish banks, given the combination of the Ulster Bank announcement.  It was devastating that the third largest bank operating in the Irish market would signal its departure, albeit over a period of a number of years.  The Government will do all it can to manage the fallout from that.  We welcome the ongoing engagement with Permanent TSB and AIB regarding what role they may play.  Notwithstanding that, it is still a very serious and adverse development.</p> <p>  The closure of bank branches is a recognition of a number of factors which the bank outlined yesterday.  However, it means we must do all we can to support the post office network and the credit unions to ensure that where services being provided by one institution are lost to a community, those services are replaced by another institution.  That is the key issue.  There are many businesses in communities that require cash services.  They require the service of going to a bank branch and lodging cash.  They cannot afford to travel 15 or 20 miles or further to do that because of the cost involved, the time and the security issues that are raised as a result.  I welcome the announcement by An Post, and we need to see the full detail of that over time.  That will be important to reassure customers that those essential services can continue.</p></speech>

The country finds itself in a new banking crisis at present.  My major frustration with this is the fact that Bank of Ireland and AIB can function in the manner in which they are functioning because they operate in an unbelievably uncompetitive banking market.  The major threat to customers, small businesses, farmers and regional and rural Ireland is the wholesale absence of competition in the Irish market.  That has happened largely because previous Governments and the former Minister, Michael Noonan, created a two-pillar banking system, in part to protect the value of those banks.  What that has done is create a duopoly.  As anybody who does leaving certificate economics can explain, that duopoly means there is enormous supplier power in the hands of those two banks.  As a result, they can control all aspects of engagement between themselves and the customers.  They can do what they like to the customers because the customers have absolutely nowhere else to go.  One must either do business with those two banks or start bartering.  That is the market that exists.</p> <p>  I listened to the Minister and Deputy Durkan with regard to not wanting to direct these banks to take particular actions.  If I was in government, I would not want to direct those banks in certain actions.  What I would do is create a competitive market, a market in which those banks lose their supplier power and there are competitor banks put into place, such as a stakeholder public banking system, and in which far more banking power is given to the post offices and the credit unions.  My worry with regard to credit unions is that I have listened to ten years of platitudes in Leinster House when it comes to credit unions, how wonderful they are and how they should be doing more, but very little extra support is being given to them to enable them to achieve more.  Indeed, I met the regulator of the credit unions a number of years ago, who basically communicated to me that the Government did not trust the credit unions to have the management infrastructure to be able to provide a proper banking alternative in this country.  The thing to do in that scenario is to buttress that management infrastructure so they can provide that system within the banking market.</p> <p>  Ireland is moving into an uncompetitive space for banks.  That is the reason Ulster Bank left.  It left on the basis of a financial decision.  It was as pure and simple as that.  The reason is that banks in Ireland have to hold two and a half times as much capital on mortgages as their European peers, and interest rates are not providing income streams to banks.  Does the Government have a significant plan to introduce competition in the banking sector to make it attractive for a stakeholder public banking system?  Does it have a plan for the post offices and the credit unions and to make them more attractive to European competitors?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021030200002#D00400"><p>It is important to acknowledge that there is competition in the Irish market.  We have the pillar banks, obviously, but Permanent TSB is playing an increasing role in the SME market.  It has significant ambition in that space.  On the personal banking side, we have a foreign-owned bank, KBC Bank, in the Irish market.  It has restated its commitment to remaining in this market, which is important.</p> <p>  When we emerged from the financial crisis, the Irish market lost many foreign-owned banks.  They departed because of the level of losses they incurred.  The Deputy made an important point.  Ulster Bank left the Irish market for financial reasons.  It is a bank that makes commercial decisions and if it does not see a pathway to a sustainable return on equity, it will not remain in the market.  Unfortunately, to our cost, that is the decision it made.  We have seen some entrants in the mortgage area.  We have Avantcard, for example.  Although it targets a particular part of the market, it is offering a rate as low as 1.95%.  I very much welcome seeing that level of competition in the market.  An increasing role is now being played in the provision of financial services by non-bank lenders across a range of platforms.  A number of fintech operators have entered the Irish market.  They are lean, have a very low cost base and operate within the regulatory environment.</p><p>As a former member of this committee, I spent a lot of time engaging with credit unions.  In the previous Oireachtas, this committee compiled a very good report on the key challenges that credit unions face.  The Government is determined to work with credit unions in developing a strategy that provides a sustainable basis for the expansion of their services in communities.  From my engagement with them, it is clear they are expanding their services and investing in technology.  While they have issues with certain aspects of regulation, regulation is carried out in an independent manner and must be done.</p><p> I touched on the issue of post offices.  I am liaising with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, on the future of the post office network and how we can support An Post.  However, we must also acknowledge hard realities.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n touched on the level of capital provision that is required under the risk-rated assets system for Irish banks.  That is determined by regulation and is not determined by the Government in any way.  The truth is that the system ascribes an additional premium to lending in Ireland because it is seen as more risky.  That reality is related to the requirement to hold additional capital.  Those are the issues we need to consider and work our way through to make sure we hold on to the competition we have and try to find new ways of bringing in additional competition.</p></speech>

The alternatives the Minister mentioned are very small in comparison.  When analysing our particular market it is still very clearly a duopoly, which is the opposite of what we need as a State.  Perhaps the Minister did so by accident but giving the pretence that there is functioning competition within the Irish market is unhelpful.  There most certainly is not proper competition within the Irish market.  That is at the heart of the problems that have manifested themselves in provincial towns right across Ireland.</p> <p>  I am a big fan of regulation and believe it is necessary but we have cyclical regulation.  This means regulation is applied when a particular market is in trouble but is then reduced when that market starts to burgeon.  We need countercyclical regulation.  Regulation must be in place when needed.</p> <p>  On procurement, where are the ventilators that were discussed earlier?  How much does it cost the State to store them?  What is planned for them in the future?</p></speech>

I suggest the Deputy directly address his questions to the HSE and I am sure it will be able to help him.  I regret that I do not have details on the contract.  In general, the Office of Government Procurement does not police individual procurement contracts that are taken out by contracting authorities across government.  That is not its role.</p></speech>

It is of primary concern.  Each contracting authority - each Department - is responsible for its own expenditure.  It has an Accounting Officer and is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Accounting Officer appears before committees and is cross-examined by Deputies, including Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  That is the chain of command.</p> <p>  I am very happy to ask the Office of Government Procurement to look at its frameworks.  If a problem has arisen in procurement in an individual contract, which is reported by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and if there is some way that we would need to change the procurement framework or policy, we are absolutely open to that.  In general, that is the regulatory and policing framework.</p></speech>

When Deputy Farrell asked the Minister of State about ventilators, surely he should have admitted that there is a policy issue and that there has been a failure of policy?  That failure of policy has allowed the HSE to enter into a formal contract that has led to the State incurring a huge loss.  As the policymaker in this, is the Minister of State going to respond to this issue?  Does the framework in place provide scope for him, the Office of Government Procurement or the HSE to sue the supplier?</p></speech>

I do not know if that is an operational question, whether there was due diligence or if the framework was followed correctly.  The Chairman said it was a policy failure but we do not know that yet.  It is too early to say that at this stage.</p></speech>

It gets expert advice and the contracting authorities are required by Government policy to follow those rules.  However, we do not police them.  We do not know that the policy was not followed, nor do we know that the policy was followed and failed.  We do not know, for example, if the policy was simply ignored.  We do not know what happened in this case.

There no point in making a policy in a vacuum that has no relationship with what happens in the real world.  There are learnings to be gained.  We were in an emergency last year and time will be spent examining what actually happened during the emergency procurements to see whether the policy worked, whether it was followed or if anything went wrong.  I completely agree.  If there are questions about this particular contract or if it turns out something went wrong with that contract, we will need to adjust our policies and framework.

I do that quarterly and I am due to meet them again in a couple of weeks.  It is a fact that the majority of public procurement spend goes to SMEs at the moment.  That is the situation.  They are winning contracts.  We engage with them and try to help them, and we change the rules, if necessary, within the law.  We have to follow European law and we then have Irish law.  We have to follow the European directive but, within that, we work with the SMEs, and we recognise it is a question and a problem.</p></speech>

It is a protection for the pillar banks - the duopoly that is now in place.  If we are really serious about post offices, it would be quite easy to give them public service obligation payments, and I think they have suggested &euro;17 million in that regard.  It is also quite easy to involve the post offices and the credit unions relative to community banking and public banking, similar to the Sparkassen model.  I think the Minister was actually in that bank, as part of a committee, examining the possibilities of that bank coming to Ireland, or at least its model being supported here in Ireland.  I would like to hear more about that.</p> <p>  When we dealt with Ulster Bank, the concern for many members was, naturally, the staff, the customer base and the question of the ownership of the various buildings that housed the branches.  In Kilkenny, as well as in Carlow, similar to many other parts of the country, there are buildings that are central to the landscape of the city.  We have failed to get information on that.  Now, Bank of Ireland comes along and it does exactly the same thing, with 88 branches closing down.</p> <p>  The post offices are asking for support.  The credit unions, in my opinion, are over-regulated when they could be used positively in terms of the funds they have.  However, it requires a radical overhaul of Government policy in regard to banking.  I have not seen a document that outlines a vision for banking in Ireland, what we see as being the banking model and how it is going to operate at community level.  I would like to see that happening.  KBC is fine and Permanent TSB may be a player, but it is going to require further Government funding.  We have to start a conversation with the banks on the basis that they caused the problem too.  They were the ones that had the reckless lending.  They were the ones that pursued individuals and small businesses, and pushed them to the pin of their collar, with suicides relative to individuals and banks.  We cannot ignore that.  They are at fault.  I am not one bit surprised that Ulster Bank pulled out of the country because NatWest made it pull out of the country.  It is as simple as that.  They wanted to get their hands on the grubby money they had.  It is fair to hold the banks to account but it is also fair that the Government should have a published policy as to where it is going in regard to banking.  That is what I would like to see.  I would also like to see within, for example, AIB, where there is the EBS tied agents issue, that we get it to resolve that.  We own the bank.</p> <p>  I am going to keep coming back to these issues because I believe the banks, by and large, have blackguarded their customers and are taking advantage of Covid by closing down branches and making big decisions that affect our economic well-being.  I think the policy is just a continuation of the last Government so we should change it.  I know it is a big ask but, at the same time, the public are asking us.  That is the backdrop to all of this and, I am sure, the backdrop to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n&rsquo;s questions.</p></speech>

While we are on the subject of the banks, I want to remind myself and everybody else that a major issue was tracker mortgages.  The banks held the view for a long time that they could not afford tracker mortgages because they were losing money on them, which, of course, was untrue.  They were not losing money but, potentially, they could have charged more if they did not have tracker mortgages, so they could make more profits.  Other European banks right across the European Union did not seem to have a problem and they were acceptable.  We need to find out more information in regard to why we are so different.  Is it because we are a small country or because we are not full members of the European Union, which, of course, we know is not true?  We should be entitled to the full entitlements that go with membership of the European Union.  If they have tracker mortgages throughout Europe, I do not see any reason we should not accept them here.</p> <p>  To go back to the question of reserves and risk, I acknowledge what the Minister says about that, but the risk was created, as the Chairman rightly said, by the banks themselves.  They encouraged people to borrow wildly and indiscriminately.  It was not necessarily the customer who looked for this.  The banks offered them facilities that were above and beyond their ability to discharge.</p> <p>  We are in a situation where, as we proceed into the future, we need to get clarity as to where we are going.  Incidentally, given the previous conversation on procurement and how some contracts are filled from inside the State and some from outside the State, I remember having the temerity to inquire into that some years ago and I was treated with absolute disdain.  I was asked how anybody could ask a question like that.  That is as it may be.  We have to do things in the future in a way that is not in accord with what happened in the past.  As the Chairman said, we have to account for our activities and what we are doing to protect our constituents throughout the length and breadth of the country.</p> <p>  I am not certain how good-hearted the banking system is going to be towards the credit unions or the post offices.  Previously, the post offices needed an extra revenue-generating avenue and, presumably, it will come in the course of the changes that are taking place.  I am not 100% certain but I would like to be certain.  Similarly, if a third banking force is required, how is it going to come about?</p><p>Do we wait for it to happen at the behest of the banks or do we suggest to the Minister and the banking system how they might construct a realistic competitive third banking force in the country upon which the Government and the public can rely?  Those are questions that need to be asked and to which we need a response.</p></speech>

The Chairman has always been consistent and forceful in raising these issues related to the banking sector.  He has also been very effective as Chairman of this committee for some time.</p> <p>  The issue of the staff of the banks was mentioned.  First and foremost, they are the people we think of at this time.  Different banks have made various announcements of redundancies, primarily voluntary in nature, over a period of time.  I hope they will all be voluntary but, nonetheless that will mean a major upheaval for many people.  Some people are late in their careers, others are not so far into their careers and, for many, it is a huge setback.  We need to acknowledge that and hope the banks fulfil the promises they made in finding alternative employment, redeploying people and ensuring that lay-offs are voluntary in nature.</p> <p>  It should be acknowledged that during the Covid crisis the Government made very significant interventions in the lending market through the SBCI.  We have the credit guarantee scheme whereby the State guarantees 80% of each individual loan.  The uptake on that has been limited, largely because the demand among businesses to take on additional debt at this time is muted for understandable reasons.  They are trying to survive.  The State has done the best it can in the form of the employment wage subsidy scheme and restart grants and we will continue to support businesses in that way.  We have also provided considerable support through Microfinance Ireland in the context of small and micro businesses getting support on attractive terms.  Those schemes have proven to be particularly popular and successful.  That should also be acknowledged.  My understanding is that the Minister for Finance will be before the D&aacute;il on banking issues this week.  I am sure he would welcome the opportunity to come before this committee also but, having said that, I am more than happy to answer any question put to me on the wider issues affecting the banking sector, the people working in it and the customers being served.  </p> <p>  The post office network and the credit unions have a major role to play.  There has been much talk for many years about setting up new banks in the form of new public banking.  The credit unions are a form of community banking.  With the right support and strategy, I believe that is a role they can very successfully fulfil.</p></speech>

Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Chathaoirleach.  I have found this extremely frustrating.  The Minister used the word "hope" a good few times.  It feels like the Government is a spectator in a market at the moment.  The Government nearly has an ideological feeling that it does not have a right to engage and fix this particular issue, which is strange because at least one of the parties of Government sees itself as a party of the free market.  This is not a free market; this is a dysfunctional market.  The Minister mentioned the credit unions but it is long past the time we should have a concrete proposal from Government on how the credit unions will get into a position where they can be an additional force.  This is not about looking into or considering this issue.  This is the time for that plan to crystallise in terms of this discussion, rather than being in the future.  The Minister mentioned interventions in the banking market with extra funding but that extra funding has gone through the pillar banks in the main, other than Microfinance Ireland, which provided approximately 1,000 loans last year, and that is small fry compared to the needs of small businesses throughout the country.  This is having a significant effect on regional and rural Ireland.  If we do not fix the dysfunction in the banking market right now, this will lead to further problems down the road.  It will mean two pillar banks will harvest greater profits from their customers and provide fewer services to them for that profit.  What are the Minister's specific plans for credit unions and for public banking systems?</p></speech>

SBCI loans are not just administered through the pillar banks.  We extended the range of platforms for the administration of those loans to include non-bank lenders, and there are plans for the SBCI to extend that further.  The credit unions are being considered as part of that.  We can come back to the Deputy with a precise update on that point.  That offers very significant potential for credit unions to gain a foothold in that market.  The Minister for Finance has a credit union advisory committee, which advises him on the strategic issues affecting the credit union sector.  There is ongoing engagement with the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association and the Credit Union Managers Association on all those issues.  I would be happy to come back to the Deputy on the specific point on the SBCI and the role of credit unions in that regard.</p></speech>

I wish to return to the Estimates.  In his opening statement, the Minister said one of the key OGP initiatives is to further develop, implement and action a medium-term strategy for construction procurement, including the capital works management framework.  That strategy began mainly in response to the debacle around the national children's hospital.  I have two questions on that.  Can the Minister outline the projected cost of the national children&rsquo;s hospital?  Has he made any additional allocation to the national children&rsquo;s hospital for 2021?</p></speech>

The capital works management framework is our general framework for all major capital works.  Specifically, we have 40 projects coming up, the value of which will be more than &euro;100 million, which will have to be managed carefully.  As part of that, we follow the recommendations in the Ernst and Young report on the national children's hospital, which recommended there be some form of monitoring of capital spend outside of the contracting authority.  Up to now the contracting authority was solely responsible for contract management and managing its own projects.  From now on, the investment projects and programmes office within the Department will have a role in monitoring expenditure.  That is the change from the previous capital works management framework.</p></speech>

I will take the question on the national children&rsquo;s hospital.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, a specific board, namely, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, is responsible for the delivery of that project under the Department of Health.  Obviously, my Department has a central role in the overall expenditure position.  It is important to say that we have a contract in place and we expect it to be fulfilled.  Work is continuing on site on the children's hospital.  We have been informed by the Department of Health that the hospital development board intends to bring forward an up-to-date report to the Minister of Health in the first instance, and to me in the coming weeks.  I am expecting that shortly.  I have also indicated to the Minister for Health that it would be timely to bring an updated memorandum on the project to Government.  </p><p> At this point, I do not have any new figure.  There have been various cost claims made and evidence has been given by the hospital development board to the Committee of Public Accounts.  However, there is no up-to-date figure at this point because those cost claims have essentially been adjudicated in favour of the State and not the contractor.  I am expecting an update shortly from the development board and there will be a memorandum to Government.  </p><p> As the Deputy knows, the current chairman of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, Mr. Fred Barry, resigned at the end of February.  There are a number of vacancies on that board and I have indicated to the Minister for Health that they should be filled as quickly as possible.  He has indicated in correspondence to me, in the last day or so, that some vacancies have been filled and others will be filled through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, process as soon as a new chairman has been appointed.</p></speech>

Has the Minister got a private figure he is not willing to share with the committee as to the amount he is willing to spend on this project?

My question concerns the use of funding and, more importantly, the information that comes back from that type of research.</p> <p>  The Minister will be aware that his colleagues are disputing, or disregarding, the advice of the ESRI on the affordable purchase shared equity loan scheme.  In my view, this scheme will push up prices.  The Minister's former Secretary General said that developers had lobbied for it because it will push up house prices.  This is supported by the ESRI in its analysis to the committee and by concerns raised by the Central Bank and a number of other bodies.  How can the Minister confirm that we are getting value for money, when research carried out by the likes of the ESRI points out that what the Minister is doing will push up house prices and saddle future generations with debt?  The Minister has decided to ignore the ESRI, the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Central Bank, the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV, and most other economists who have offered an opinion on this issue.</p></speech>

The analysis it publishes on a regular basis on different issues is of very high quality and is carefully considered by Government and others in civic society.  The additional funding I provided in the budget, in the form of a &euro;225,000 increase in the grant, to the ESRI was to make sure there was a particular focus on the social dimension of its remit and responsibilities.  It has always produced excellent analysis on economic issues and this was an area it was keen to develop further.  I thought there was much merit in looking at income inequality, poverty, health, well-being and so on.</p> <p>  As for the shared equity scheme, the ESRI appeared before the committee during the pre-legislative scrutiny phase of that Bill.  It gave its assessment and the Deputy has highlighted one part of it.  It gave a full assessment of different aspects of that Bill which is absolutely its right, entitlement and duty.  The Government must take that on board, as well as all the other advices it receives and all the other factors that go into making such a decision.  The ESRI is listened to but that does not necessarily mean that any Government at any time has to follow to the letter everything it recommends.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.434" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021030200002#H01600"><p>I understand that and the work of the ESRI is crucially important.  The Minister talks about listening to the ESRI but is it not the reality that the Government has listened to the developers here?  This is a developer-led scheme.  I am not saying that to make the accusation.  I know it because developers came to Sinn F&eacute;in and tried to convince us of the merits of this proposal.  We told them to sling their hook.  They went to Government Buildings or to Fianna F&aacute;il and got a friendly ear in the form of Deputy Darragh O'Brien, who ended up becoming Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and is now implementing their policies.</p> <p>  Whether the Minister is listening to the ESRI telling him the scheme will push up house prices, his own former Secretary General who said developers are lobbying for this because it will push up house prices, the entire Central Bank which is saying it has concerns or the Institute of Property Auctioneers and Valuers, which is just interested in selling property, all are saying the same thing.  This is a scheme that will push up prices.  The reality is, when it comes down to it, it is the ear of developers that have got the friendliest tones when it comes to a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister.  Is that not the case?  How can the Minister justify the chorus of opposition from State-funded bodies against this scheme, when it seems the only ones supportive of it are the Government and the developers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.435" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021030200002#J00100"><p>In essence the scheme is an attempt to bridge the gap for many first-time buyers who have a certain level of income and who cannot afford to purchase on the open market.  The State has already done a considerable amount, as the Deputy knows.  I know he does not agree with the help-to-buy scheme, for example.  However, many thousands of first-time buyers would not have been able to purchase their first home without such support.  In the context of a Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage budget of over &euro;5 billion, the &euro;75 million for the shared equity scheme is modest.  It is designed to help first-time buyers to bridge the affordability gap.</p> <p>  We believe in home ownership.  Of course, we want to see private supply increased and we need to examine the bottlenecks in the system preventing private supply coming on stream in the numbers we need.  We should acknowledge the viability issues, particularly relating to the development of apartments in city centres.  They are just not viable and are not happening.  In my city of Cork, no apartments are being built nor have there been for several years indicating that there are problems there.  The scheme is designed to make the purchase of a home more affordable.  It will not be for everyone.  For those who qualify, it will play a modest but important role in the market when it is operational.  </p></speech>

I hear what the Minister is saying.  He believes it will make it more affordable; almost everybody else says the opposite.  The Government is in tune with the developers.  Both of them claim it will make it more affordable but everyone else is saying it will actually do the opposite and will push up house prices.  These are people without any political allegiances, including the Central Bank, the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the ESRI and other institutions.</p> <p>  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and other Deputies spoke about the impact Bank of Ireland's decision to close 103 branches will have on communities, on vulnerable customers and particularly on businesses.  The evidence shows that when a branch closes, the credit lending growth reduces by two thirds.  When it is the last branch in town, which is what is happening in many villages and towns as a result of the Bank of Ireland decision, the credit lending growth reduces by over 100%.  This is happening at a time when we will need banks to support businesses to help to rebound on the other side of this pandemic.</p> <p>  I am sure the Minister will give the Civil Service answer about the framework relationship agreement.  However, does he accept the Minister is entitled to express an opinion about what Bank of Ireland has done by deciding to close 103 branches across the island of Ireland in the middle of a pandemic?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.437" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021030200002#J00300"><p>I will not give a Civil Service answer and there is nothing wrong with our Civil Service.  I will give my own opinion and the facts.  The facts are that the Government cannot intervene over a commercial decision, as the Deputy knows as well as I do.  I will not sugar-coat it.  The decision by Bank of Ireland to close so many branches is a very serious blow for the communities served by those branches.  It is an enormous blow for the staff.  I have already spoken about the need for them to be properly looked after and indeed for the customers who are served by those branches to be looked after.  In recent days we have seen news reports indicating how those communities will miss having a branch.</p> <p>  The Government cannot dictate to individual banks the nature of the service or how it is provided.  However, we can use the levers we have, including our role as a shareholder in An Post, our role as a supporter of the credit union movement and our role generally in banking policy to try to ensure that services are provided.  It is a very difficult time for any community relying on the services of branches that will close later this year or in the future in the case of Ulster Bank.  It would be wrong for me to give the impression that the Government can control that because the Deputy knows we cannot.  </p></speech>

I did not ask the Minister if he could control it or direct it.  I asked him if he accepts that the Minister is entitled to express his opinion on the decision of Bank of Ireland to close branches.

That is not to say they must be acted upon but they must be taken into account.  The Minister is the largest shareholder in Bank of Ireland on behalf of the Irish people because &euro;4.7 billion of Irish taxpayers' money was put into this.  People are hurting and they are angry.  They are suffering considerably as a result of the pandemic and this is the respect they get, with the announcement that services will be withdrawn.  Whatever about telling us how difficult it will be and how challenging it will be for business, will the Minister say that Bank of Ireland should reconsider its decision to close the branches, particularly in the middle of a pandemic?</p></speech>

The regulator in Britain has called on banks not to close their branches in the middle of a pandemic.  There is a rationale for it.  The rationale is that it is hard to reach vulnerable customers.  It is hard to reach businesses that are temporarily closed at this time and therefore it should not be happening.  We have called for the establishment of a forum on the future of banking.  That should be allowed to run over the course of 2021 and into 2022.</p> <p>  Bar the fact that the Minister is now a Minister as opposed to sitting on this committee as an ordinary member, I do not understand why he does not support what I believe the people are looking for, which is to ask Bank of Ireland not to close these branches in the middle of a pandemic.  While the Minister cannot direct or dictate, undoubtedly the Minister can influence the decision and ask Bank of Ireland to reconsider it.  Business plans need to be submitted to the Minister for his consideration before they even go before the court of directors of Bank of Ireland.  It is not the case that the Minister cannot say anything.  Does the Minister have an opinion on this?  Does he believe, as the Chairman of this committee who is a party colleague of the Minister's has called for, that this decision should be reversed and these closures should not happen in the middle of a pandemic?</p></speech>

I would be interested to hear his views.  I think in the last year or so, new lending regulations now allow credit unions to lend 7.5% to 15% for secured loans, which was deemed a big success by certain people.  Certain people in the credit union sector felt that it shut them out of the market.  As the Minister mentioned the role of the credit unions, what are his views on that?  Will he raise it with the Central Bank the next time he is in contact with it if it is his view that credit unions will be playing a major role in the future?</p></speech>

It is very much a regulatory issue.  It would be wrong of me, as Minister, to cross over into space that belongs to the Central Bank.  The Oireachtas has a role in setting the legislative framework for the Central Bank to perform its functions, but it would be wrong and inappropriate of me as a Minister to comment on a specific regulatory function that relates to the Central Bank.</p></speech>

However, I take the Minister's point.</p> <p>  I would like to return to the procurement issue.  On the level of non-compliance with the competitive tendering process in 2019, it is my understanding from the response of the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, that no information is available yet for 2020.  I add my voice to the call that the Minister of State, who has specific responsibility for procurement, seek that information.  It is important that information is made available to the committee.</p></speech>

In terms of reform, are there plans to reform the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General to the extent that it might be amalgamated with the Local Government Audit Service, such that we would have one audit office for the country?  The spend on local government does not get the same scrutiny as Departments and agencies.  Given the amount of money that is now going through local government, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be improved to allow for that audit and also to allow for the possibility of auditing any body that would get a significant amount of funding from Government.  I am not suggesting that office would audit every body but that if the occasion arose, as it did in the past, there would not be any legal obstacle to the Comptroller and Auditor General following the money.</p> <p>  My second question is also on reform.  This morning, the ESRI was mentioned.  I refer now to the Institute of Public Administration, IPA, and the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  In organisations that have a bearing on Government policy there is little input from the private sector and so each one of those organisations is heavily weighted towards public sector involvement.  I believe they would benefit from an appropriate level of private sector involvement.  Similar to the gender quota, there should be a minimum of 30% representation on these agencies and boards by people from the private sector in order that we would have a dynamic working between public and private and, perhaps, an influence on policy that would be more positive and business driven than is the case now.  I believe there is a lack of diversity in this area.  I ask the Minister to comment on the fact that of all of the people recruited from the public sector to the higher level within the Civil Service, only 8% have been successful.  In other words, only 8% of those coming from the interview process are from the private sector.  The issue here is the level of pay.  A person from within the service receives a level of pay that is equal to his or her current standing within the organisation but a person coming in from the outside must start at the bottom level of the scale.  I think the Minister needs to look at that.</p> <p>  Staying with the issue of reform, we continually refer to the relationship framework with the banks.  I accept the following is probably a matter for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, but I suggest to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, as I will also suggest to the Minister for Finance, that the relationship framework should be reviewed and a clause inserted therein that allows the Minister to intervene where it is in the interests of the community, society and the State so that we need not always put forward the excuse that it is not within the relationship framework to do this or that.  Deputy Pearse Doherty mentioned the banking framework for the future.  We need to examine that closely.  We should stop the branch closures.  This committee should be saying to the Government that it too should be insisting that there be no branch closures by Bank of Ireland.  The public banking model report was produced and discussed at this committee and the Government at that time, which introduced vulture funds to the country, did not support the public banking model.  It was in the previous programme for Government and it is mentioned in the current programme for Government, as are so many other issues it is hard to believe anything has been left out.  I would like to see that coming forward.</p> <p>  There are two final issues I want to raise.  There are employees of a semi-State company based in Shannon waiting to be redeployed to various parts of the public service.  They have been waiting a considerable length of time but no move has been made in regard to the numbers.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on this matter.  A number of the employees want to deploy to civil or public service jobs.  This process has been stalled for some time.  It now needs to be revisited in order that the employees' case is settled.</p> <p>  On the whistleblower legislation, I understand the Minister does not have authority in respect of each disclosure but that legislation needs to be reviewed.  The committee has decided to do its best in the context of the restrictions in place on committee work to take that into consideration.  Looking across the disclosures that have been made, is the Minister concerned by the actions of the State in terms of how disclosures have been handled?  One whistleblower was named at the Committee of Public Accounts and that is illegal.  The arm of the State with which whistleblowers are dealing is using a significant amount of taxpayers' money to beat them down.  In some cases, what the whistleblower or protected disclosure has disclosed has been a help to the State and it has been acknowledged that it is, rightfully, a protected disclosure yet, particularly in the education sector, there is a refusal to sort out the problem.  It is similar to the question on the procurement side raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth.</p><p>The legislation and policymaking are there but where a perceived wrongdoing to a person who has made a protected disclosure is identified, nobody will intervene.  The matter is left locked between the Department concerned and the law, with the weight being on the side of the Department because it has access freely to taxpayers' money to defend something that really cannot be defended.  Surely the Minister must be concerned that aspects of this law are not working, particularly the aspect that is costing the taxpayer so much money.</p></speech>

In regard to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, it comes under the remit of the Department of Finance.  I am aware that officials are looking at the relevant legislation and we will consider again the idea of the Comptroller and Auditor General following the money in respect of significant projects, along the lines of what the Chairman has suggested.  There is a separate audit function, as referred to by the Chairman, for local government.  That issue could be taken up with the Minister for Housing, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  I will consider the Chairman's point regarding the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

An area for which I am directly responsible is the review of the national development plan.  I will shortly be setting out my proposals in that area and it is my view that we need to bring in more private sector expertise to the oversight and management of projects.  There are opportunities in the case of the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board, for example, which is, in effect, made up of Secretaries General, one external person and the chairperson of the OPW.  We need people with a wider pool of skills serving on a board like that, given the really important role it plays in overseeing the implementation of the national planning framework and the NDP.  In addition, we need more external oversight when we are bringing projects through the system.  I will be bringing forward specific proposals in that regard very shortly as part of the NDP review and I would be more than happy to engage further with the committee on the matter.</p> <p>  The Chairman raised the issue that only 8% of public service posts above a certain grade are filled by people from outside the service.  If I understood him correctly, he is saying that the point at which they start on the salary scale is a factor in this regard.</p></speech>

I would point out that an external chairperson, Mr. Sean O'Driscoll, who is formerly of Glen Dimplex, has been appointed to the ESRI.  He is doing a really good job there.</p> <p>  Regarding the employees in a company in Shannon, the Chairman might provide me with the details of that particular case.

I am keen that we have as much transferability as possible across the civil and public service and also the wider public sector.  That is important.</p> <p>  On the whistleblower legislation, I will be bringing forward new legislative proposals in this area in the coming months.  A review is needed and some changes are required.  An EU directive on whistleblowing was adopted in October 2019 and we have until December of this year to transpose it into our national laws.  A public consultation on the areas of the directive where Ireland has discretion took place last year, closing in July.  A total of 24 submissions were received as part of that process and they will inform the approach to be taken in the transposition of the directive.  My intention is to bring forward the legislation as early as I possibly can in order that we can engage in pre-legislative scrutiny.  There are important issues around protected disclosures that we need to look at afresh.  The legislation is seven years old and we must learn from our experience over that period of time to see how we can improve and strengthen it.  We want an environment across the public service where we are open to whistleblowers making information available without any fear of recrimination or consequences.  People still feel reluctant in many cases to challenge the system and bring forward information.  I will be engaging with the Chairman and the committee in the months ahead in regard to the legislation on protected disclosures.</p></speech>

Is there any way of intervening with Ministers to ensure that, within each of their Departments, any protected disclosures that are made are dealt with efficiently regardless of the outcome?  The person who made the protected disclosure must not be left out of the process.</p></speech>

We need to be careful to ensure that employees who are the subject of an allegation or disclosure made by somebody else are entitled to their good name.  If we have a situation where such persons are cut loose and left to carry huge costs in defending their good name in the performance of their duties for the public good, as they would see it, that would raise serious issues.  It is something we can examine as part of the review we are doing into the legislation.</p></speech>

In many ways, this is an economic elephant in the room that we will be faced with when, God willing, the pandemic is subsiding.  Has the Government developed any plan to reduce the budget deficit and the timescales that might apply for that reduction?  Has the EU been in contact and have there been any discussions with it regarding the timescales to meet the fiscal rules?  Has there been any discussion with the ECB in this regard?  Can the Minister give us any information as to whether the reduction will be done through tax hikes, public spending cuts or economic growth?  My preference would be economic growth.  There is a massive train coming around the corner and I want to know the Minister's thinking on how we are going to avoid it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021030200002#L01300"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this question.  It is absolutely the case that the pandemic has had a dramatic impact on the public finances, first and foremost on the people we serve, including the 470,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment, many of whom have remained out of work for almost a year since they lost their jobs in March 2020.  Our number one priority and challenge will be to rebuild the economy and bring about a recovery that is focused on helping people to get back to work.</p><p>There was a question on the deficit.  The preliminary estimate for last year, as committee members know, is of a deficit of &euro;19 billion and a forecast we made in the budget for 2021 is of a deficit of a similar order or slightly higher at over &euro;20 billion.  The truth is that we are in a period of such uncertainty that it is difficult to make predictions.</p><p> We need to consider in the coming weeks how we approach the stability programme update.  As committee members know, we must prepare and submit that statement to the European Commission by the end of April.  I imagine there will be engagement with the committee as part of that process.  We will have the summer economic statement in the summer as well.  We made provision in the budget for the contingency fund and for the recovery fund.  Those two are being used currently to sustain the supports currently in place in the form of the pandemic unemployment payment, the employment wage subsidy scheme, the Covid-19 restrictions support scheme and so on.  Those funds will come under strain as we move through the coming months depending on the level of the public health restrictions.</p><p> In overall terms, last year we spent &euro;85 billion.  The forecast this year that we set out in the budget was for expenditure of approximately &euro;88 billion over the course of the year.  The commitment we have given is that we will maintain the supports as long as is necessary and there will not be a cliff edge.  We are not going to allow them to end abruptly.</p><p> Recently, I had a good meeting with the National Treasury Management Agency to get an overall handle on the work officials there are doing in managing the national debt.  I was convinced following the engagement that they are taking maximum advantage of the current borrowing conditions, which are extraordinary because of the support of the European Central Bank.  As committee members know, the ECB has committed to continuing with the exceptional bond buying programme up to March 2022.</p><p> At this point the focus of the Government is on supporting people and businesses and getting everyone through this in the best way possible.  Our assessment is that the bulk of the heavy lifting in respect of the deficit can be achieved through growth, trying to repair the economy and bringing about that recovery.  I am not going to suggest for one moment that it will be plain sailing right through the full term of Government.  It would be foolish to make such a commitment.  Anyway, our focus is on continuing with the supports and bringing about the recovery.  A reduction of the deficit will be done gradually.  It will be led by growth and by helping people to get back to work.</p><p> I believe the Irish economy has the capacity to rebound strongly when we consider the level of savings.  Over &euro;15 billion in extra savings has been amassed in our financial institutions in the past year.  I believe the economy will start to recover in the second half of this year.  All the forecasts from the main bodies internationally and domestically are for growth of between 4% and 5% next year.  Now, we cannot take anything for granted but I believe if we can help to ensure that businesses get through this period, then that money is well spent in general terms.  We will keep the supports under review.  We are doing a good deal and we will see what further work we can do or need to do.  When it comes to the reopening phase of the economy there will be a need to try to give extra help to businesses, some of which may have been unable to open their doors for the past 12 months or more by that time.  There will be damage and legacy issues will need careful consideration.  We will work with people on that basis, but the commitment I can give is that our focus will be on bringing about recovery.  That is the best way to address the deficit, which will need to be addressed over time.</p></speech>

First is the draft minutes on the scrutiny of EU legislative proposals.  Can I take it that the minutes of our last public and private meetings of Tuesday, 23 February 2021, and the actions of our earlier private meeting, are agreed?  Agreed.  The committee also considered three schedule B EU legislative proposals, namely, COM (2020) 659, COM (2020) 814 and COM (2020) 849, and agreed that they did not require further scrutiny and there were also no subsidiary concerns with the proposals.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

He will provide us with an update on a number of issues, including capacity, and the situation regarding the pay of student nurses.  The Minister is joined by the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler, Feighan and Rabbitte.  They are all very welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.479" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#A00500"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me today.  I am joined by my three ministerial colleagues, namely, Deputy Butler, Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people; Deputy Rabbitte, Minister of State with responsibility for disability; and Deputy Feighan, Minister of State with responsibility for public health, well-being and the national drugs strategy.</p> <p>  I thought it would  be useful to use my opening comments to address the impact that Covid-19 has on the delivery of healthcare and our plans to deal with this.  The first wave of Covid-19 led to an unprecedented interruption to normal healthcare activity, both in community and acute settings.  While many vital services were maintained or restructured to respond more appropriately to Covid-19 related risks, other services were suspended or delivered on a reduced basis.  In the acute settings, many health services were suspended on the advice of NPHET.  The provision of other health services, particularly in community settings, was also affected.</p> <p>  Many steps have been taken within the HSE, over the past number of months, to restore services.  Over the summer of 2020, the HSE prioritised, among other things, communications to advise and encourage the public to seek necessary healthcare and to attend appointments.  Many critical services continued through all stages of the pandemic, including cancer services.  Urgent and time-sensitive treatments are being prioritised, based on clinical considerations.  Innovative use of technology also benefited outpatient appointments in 2020 and between March and December 2020, more than 557,000 patients attended a virtual outpatient appointment.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding the significant resumption efforts, the overall effect of this was that less non-Covid healthcare was delivered last year than in previous years.  Waiting lists for care in the country have been too long for many years and this has been exacerbated by Covid.  Our waiting lists have increased over the past year.  There are more than 622,000 people waiting for an outpatient appointment.  There are 81,000 people waiting on our active inpatient or day-case lists - almost 22% more than this time last year.</p> <p>  To tackle these waiting lists we are providing an unprecedented level of investment.  The total budget for 2021 represents an increase of around 20% on the 2020 allocation.  While &euro;1.67 billion of this is for Covid-related care and supports, including our vaccination programme, there is significant additional funding for new measures.  This money will be used: to address the known capacity deficits by funding more beds and employing more staff; to replace, insofar as possible, the lost capacity and activity due to Covid-19 with the necessity to operate at reduced levels for clinical and public health reasons; to ensure people can stay at home for as long as possible and be treated as close to home as possible, in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  For example, we are providing funding for several million additional hours of home support.  The money will also be used to help alleviate waiting lists with an ambitious access to care fund.</p> <p>  The HSE National Service Plan 2021 sets out how the funding will be used.  There is an access to care fund, which, together with funding allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, comes to &euro;340 million.</p> <p>  As I mentioned previously, some services have yet again been reduced or suspended out of necessity to assist in preventing the spread of the virus during the third surge.  Given this, it is the intention of the HSE to keep the planned levels of activity, performance and reform as set out in the national service plan under close review and the chair of the HSE board has committed to updating me formally in April 2021 in this regard.</p> <p>  I would like to conclude by acknowledging that we cannot predict with certainty the future trajectory of this disease.  We must continue to ensure that our response is agile and flexible.  Most importantly, we must ensure the public feel safe using our health and social care services, and that everything that can be done, is being done, to maximise the availability and quality of those services. </p></speech>

I call on Deputy Colm Burke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.481" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#A00700"><p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  I wish to go through the challenges that are currently facing the health service.  Many staff are very tired and drained because of the challenges they have had to face over the past 12 months.</p><p>The information I am getting back from a number of them is that we may very well have far more people leaving the health service over the coming 12 months because of the pressures put on them.  Has an assessment been conducted of how to deal with this and give more support to staff?  On a number of previous occasions I raised the issue of planning for retirements so we would know at any time how many people are to retire over a 12 to 18 month time period so we can plan for recruitment.  This does not appear to be happening in the HSE.  Will the Minister clarify what has been put in place to deal with this issue?</p><p> I want to ask about the &euro;240 million care fund.  My understanding is that people are being referred for assessment and then referred back to the HSE or hospital where they were initially on the waiting list without a procedure being carried out.  People want to be referred for assessment and for full care procedures to be followed through without having to be referred back.  Is there a proposal to revise this process?  As a result, we are making no inroads on waiting lists, especially when we are referring people to the NTPF.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.483" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#B00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  On the first issue, I wholeheartedly agree.  Many of the HSE staff are exhausted.  Before Covid arrived, they were run off their feet and over the past year they have been asked to step up again and again.  They deserve huge credit for what they have done but we all agree simply thanking people for their work is not enough.  We have to look very seriously at how fatigued people are and whether they are close to burn out.  If what the Deputy is saying is true, and people have had such an experience at least in some parts of the system that they are thinking about retiring, changing career or moving to a health service in a different country, it is something we need to look at very seriously.</p> <p>  The good news is the pressure has eased.  Today the number of Covid cases in hospitals has reduced below 500, which is very welcome.  The figures the chief clinical officer has given are very encouraging with regard to the impact the vaccine is having.  It is not just the vaccine, as it reflects lower community transmission also, but, from memory, the chief clinical officer was citing figures that suggested an approximate 95% reduction in Covid infection rates for hospital staff, which is very encouraging.</p> <p>  There is no question but that we need to work closely with the HSE, management, the representative bodies and, most importantly, the staff themselves to make sure they have the supports in place that they need.  My view is we need to do something for them and I believe that in the fullness of time we will.  We need a Government decision on this and Government agreement on what it is.  Certainly the HSE, the Department and the Government are taking very seriously the issue the Deputy has raised, which is that staff are exhausted.</p> <p>  To go back to the topic we are discussing today, when we successfully manage the resumption of services we will look at ever greater waiting lists and greater pressure.  With respect to planning for retirement, I might ask for a note to be provided to the Deputy on this.</p> <p>  With regard to the access to care fund, the plan is absolutely as he proposed.  It is for referral and treatment.  The plan is not that people get a referral and are then designated for treatment but the supports stop there; the plan is that people will see the clinician or clinicians they need to see and are treated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.484" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#B00300"><p>On the issue of the challenges that staff have faced over the past 12 months, is it proposed that a process will be put in place to assess how they can be assisted?  I have not heard of anything new being done in the HSE over the past 12 months.  I know there were administration challenges in the same way as there are challenges with regard to front-line staff.  Surely we should be putting in place a process to consult staff so we can see what needs to be done to increase the level of supports for staff.  Is this being planned?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.485" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#B00400"><p>That is exactly right.  We do need a process.  What I can tell the Deputy is that the HSE is engaged on an ongoing basis at a comprehensive level with the various cohorts.  There are mechanisms in the HSE and there is a lot of engagement across the service.  What we are speaking about now is something on top of this to look at addressing the very serious burden and very serious exhaustion that so many of our staff are carrying.  The Deputy is right that we need to address it as a specific piece of work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.486" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#B00500"><p>I raised this issue previously when the HSE came before the committee and I am still not happy with the reply.  A comprehensive survey of people who are leaving, in other words analysing and finding out the various reasons they are leaving, is not done.  My understanding is that in some places surveys are being done and in others they are not.  Can we not set up a comprehensive survey so we can learn from it, whereby when people are leaving they fill out a survey?  Obviously it would be anonymous.  It would then be available to see what changes need to be brought about to assist management in dealing with the number of staff leaving.  Over the past 12 months, quite a number of staff have left but over the next 12 months it will be an even bigger challenge.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.487" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#B00600"><p>That is exactly right.  I have seen data and the committee in the previous D&aacute;il saw data on various cohorts and why they might be leaving the profession or the country.  Certainly some of what the Deputy has proposed is being done but at a HSE-wide level.  It is an excellent idea.  In fact, we could perhaps go further.  Something we want to keep an eye to is that as many of our graduates as possible stay in the country and work in the public health system.  A systematic survey, essentially exit interviews, is what the Deputy is speaking about.  To understand the same for our graduates would also be very useful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.488" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#B00700"><p>Non-consultant hospital doctors from outside the European Union appear to have a particular difficulty at present because no structures are in place for them.  There is also a lack of support in place for them.  We have more than 6,000 non-consultant hospital doctors working in the healthcare system.  A large number of these are not Irish and a large proportion are not European.  Are the Department and HSE, together with the training bodies, looking to review how we can set up a better structure for their training because there is a benefit for us in Ireland?  Many of them will leave and go off to other countries.  This is something we need to look at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#B00800"><p>I wholeheartedly agree and, in fact, I met a group of foreign doctors who are non-consultant hospital doctors.  They have two very reasonable asks.  One is on their visas.  They need to update their visas regularly.  From memory it is every six months but please do not hold me to that.  It may be different for different countries.  I am engaging with the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, on this.</p> <p>  The second issue is one the Deputy, I and other members discussed at the committee in the previous D&aacute;il.</p><p>It involved the situation where some foreign NCHDs do not have access to the consultant track and, therefore, do not have access to some of the ongoing continuing professional development that is needed.  I have met a group of them about that and it is something we are working on with the Department.  It is something I would like to see sorted out for two reasons.  One is because, ideally, we want them to stay here and, therefore, we want them to be able to train up to be consultants.  We want them all to be the best clinicians they can be and right now, they do not have that opportunity.  Even if they do want to go back to their country of origin, there is an ethical responsibility on, and an opportunity for, Ireland to train them up as consultants as well as possible.  It is something we are working on.</p></speech>

We wrote to the Minister a number of times and the matter was raised twice in private session that we would ask him to set out his position regarding pay and allowances for student nurses and midwives in his opening statement.  The matter was not addressed in his opening statement.  It would be very unfair if time for members was eaten into by the Minister setting out his position.  Can I ask that without using up any of our time, he use a minute or two to set out his position?  He was specifically asked by the clerk of the committee, and I checked this again before the meeting started, to set it out but it was not addressed in his opening statement.  There was universal cross-party support for the Minister acting on this and on a D&aacute;il motion that was unopposed that called on him to revert to the March agreement.  Will the Minister address in his own time what he should have addressed in his opening statement and set out the position regarding pay and allowances for student nurses and midwives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.492" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#C00300"><p>I will have to defer to the Chairman on that.  I do not have any extra time.  I was asked to cover a very wide gamut of issues, including capacity within the system, the impact of Covid on waiting lists and many other issues.  I had five minutes as an opener, which is about 600 words.  We have two hours now so my understanding is that any members who wish to ask any relevant questions can but, obviously, I do not have any time myself so I will defer to the Chairman on the Deputy's point of order.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.493" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#C00400"><p>I think all the members who are lining up for questions would be interested in hearing the Minister address that issue in a few minutes.  We will then deal with Deputy Cullinane's questions.  Does the Minister have a note on the updated position relating to student nurses and midwives or does he want to address it later?  The committee is interested in hearing his answers.  The matter has been discussed privately by the members and we wrote to the Minister and Department about it.  If the Minister has a note on the updated position regarding pay for student nurses and midwives, it would be helpful.  I will certainly put a couple of minutes aside for him if he wishes to address it now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.494" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#C00500"><p>That is entirely up to the Chairman.  As members will be aware, I commissioned an independent review by Professor Tom Collins to look at the allowances payable to student nurses and midwives while on clinical placement in the context of Covid.  There are two different reviews.  One is the review by Professor Collins, which is specifically in the context of Covid, while we are starting a second one that I would like to see finished and implemented for the September academic year.  This second review looks more broadly and structurally at the clinical placements themselves.  What we agreed to was an independent review.  Professor Collins provided that.  He was under a lot of time pressure.  I was keen to see that any recommendations if they were to be accepted by all sides could be implemented from 1 January so in fairness to Professor Collins, he did huge work right through Christmas.  He came back with a series of recommendations, which will be available to the committee.  The report on that has been published.  I accepted all of the recommendations on that.</p> <p>  His specific recommendation on pay was that there would be a pandemic placement grant of &euro;100 per week supernumerary so it would be a non-taxable amount of &euro;100 per week.  This would be from January.  He also gave me the option to backdate that to the start of the academic year in September should I deem it appropriate.  I did that and I have accepted those recommendations.  I would very much like to be able to pay it but, obviously, we would be paying it as an agreed settlement.  The discussion is ongoing with the representative bodies to see whether or not they want to accept that.  It is fair to say that their reaction to it, which they stated publicly so I am not giving away any secrets here, was that they were disinclined initially to accept the proposal from Professor Collins.  There is an ongoing conversation with the Department at the moment.  I would very much like to get to an agreed position as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It was important for the Minister to set out his position on this issue.  Staying with this issue, can I put one point to the Minister.  When Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha from the INMO was before this committee a number of weeks ago, she said:</p> <blockquote> 	We are on the record and have said from the outset that when we have 6,000 staff out sick and we have an unpaid workforce of 1,500, what do people think they are doing?  I do not accept, nor do they, that they are standing in a supervisory capacity and not engaged in the business of work.  Of course they are working and they are not getting paid.   </blockquote> <p>She said that when the Minister was asked at a meeting on 8 February with the same union whether he was going to revert to the March agreement, his answer was &quot;No&quot;.  Is the Minister's answer still &quot;No&quot;?  Is it the case that he will not revert to the March agreement?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.498" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#C00900"><p>To be clear, what happened last March was that the clinical placements were stopped and the students had to make up that time later in the year.  The clinical placements were stopped and the supervising senior nurses were then deployed into the healthcare system.  About one in three students who were on placement where the placements were paused came back as healthcare assistants and were employed as healthcare assistants.  What is important is that under the EU directive, that time cannot count towards their clinical placement and degree.  My understanding is that a lot of work was done to make up that time.  To some extent, what happened last March did happen so the HSE did request that the clinical placements for the first, second and third years be paused and I accepted that request.  They were paused for a short number of weeks.  We wanted to pause them for as short a period of time as possible.  It was at the time when the need for qualified nurses was at its greatest so they were redeployed accordingly.  As per March, some hospitals did engage with students and brought them back as healthcare assistants.  Essentially, with regard to last March, to some extent, although it will not be perfectly comparable, what happened again was that the clinical placements were paused and some students came back as healthcare assistants and were paid as healthcare assistants.  I know the Department, the HSE and the higher education authorities are now working to find opportunities for those students to make up that clinical placement time.</p></speech>

There is universal political support for dealing with this once and for all.  I hear what the Minister is saying about the second review that will look at the long-term implications.  There are many more questions I need to ask.  I will get to the next question but I would ask the Minister to engage urgently with the healthcare trade unions involved and resolve this issue once and for all.</p></speech>

Unless we keep on top of the virus and unless we can keep the numbers down low, that will present more challenges for our healthcare system.  The best we can do is to make sure that the overall strategy is correct in terms of the public health strategy and all of the tools that we have at our disposal are working.  Why, according to the latest figures that I have got, was there a target for 2,000 swabbers and contact tracers to be employed yet only 1,577 are currently employed?  Why is the HSE not even meeting its own targets for staffing and for capacity when we know that testing and tracing will become very important again as the numbers become lower?  Can the Minister explain why he has set a target of 2,000 swabbers and contact tracers yet, despite all the sacrifices that people have made by abiding by public health restrictions, the State has not met it?</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for that question.  I will get Deputy Cullinane a detailed response as to the gap between the target and the full-time staff.  The Deputy will forgive me, as I do not have the detail.  It is not one of the topics that the committee asked us to discuss today and I do not have those exact figures in front of me.  I understand the HSE is coming in next week and will have those details for the committee.</p> <p>  The testing and tracing system that has been put in place by the HSE has done extremely well and compares favourably by international standards.  It is for another day.  I note some of the highly critical remarks that the Deputy has made publicly about the HSE's testing and tracing system and I would respectfully suggest that they do not stand up.  The Deputy's remarks are at odds with the facts.  The HSE has not got it all right.  It would not claim to have got it all right but under the circumstances, it has done a very good job.  With respect, some of the criticism has been very unfair.</p> <p>  In good news, again, on testing and tracing, we have had a very significant increase in genome sequencing of positive tests.  In fact, the numbers have gone from 1% of positive tests being genome sequenced to now 15%.  We will be looking to increase that further within the realm of all of these new variants.  That is why it is so important.</p> <p>  I would be delighted to come back to the committee in the near future and have a detailed conversation about rapid testing.  It is something we discussed previously.  I appointed an expert group to do a short piece of work on it.  It is chaired by Professor Mark Ferguson, who is the Government's chief scientific adviser and the head of Science Foundation Ireland.  They will be reporting back to me soon on that.</p> <p>  In terms of the regular testing and tracing, or polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing, in response to Deputy Cullinane, the NPHET advice has been changing; for example, we are now going back to testing close contacts, and there is more NPHET advice coming on further improvements to the testing and tracing system.</p></speech>

We had all of the healthcare unions before us a number of weeks ago.  There was much understandable frustration where they were representing their members who felt - in my view, rightly so - overworked, exhausted and at burnout.  I want to relay to the Minister one remark that was made by the representative of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association: "There is no doubt that we are facing a tsunami of missed or late care.  Unlike the Covid crisis, we know exactly the scale of this."  The representative further stated: "There is no doubt the public health system as structured does not have the capacity, either in terms of personnel or in terms of infrastructure and beds, to deal in a timely fashion with the tsunami."  The Minister himself referenced all of the cancelled care and all of the care that is on hold.  We all accept that is the case.</p> <p>  We also heard that there are hundreds of thousands of hospital appointments that did not happen this year to date, and possibly will not for the rest of this year - they certainly did not happen last year - that will add to the problems as well.  Can the Minister set out what additional capacity will be put in place because we cannot expect those on the front line, who are exhausted and at breaking point, to continue to provide the service that we need and to try to deal with all the levels of catch-up care that will need to be done without sufficient additional capacity?</p> <p>  A hospital manager at University Hospital Waterford in my constituency told me the hospital made an application for a rapid build 72-bed modular unit with single isolation rooms, which is what the healthcare unions are telling us they need, and it has not received the funding.  It was not approved in the capital plan.  Hospitals are making the applications for funding to ensure that they have the capacity to deal with these issues and it is not being provided.  What additional capacity will be put in place to deal with this tsunami of missed care that is coming at us, and can the Minister outline when all of that care that has paused will be resumed?  If the Minister does not have the answers to hand, can he send on a detailed note on timeframes as to when that care would be recommenced?</p></speech>

He has approximately one minute, if that is okay.</p></speech>

Between us all, we could not overstate the challenge in terms of the waiting lists, the unmet care and the missed care.  The challenges we face are very significant.  We are responding in various ways but, obviously, within a very challenging Covid context.</p> <p>  The first place to look is the national service plan, which is now up online.  We have broken the additional funding into a few different areas.  On increasing capacity, for example, we are looking at an additional 1,146 inpatient beds, increasing the critical care beds - up to 321 is the plan for the end of the year - 135 sub-acute beds and 1,250 community beds, including 600 new rehabilitation beds, and the very significant staffing that has to go with all of that.  There are big capacity increases as well in community care, social care, mental health, disability, wellness, etc.  I am probably out of time but I am happy to send the committee a detailed note and engage further with the committee.</p> <p>  Could I end this response by asking something of the committee in return?  The scale of the challenge we face, in terms of the waiting lists we already had coupled with everything that has happened with Covid, is completely unprecedented and nobody has all the right answers.  I would very much value the committee's view.  I do not know if the committee will hold sessions or, indeed, has held sessions on this.  If the committee has views, that it would like to sit down on, do a report on, etc., that the Government, the Department or the HSE should be taking on board, I ask it to let us know because the task ahead is bigger than any one entity and the more people we have trying to solve it, the better.</p></speech>

Our hands have been tied given the amount of time that we have had to meet.  We will try to address that at some stage.  I call Deputy Lahart.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.514" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#E00100"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for giving his time to the committee.  I pay tribute also to the Ministers of State, Deputies Rabbitte and Butler, who have been available at any hour of the day or night over the last six or seven months to answer myriad questions, and to the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, who is also very obliging.</p> <p>  I want to pay tribute to the Minister's temperament during what he has described as &ndash; I know it is a clich&eacute; &ndash; the tsunami of issues and events, the ups and the downs, that face him as Minister.  I want to acknowledge the courteous and mild-mannered way he has dealt with everything.  I also welcome the opportunity we get in the committee to tease things out in a little more detail with him, and not in the combative way that is so typical of the D&aacute;il Chamber, even in the Convention Centre.</p> <p>  I want to echo the comments made in regard to the student nurses.  I made those points in a parliamentary party meeting and the Minister is familiar with them.  I welcome the comments the Minister has made here so I do not need a response from him.  However, I ask him to always bear in mind that this cohort of student nurses, as I know he knows, never envisaged what they would be thrown into.  Without them, the health system, particularly in regard to Covid, while it would not have collapsed, would certainly have had its foundations seriously shaken.  I ask the Minister to take into account the uniqueness of the circumstances they have faced and how they have risen to the challenge.  The Minister does not need to come back on that.</p> <p>  I also thank the Minister's officials and the HSE.  These are unprecedented times and this is an invisible virus, although we often lose sight of that in the midst of our own anger, frustration, anxiety, despair and distress.  When we do not have an outlet at which to direct those feelings, obviously, they get directed at the person who politically carries the can, and that is just part of the job description, I guess.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, review.  A different cohort of people contact politicians every day and we are told, for example, that we dealt with the kidney transplant people and those on dialysis as a result of public representations, which was welcome.  However, each week is going to see new cohorts of people and these have started to come into our inboxes in the last few days, suggesting that different categories need to be prioritised.  Is the recent NIAC review the end of that process?  Is it the objective that abundant supply, beginning to arrive from early April, will begin to handle all of the other groups?</p></speech>

Is it the end of the NIAC review?  Absolutely not.  NIAC is reviewing on a weekly basis and on a daily basis.  We are learning new things all the time, new studies are being published and new decisions are being made.  For example, Professor Butler, who is the chair of NIAC, was referencing with me at a session recently a new study from NHS Scotland.  From memory, she said it showed the performance of AstraZeneca and the MRNA vaccines was quite similar, and more similar than in the clinical trials, so that is relevant.  The data coming out of Israel are highly relevant in terms of reductions in hospitalisations in different age groups, and various reports have been published out of the UK as well.  NIAC is constantly looking at that.  For example, it considers what age groups are appropriate for the AstraZeneca vaccine.  France made a decision either today or yesterday around increasing the age groups for AstraZeneca.  New evidence is being looked at in terms of the timing for Pfizer or the MRNA vaccines, for example.  At a medical or scientific level, NIAC is conducting what we call a rolling review.</p></speech>

What it is now looking at is the next and very large grouping, which is key workers, for example, family carers.  Many people have been advocating on behalf of family carers and I have a lot of sympathy for them, particularly family carers of children, who I believe are caught between two stools at the moment.  One of the things NIAC is now looking at is key workers, including, for example, the role they play in supporting healthcare or the vaccination programme itself, or other essential activities, such as education, caring and so forth.</p></speech>

I am happy with a written answer on this.  I have no doubt this issue exists and that it is legitimate.  Could the Minister give some of the categories of essential workers who must travel in and out of Ireland on a daily, weekly or monthly basis - some kind of categories or a brief overview of that?  We have never got them.  We know about the fruit pickers, and that is one, but what other kinds of people are coming into the country on the basis that the country cannot function without their presence here?</p></speech>

The latest briefing I have from the HSE is that a large majority of those aged 85 and older will have received their first vaccination by the end of this week.  There will be some who are housebound for whom individual solutions are being put in place.  Some who are housebound have already been vaccinated and in some cases, I understand, GPs will be calling to houses and the National Ambulance Service will be involved, and there may be more solutions as well.  What I am told this morning is that the large majority of those aged 85 and older will have received their first dose by the end of Sunday.</p></speech>

He inherited the issue, as I think the committee acknowledges.  Is it time that some sort of mediative process was introduced into the national children's hospital debate?  It is dragging on.  It is going on in the background and there is a kind of slinging going on from both sides.  It seems to me it requires a good, strong, experienced political-business head to bring these two parties in and basically get them to deliver what we all want to see delivered.  I want to emphasise the Minister inherited this but it is he who is going to have to deal with it.  What is his view on that?</p></speech>

There is a lot of work going on.  The development board, I believe, very successfully resisted a lot of claims from the contractor.  I do not have the numbers with me but, as I understand it, the amounts awarded by the appeals mechanism or mediation mechanism as part of the contract are very small relative to the awards being made.</p><p>In fairness to both sides, things were further complicated by Covid.  The site was shut down and it was then slow to get back up.  I was not satisfied with the speed with which it started up again, but it did start back up.  Unfortunately, because of Covid there will be delays as there are to all major construction projects.  There is a mediation process, although "mediation" might not be the right legal word. There is an independent mechanism in place which the hospital development board and the contractor use for these claims.  They can always escalate a matter to the courts if they need to.  We should certainly not rule out the idea Deputy Lahart has tabled, should it be needed.</p></speech>

The fortnightly sessions in the D&aacute;il on the vaccine programme have not been terribly satisfactory because it is hard to get answers in that forum.  I asked the Minister some time ago if he would commit to providing figures on the actual delivery of vaccines into this country.  The Minister did this once in the briefings but we have not had anything since.  It appears from the figures that I have been able to put together that there is a substantial gap between the number of vaccines delivered to Ireland, across the three vaccines, and the number actually administered.  This is how it appears to me.  I hope that it is not accurate but we simply do not know.  For this reason, I ask the Minister to give a commitment to provide the daily figures for the vaccines that have been administered and the vaccines that are actually delivered and in this country.  Will the Minister commit to doing that please?</p></speech>

I do not know whether we could produce the delivery figures daily.  The Deputy and others asked for the figures for daily doses administered, which we are providing in the data hub and on the app.  I believe all members of the committee and all Members of the Oireachtas are getting a daily briefing.  I can certainly take up the Deputy's request.  On the core of her question on whether there is a big gap, as of now, we have received 520,000 vaccines and by the end of the week, the forecast is that we will have administered approximately 500,000.  We can take from those figures that the amount being kept is very small indeed.  We are expecting an additional amount of vaccines from AstraZeneca this week.  It has not arrived yet.</p></speech>

That is why we need up-to-date accurate figures.  The figures do not tally as of now and it is important that we have accuracy.</p> <p>  Previous speakers referred to our meeting a few weeks ago with the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association.  All three organisations spoke of the crisis in recruitment and retention.  That crisis existed before Covid ever appeared and the pressures of Covid have hugely exacerbated it.  There are already a lot of data.  The Health Research Board has done a review of the reasons hospital doctors leave.  The Medical Council did a review.  The framework for safe nurse staffing also sets out a number of reasons.  Why does the service plan not contain a major recruitment and retention strategy that is funded?  Will the Minister commit to producing such a strategy given the urgency of the situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.535" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#F00600"><p>The short answer is "Yes".  Many important elements have been agreed for this year, one of which is the very important framework for safe staffing for nurses, as referenced by Deputy Shortall.  There were huge benefits on the pilot sites where it was done.  I have told the HSE that the Government wants staffing and the increase in nursing levels to be done in line with the safe staffing framework.  Based on the pilot projects, this will have a big effect.</p> <p>  Another element, one for which the Deputy deserves great credit, is the Sl&aacute;intecare contract, which we are moving ahead with.  As the Deputy and I have discussed in the committee previously, this will be the only game in town.  It will be a public-only contract and will be for all new hires.  My hope is that many existing consultants will also move across.  I believe the Deputy and I share that understanding.</p> <p>  We have talked about the NCHDs and significant work is required to treat our NCHDs better.  The IHCA and IMO have told me that some of the issues are contractual and some will be solved simply by hiring enough people.  One of the problems is that when there are not enough consultants, and we do not have enough of them, they are, on an individual basis, simply under too much pressure.</p></speech>

This is critical for chronic illness generally but also for the whole issue of nurse and midwife-led care right across all care settings.  When can we expect to see some real progress in that area?</p></speech>

There is a commitment in Sl&aacute;intecare to move that out of hospitals and into nurse-led care within primary care.  When will we see action in that area?</p></speech>

Some of that would have been taken under the previous Government.  The chronic disease management agreement with the GPs was put in place by the previous Government.  It was activated through this year and further ramped up in the winter plan.  It is also being further ramped up in the national service plan.</p></speech>

We need to start implementing Sl&aacute;intecare in a serious way.  I must say that the service plan this year is disappointing in that respect.</p> <p>  My next question is on public health doctors and the pertinent need to have proper retrospective tracing.  When will we see a resolution of the public health doctors' issue?</p></speech>

I know from the Sl&aacute;intecare team and some of the testimony the team gave to the committee that its view is that this budget is very much a Sl&aacute;intecare budget.  They are very excited by Sl&aacute;intecare and spoke very highly of it.  Obviously, the Deputy and I just have different views on that, which is fine.</p> <p>  I want the consultant contract for public health doctors to be put in place as quickly as possible.</p><p>The IMO and the Department are meeting next week on exactly that.</p></speech>

Last week, a group of experts and varying different disciplines of doctors appeared before the committee.  They made a compelling case for the recommendation of a minimum level of vitamin D supplementation.  Will the Minister give that some serious consideration?  It seems that it has been put on the back boiler by NPHET.  There is, however, compelling evidence from other countries, particularly Finland.  We need all the help we can get in terms of our ability to respond to the threat of Covid-19.  Can the Minister please address that issue?</p></speech>

NPHET has published a paper on it, which I will ask the Department to send on to the committee.</p> <p>  My non-medical synopsis of the paper is that it was very positive about vitamin D generally in boosting the immune system.  I may be wrong on this, but, from memory, I believe its conclusion was that there was not evidence specifically linking it to a higher resistance to Covid-19.  I will ask for the paper to be sent to committee members, however.</p></speech>

Anybody at the committee who listened to the evidence presented by that group of experts last week cannot but believe we need to make clear recommendations on that to the public in respect of Covid-19.  I ask the Minister to please brief us on that issue.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Hourigan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.549" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#G00600"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I wish the Minister and the Ministers of State, who are in the room with him, a good afternoon.  I want to ask the Minister about the requirements HSE staff are being asked to meet to volunteer for the vaccination teams.</p> <p>  I have been contacted by an employee of Crumlin hospital who has responded to a call for people to join the vaccination team in Citywest, which is being run by the Dublin Midland Hospital Group.  Like many of her colleagues, she feels she could spare some time for vaccination in addition to her existing work, which is incredible considering the pressure staff are under.</p> <p>  Despite being employed by the HSE, working on the front line and being registered with the appropriate medical body, she is being asked by the HSE to do the following: No. 1, supply proof of police clearance for any country resided in for more than a period of six months; No. 2, start a Garda vetting process; No. 3, provide name and contact details of three references; No. 4, provide a notarised copy of two forms of photographic proof of identification; No. 5, provide a notarised statutory declaration; No. 6, provide a verification of service by her current and previous employers; No. 7, fill out an employee set-up form, pension deduction form and section 51 form of the public services pension; No. 8, complete an occupational health assessment; No. 9, provide a copy of registration and qualifications; and No. 10, supply a work permit, if required.</p> <p>  I realise how important it is to get this right and ensure staff are appropriately qualified.  This seems unnecessarily bureaucratic, however.  Perhaps we are flush with qualified vaccination staff but my fear is that the vaccine roll-out may be slowed down by a lack of qualified staff.  Does the Minister believe those requirements are onerous and may act as a barrier to the recruitment of volunteer vaccination staff?  Does he feel that we can rationalise that process in any way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.550" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#G00700"><p>That does not sound right to me at all.  I will raise it directly with the HSE.  We need as many vaccinators as possible.  The last time I looked at the figures, I believe approximately 7,700 vaccinators had been trained.  The number is probably higher now.  I received the report some time ago.  However, it includes GPs, pharmacists and the vaccination teams we have in place.  I would like dentists brought on board as well.  People are suggesting optometrists and others and exactly the type of volunteers the Deputy mentioned.  It must be appropriate and we need to put in place whatever safeguards are required.  Certainly, however, what the Deputy has read out, if it is about an existing clinician within the HSE, certainly sounds a little over the top.</p></speech>

There may be reasons particular things must be followed.  I will certainly ask the HSE to take a look at that, however.  It sounds like a lot.</p></speech>

One of the questions I asked related to the use of GPs as the primary referral into the vaccination programme.  I highlighted the fact that many people in Ireland do not have a relationship with, or access to, a GP.  We all know we are relatively short on GPs in this country.  That is particularly relevant in communities where people are experiencing lower incomes.  Those who have chronic conditions, however, might have a closer relationship with a nurse practitioner in an outpatient clinic or with their own consultants.  I believe there was a discussion that, perhaps, the referral system would be broadened to include or allow for referrals from consultants or nurse practitioners in outpatient clinics.  Is there any update on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.554" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#G01100"><p>If anyone in any of the cohorts being done now or that will be done next, which are the high-risk, very high-risk and underlying condition categories, has any worry about not being contacted by a GP, they or a family member can make a telephone call to 185 024 1850.  As the Deputy quite rightly said, not everyone has a GP and not everyone is on a list.  I know in my constituency in Wicklow, for example, it was impossible for a long time to even get on a list for a GP, such was the shortage of supply.</p> <p>  I see no issue why consultants could not refer.  I know at the moment, based on NIAC's latest clinical advice on the very high-risk category, the HSE is working with the consultant body to identify its patients who would meet the various criteria and, therefore, it may well be that the consultants have a role to play with that cohort.</p> <p>  Ultimately, when we move to bigger population levels, people will be able to essentially sign up online themselves through a portal.  Not yet, however, but when we get to the wider general population cohorts.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions, the first of which is with regard to vaccines offered to countries outside the EU.  For example, there was a report in the<i>Business Post</i>recently regarding Russia offering the Sputnik V vaccine to Ireland.  There is also a vaccine from China, and one from Cuba, which is off-patent.</p><p>To date, have the Irish Government and HSE been offered vaccines that were sourced outside the European Union?</p></speech>

We are following the process as part of the EU.  Our regulator is the European Medicines Agency, EMA.  I can tell the Deputy from an update I received yesterday that the EMA is looking at some of these other vaccines, which are not the ones we have all been talking about.  That is happening.  We actually have quite a lot ourselves, however.  For example, the three of which we are all aware, because they are now actively being deployed, are Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca.  We are also quite aware of Janssen or Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson.  Hopefully, that will be coming soon.  It has a very high effectiveness and is a single dose.  I hope the EMA will make a decision on that very soon.</p> <p>  We have also signed up to three further vaccines, which are CureVac, Valneva and Novavax and, therefore, in our own advance purchase agreements, we now have seven vaccines.  I believe that comes to approximately 18.5 million doses, and because Janssen is a single dose and the others are double dose, this will vaccinate a little more than 10 million people.</p><p>Yes, the European Medicines Agency, EMA, is looking more broadly as well at other potential vaccines.</p></speech>

This week, there is a crucial vote on the suspension of patents and intellectual property rights and if that happens it will give the less developed countries access to vaccines.  I hope that anybody on the health committee would agree with giving as many people as possible access to vaccines.  If the suspension happens then it could free up pharmaceutical companies, particularly in the European Union, to make these vaccines and make them available to as many people as possible.  That is important because the fewer people who are vaccinated then the more chance there is of variants and so forth.  I am talking about a hypothetical situation and I hope that Ireland votes in favour of the suspension.  If it happens would the Minister, as a member of Government, direct the pharmaceutical industry, which is quite wide in this country, to immediately ramp up production of a vaccine that is off patent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.559" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#H00300"><p>I would agree with the Deputy on the objective.  This has to be a global vaccination programme.  The reality right now is that the developed or richer world is buying up the global stock, and there is no question about that.  Even if some of the stock was available for some other parts of the world very serious supports will need to be put in place in terms of healthcare supports, logistics, supply chains and a lot of other things.  Yesterday, there was a meeting of EU health ministers.  On behalf of Ireland, one of the calls that I added to that was that Europe would be the leader in terms of global justice on vaccinations and that was for two reasons.  The first is ethical as I think we have a moral obligation to help and, second, is enlightened self-interest.  There is no point in us vaccinating ourselves or Europe or America vaccinating itself if large swathes of the world are unvaccinated.  That simply does not work as a strategy.  For those two reasons we probably share the same end goal.</p> <p>  In terms of whether suspending intellectual and patent rights is the right way to go, what would have to be borne in mind is what happens the next time.  Undoubtedly, there are enough vaccines out there right now that if IP was suspended across the world generic producers all over the world could produce a huge amount of vaccine very quickly.  That is my sense of what would happen but here is the other question that we would have to think through.  What happens when there is a mutation that requires very serious investment in an updated vaccine or vaccines, or if an entirely new disease hits us in one year's or three years' time?  We would have to be very clear that if we suspend it at this time, the very same companies that we have relied on to produce all of these vaccines would not just say the next time that they would not do because the previous time we suspended their IP.  That consideration would have to be given very serious thought.        </p></speech>

The private sector did not create them themselves even though they will profit hugely from them.  Public moneys have gone into vaccines so they should benefit the public.</p> <p>  Last Thursday, we informally spoke about the HSE service plan and the funding for the medical cannabis access programme.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.  What funding is available?  When could the programme commence?  I hope that it is this year so people can for the first time get medical cannabis under prescription. </p></speech>

As he will be well aware, there are two avenues to access these particular treatments.  One is the ministerial licence scheme, which been active to date.  Since 2016, when the scheme was brought in, 144 licences have been approved for 55 separate patients.</p> <p>  What the Deputy and I have focused on is the medicinal cannabis access programme, MCAP.  It was based on a 2017 Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, scientific review.  The programme was put in place but never funded so it could not be used and I am activating that this year.  My Department has estimated that several million euro will be required but we do not know the exact figure yet.  Covid has complicated things a bit because of exports from Holland.  What the HSE and the Department have done, for which they deserve great credit, is to have deliveries made direct to patients' homes.  What I think we both want to see is for MCAP to be put in place as quickly as possible, and it is funded for this year, so that deliveries are made to local pharmacies for the patients, which will be a gamechanger.  I have no doubt that I, the Deputy and others will debate some of the other products from the Netherlands that, to date, had not been considered for inclusion; Bedrocan is one that we will all be familiar with and I think we need to look at that.  What I am told is that the Dutch authorities do not permit their commercial export at this time but that is something we should continue to engage on.  </p></speech>

In political life one is never thanked for what is done or is positive but one will always be blamed for mistakes or be questioned about them.</p> <p>  I have questions on the vaccine roll-out.  Every dose that is administered is a positive.  I know that there is a great vaccination plan that will be rolled out over the next number of weeks and months, including up to 1 million doses in April that will be administered.  People over 85 and, indeed, over 70 in hospitals who await vaccination - and I am sure there are cases all over the country but I hope that it is a small number - were told following inquiries to hospital management that they must wait, that supplies are not available and that vaccination has to be done in the community.  When will people over 85 and, indeed, over 70 in hospitals be vaccinated?</p> <p>  The community GP roll-out is going well but I understand that some GP practices have not yet received vaccine supplies.  That might be a small number but I do not know.  Certainly,  I have been made aware of cases.  As a result, their list of patients over 85 and over 70 are not getting calls but I know that neighbouring doctors are currently vaccinating patients in their 60s.</p> <p>  I know that at least two offshore islands - Inis Me&aacute;in of the Aran Islands and Inisbofin - have received no vaccines for people who over 75 or 85.  I have advocated that we vaccinate all of the cohorts on the islands because it would be easy to vaccinate these small populations quickly.</p> <p>  In terms of the nursing home and healthcare sector, I wish to inquire about healthcare assistant staff.  I know that the occupation list for employment is being reviewed at the moment by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Has the Minister and the Department liaised or engaged about this matter?  The role is notoriously difficult to fill and requires the right candidate with a suitable skill set and caring disposition.  As we know, such people might not always be available even though there is a high number of people on the live register at the moment.</p> <p>  Finally, I wish to refer to nurses who have left the profession for childcare purposes, etc. and have not returned to the workplace in the past five or ten years.  What engagement would the Minister or the Department advocate to get some of these nurses back into front-line services?  I know it is not always easy to do such work and these nurses as they get older may not be able to perform nursing duties.  If these people are available but require some retraining or upskilling, can that be considered?</p></speech>

The good news is the forecast that by the end of this week we will have administered more than 500,000 vaccine doses.  Great credit goes to our vaccination teams across the country, as well as to the GPs, the practice nurses, the Defence Forces and so on.  There have been so many people involved and it has been a huge effort.  Has it gone flawlessly?  No, of course not, neither here nor in any other country that I can see.  However, it has gone very well and I am told that, by the end of this week, the large majority of 85s and over will have received their first dose.  It is worth acknowledging the efforts across the country.  People are working seven days a week.</p> <p>  To the Senator's question on the islands, the Air Corps has been directly involved in delivering vaccines to several islands.  I will check in with the HSE on exactly what the plan is for the islands he referenced.  It is wonderful to see.  It has been a real all-Ireland approach.</p> <p>  With regard to GP practices, I am aware of the situation as well.  GPs have been in contact with many Deputies and Senators to say they have not got the vaccine yet.  The majority of the GP practices were scheduled for this week so most of that will be addressed this week.  I have no doubt, given the scale of the programme, there may still be a number who say they did not get it in certain locations.  The HSE is working hard to that end.  It holds regular WebEx sessions for the entire general practice community, with thousands of GPs getting involved.  Part of the frustration some of the GPs have had is, if we look at it another way, due to the fantastic demand.  One thing that has stood out for Ireland is the very high acceptance rate and demand for these vaccines, much higher than some other countries.  It is fantastic to see.</p> <p>  On the 85s and over in hospital, logistically I see no reason.  Perhaps there is a reason the HSE has identified.  I wonder if there are clinical reasons for them to say they prefer the patients to be discharged in the community.  I will check in with the HSE and revert to the Senator on that.</p> <p>  On nurses who have taken a leave of absence, a career break or who have simply left, it will be part of the considerations for this year because we have ambitious targets in terms of nursing and other clinical grades across the system.  One of my hopes is that, as we scale up and hit the safe staffing levels, some of the awful pressure nurses and midwives have been under will be relieved.  If the pilots are anything to go by in terms of safe staffing, they made a huge difference to the clinicians, nurses and midwives involved.  Absenteeism and sickness fell while job satisfaction went way up.  That might be one of the ways.  We need a public health system that people enjoy working in and that supports our staff.  I have spoken with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, about healthcare assistants in nursing homes and she will revert to the Senator with a detailed written reply on that, if that is okay.</p></speech>

On the over 85s, I checked in with one hospital which told me it is not getting vaccine supplies.  They are all in the vaccination centres or in GP clinics, so they do not have supplies in the hospitals and cannot administer, which seems strange to me.  One individual I was working on behalf of has been in hospital for 22 days.  Her son has been on to me and has said she is aged 89.  He wants her vaccinated and the hospital tells me it does not have vaccinations and that it has to be out in the community.</p></speech>

A patient in an acute hospital setting would be vaccinated in the community because he or she might be not there for the second vaccine.  I was told that is the reasoning.  A patient might be there for 12,14 or 16 days but they are not vaccinated in the hospital setting.  That person would be vaccinated in the community.  If a new entrant goes into a nursing home who has not been vaccinated, we will not go back into the nursing homes on a weekly or two-weekly basis.  We cannot do that.  They would have to receive the vaccine through their GP.  That is my understanding regarding acute hospitals.</p></speech>

Surely a small number of individuals can be vaccinated in the hospital and have their local GP follow up.  Their families will look after that and ensure that in X number of days, they are brought to the GP.  They need the first vaccine.  If they are willing to take it, of that age and in a hospital setting, it gives peace of mind to family. That policy should be looked at again if possible.</p></speech>

What else would I talk about?  The reason given for our inability to pay student nurses and midwives is the EU directive.  However, every year 18 to 20 students in every class are sponsored by the Government to undertake nursing and they are paid a salary throughout the four years at a healthcare assistant level.  How is that square with what the Minister said about the EU directive that does not for allow them to be paid or for those paid hours to count towards their training?  If the issue is that they cannot be paid because of the EU directive, would it be reasonable to change the language and have a discussion about a decent bursary?  In the UK and Northern Ireland, there is a bursary of &pound;5,000 per year.  They are out of the EU now but that existed before they left so if there is a will there is a way.  Do we just need to change what we call it and then we could find a way forward?</p></speech>

On her first question, I will get her a detailed response.  It sounds like a contractual issue.  If I had to hazard a guess, which I am loath to do, I imagine it would be to do with pay that is specifically about the clinical placement.  However, I will get a detailed response from the Department as to why that would be.</p> <p>  With regard to a bursary, the Senator referenced England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  At the moment, someone studying nursing or midwifery in Ireland will be paid, I am told, &euro;17,400 over the four years. That is the amount they get paid during their time on placement.  In England, Scotland and Wales, I am told it is approximately 10,000 - it might be pounds - over three years.  The amount paid to the students over four years in Ireland is significantly in excess of the amount currently paid over three years in England, Scotland and Wales.  I do not know about the other jurisdictions but my understanding is that in Scotland that payment or some of it is means tested as well, so for some students it would be significantly less.  However, these are all fair questions and we have to make sure it is possible for people to complete their training.  We want them to have the best possible experience during their training and to be the best graduates they can be.  That creates something of a problem for us because they are highly valued around the world and other countries look to recruit them.  However, it means we get the best possible graduates coming into our system.  The review that is about to be kicked off, which is looking at structural issues around the placements, will consider exactly those issues.</p></speech>

I am interested in hearing how that tallies with the EU directive and how the arrangement does not work  There needs to be a conversation.  We need only listen to some of the points made, including here today, on why graduates are leaving.  It is all well and good for us to have the best education system in the world but if all our students are skedaddling out the door, we are not benefiting from it.  We keep going around in circles.  As I have said previously, it is just a bad business decision.  Maybe we need to-----</p></speech>

We want the students to stay.  If they are leaving en masse, we need to understand why.  If a student in Ireland is being paid significantly more than a student in England, Scotland or Wales while doing a degree at &euro;17,400 versus &euro;,10,000, according to the figures I have been given, it stands to reason that pay is not why they are leaving.  They are paid more here during their time of study.  We do need to understand, therefore, why they are dissatisfied when they leave the education system.  We need to fix that.</p></speech>

How much someone is being paid elsewhere is not going to affect student nurses other than to inform them they are perhaps being paid a different amount.  There is very clearly a problem.  I have told the Minister before that the Union of Students in Ireland has research on this.  The INMO and SIPTU also have research.  There is ample quantitative and qualitative research on the current circumstances of student nurses and midwives, why they are unhappy and their experiences in the workplace.  I would certainly support the Minister in doing more research but there is existing research on why students are dissatisfied.  Pay is the number one factor, and working conditions also feature.</p></speech>

I am sorry as I do not mean to be taking up the Senator's time.  In our very productive debate in the Seanad recently on her Bill, one of the questions I asked the Department was whether it could find for me any country in the world that paid more to students during their nursing and midwifery degrees than Ireland according to an arrangement not based on an apprenticeship model.  Germany, for example, undoubtedly pays more but it has an apprenticeship model.  At the time, the Department was not able to come back with any country that paid more.  If it is the case that Ireland is paying as much or more than any other country, it does not stack up that the amount paid while doing a degree is the reason students would choose to work in other countries.</p></speech>

Can the Minister give an update on the backlogs in the screening services, particularly for BreastCheck and CervicalCheck?  I realise this has not been flagged.  Does the Minister have an update on how the backlog will be dealt with?  People have been in touch with me to say they are very worried about it.</p></speech>

A number of meetings were clashing today.  Well done to the Minister.  I can see that he is surrounded by his Ministers of State.  Collectively, they are doing a really great job at a difficult time.  It is extremely difficult.  We are just a shade below peak crisis.  We had peak figures a few weeks ago and now the whole focus is on containing the situation, driving down intensive care numbers and, most important, getting the population vaccinated.  I will start on the latter point, making reference to the case of a 91-year-old constituent whose circumstances could arise anywhere in the country.  She is bedridden and cannot leave her home.  The local GP and health service have not full certainty on the parameters in respect of them leaving the local dispensary to go to her home to vaccinate.  Could the Minister clarify the position to some degree?  Is it possible to go to someone's home to vaccinate him or her right now?</p></speech>

It is such a positive announcement.  In total,18.5 million vaccines will be purchased by the Government.  Given that the plan for this year will be extensively implemented and Covid is not going away, has the Government a plan for the population to be vaccinated in a second round in 2022?</p></speech>

That is an excellent question.  The answer is that the experts do not know yet.  The scientific and medical communities around the world are waiting to find out how long the vaccines last.  It may differ for each vaccine and it may differ based on the intervals between vaccinations.  What I can say is that we have pre-ordered just under 18.5 million doses, as the Deputy mentioned.  If it is the case that boosters are required next winter or at the same time as the flu vaccination, or maybe this time next year, we would certainly have enough to provide them based on our current orders.  However, there is an additional complication, which is that the vaccines may need to be adjusted.  The flu vaccine we take every year is different each year.  It is based on different mutations of the flu coming across from Australia and that part of the world every year.  There is still a lot of uncertainty over whether we will need a rolling programme and, if so, what it will be like.</p></speech>

How does the Minister envisage international travel resuming?  As vaccination of the world population starts, we need to see a resumption of international travel, particularly aviation.  What does the Minister envisage in this regard beyond phase 5 of lockdown?</p></speech>

To an extent, Ireland and the rest of the world will have to wait and see.  The strategy right now is to put in place very robust controls around international travel.  Even before hotel quarantining is introduced, the measures we have in place will put us at the forefront of the EU.  When we introduce hotel quarantining, which will be here very soon as the legislation passed through the Seanad last night, we will have, by quite a stretch, the most robust quarantining and international travel measures anywhere in the EU, very much in line with the UK.  That is one part of the strategy.  At the same time, we need to continue aggressively suppressing the virus here.  Very good progress has been made, thanks to people sticking with level 5.  We got good, heartening evidence from the ESRI to the effect that while people have been finding it really tough, they have understood that we absolutely must keep going.</p> <p>  If the vaccines are delivered from April onwards, we will be able to administer in excess of 1 million doses per month.  If the supplies come in, it will have a big effect on case numbers in Ireland.  The chief clinical officer in the HSE gave figures some days ago indicating that the Covid infection rate among hospital staff had reduced by 95%, which must be partly due to the vaccines.  The big unknown is the variants.  What happens with variants around the world, their characteristics, the question of whether they are resistant or partially resistant to the vaccines, and their level of severity will influence, to an extent, the border controls we will have to keep in place.</p></speech>

My question focuses on mental health in respect of the HSE national service plan, so it may be for the Minister for State, Deputy Butler.  It pertains to transparency and accountability.  I must say that I am very pleased to see the attention to detail and focus on the Sharing the Vision report.  The report is groundbreaking and the focus is on closing the gaps and filling the multiple cracks that mental health services currently have.  I am very pleased to see that it is the main point of reference for the 2021 national service plan, as well as for Connecting for Life, Ireland's national strategy to reduce suicide.  It is most welcome.</p> <p>  One of the most fundamental parts of reforming the mental health services is taking on the critical task of driving transparency and accountability in the area of mental health investment and expenditure.  In particular, we must examine how and where the funding is allocated and what outcomes are achieved from this investment.  How should we do that going forward, as we implement these new commitments from the national service plan?  In other words, how do we ensure that these commitments are more than just promising words in a report?  Where will the extra &euro;20 million go in mental health supports?  How do we effectively show transparency when it comes to investment and expenditure going forward?  There is a whole clatter of questions there and I hope the Minister of State was able to catch them all.</p></speech>

She chairs the sub-committee on mental health and we have had several conversations in the Seanad and otherwise, and I want to thank her for her continued support.</p> <p>  She is quite right about Sharing the Vision, which is the new mental health policy for the next ten years.  It is a whole-of-government approach with strong service user and voluntary and community sector representation.  As the Senator knows, the national implementation monitoring committee was established in November 2020 and it has already at three times.  Various sub-committees will be set up in the next number of months to look specifically at issues in respect of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and minority groups.  For example, we are looking to set up a Travellers group.  We are also setting up another committee to look specifically at the challenges that women face in relation to their mental health.</p> <p>  However, the Senator is quite right that we need transparency and accountability.  The most important thing with a budget is ensuring that it is spent correctly.  I will provide some examples.  This week is national eating disorder awareness week.  Yesterday, I met with those involved in the national clinical programme, led by Dr. Michelle Clifford, to discuss eating disorders.  In the past three years, there was criticism that the budget was not spent sufficiently.  Some &euro;3.9 million will be spent this year on specialist eating disorder posts.  The three teams that are already in place, and which have not yet been fully populated, will be populated.  We are also seeking to set up a further two to three teams this year because currently, not all areas of the country are covered.  It is most important that we have that accountability.</p> <p>  The &euro;23 million that I secured in the budget with the support of the Minister means that 153 whole-time equivalent new staff will be put in place.  For example, 29 of them will be working with CAMHS to help support the waiting lists.  There are currently 2,500 children on the waiting lists.  Some 39 new posts will be put in place for adult crisis resolution services and there will be six new whole-time equivalent staff places for the clinical programmes for early intervention.  </p> <p>  As I said, I have already met representatives of the HSE on this issue, because the recruitment of stuff must happen in parallel with the Covid pandemic.  Last year, for example, many things fell away, because the situation was so new to us that we were learning.  As we know now that we have to live with Covid, the most important thing we can do is to ensure that the staff are recruited and that they are trained up quickly.  For example, the staff recruited to provide CAMHS supports may already be trained in providing adult mental health supports but they will have to be retrained to provide supports for children and adolescents.  It takes two to four months to recruit the staff.  Recruitment for the eating disorder teams and for CAMHS is already under way.</p></speech>

It concerns Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson one-dose Covid vaccine.  I know that the European Commission has stated that deliveries of this vaccine are expected to begin in early April 2021.  Can the Minister provide us with an update on this one-shot vaccine?  It does sound like an answer to our prayers, in one way.  What is the current strategy for the vaccine roll-out?  Does the Minister have a strategy for the roll-out of that particular vaccine?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.593" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#L00700"><p>The short answer is that we must await the guidance of the European Medicines Agency, EMA.  The process is as follows.  The vaccine is under consideration at the moment and we all hope that it is approved.  When it is approved, the EMA will issue highly technical guidance to our own experts here.  They look at that guidance and provide advice on the best way to use it.  For example, with the AstraZeneca vaccine, when the technical information was issued with the EMA's authorisation, NIAC looked at it and then made various recommendations to NPHET in respect of the age groups suitable for the AstraZeneca vaccine.  Therefore, we must await the guidance of the EMA.</p></speech>

I want to follow up on two questions.  First, I want follow up on Deputy Shortall's question regarding information on the vaccines.  The Minister worked in the private sector before going into politics.  To be quite frank, the flow of information on vaccines from the Department is not acceptable.  In the private sector it would not be tolerated.  I have been in touch with officials in the Department on this issue.  I want to know why a report cannot simply be issued on a Monday morning, containing information on the number of people vaccinated in the previous week, the number of vaccines delivered, and from which companies, and the number of vaccines in stock.  It is not rocket science.  I want an answer from the Minister as to why that cannot happen.  Can the Minister make it happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.595" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#L00900"><p>The Senator and other members of the committee have asked for daily numbers to be provided previously.  The daily numbers of people who have vaccinated, both first dose and second dose, are now available on the Covid data hub and on the Covid tracker app.  On top of that, I requested that a daily briefing go out to each Member of the Oireachtas as to what is happening with the vaccination programme.  Forgive me, if Members have not yet received them.  I hope that they have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.596" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#L01000"><p>The important point is that while we are getting the figures of the numbers who have been vaccinated, we also need information on the number of doses that have been delivered to the country in the previous week, and the number of doses that are in stock that have not been issued to GPs or other facilities for administration.  That is the transparency that we need.  It is easy to get the figures of how many have been vaccinated.  However, in my view, the transparency is needed in respect of the timeline of the delivery and distribution of the vaccines.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.597" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#L01100"><p>That is an issue that I am very happy to pick up with the task force and the HSE.  What I can say is that as of today, we have taken delivery of 520,320 vaccine doses.  It is forecast that approximately 500,000 will have been administered by the end of the week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.598" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#L01200"><p>As for my second question, we are holding this meeting online and it is working out pretty well.  It never ceases to amaze me that the Minister's officials and NPHET must hold in-person briefings twice a week, while other countries are holding such briefings online.</p><p>Does the Minister believe it is appropriate that NPHET would continue to hold face-to-face briefings with journalists in the Department of Health twice a week?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.600" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#M00200"><p>My understanding is that the meetings of NPHET, which I am told by survivors of NPHET can be marathon sessions that go on for many hours, are by visual communications, VC.  The Senator rightly points out, however, that the NPHET briefings with the media are face-to-face.  They follow very strict protocols.  Very few are allowed in the room.  I have been involved in a few of them.  There is physical distancing.  It is a big, well ventilated room but I would be more than happy to bring that perspective back.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.601" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#M00300"><p>I appreciate that because this is about leadership and setting a standard.  I have no doubt whatsoever that there are strict protocols in place but when we expect the rest of the country to use every mechanism possible to work from home, stay out of buildings and not to congregate, the inability of the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, the deputy CMO and other senior officials to embrace modern technology and hold their briefings virtually sends out a bad message.  Would the Minister agree with that?</p></speech>

I would agree that we have to be seen to lead by example; there is no question about that.</p></speech>

In a pandemic when we are dealing with people's fears and concerns, concise, real-time communication is very important.  Does he believe his Department has been up to standard when it comes to that type of communication?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.604" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#M00600"><p>We must always strive to do better.  There has been a good deal of commentary about the communications over the past while.  Some would argue that some of it was unfair.  Some of it is undoubtedly fair.  The public have a right to the very best information quickly and they have a right to clarity also because as the Senator said, people have been through a brutal year.  Many people have been very worried all year.  Many people are desperate to find out when they will be vaccinated.  We are dealing with a complex and fluid situation where the scientific information and information about the vaccines changes regularly.  The delivery schedules change a good deal.  The advice we are given from NIAC has changed on more than one occasion.  We try to find a balance between giving as much information as we can and not disappointing people, because some of that information gets updated and changed.  As to whether we can do better, we must always do better and communications are an essential part of both the vaccine programme and, as the Senator rightly said, the national response to Covid-19.</p></speech>

I have a brief question on third level education.  The Minister outlined the projected vaccination schedule for the country.  If that schedule goes according to the current plan will third level students be returning to the classrooms next September?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.607" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021030200002#M00900"><p>I do not believe anyone can accurately say right now what will happen in September.  If things go according to plan, both in terms of the suppression of the virus and the vaccine roll-out, and what is increasingly positive information about the effectiveness of these vaccines, we would certainly be in a very different and much better place next September.  There is no question about that.  However, we have to temper all of that with the fact that there are many unknowns and variations.  There are variants emerging now around the world.  They are being studied very rapidly.  The characteristics they will have in terms of increased transmissibility, increased severity, resistance to the vaccines is largely unknown.  For example, information emerged yesterday and today around initial looks at one of the variants that originated in South America in terms of effectiveness of vaccines, higher transmissibility and so forth.  All I can say is that if the vaccines arrive in Ireland to the agreed supplies and if the rest of the vaccines are authorised, by September the population would be largely vaccinated.  If we add to that the fact that these vaccines appear to be highly effective and way beyond the sort of protection we get from the influenza vaccine and if there were not variants arriving that had immunity or whatever the correct scientific word is that could evade these vaccines, we would be in a much more positive space in September.</p></speech>

There has been a major focus on getting primary school children, the leaving certificate classes and the other second level students back to education but we should focus then on getting the third level students back into the classroom.  I am aware that prolonged absences from the classroom have affected their mental health but also their education.  I would like the Minister's Department to do some kind of modelling on that, if possible, and give the students hope that they might get back to the classroom.  Online learning for third level education is not ideal and it has been a very difficult year for that cohort of people.  I know there are many variables and unknowns but if we could see some sort of modelling in respect of that elusive herd immunity there might be the possibility of all third level students returning to the classroom, which would be very helpful.  I thank the Minister for answering my question.</p></speech>

I will put them down for written answer, which is probably the best way of doing it.  My first question is on those who have other conditions who are now part of a backlog awaiting attention.  Have all of them had online discussions with their GP or consultant?  If only a portion of them have had such discussions, what is that portion?  That is important in terms of dealing with the backlog.  Arising from that, what plans are in place to handle that backlog?  If there are 800,000 on a list of some description there has to be a means of breaking down the numbers, attending to some of them more urgently than others and so on.  How is it proposed that that will be done?</p> <p>  Also, as we move towards the start-up of business again and all the community has been inoculated, are we aware of the fact that there will be a greater opportunity for health workers to emigrate to other jurisdictions?  Are we prepared for that and what are we prepared to do to try to ensure that does not happen?</p> <p>  The last question is on student nurses to which Senator Hoey referred already.  I find it difficult to understand how the existence of Covid-19 has not been regarded as an emergency in terms of the delivery of health services.</p><p>The question is whether the emergency is of sufficient urgency and severity to invoke other ways and means of dealing with the question of student nurses, who have a very understandable case and who feel more than a little disappointed.  They feel obscured by the activity around them when compared with the UK and EU.  I note the points made by the Minister on the higher level of pay and so forth but that does not take away from the fact that we are in this jurisdiction and we need to look at the matter again.</p></speech>

He asked if online and telemedicine is being used and it is.  It has been a real silver lining.  If necessity is the mother of all invention, telemedicine has come to the fore.  Many consultants who would not have used it previously are not only using it now but actively embracing it.  It is something that will continue and as distributed technologies, remote sensors and so forth become more prevalent, more will be possible.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how we will deal with the backlog and there are many different ways.  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to speak on this as she has led what is a spectacular success in respect of assessment of need.  I would love her to update the committee on that.  Essentially, there are at least two strands, with one strand building the permanent capacity in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of community-based care and so forth, and that is what the national service plan and winter plan are all about.  The second concerns the access to care fund, which comprises targeted interventions.  Last year, we were able to allocate &euro;7.8 million and the Minister of State has used this to specifically address the very serious backlog for children with assessment of need.  I will ask her to give the committee an update on that because thanks to her leadership, it has been an incredible success.</p></speech>

Last September, under Sl&aacute;intecare, we managed to get &euro;7.8 million as a targeted fund to specifically address assessments of need.  A plan was put in place between the Department and the HSE through the nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, with each CHO director of services putting a plan in place for the 6,500 young people under 18 who needed an assessment of need.  From September to date, 50% of that has been achieved, with more than 3,400 young people having an assessment of need delivered.</p> <p>  This was down to the initiative between the Department and the HSE in trying to use private providers over time and bringing back some redeployed staff who had been on testing and tracing duties.  Even during the second wave of level 5 restrictions and again in the current wave, we are still managing to get assessments of need done.  It has worked through the use of assisting technologies, as mentioned by the Minister, and there has been combined working between the section 38 and section 39 organisations.  There has also been support from schools when they have been open.  This month has been a little more of a challenge as we need on-school oversight.  It is nevertheless going very well.</p> <p>  It is important to finish on this note.  All the assessments of need for CHO 1 have been completed and I hope that in March two more CHOs will achieve the same target.  When we use targeted funding in combination between the Department and the HSE, we can really see the end result in this type of success.</p></speech>

The first is the review by Professor Tom Collins, who has made a series of recommendations to address the period during Covid-19.  I have accepted all those recommendations, including the option to backdate the payment to the start of September.  There is an ongoing conversation with the representative bodies and unions with the aim of reaching an agreed settlement.  I would very much like to implement that.</p> <p>  The second element is structural review to look at placements more broadly and address some of the real and serious questions that the Deputy, Senator Hoey and other committee members have raised today and previously.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for its invitation and look forward to assisting it in its pre-legislative scrutiny of the affordable housing Bill.</p> <p>  All local authorities, along with approved housing bodies, perform an extensive range of housing services, including a multibillion euro programme of new social housing construction across all parts of the country.  In the ten-year period up to 2008, local authorities delivered more than 26,000 affordable homes and they have extensive experience and knowledge of affordable housing as a result.</p> <p>  While the emphasis over the past number of years has been on social housing delivery, local authorities welcome the new affordable housing Bill.  Affordable housing delivers homes to middle-income earners facing housing affordability challenges.  When built along with social housing units, it enhances the sustainability of these communities.  The addition of cost-rental affordable housing to the delivery methods available to local authorities is also welcomed.</p> <p>  The majority of the Bill's provisions are amendments to Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  They relate to intended improvements in the areas of assessment of purchaser eligibility, scheme of priority, charging period and the role of the Land Development Agency.  Other key provisions cover cost-rental and the affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  The CCMA is of the opinion that measures in the Bill, in particular heads 3 to 8, inclusive, will give greater clarity and certainty to both local authorities and prospective purchasers.</p> <p>  The primary delivery mechanism enabling local authorities to deliver affordable housing is the serviced site fund.  To date, funding of almost &euro;188 million has been approved in principle in support of 38 infrastructure projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of almost 4,000 more affordable homes.  Of these 140 homes will be delivered this year, with an additional 700 in 2022 and a further 1,500 in 2023.</p> <p>  It is important to note that the serviced site fund is provided to support the cost of infrastructure associated with the construction of new affordable purchase homes on local authority lands.  However, the financial ability of local authorities to deliver affordable housing at scale is dependent upon a simplified serviced site fund bridging the entire gap between the full cost of provision of housing by a local authority and the affordable selling price.  The CCMA and the housing delivery co-ordination office are in discussions with the Department in this regard.</p> <p>  The timeframe for the delivery of such projects must accommodate detailed design, the consultation process, planning, procurement and construction.  As with all large projects of this type, the nature and scale of the developments will generally evolve as plans are progressed by local authorities.  The provision of affordable housing by local authorities utilising funding via a simplified serviced site fund will allow local authorities progress development of larger mixed-tenure housing schemes delivering social, affordable purchase and affordable rental housing.</p> <p>  However, it should also be pointed out that local authorities are still dealing with the legacy of previous affordable housing programmes before 2011.  Currently local authorities have approximately 2,000 unsold affordable dwellings with associated unfunded costs of approximately &euro;350 million.  While all these dwellings are currently occupied as social housing units, these legacy issues require resolution.</p> <p>  Local authorities are currently assessing their remaining housing land banks and will be acquiring land over the next number of years upon which to further deliver social and affordable housing.  Consideration is required on how best to fund these land purchases in order not to disproportionately impact on other local authority general services.</p> <p>  The CCMA is of the opinion that local authorities are best placed to assess the level of demand for affordable housing in their functional areas.  It has been working with the Department on setting targets.</p> <p>  The CCMA welcomes the measures in the affordable housing Bill.  Coupled with the serviced site fund, it will allow local authorities deliver affordable housing in conjunction with the other suite of measures in the programme for Government.</p></speech>

I invite Mr. Declan Dunne of the Housing Alliance to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.623" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021030200002#A00500"><p>The Housing Alliance thanks the Chair, Deputy Matthews, and the committee members for inviting us to discuss the issue of affordable housing.  Cost-rental is the one that applies mostly for approved housing bodies.</p> <p>  The Housing Alliance is a collaboration of six of Ireland&rsquo;s largest approved housing bodies, namely, Circle Voluntary Housing, Cl&uacute;id Housing, Co-operative Housing Ireland, Oaklee Housing, Respond and Tuath Housing.</p><p>The Housing Alliance was formed to promote the delivery of social and affordable housing, address barriers and challenges to delivery, and promote strong professional approaches to housing management.</p><p> We warmly welcome the cost rental scheme.  We await further clarity on receipt of full details of the conditions and will reflect on those details when received.  We have responded enthusiastically to the expression of interest for funding, which was oversubscribed, demonstrating the commitment of Housing Alliance members to contribute to the new initiative.  It is our contention that, in time, affordable cost rental will be seen as marking a significant and important development in housing policy.  It provides a long-term affordable housing solution for those households that choose to rent, with the advantages that this bestows on the wider economy.  The housing sector has lacked an affordable rental option for some time.  The provision of affordable cost rental homes is an important initiative for those households whose income falls between private and social rental.  It brings Ireland more in line with other European housing systems, which tend to have a cost rental element in their housing provision.</p><p> Many households become trapped in the private rented sector, unable to move to a more secure or affordable tenure, yet their incomes are above the threshold to qualify for social housing.  They are not earning sufficient income to purchase a home of their own.  The cost rental equity loan, CREL, represents a remedy at a critical juncture in housing policy.  While the initial 440 homes is a relatively small number, given the proportion of households in need of an affordable rental option, we believe that the success of this initial year will provide the evidence and demonstrate the value of significantly increasing recurring budgetary allocations to allow many more cost rental homes to be provided in future.</p><p> As is clear to everyone, housing affordability is an increasing challenge in the Irish context.  Without a secure place to call home, it can be challenging to engage in many aspects of life, including employment, education, training and recreation.  Never has the centrality of the home been more acute than during the Covid-19 crisis, with the call to action to stay home and stay safe.  For many households, having a secure home of their own is out of their reach and unaffordable.  For example, 16% of households spend more than 30% of their net income on housing, with this figure rising to 70% for the lowest quartile of the income distribution, according to ESRI research in 2018.  That study also found a variation in affordability in respect of age group, location and household formation.</p><p> In social and economic terms, lack of access to affordable housing impacts on family life, household job prospects, household finances, family formation as well as national competitiveness and growth.  Furthermore, according to most recent figures, the median gross income per household in Ireland was &euro;45,256 while nearly two thirds of Irish households had a gross income of less than &euro;60,000.  Despite marginal reductions in rents in recent months, market rents in Dublin city are still at almost &euro;2,000 per month, comprising more than 69% of the net income of a household on a gross income of &euro;45,000 and just over 56% of the net income of a household on a gross income of &euro;60,000.  Rents in other cities, including Cork and Galway, continue to rise at a rapid pace.</p><p> Cost rental housing in Ireland is providing discounted rental housing developed by approved housing bodies, AHBs, and local authorities; guaranteeing long-term security of tenure to tenants; charging rents of at least 25% below prevailing market rents, with affordability likely to increase over time; and assisting tenants with housing assistance payments, HAP, after six months should they temporarily lose employment.  As in other European countries, cost rental properties act to counter the boom and bust cycles that often plague the housing market.  For example, in Austria where two thirds of the population live in subsidised housing-----</p></speech>

In conclusion, AHBs are organisations with a social purpose and have a particular role to provide for people in need of housing, including those above the social housing limits.  We have a strong track record of delivery.  For example, 41% of all social housing in 2019 was provided by AHBs.</p> <p>  This is a good scheme and we look forward to future budgets as an opportunity to reward low-to-medium-income workers, especially front-line workers for their extraordinary contributions during the Covid pandemic.  Access to cost rental is a cross-party issue and we ask for the committee's continued support for providing this much-needed affordable rental housing for families and individuals who need it.</p> <p>  We are happy to answer questions.</p></speech>

We will now move to questions from members.  I remind them that, if each member sticks to five minutes for questions and answers, we will get considerable value from this session.  There is a great deal of experience in housing delivery present in the form of the local authorities and the Housing Alliance.  I also ask members to identify themselves clearly for the Debates Office and to confirm that they are within the confines of Leinster House or the convention centre.</p></speech>

For the record, I am in Leinster House.</p> <p>  My first question is for the Housing Alliance, which I thank for its presentation.  It is reassuring to have the Housing Alliance's support.  As Mr. Dunne stated, the alliance provided 41% of social housing.  It is important that there be a change in the State's housing policy and that we provide affordable rental accommodation to people on modest incomes.  It is good to have the alliance's endorsement of that.</p> <p>  Much has been made of the 400 odd units in the first year, but will Mr. Dunne confirm what the Housing Alliance's delivery target over the next three years will be?  How many units does it intend to deliver?</p></speech>

They are on schedule to deliver at least another 12,000, bringing the number up to 40,000 in the next couple of years.  Does the Senator wish to know about cost rental in particular?</p></speech>

It would be helpful if, after this meeting, Mr. Dunne circulated to the committee a projection of where those 12,000 units would be.  I have a couple of questions for Mr. Curran as well and I am trying to keep to the time, so I apologise.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Curran for his presentation and his participation.  Local authorities have a strong track record of social housing provision, but today's report is disappointing in its ambition and scale.  It seems to indicate a target of approximately 2,000 units over the next three years, yet the CCMA is discussing acquiring land.  How many units can the land that is currently available to local authorities provide?  Are the targets indicated in the report based on the new legislation or are they old?  If the latter, when will they be revised to reflect a greater ambition?</p></speech>

Since 2016 up to quarter 3 of 2020, we built approximately 6,400 units, acquired 6,600 and assisted the AHBs in building 5,500.  In the same period, AHBs acquired approximately 3,500 units.  There were 2,800 homes delivered through Part V and 4,500 leases.  These numbers are significant.  Currently, 15,000 dwellings are under construction and the target is 10,000 per year over the next five years and a further 2,500 leases.</p><p>It is a very ambitious programme in terms of social housing delivery.  Right now, through the housing delivery and co-ordination office, we are assessing the land local authorities have to deliver those 10,000 social units.  We are also assessing demand for affordable housing units.  We are working with the Department in this regard.  We are looking at the staff local authorities will require to deliver on this ambitious programme of social and affordable housing and what land we need to acquire.  We will be going out to acquire this land.</p></speech>

It is very encouraging to hear those numbers.  It is way more ambitious than the 1,900 or so referred to in the report.  How many local authorities made an application for the cost rental equity loan, CREL, funding?</p></speech>

Into the future, we need more mixed-tenure development in terms of social, affordable and cost rental housing, so we are very much in favour of that.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Curran, Mr. Dunne and their teams for their presentations.  As somebody who has been a long-time advocate of local authority and approved housing body delivery of affordable rental and purchase accommodation, it is good that we are finally having these conversations.  I must say, however, that I do not believe any lack of ambition is on the part of the people who are in this meeting.  If central government does not provide significant funding from AHBs or councils to deliver affordable housing then we will not be able to deliver it.  It is important that committee members know there was no additional funding for the serviced sites fund in budget 2021 above pre-existing commitments.  Only &euro;35 million was allocated to the AHBs for cost rental whereas we need to be spending far greater sums of money over the next five years to meet the level of need that exists.</p> <p>  I have two questions, the first of which is for CCMA.  As we know, &euro;300 million was allocated for the serviced sites fund over three years to deliver more than 6,000 affordable homes by the end of 2021.  That obviously has not happened.  As was said, we will only get 140 this year, 700 next year and 1,500 the year after, and those are pre-Covid figures.  What needs to change to allow Mr. Curran to accelerate the drawdown and delivery of homes under that fund?  If the fund were to be increased, what is Mr. Curran's capacity to handle that?  We need thousands of these units every year, not hundreds.</p> <p>  I congratulate Mr. Dunne and his colleagues on the success of the applications, the details of which I know we will get soon when they are announced, for the affordable cost rental scheme.  My concern here, however, is that it is a very small amount of money and a small number of units.  The real concern is the rent levels, however.  This is not a criticism of the Housing Alliance but a whole range of people will not be able to afford those rents, for example, single people or those on a modest dual income who are above the threshold for social housing.  What needs to happen in that scheme to drive the rents down below &euro;900, &euro;800 or &euro;700?  Are we going to see any units in the city centre given the price differential there?  We need to make sure these units get to the people who need them most.  We are hearing figures of &euro;1,100, &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,300 for rent on Land Development Agency, LDA, cost rental sites.  What does the Housing Alliance need from Government to bring rents down below the &euro;1,000 mark?</p></speech>

Our ambition is to have the lowest rents we possibly can.  This housing cannot be delivered without a subsidy, however.  Therefore, having the cost rental equity loan provides a level of subsidy.  Then there are other factors with regard to land cost and construction costs that feed into it.</p> <p>  Our initial responsibility is thinking about those who are in the current situation where they are paying &euro;2,000 per month, which I know all members care about.  We are looking to see how we can significantly reduce that amount.  If I may, I will invite my colleague, Mr. O'Gorman, to make further comments.</p></speech>

We are obviously trying to drive down the rents as low we can.  We realise that the more we can drive those down, the bigger the pool of people that will be available to us.  We have tried to develop the properties in as reasonable and cost-effective a way as we can.  We have applied an affordability measure to our assessment of potential applicants.  We do not want anybody to spend more than 35% of his or her net income on rent because that just brings people into unaffordability and issues regarding rent arrears, debt and so on.  We have managed, therefore, to bring the rents between &euro;900 to approximately &euro;1,100 across the various schemes.</p> <p>  We hope the success this year, which we are anticipating, will deliver a permanent budget line in order that this will be something allocated year on year.  Then we can begin to plan much further in advance.  We can develop sites ourselves.  These are all acquisitions.  We will be able to develop sites if we know a programme is coming.  We hope to be able to drive that down further.</p> <p>  In addition to what Mr. Dunne said, the rents will be indexed to inflation, to consumer price index, CPI, which will be less than the increase in market rent.  Therefore, we expect that affordability will increase over time.  These are 40-year terms.  At the end of that 40 years, when they are available to other households, long after I have left the scene, we hope we can bring down the rents even further because the loans will have been paid back.</p></speech>

What would help, and we are in discussions with the Department and the Minister is willing to look at this as part of the new housing strategy, is if the serviced sites fund could be expanded in order that it would cover the entire cost of the difference between the actual cost of building a house and the affordable price.  That would help very much in terms of delivery.</p> <p>  This Bill will also be of assistance in terms of providing clarity and certainty on affordable housing on the side of the local authority and the applicant and will give greater certainty to local authorities.  As I mentioned, we also need to acquire land.  That will give us greater opportunities to develop more mixed tenure developments.</p></speech>

I, too, thank witnesses for attending this morning to give evidence on this very important legislation.  This affordable housing Bill will provide local authorities, the LDA, approved housing bodies and the private sector with a set of tools they have not had before to try to increase supply of units and bridge that affordability gap for many individuals and households in the State.  I know there has been much public commentary regarding one element of the Bill.  I am glad we are talking about the other two elements of the Bill this morning.  It is quite useful.</p> <p>  I will focus first on the cost rental scheme.  The way I see it, the approved housing bodies have been tasked, initially, with proving the concept of cost rental in the Irish context, and the 440 units have been mentioned.  I do not want anyone to take this as a criticism, but I believe that to expand this scheme and drive the delivery of the units, we will have to expand the scheme beyond the approved housing body sector.</p><p>Would Mr. Curran or Mr. Taaffe, who is also on the line, agree that keeping it on-balance-sheet, as it is at present through the CREL, is going to potentially hamper the expansion of the scheme in the future?  Do they agree that flexibility is required in the legislation and regulations to allow housing organisations outside the AHBs to take part in this model?  In my opinion, there is no point in developing a scheme in which we will not be able to quickly drive the number of units that will be provided.  I am certain there are funds and organisations that will be willing to provide long-term leases.  The 40-year horizon has been mentioned.  There could be long-term lease arrangements agreed with organisations to provide units and at the end of the 40-year period they revert to the State for a nominal free.  Have those discussions, beyond the approved housing bodies sector, been ongoing with the local authorities?  Can Mr. Curran or Mr. Taaffe expand on that?</p></speech>

There is the Land Development Agency, LDA.  In Shanganagh in D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council there is a development through the LDA that will deliver 306 cost rental units, 200 social units and 91 affordable units.  Also, on the Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council the serviced site fund, SSF, is being used to assist in the delivery of cost rental units with the assistance of an approved housing body.  I will ask Ms Keenan to expand a little on those.  They are outside the CREL but are delivering cost rental.</p></speech>

We are delivering this in partnership with the LDA.  The rents there will be approximately &euro;1,200.  I know people would like to get those lower, but if one compares them to the market rents in the area, which are &euro;2,000, it is a considerable difference.  We are due to go to tender in April and we will be on site in the latter half of this year.  That is 306 cost rental and renting and affordable housing in collaboration with the LDA.</p> <p>  In terms of the Enniskerry Road, Mr. Declan Dunne from Respond Housing Association is present.  We are working with Respond Housing Association, Tuath Housing, the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency.  That will deliver 50 cost rental homes.  They are on site now and almost at completion.  They will be completed in autumn this year.</p> <p>  The key point in both of these projects is the collaboration.  We have collaborated very well with the approved housing bodies, the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency on Enniskerry Road, and in Shanganagh the LDA is driving that delivery.</p></speech>

The specific question here relates to on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet.  If everything is being channelled through the approved housing bodies sector, which is doing fantastic work, we must be cognisant that this is on-balance-sheet.  I know there is a desire eventually to attract long-term pension funds with a 40-year horizon that are looking at a low return over a period.  That is what is happening across Europe.  However, to do that, it must be off-balance-sheet.  Everything that has been described so far is on-balance-sheet.  My question was whether the witnesses agreed that there has to be flexibility in the legislation and the regulations to allow this to go beyond the approved housing bodies sector to get it off the State's balance sheet.</p></speech>

I welcome seeing Mr. Taaffe in this forum.  The representatives of both the CCMA and the Housing Alliance spoke about the benefit of delivering cost rental en masse in the context of rent affordability and to stabilise the housing sector.  I agree with this and the AHBs play a pivotal role in helping to reshape our housing market into one that is affordable and inclusive of all income levels.  In a previous committee meeting on this Bill it was suggested by the Housing Agency and the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, that we require at least 2,000 cost rental units per year to stabilise the market and eventually drive down prices.  NESC also cited multiples of that figure, up to 6,000 units per year, as what we really needed.  Have the witnesses engaged with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on multiannual funding and access to local authority land, given that AHBs will have to deliver cost rental units on such a scale?</p> <p>  Second, we often cite the success of the Vienna model, which has exemplified the housing model centred on affordability.  In a recent meeting with the Austrian Green Party, which forms part of the Austrian Government with the Social Democratic Party, its members noted that every fourth flat in Vienna is city owned, with up to two thirds of the population in affordable and high-quality public housing.  That includes high-income earners.  Only about 20% of people own their own homes in Vienna.  That is not because house prices are expensive, but because of the significant investment in delivery of public housing as well as the evident rental culture that exists there.  What is the witnesses' perspective on the lease terms and the provisions we need?  Would they support leases of indefinite duration, considering the State's current six-year lease terms?</p> <p>  Finally, in order to maintain cost rental as a non-profit driven model, do they agree that cost rental rents should be priced on the construction and maintenance and capped at a profit of 3%, akin to the Vienna model?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.654" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1574" speakername="Francis Noel Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021030200002#D01200"><p>Yes, at scale.  Is the funding available on a multiannual basis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.655" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021030200002#D01300"><p>I will answer that.  It is interesting to hear about the NESC report with regard to 2,000 per annum.  We also hear about the 440 in the CREL scheme.  Ms Keenan has outlined that the Shanganagh scheme will have 306.  We are quickly approaching at least 50% of that target, and that is encouraging.  However, this is very much the beginning, the initial phase where we all need to prove this model, be satisfied and improve it.  There are opportunities to improve it as we proceed.  Certainly, the Enniskerry Road project was the initial pathfinder project and we have learned from that.</p> <p>  In terms of engagement with the Department about the funding and scaling up the model, the Housing Alliance has raised this.  I represent the alliance on the delivery group that the Minister chairs and we have raised two matters.  One is the need for us to get on with this and prove its viability, and then to make the case to the Department for future budget allocations to scale it up.  We have also highlighted the importance of the request for expressions of interest to be made much earlier.  We had expressions of interest late in December and we are delivering most of this in this year, and that is quite a tight timeline.  We believe it is important that it might happen in August and September while there is the parallel process of the Department making its submissions to the Government about budgetary allocations.  There is no doubt that is important.</p> <p>  On the issue of classification, we are actively involved in making an effort to reverse classification.  We are optimistic about doing that.  We are having conversations with National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and the Government about it.  We believe it is entirely possible for us to address it.  The Senator's comments were well made and they must be addressed.  We are working hard to address them.</p> <p>  With regard to the elements that go into the cost, we agree that the profit element of this must be reduced as much as possible.  The purpose of this is to keep the cost down.  I cannot see how involving private sector actors or investors is going to keep those costs down when they are required and entitled to a make a substantial return on investments in order to get the investments they need.</p><p>Between the local authorities, the AHBs and the LDA, we would be optimistic that the State could adequately do this, that we are adequately placed to do it and that we are focused on the lowest possible rents for tenants.</p></speech>

Not only do these people have lifetime homes in perpetuity, but if their children qualify under the income criteria, they can also live in those homes, and that is our intention.  The wonderful thing about the model is that the houses are paid for once and that cost might be repaid over 25 years, and then those homes are available at no additional cost in the remaining 75 years, except for maintenance.  Our perspective then when it comes to cost rental is that we would like these properties to be available in perpetuity and that the tenure should not be limited.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Curran and Ms Keenan from the CCMA and Mr. Dunne from the Housing Alliance.  We have talked about affordability.  I and most other Members operate on the understanding and belief that affordability is based not on location but on income.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that because it is critical and many people miss it.  I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Ms Keenan represents D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and she will be aware of the costs there.  Wherever we go in the country, there is a different impact in respect of affordability and we must address this key issue.</p> <p>  I am conscious of time and I want to stick to a few questions.  The Minister announced 390 new cost rental units and I see that members of the Housing Alliance, namely, Cl&uacute;id Housing, Respond and Tuath, have been involved in some of those endeavours.  Of those 390 cost rental units, will the witnesses confirm that 50 of those units are already accounted for as part of the Enniskerry Road project?  Mr. Curran mentioned the issue of acquisition.  I am taken aback by that.  We know a number of local authorities have a legacy regarding the land aggregation scheme.  Nothing has happened in that regard.  That legacy needs to be brought into play in respect of affordability.  I accept there is a need for mixed tenure.  I would like to hear what the CCMA is doing in that context because there has been no mention of it.</p> <p>  I was somewhat surprised by what I thought was a bland statement from the CCMA this morning.  I had expected it to have been a bit more ambitious.  I am not suggesting the association is not ambitious but I did not see ambition reflected in its statement.  In the greater scheme of things regarding this proposed Bill, the witnesses might also comment on the LDA and how it will interact with the local authorities.  I know for certain from talking to city and county councillors around the country that they have serious concerns about the proposed adjustments to the section 183 disposal system.  The witnesses and anyone who works in the local authorities will know there are many good reasons that elected members may decide not to release land to the LDA, while there are also many other reasons that they would do so.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.</p></speech>

We are here to discuss the affordable housing Bill so the witnesses may not be in a position to comment on the last question from Senator Boyhan.  Would the Senator like to direct his questions to anyone in particular?</p></speech>

Local authorities will co-operate with the LDA in delivering social, affordable and cost rental housing.  We already have the example of the scheme in Shanganagh, where the local authority in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown co-operated fully with the LDA and significant delivery of housing is now under way.  The LDA has a number of schemes coming through around the country, with some of those deriving from the land aggregation scheme, such as those in Naas and Lusk and also a scheme now coming through in Cork.  The LDA has a very ambitious programme for delivering social, affordable and cost rental housing in the next year.  We welcome that.</p> <p>  Going back to the land aggregation scheme, we are looking at all the lands in the landbank, that is, all the lands owned by the local authorities.  We are looking at the services available for those lands.  We are examining what land can be made available for social and affordable housing.  We are also in discussions with the Department and the Housing Finance Agency concerning land which is unlikely to be delivered in the next number of years and how to deal with existing loans.  </p> <p>  Turning to the Senator's comment regarding our ambition, I think we are very ambitious.  As I said, there is a target of 10,000 units for social housing for each of the next five years, in addition to 2,500 leases.  This proposed affordable housing Bill will give us clarity and certainty in this context.  We also have the serviced site fund in operation and we are seeking to expand it.  We are actively looking for land on which to deliver affordable and cost rental housing.  There is considerable ambition on the part of the sector.  We will examine issues such as the staff complement in each local authority, the skill set we will require and the recruitment of the staff we need to be in a position to deliver on this ambitious programme.</p></speech>

That is why the Housing Alliance statement refers to 440 houses.  The reference to 390 affordable houses concerned the call for expressions of interest.  Added to that figure are the 50 houses being developed in D&uacute;n Laoghaire by Respond and Tuath and the Housing Agency and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, supported by the Housing Finance Agency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.665" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021030200002#E01400"><p>I have two questions for the witnesses from the CCMA.  The expansion of the serviced site fund was mentioned.  Will the witnesses tell us more about that?  What is envisaged?  Is it that there will be flexibility in the amounts and it will be possible to go beyond &euro;50,000 or will the amounts be fixed?  If the approach is that of some flexibility, how would that be worked out?  I ask the witnesses for more detail on that.</p> <p>  Part of the process of achieving housing affordability must focus on driving down the costs of delivery and construction.  Is the CCMA considering that aspect?  Has the possibility of more universal internal design been considered to achieve economies of scale, for example, in procuring internal fittings?  I do not believe universal external design is desirable or a good idea.</p> <p>  Is the cost procurement process being examined to see what might be done to lower the costs of construction?  There have been issues with some larger developments, for example.  If they have not been broken up, only a couple of large developers bid in the tender process.  The resultant lack of competition has been driving up costs.  Has consideration been given to breaking up some of the bigger projects so that smaller bidders can make bids?  That would then bring costs down.  Does that form part of the work being done on the serviced sites fund?  That is one way of bridging the affordability gap.  However, we should also be looking at areas where we can drive costs down while maintaining good standards.  I ask the witnesses to expand on those issues.</p></speech>

An individual who can borrow 90% of the cost of a house does not need a subsidy, but a discount would be applied for people who fall below that level of affordability and who cannot secure a loan to cover 90% of the property cost.  We are looking for that sort of flexibility.  We are also looking to expand it to current developments, rather than just construction, which will give us another route to providing affordable housing.</p> <p>  In terms of affordability, we are looking at other forms of delivery, such as design-build, which will allow for delivery to be achieved much more quickly.  We are looking at frameworks to put in place in that regard.  We are also looking at economies of scale and larger developments that will provide better value for money.  I ask my colleague, Mr. Taaffe, from the housing delivery and co-ordination office, to comment on that aspect.</p></speech>

We see a need for design-build contractors to take on some of the more straightforward sites in order to speed up the whole delivery process and bring in economy of scale in that regard.  We are also working with the Department on trying to standardise as much as possible floor plates and floor plans for particular types of units.  That should lead to greater certainty in the construction sector in regard to design-build schemes.</p> <p>  We are also trying to review how we operate frameworks, particularly for design teams and consultants such as architects and quantity surveyors.  We are co-ordinating that better across the sector and making sure the right frameworks are in place to meet the needs of local authorities throughout the country.  One of the considerations with frameworks is that they must provide for smaller consultants and builders to be involved in the delivery of housing, as well as the larger and medium-sized operators.  The frameworks will be tailored to allow all cross sections of the sector to deliver different sizes of projects across the country.</p></speech>

In regard to design-build frameworks, will they clarify that there will still be plenty of flexibility in terms of external design in order to ensure it is not overly uniform?

I have a couple of questions for the witnesses from the CCMA.  Mr. Mark Bourke from Dublin City Council told us about the problems local authorities have in comparison with the private sector in delivering housing.  In some cases, the process they have to go through can see construction taking six years.  In the context of the affordable housing Bill, are the witnesses speaking to the Department about the steps and processes that take place between local authorities and the Department in regard to the provision of funding?  Where does the CCMA see the longer delays arising in local authority delivery of social housing?</p> <p>  Mr. Curran said that he is talking to the Department about additional funding under the serviced sites fund.  What type of infrastructure is he talking about in this regard?  Is he referring to enhanced infrastructure?  In the case of the Dublin local authorities, for example, when it comes to building anything like playgrounds, parks and other facilities that build communities beyond the bricks and mortar of housing, they often feel that they are forced to sell land in order to get the money to provide that enhanced infrastructure.  Is there any case being made to the Department for funding of enhanced infrastructure, which currently is not covered?</p> <p>  How does the CCMA see the issue of guaranteed affordability in regard to purchase prices?  In the case of O'Devaney Gardens, for instance, some of the affordable housing units cost more than &euro;400,000.  What steps can the Department or the CCMA take in terms of the procurement process to bring that price down?  Following on from what Deputy Cian O'Callaghan said, where there are one or two builders on large sites, local authorities are often forced to take what those builders say is an affordable unit.  Are there any steps that can be incorporated into the affordable housing Bill to enable direct dealing with small builders in order to reduce the cost of the affordable purchase element of schemes?</p></speech>

The Department, like us and every other public body, is subject to the public spending code and the various governance arrangements that are in place.  We previously agreed to bring it down to a four-stage approval process that takes approximately 50 weeks.  In more recent years, we have been working on the design-build process, which has shortened that.  In Wicklow, we are delivering schools through design-build and the initial process is taking 43 to 45 weeks, which is a significant improvement.  The Department now has a single-stage approval process for schools for projects up to &euro;6 million, which speeds up the whole process.  It is very useful for local authorities and we will certainly be taking the Department up on it.</p> <p>  Regarding the serviced sites fund, it currently deals with large-scale infrastructure projects, including roads, sewerage and so on, that are over and above the norm.  They are covered, which will allow the houses to be more affordable.  The Senator is talking about social infrastructure, such as playgrounds and parks, for which there are various sources of funding.  It would usually come through us, by way of our community development levies, and we provide parks, open spaces and playgrounds all the time.  There are also various grants available such as the town and village renewal scheme, the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme and the urban regeneration and development fund.  We draw on those sources of funding all the time to develop community infrastructure.</p> <p>  In terms of guaranteed affordability, as Mr. Taaffe pointed out, we are doing a lot in terms of our procurement process.  We are working with the OGP on design-build and having standard layouts etc. in order to reduce the costs as much as we can.  After that, the serviced sites fund would kick in to provide the subsidy and discount available to people.</p></speech>

The Department, in discussions we have had with it, is open to that argument being made, particularly where it is a requirement and condition of the public consultation process that associated infrastructure like playgrounds or community facilities are tied into housing developments.  It strengthens the hand of local authorities to get the funding and get the infrastructure delivered because it is a condition of the public consultation planning process.  We are having ongoing discussions in this regard and there is a recognition from the Department that where there is a community deficit of infrastructure associated with particular housing schemes, a level of funding to address it should be provided under those schemes.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses agree that in order to ramp up the scale of delivery of affordable homes, we must get cost rental taken off balance sheet?  Do they agree that flexibility is required in legislation and regulations in order to enable organisations beyond the approved housing bodies to partake in cost rental schemes?</p></speech>

In the longer term, if we are delivering cost rental at scale, there is a role and it is allowed for in the Bill.</p></speech>

It is no disrespect to say that, as I did in my first round of questions to the alliance members, who are doing fantastic work in the provision of social homes.  Cost rental is a new sector and approved housing bodies have been tasked with proving the concept.  In order to ramp up production of these homes, we must get this off balance sheet.  It is a key metric.  There is a desire from the approved housing bodies to get their provision off balance sheet but there is no guarantee that can happen.  If we look at a 40-year horizon with long-term leasing, is Mr. Curran aware of organisations that have approached local authorities to provide affordable schemes outside the approved housing body sector?</p></speech>

For the next two or three years we can focus on the LDA, the approved housing bodies and the delivery of cost rental, as outlined earlier.</p></speech>

I do not mind whether it is a local authority, a land value alliance, an approved housing body or the private sector that comes in to provide these homes.  To be frank, I do not believe the public cares who provides such a home as long as people can get it.  I do not want to see a tug of war, with people vying to provide these homes and nothing being done.  I want to see them delivered and, to be frank, I do not care who provides them.</p></speech>

That is allowed for in the Bill.  Mr. Taaffe might comment on this.  We are getting enhanced and long-term leasing from institutional investors and it certainly could be available down the line to provide that affordable rent.</p></speech>

I am not aware of any other sectors that would offer it outside the approved housing body sector.  I suspect that when cost rental becomes a feature, we may well see that.  It may become another delivery channel and that would only be a good thing, depending on how finances work and value-for-money elements.  There is also the matter of the whole-life cost to the State of that type of housing.  We are not seeing it currently but I suspect we will in the near future once affordable rental and cost rental becomes a growing feature.</p></speech>

The long-term leases mentioned by Mr. Taaffe are where a local authority enters into a 25-year arrangement, for example.  What happens after those 25 years to tenants in those long-term leases?  What is the plan after the 25-year lease?</p></speech>

In some cases the lease could be renewed by agreement.  We are only at the beginning of leases but there could also be alternative lease properties found.  It could well be the case that the properties could be acquired by the local authority at the end of the lease.  There are a number of options available to local authorities.  It is important to note that as we know when a lease will end, we have time to work out a resolution for what happens at the end of the period.  Local authorities will have time to do that and there are a number of options available at the end of the lease period.</p></speech>

As a Deputy, I want to see the delivery of social and affordable housing and affordable cost rental properties.  People need action and they are looking for us to provide it now.  They are sick of announcement after announcement.  We need to deliver these for the people.</p> <p>  I have a question for the CCMA delegation.  With the legacy issues, is a full write-down of loans required or what must be done to get rid of the burden on local authorities caused by these loans?  The opening statement indicated that in the ten-year period to 2008, local authorities delivered over 26,000 affordable homes but 2,000 of those were unsold.  What lessons can be learned from this?  Has there been an analysis of the 24,000 homes that were sold to see if the tenants felt they had a good or fair deal and what changes would be made if we were in a similar position now?  How would the CCMA envisage the process of determining the price of an affordable home under the proposed scheme?</p> <p>  The Housing Alliance statement referenced cost rental prices and the relation to market rates.  Would it consider market rates to determine cost rental rates as appropriate?  There are areas where current market rates are extremely or excessively high.  Should the cost rental affordability calculation be done on the median wage in those areas so as to make these properties affordable for people?  There was an announcement for a proposed cost rental scheme on the St. Kevin's site, with rates between &euro;900 and &euro;1,100, but for most people that is not affordable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.695" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Curran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021030200002#G01700"><p>We are looking at the legacy loans, as I mentioned earlier.  The first step is to look at all those land banks and see what can be developed for social and affordable housing.  That is the best way to deal with it.  At the end of that exercise, there may well be land that is unlikely to be developed for various reasons, and the type of discussion we are having with the Department and the Housing Finance Agency is on how to clear those loans.  There are a number of options.  There could be another scheme.  The loans could be cleared by the Department or paid over time.  There could be an arrangement between ourselves, the local authorities, the Department and the Housing Finance Agency.  That is all up for discussion and we are analysing all those land banks.</p> <p>  On the unsold affordable housing units, there were 29,000 units built and the vast majority of people are very happy with the deal they got.  We get that information anecdotally.  Despite the scale of the crash, which was unprecedented in Ireland, only 2,000 remained unsold.  Those that were unsold are now fully occupied by social housing tenants.  They were leased to approved housing bodies and occupied by social housing tenants.  The lease then paid the loan.  We are in a position now where we must look at what to do with those loans.  We are looking at whether we should continue and transfer them to the approved housing body or what is the best way to deal with that.  There is a working group between the Department and ourselves that is looking to resolve that matter.</p><p>On affordability, the way it is set out in the Bill is that if somebody can afford a mortgage to purchase a house on the private market, he or she will not be eligible.  The plan is to consider what a person can afford, and provide a discount in respect of what he or she can afford and the price on the market.  That is how the discount would be provided.  It would be based on the individual and not the individual's circumstances.  There is a maximum discount of, I understand, 40% set out in the notes on the Bill.</p></speech>

Cork City Council has &euro;36 million in loans in respect of land it purchased.  There is no way it will recoup that money if it is providing social, affordable and cost rental properties.  They will have to be subsidised or something else will have to be done.  Cork City Council has another &euro;36 million in unsold homes.  That one local authority has a debt of &euro;72 million in total.  We know there are many other local authorities in the same position.  If local authorities are to deliver housing, surely these loans need to be dealt with.</p></speech>

As I said, unsold homes are being occupied by social housing tenants.  The interest on the loans is being paid.  We need to sit down and examine this situation.  As I said, a working group has been established.  In terms of what to do in the future, do we leave them or transfer them to approved housing bodies and continue to let them to social housing tenants?</p> <p>  Mr. Taaffe is involved with Cork City Council through the housing delivery co-ordination office.  It is examining the parcels of land, in particular, and determining in the first instance whether we can develop social, affordable and cost rental housing on those pieces of land.  If that is not possible or is unlikely, we, along with the Department and the HFA, will consider what the best option is for dealing with the loans.  That is actively being worked on at the moment.</p></speech>

We need to look at the counties where there is a affordability issue and the quantity of affordable housing we need.  We will then sit down with the Department, which is producing guidelines on developing housing needs demand assessment.  At that point, local authorities will have targets.  Research needs to be done, and that it being done at the present time.</p></speech>

Now we will have the tools to do all three, and the fear is that local authorities will not have the ambition that is needed and will leave cost rental to the AHBs and affordable housing to the LDA.  That is not the purpose of the Bill.  It is very important that there be an aggressive and ambitious target set by local authorities.</p></speech>

We are very ambitious in this regard.  As he said, the tools are now available.  We are talking to the Department about expanding the serviced sites fund, which would be very welcome.  The Bill will provide clarity on those issues of priority and eligibility, the rent, the period of the charge, etc.  All of that will be clarified which will make it much easier for local authorities.</p> <p>  I mentioned we are considering acquiring land and we are looking at our staff structure in terms of gearing up for increased demand.  We are also examining providing mixed tenure which, as I said, is important from a sustainable communities point of view.  We certainly have the ambition and the tools available to us to accelerate the delivery of affordable housing into the future. </p> <p>  When we have set the targets and as go through that exercise, we will forward the information to the Deputy.  We will forward any information we have in the interim to the committee and Deputy.</p></speech>

Councillors and elected members will certainly support that and the approval process will be a lot easier, not that we are having any problems.</p> <p>  I do not think we have ever had a major difficulty here in Wicklow in terms of councillors approving social housing, but it becomes all the more attractive with mixed tenure.  It avoids any difficulties that may have arisen in the past with mono-tenure estates.</p></speech>

On mixed income and tenure housing, every other sector of housing is responsible for providing it.  Private providers do so via Part V.  We always ensure there is a balance, even in places like Ballymun where Mr. Dunne and I worked.  We sought to have mixed income housing and prevent cost rental developments becoming gated, middle class enclaves.  How do we ensure there is mixed income within cost rental developments, in particular with retired people or tenants that might be eligible for council housing?</p></speech>

We have every confidence this will be the case.  We and the Department are working actively on it.</p> <p>  In our role in AHBs to provide mixed tenure communities we work closely with the private sector.  A lot of our work is done in partnership with the private sector.  There is a role for private sector companies in the delivery of housing on a fixed price basis.  We have a strong track record of having the types of frameworks that the CCMA is looking at.  That is how the AHB sector works and how we deliver fixed price housing on time.  That is the way forward.</p> <p>  In terms of potential investment from the private sector, there is an opportunity for pension funds and credit unions to invest in delivery through local authorities and in cost rental housing, via AHBs, that is off balance sheet, and we are actively working on that.  We consciously believe that it is not a question of having mono-tenure and it is not desirable to have social housing alone.  We do not see cost rental as being in any way some kind of private sector enclave.  Everywhere we are already working with developers that are building private housing we want there to be an element of social and cost rental, and that will provide the mixture that is required.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.</p><p>The purpose of today's meeting is to scrutinise the affordable housing Bill, to help us report back on that Bill and suggest improvements that may be necessary.  We know that local authorities and approved housing bodies have a long track record of delivering good quality housing and they will continue to do so.  We must also examine the Land Development Agency Bill which is going through the Houses.  There will be a certain partnership between the agency and the local authorities. </p><p> I have questions for the representatives of both organisations today.  Do they see any difficulties with aspects of the legislation before us that would impede delivery or are there ways by which the legislation could be improved?  I will ask the Housing Alliance to respond first.</p></speech>

To date, we have worked in social housing rental and now, through the legislation, we will be involved in supporting other income groups through cost rental.  Our opinions are limited to that part of the work that we are involved in.  We are happy with what we see with the legislation.  We are particularly interested in hearing the details that will come later on the conditions that will apply to the cost rental equity loan and the specific eligibility criteria and so on which will be announced soon.  Otherwise, once the value of this is established along with the value for money and the value for tenants is established, our focus is on how it can be scaled-up in the future.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Dunne think the legislation would be improved by defining that as limited equity return, and the limit being defined?</p></speech>

The cost rental equity loan is a long-term loan which is the equity that the State puts in and is repayable in a bullet payment at the end.</p></speech>

The focus of cost rental should not be profitability but affordability.  That is why I make the point about the equity return.  I think it should be defined as limited equity return in order to define that is our objective on cost rental housing.</p> <p>  I will put a similar question to the CCMA.</p></speech>

There is a lot of clarity on eligibility which is useful as it is more streamlined now and focused on the individual, which will be very welcome.  On priority, it is effectively first come, first served.  If there is an affordable housing scheme available, it will be advertised, people will apply, they will be assessed on their length of time living in the area, the suitability of the house and when they applied.  Rather than going into distance from home to work and home to school which is cumbersome and inconsistent around the country, it simplifies it.  The plan is to have 70% of units allocated on those priorities and then 20% through a local scheme which local councils will arrive at.  That is very welcome.  The clarification around the charging period is welcome.  We have been in discussion with the Department on the serviced site fund and expanding it, which would be very useful.  There is a question of what happens to unsold affordable units, whether they transfer to social housing, for instance, as is effectively the case now.  That is something we need to consider.  If there is a change of circumstances while we are building these units, there needs to be consideration of what happens if the houses are not sold.  Acquiring land is a big issue.  It is a big outlay for us.  Currently, we recoup those funds when we start building, which is effectively stage 4 of the four-stage approval process which I mentioned.  Bringing that forward a stage or two might allow us to buy more land for social and affordable housing.  We will continue to discuss issues such as that with the Department, but generally we very much welcome the Bill.</p></speech>

The Land Development Agency will have responsibility and capability in infrastructural delivery and acquiring land and working closely with local authorities.  Does the CCMA see the advantages of the measures in the Land Development Agency Bill and the affordability legislation working in tandem?</p></speech>

The LDA will have an ambitious programme.  It will work with us.  We saw the example of Shanganagh earlier.  Examples such as the developments in Naas and Lusk are coming through, which are lands that came through the land aggregation scheme.  The LDA will have the advantage that it will be able to strategically assemble land and fully utilise state lands to build affordable homes and sustainable communities.  It is providing affordable and cost rental housing.  We will work with it as best we can.  It is very welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.720" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021030200002#J00900"><p>Mr. Curran keeps repeating the point about the acquisition of land.  Many of the local authorities have very substantial land banks which have not been developed.  The Chair asked about the synergy between the Land Development Agency and local authorities.  There seems to be some conflict here.  On one hand, we are discussing disposing of land and on the other we are talking about acquiring more, where the focus must be on delivering houses.  One thing that has come clearly from today's discussion is the strong support for the mixed tenure.  I do not think anyone is in doubt about that.</p> <p>  I posed a question at the beginning of the meeting.  Affordable rental and purchase must be based on income, not on location.  I referenced that in terms of market rents.  I am interested to hear a comment on that statement. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.721" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021030200002#J01000"><p>I agree.  What is the focus of this entire thing?  It is about providing a housing solution that is affordable for people who find themselves in the situation where the price of private rental is far too high, they cannot afford to buy a house and their income is above the social housing level.  The test of the success of this will be whether or not it provides for those people.  That is our objective and what we are trying to achieve.  My opening statement referred to the challenges faced by a high percentage of people who are unable to rent or buy on average incomes, and who do not have access to social housing.  That is what we are trying to achieve.  Everything we do is done in partnership with local authorities.  Whether it is social or cost rental, our first point of call is the local authority.  We discuss the housing need and demand in the area and what the local authority wants us to do and where we can help.  We do not see ourselves as the primary mover in housing in Ireland.  Local authorities develop the development plan, it is the planning and housing authority in that county, and our role is to assist when invited and when it is helpful for them to have us there.</p> <p>  For the people who live in those counties, whose rent we are trying to address, we are trying to match two things, namely what they can afford to pay and how we can drive the cost down as far as we possibly can, through reducing our own costs around housing management, buying at the best price, buying at fixed prices and using modern construction methods.  AHBs have been involved in modular house building in 2D and 3D designs and we are trying to do this.  There is no doubt we can improve on it and that we want to improve on it but we do work with the private sector, and we drive as hard a bargain as we can.  My organisation has 1,366 homes in construction.  That means we have the skill set to be able to tell the private sector that we know what we are doing; we know the costs, we know what we pay and we will only pay the absolute minimum.</p><p>The Senator has raised the issue of the real challenge, which is the gap between the cost of housing and land in Ireland and what people can afford to pay.  We are trying to close that gap as much as we possibly can and clearly there is more work to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.723" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Curran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021030200002#K00200"><p>It should be targeted at the individual.  Where applicants cannot secure a mortgage for 90% of the market value of the unit, they are into the affordable category, assuming their income is above the social limits.  The equity and discount should be based on what individuals can afford to pay.  This is a sensible approach.  As Mr. Dunne outlined, it is very important for us to provide the affordable units at the best value we can by looking at design, build, approvals, purchase and the serviced sites fund to provide as much value for money as we can.</p></speech>

Mr. Curran referenced the county and city development plans.  This process takes about two years.  Considering all the pent-up need for affordable housing and how long we have all waited for an affordable rental scheme, I really hope we will not be waiting for two years for the local authorities to give us a projection on the need for affordable housing for purchase and rent in each local authority area.  Will Mr. Curran explain to us when we can expect to see a statement from the CCMA on what the projected needs are and what the targets will be?</p></speech>

Once the legislation is passed, when do the witnesses believe they will be at a stage where applications can be issued so that people can make an application for the scheme?</p></speech>

We have the serviced sites fund and I hope it will be expanded.  The Bill will provide us with the clarity and certainty we need with regard to eligibility, priority and the charging period.  We are now in a position to start to acquire land.  Our plan is to provide these in as short a timeframe as possible to provide mixed tenure developments.  As soon as we have concrete targets available, we will certainly send them to the committee and pass them on to the communities.  Each local authority now recognises this as a priority for very obvious reasons.  We hear it from our councillors in their respective council chambers.  There is a demand for affordable housing and cost rental and we will certainly act on it.  Applications can be made as soon as the schemes are complete.  We will be looking for applications and people will be applying.  As I said, we will be looking at eligibility in terms of what people can afford to pay.  We will be looking at priority in terms of whether a house is suitable to the needs of people, how long people are living in the area and how long it has been since their application was made.  We may well go for expressions of interest when we are assessing the demand in a particular area.  As soon as we have concrete schemes, they will be advertised.  As soon as we have data on what will be delivered and what the targets are, we will send them to the committee.</p></speech>

Is this correct?  Is there a report to which the witnesses could refer us that will give us details of what land is in local authority ownership in each jurisdiction and the capacity for housing on these land tracts?</p></speech>

I mentioned that earlier.  A total of &euro;188 million has been approved and 4,000 units will come from that.  They are starting this year.  Affordable housing is coming on stream.  This year, it is coming on stream in Boherboy in Cork city and Lusk.  With regard to the exercise to assess the amount of land, I mentioned that we have a target of 10,000 social housing units a year for the next five years, along with 2,500 leasing units.  Mr. Taaffe of the housing delivery co-ordination office is involved in the detailed land mapping exercise and I will hand over to him.</p></speech>

There is land that local authorities own and which is in the pipeline for construction, so there might be planning permission on it but there has not been construction yet.  It is in a pipeline and it is scheduled to deliver housing, for example, in 2023 or 2024.  We estimate that throughout the country land for approximately 25,000 units is in a pipeline and committed to a project.  There is also land that is not committed in a pipeline but may well be suitable for housing if something happens, such as, for example, if a new piece of road infrastructure or Irish Water infrastructure were to be put in place.  We are trying to quantify this at present.  We do not believe there is a significant amount of land in this category.  It could be in the order of another 5,000 to 10,000 units.  The important point about land is that we need to start buying it this year and next year if we are to deliver housing on it in 2024 or 2025.  However, there is nothing like the order of land available to deliver 100,000 units over the next three years.  We have to start buying land again because of the lead-in time required to identify land, get it serviced in some cases, go through the planning and procurement processes and then deliver housing on it.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses.  This has been a very informative discussion and it has been great to get all of the witnesses' viewpoints.  This is very exciting legislation that will deliver affordable homes and affordable rental in secure and long-term leases.  That is something we all share as a goal.  The Housing Agency plays a key role in delivering social housing and I agree it has the skills, experience and knowledge to play a key role in delivering cost rental affordable housing.  I would not want to see any sector have a monopoly in the delivery of any particular type of home.  This is why it is so important that the Housing Agency is involved but also that we get other viewpoints.</p> <p>  I agree with what the CCMA representatives said with regard to local authorities being best placed to know their own land and what is best suited for the land.  I know the association is doing a lot of work on land mapping.  I am conscious that target setting was mentioned in the opening statement.  I am interested to hear what the witnesses have to say on how these targets are being set and how they feel they should be set.  They spoke about the need to acquire new land banks to meet the housing targets, which is quite welcome.  It will be interesting to see how the Land Development Agency figures in this.  Mr. Curran mentioned many of the acquisitions in the pipeline and Mr. Taaffe spoke on that too.  Does what they spoke about cover Shanganagh?  Are we looking at schemes similar to this that will all be done in collaboration with the Land Development Agency?  How will the Land Development Agency figure in this?  Mr. Taaffe spoke about the design and build scheme and I wonder about streamlining the frameworks.  He spoke about the economies of scale that will be delivered.  Will there also be an acceleration in the delivery of these homes?</p></speech>

We need to look at the market, house prices, the supply of housing units over the next number of years, household formations, and the type and size of houses needed.  That exercise will be done and that will determine where we need to provide affordable housing because we want to provide it in the areas where it is needed.  As I said earlier, the serviced sites fund and the outlines in the Bill on eligibility, priority and so forth all help and we are going to acquire land in that context.  Affordable housing, as per the Bill, can be provided through approved housing bodies, AHBs, the cost rental equity loan, CREL, which we mentioned, the LDA or local authorities via the serviced sites fund.  It is a combination of everything but we need to look at the demand and target development at the areas where it is needed.</p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Taaffe, to answer the design and build question.</p></speech>

At the moment local authorities effectively do preliminary design via the Part 8 process.  Once the Part 8 is approved by councillors, that is enough of a preliminary design and if that is tied together with the standard specification documents and the standard internal layouts prepared by the Department, it should be relatively straightforward and quick to begin a tendering process for design and build rather than having to go out with a separate procurement for an architect and another one for a builder.  It can be wrapped up into one process to get on site quicker.  The construction sector is well used to design and build because that is how a lot of private sector housing is done.  It is design and build but we do not call it that.  We need to use that more and accelerate delivery more.  That will free up some council resources to do other schemes like vacant renewal and combating dereliction via the social housing construction programme in our towns and villages, which is a very worthwhile area.  There will be a greater emphasis on that in the new Housing For All programme.  Design and build will not work on every site, but we should definitely be utilising it more and there is a definite desire to see it used more by local authority design teams.</p></speech>

It is something we will be proactive on because we want to start building affordable housing as soon as possible.  There is no question about that and there is no question about our ambition to do that.  We have the tools with the serviced sites fund and the new Bill and we are gearing up in terms of extra staff to deliver these units.  However, before we set concrete targets, we need to assess the demand and we will work very closely with the Department on that.  As soon as we have those targets, we will pass them on to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.738" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021030200002#L00800"><p>I thank all of the witnesses for their contributions, which have been very helpful.  I wish to make a couple of comments and then pose two specific questions.  There is a lot of talk about ambition and targets, particularly from committee members, which is good, but let us all just remind ourselves that targets will only be set in accordance with the funding provided.  Unless the Government invests more than &euro;50 million in the serviced sites fund and &euro;35 million in the CREL scheme, we will not see the local authorities or AHBs expand their ambition.  We need to be realistic about this.  If we want ambition, it will have to be matched by funding.  Otherwise, the stuff does not get built.</p> <p>  I support Deputy McAuliffe's call for mixed income AHB developments.  Of course, the easiest way to do this is to allow the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, to be used by AHBs for mixed social and affordable rental schemes.  They have been calling for that for years and neither the previous Minister nor the current one has agreed to it.  If the Deputy has any influence with his party colleague and he wants to make sure this is delivered, he should use it.  Let us not have two separate funds.  Let us allow the AHBs to have one fund to deliver exactly the kinds of schemes Deputy McAuliffe is rightly calling for.</p> <p>  On the target setting, Mr. Curran is being very generous to the Department.  The methodology for the housing needs demand assessment has not actually been produced by the Department yet.  Local authorities are drawing up their development plans without this methodology.  I know from my own local authority, South Dublin, that the development plan will be finished before that methodology is complete and issued.  Again, if we want our local authorities to set targets, the Department should give them the methodology for these exercises before they complete their development plans.  If anybody has any influence on that, it would be very helpful.</p> <p>  I want to go back to price because ultimately, all of this comes down to what price people are paying.  Let us take the example of a two-bedroom unit renting at &euro;1,200 and a family over the threshold for social housing in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority area.  A family with a gross household income of &euro;38,000 or &euro;39,000 paying &euro;1,200 in rent will be left with a weekly income of &euro;490.  Trying to raise two children, for example, on a weekly income of &euro;490 is simply not acceptable so we have to find ways of bringing rents down for those people or raising the social housing threshold.  What can be done to bring rents down further?</p> <p>  In terms of house prices, the guide price we are hearing is about &euro;250,000 and that is before the shared equity element of the serviced sites fund is taken into account; it is after that discount.  The average Rebuilding Ireland home loan in Dublin is &euro;200,000, so again, what we can do to bring those costs down in order that the above-average income worker can get the finance to purchase a home, even with the serviced sites equity element built in, at a price that is affordable?</p></speech>

All of that will help to drive costs down.  Obviously, expanding the serviced sites fund will also help.  There are a number of things that can be done.  The situation is similar with regard to cost rental because the level of rent depends on the cost of construction, operation and maintenance.  If we can lower those costs, we can lower the rent.  People can get a significant discount.  I know that in Dublin, in places like D&uacute;n Laoghaire, rents of &euro;1,700 per month are being paid and if they come down to between &euro;900 and &euro;1,200, that is a very significant reduction.  I will hand over to Mr. Dunne now.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.741" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021030200002#L01100"><p>One of the virtues of the social rental housing system that we have is that it applies a differential rent in order that, by definition, the housing is affordable.  Rent is based on someone's income and a certain proportion of that income.  Ideally, we would also like that to be operative in the cost-rental model so that people would pay according to their income and that would be, by definition, affordable going forward.  It is to be hoped that kind of unitary model between social and cost rental will be where we eventually end up.  In some ways, it has been a long time coming.  A number of people around the table here have argued for a long time for cost or affordable rental, or whatever term one prefers.  We need to prove the concept but the organs of the State have, in some ways, come on board now.  The rates, in terms of 30% CREL over a 40-year period and the 1.25% loan finance being provided by the Housing Finance Agency, have made this possible.</p><p>It could be better; we all want it to be better.  We all want the affordability to be much wider so that more households will be eligible for it.  We have brought the rents as low as we can.  Ideally, doing more to bring them down to within affordable levels is where we all want to be.</p></speech>

Cost rental is a model the Green Party has promoted for a long time, so I am delighted to see it placed on a statutory basis now.  The Vienna model has been in place for generations, and that is why it is so successful.  It is because it has proven track record.  Do we have a bit of work to do in this country to explain or promote cost rental as a long-term affordable solution, that tenancies are secure?  We have a history in Ireland of security of tenure not being good and tenants always being fearful of a landlord's knock on the door.  Have we a bit of work to do to show that this is a long-term, affordable solution for housing needs that will be safe and secure, that rents will be at an affordable rate based on incomes, that tenants will be secure there and will not always be desiring to attain home ownership?  Would the Housing Alliance have a view on that?</p></speech>

In a way, there does need to be a marketing exercise.  One significant advantage Vienna has over us is they began to build cost rental after the Second World War and even before that, so a large stock of housing was built up, and it is much easier to add to that stock because it can be cross-subsidised.  We are starting from a very low base.  Ideally, we are trying to achieve on the cost rental what housing associations have achieved on the social rental.  Organisations like the Iveagh Trust, for example, which began in the 1890s before the foundation of the State, have properties which were developed and which, if there is a vacancy, are still available to rent more than 100 years later.  We want to see that kind of model into the future, where we build up the stock of rental accommodation which will, over time, as a number of members have said, drive down the cost and bring that stability to the market so that we do not get these huge hikes and falls in rent but rather have much more stability and drive down the cost for everybody.</p></speech>

The discussion has been very broad and positive.  Unlike previous sessions, we have focused on many of the positive elements of the Bill which will see secure and affordable public housing being delivered by public agencies, which is a significant shift in the Bill.</p> <p>  I take on board the issue around funding.  That has been discussed.  Of course, something can only be funded in a given year when there is capacity in that given year, and it would be irresponsible to fund it if there is not current capacity.  In fact, it might actually be suggested it would have an inflationary impact, but that is a matter for a different day.</p> <p>  Has the Housing Alliance had discussions with the LDA?  This Bill is a companion one to the LDA legislation.  Has the alliance had discussions with the LDA about how these tools might be deployed on the agency's sites in partnership with the alliance?</p></speech>

Over that period we have both explored how the needs of citizens in this country can be best met: what our role is, what their role is and what is the local authority's role is.  That is still evolving.  I spoke to the chief executive only yesterday on this subject and there will be future meetings.  This is entirely the way things should be done and the way they are going.  We have to figure out where our strengths are, where the agency's strengths are, what the role of the local authority is, and then the three of us together figuring out how best to go forward.  There is a good relationship and common cause.</p> <p>  Again, the relationship between AHBs and local authorities is extremely positive.  There is nothing we could do without the support of local authorities.  It is their plans for their counties that determine our role in them.  When they decide we have some role to play in them, they invite us to be involved, complementing their own work, and this is the way it should be.  We are a relatively small player in terms of the State itself, the role of local authorities and the councillors in that area, which we accept.  We are very keen to work in partnership with everybody while all three entities think and are focused on the people - the children, the young people and the families - who depend on them not only for the provision of housing but also thriving communities.</p></speech>

In the other jurisdiction, north of the Border, there is a type of preliminary hearing called a committal hearing.  Interestingly enough, there were reviews of this recently.  With the speeding up of justice in mind, it was recommended that such hearings be abolished.  The reports on this side of the Border, however, have recommended that we introduce such hearings to speed up justice.  The main issue in the North concerned the cross-examination of victims at a hearing.  It was not considered appropriate for this to happen at a committal hearing or preliminary hearing.</p><p>What we want to do is ensure that whatever wording we have relaxes the arrangement and that, where possible, people will not be tested in a preliminary hearing, particularly victims or witnesses.  We want it to be done in an appropriate way.  That is the reason for the wording in our amendment.  Deputy Daly may have more to add in respect of that.  It is a very small amendment.  It is just to try to ensure that victims of crime, in particular, will not find themselves in circumstances in which a preliminary hearing becomes like one part of a double trial in which they must give evidence twice.</p></speech>

Pretrial hearings are, in general, a good idea because they will make sense in sorting out a lot of issues so juries will not be hanging around, especially in long cases.  There is a reference in the legislation to arraigning the accused person if it is felt to be appropriate.  We feel that should be tightened up a little.  An issue could arise over the chain of custody or there could be a technical issue in respect of which the accused should be able to make a guilty plea as early as possible and be given credit for that.  Thus, a minor technical issue could be sorted out and the accused would not have to be arraigned beforehand.  That was a concern I had about the section.</p></speech>

We are all trying to achieve the same thing.  Perhaps I am incorrect but my understanding of the amendment, as it is being set out, is that its effect would be to require a higher test for arraigning a person at the preliminary trial hearing.  I do not believe that is necessary in this instance.  It is being left up to the court, and it is appropriate that the court can decide whether an individual can be arraigned at the pretrial hearing.  If it is just an issue of case management, where somebody does need to be brought forward, a court can decide on that without having to show whether is in the interest of justice.Therefore, the amendment is possibly setting the bar too high.</p><p>Regarding the O'Malley review, a key recommendation is to try to deal with some of the challenges and issues that arise in a trial.  Regarding Northern Ireland, we have done something different.<b></b>The procedure in question is to be before the trial so there will be no need for an arraignment in every case.  Maybe I am not responding fully to what the Deputies are saying but my reading of the amendment, as it stands, is that it would just be setting a higher bar.  It is still very much up to the court to decide what is appropriate.  This is a key recommendation in the O'Malley report, among many others.</p></speech>

The experience in the other jurisdiction where wording in legislation has been loose is that it has been open to abuse or certainly what victims of crime in some cases have considered to be abuse.  We tabled this small amendment to tighten the language.  The Minister said it is setting the bar a little higher but in those particular circumstances it would be appropriate at least to warn the Judiciary that this is a scenario that could arise.</p></speech>

It is not only arraigning a person but considering matters such as case management, the availability of witnesses and the length of the trail.  We would be going into a different type of list.  This is simply focusing on arraignment.  It would be more appropriate that the court would be able to decide that without having to have a test or that a certain bar would have to be reached.  The test that is provided for is adequate.  It strikes the right balance between something that is workable and practical in reality in the courtroom.  We are setting a very high bar whereby the court can decide whether it feels it is appropriate.  Adding the words &ldquo;in the interests of justice&rdquo; would set a higher bar.</p></speech>

It does not prevent a matter from potentially being addressed later in a trial, for example, if new evidence arises or there is a reason a defence may seek to raise questions under section 21 of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act.  Removing the provision, as the amendment proposes, would mean a decision on whether to include this type of questioning could not be taken at the preliminary trial hearings.  The reason we are introducing this provision is to remove this type of decision from the subsequent trial where it might cause a delay.  That is not to say the matter cannot be addressed in the trial.  It is important that this question can be asked and a judge can decide whether it is appropriate in the preliminary trial hearing.  I suggest, therefore, that we keep this provision.</p></speech>

It sets out that where a person will be victimised, where there will be intimidation or where it is contrary to the interests of justice, a question about a person's private life is not acceptable.  It is not for me or the Deputy to decide whether that is appropriate in the context of a case.  It is very much up to a judge to decide that.  It is important to have an opportunity to resolve this type of issue before a trial where a victim will have obviously prepared.  We want the trial to go as smoothly as possible without being stopped and started again on issues like this.  There is a view that people should not be asked about their private life if it is felt it has nothing to do with the case but there may be some instances where they are related.  I do not have an example of that but a judge may decide it is important that somebody be questioned on his or her private life.  As I said, it is important that judges be allowed to make such decisions.  It is also important that we can get the matter out of the way in the preliminary trial hearing.</p></speech>

During trials requests could be made for information on victims' sexual history, which could increase disruption and leave them trying to find legal representation quickly.  They would have to go into a pretrial hearing without knowing whether it would delve into their sexual history.  The language in the section does not deal with that in a manner we consider appropriate.  For this reason, we propose the amendment.</p></speech>

There is an onus on the prosecution and defence to highlight particular issues they want to raise at the pretrial hearing.  It is important that these are not put off and it is claimed later that something has arisen and needs to be raised.  Section 6(17) provides that there is an obligation on the prosecution and accused to inform the trial court of any orders.  That would apply, irrespective of whether they be sexual offence cases, where they intend to seek that at the first available opportunity.  These issues need to be raised at preliminary trial hearings.  This also takes into account that issues can arise, for example, new evidence, witnesses and other matters can arise throughout a trial.  We need to make sure we do not prevent these types of orders from being raised later on in a trial as opposed to at the preliminary trial hearing.</p><p>On the language, we are talking about efficiency and disruption and later on where something "may" arise limits the scope under which a decision by a judge can be made as to whether something is admissible.  It narrows that provision.</p><p> I fully accept we must ensure that as much as possible is addressed in the preliminary trial hearing and that is where we try to deal with it later in section 6(17), where there is an obligation on the prosecution and the accused to inform the trial of any orders they intend to seek at the first available opportunity.  It places the onus on all the parties to make any application specifically under this section 3 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981 at the preliminary trial hearing.  It also provides protection for later in a case where it may not have been possible to raise these matters in advance.</p><p> As I have said, the potential unintended consequence is where there are very specific reasons for acceptance relating to efficiency and disruption, it limits the scope for the judge to deal with the matter.  We have dealt with this in section 6(17) but we must pre-empt that there can be unintended issues arising and we need to allow the court to be able to deal with them.</p></speech>

It is important we review all legislation.  Deputies are aware that there is an existing provision within Standing Orders for post-enactment reports.  It is Standing Order 197.  It must be prepared by the Government or the Minister responsible for the legislation 12 months following the enactment.  It provides for a review of the functioning of the Act and this is laid before the Houses in the parliamentary library.</p> <p>  We have engaged with a number of people from the courts, the Director of Public Prosecutions and beyond on this legislation, which has been discussed for some time.  There is a concern that if we wait for a review in three years, the progression on implementation and function may be paused because people might be waiting for that review.  There is an existing provision for this to be looked at after a year and this will enable us to ensure the provisions can be implemented as quickly as possible.  Any changes could be made before that three-year period is up and they could happen in the next year or so.</p> <p>  This legislation is a long time in the making so it would be better to implement required changes sooner.  I agree with the Deputy but if we could have a review after one year, it would serve the implementation of the legislation better.</p></speech>

I remember the debate on the Standing Order.  The issue was whether we should review all legislation after 12 months because as much legislation is complicated, it could not be assessed after 12 months.  The debate was whether we should have a two-year horizon on legislation.</p> <p>  On foot of this discussion, I will bring before the committee dealing with D&aacute;il reform the issue arising from the reviews just going to the library without anybody seeing them.  Newer Members may not be aware this is happening in any event.  We need a different procedure whereby the legislation, once reviewed, would be somehow notified to the D&aacute;il or, more properly, one of the standing committees.  There might be a requirement to review the review, see how the legislation is being implemented and whether further amendment or tweaking of the legislation is required.  It is an important part of procedures that is probably not followed through with sufficient vigour.  It often transpires that legislation we enact does not do what we want it do or does something we do not expect it to do.  It is useful to have a review.  Note may be taken in a Department but it might be a decade before amending legislation comes in a normal cycle.  That is instead of addressing issues where it might be appropriate for them to be reviewed by committees.  It is a good amendment.</p></speech>

It might be interesting to see that number.</p> <p>  If the review happens after a year, that is fair enough, but this amendment would not have an impact on the review.  The review could happen and we could look at it again in three years.  I do not see what is the problem.  If it is the case that the legislation is working well after a year, it should work well after three years.  It may work okay after a year but a problem might arise that could be picked up at a later stage.  It is important to have a review mechanism.</p></speech>

Perhaps that is something that should be discussed by the committee dealing with changes to Standing Orders.  I am very happy for that to happen.</p></speech>

In this case, the legislation has been requested for a long time and some concerns have been raised with us by those who have engaged with us on the matter.  My concern is that by waiting and including in primary legislation a requirement to have a review after three years, the legislation may not progress or be implemented in the way we want because people will wait for the review to happen.</p><p>If the review could happen more quickly, which is within the 12 months set out under the standing order, then if any further changes, requirements or updates are necessary, that would be done quickly in order that this can become embedded as quickly as possible and we are not waiting for the three years.  It is simply not to delay that review.  That it would happen more quickly would be my preference.</p></speech>

The reality is that within a year, there will be very little to examine or on which to carry out a study.  It will take a little time to see what the outworking of this legislation is.  It will probably take two or perhaps three years before we will be able to have a review which would have any substance and would be able to examine a number of cases that would have passed through the preliminary process.  If we do it within a year, all we would be doing is examining the legislation we have passed rather than examining its implementation.  Deputy Pringle is probably correct.  We need to push it out a little.  While I understand that in normal situations one would pass legislation and examine it after a year, in this case it is the working of the legislation, its implications and how well it has worked or not that has to be examined.  That will take a period of time.  Perhaps the three years would be an appropriate time in that respect.</p></speech>

That will all be dealt with in the preliminary hearing.  The issues we focus on, and this has been raised today and in other forums, are issues relating to cases of rape or sexual abuse, in particular, where a person's character or a person's sexual history would come into it - the clothing a person was wearing on a night out was used in cases in the past - and how that can be dealt with in a preliminary hearing.  We would all suggest, hopefully, that it should not be something that would be taken into a trial.</p> <p>  However, I wonder about other aspects of it.  For example, we often see in trials where there is a great deal of evidence of what is called a person's good character, a character reference.  For many people it is a type of suggestion that the accused person in a particular case may be from a particular class rather than from another class, and that is often used in proceedings of that nature.  Most of us would suggest that this is not appropriate.  Is that something that can be dealt with in preliminary hearings to ensure it cannot be brought up in cases, particularly where there are very serious assaults?  The emphasis should be on the action that took place, how it happened, where it happened and whether the person is convicted of it, rather than whether the person was in good standing in the local GAA club or whatever.  That is not the issue.  The issue is the hurt or harm that was done to another individual or to society in general.  Does the Minister have a view on that?</p> <p>  In addition, we are going into a situation where the emphasis of the legislation is on speeding up the judicial system to make it more efficient and work better.  However, as I said earlier, the experience in the other jurisdiction north of the Border has been that it has not done that.  In fact, it has created a system almost of double trial and delayed justice, rather than speeded-up justice.  We need to be cognisant of that as we move forward with this and ensure we do not go down that path and that we learn from the lessons north of the Border.  It is a different judicial system.  That must be said.  There are serious differences, and quite major differences in some places, but I believe lessons need to be learned at the same time.</p></speech>

The Minister can set out under section 5(2) to section 5(4) the types of orders that can be set under this legislation that can be addressed in the preliminary trial hearing, the reasons for doing so, the nature of the offence concerned and the complexities that arise in particular offences.  The provisions of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act provide important protections to victims here, which is slightly different from the North.  We have seen examples of particular cases where items of clothing were held up and certain things were supposedly brandished in courtrooms.  There are protections here whereby that should not happen and is not allowed.  One cannot always prevent something happening in a courtroom which should not happen, but there are protections under current legislation to prevent something like that happening.  The fact that the Minister can specify orders that are relevant defence or that are indictable under this legislation allows some flexibility that is not specified in the legislation itself.</p> <p>  Overall, the implementation of the O'Malley report and the implementation plan supporting a victim's journey are important in that process as well.  It is not just about the criminal procedures and the court process, but the type of supports that are being provided to victims, be it through legal aid or through other supports.  It is important that all of these recommendations are implemented as a package.  It is not just this legislation that will support victims who are going through very difficult scenarios and where difficult questions are being asked.  There will sometimes be scenarios where difficult questions are asked and we cannot always prevent that from happening, but we can do everything we can to ensure the support is available and that victims have that support throughout, not just in the court but beyond that as well.</p></speech>

Deputy Brian Leddin is substituting for him.  The purpose of our meeting is to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny of the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2019 and to examine delays in driver licence renewals and driver tests.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the following officials from the Road Safety Authority, RSA: Mr. Sam Waide, CEO; Mr. Declan Naughton, director of driver testing and licensing; Mr. Brian Farrell, communications manager; and Mr. Michael Rowland, director of road safety, research and driver education.  They are all very welcome and I thank them for attending at such short notice.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable and engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of domestic law and how it may  apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  For those watching this meeting online, Oireachtas members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only the Chairman and necessary staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everyone's forbearance should any technical issue arise.</p> <p>  I call on Mr. Waide, CEO of the RSA, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank committee members most sincerely for the opportunity to speak to them this morning and to discuss the pre-legislative scrutiny of the road traffic Bill and delays in driver licence renewals and driver tests caused by the current Covid-19 pandemic.  I am joined virtually by some of my senior leadership team, which was noted by the Chair, and together we will endeavour to answer committee members' questions.  We have submitted a full briefing note on the issues under discussion.  I do not propose to read it in full but I would like to highlight the main points in the interest of addressing key concerns which committee members may have.</p> <p>  With regard to the road traffic Bill, as members know, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced on 1 February the Government's approval to draft legislation which addresses several road traffic and road safety related issues.  The main provisions of the Bill include legislation around the use of e-scooters and e-bikes.  In addition to the legislation relating to e-scooters and e-bikes, the Bill will also include revision of legislation regarding the giving of driver instruction for reward, the introduction of a new power of the Road Safety Authority to revoke a driver licence and legislation for autonomous vehicles on Irish roads.  </p> <p>  The RSA welcomes the Bill and its provisions and looks forward to more details being published.  It also goes without saying that we are available to participate in future detailed pre-legislative scrutiny at a time decided by the committee.</p> <p>  The following summarises the situation regarding RSA services and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on them.  I will begin with the driver theory test.</p><p>The extension of Covid-19 level 5 restrictions by Government, until at least 5 April, means that the driver theory test continues to be suspended.  More than 80,000 driver theory test appointments in place over the coming months are now being rescheduled because the suspension of the service is being extended.  We are very much focused, in line with Government advice, on meeting the demand to restore pre-Covid waiting times when the service reopens.<br/><br/>We have plans to significantly increase capacity within the service when it can reopen.  This includes increasing capacity from an average of 15,000 tests per calendar month to 50,000 tests per calendar month when the service resumes.  This increased capacity will be available from mid-April 2021.  In addition to this, we are working on rolling out an online driver theory test service called ProProctor.  This was trialled in December and January for those taking a theory test for trucks and buses.  The pilot is now being evaluated and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is committed to extending the service for all theory test types during 2021. <br/><br/>Regarding driver licences and the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, announced details of a further extension to the expiry dates of driver licences on 24 February, as have other EU member states.  The extension will apply to different groups of licence holders, including those who benefited from previous extensions in 2020.  Drivers can see if they qualify for the extension by using the expiry date calculator onthe website <i>ndls.ie</i>.  Entering the expiry date printed on a driver licence into the calculator will tell a driver the new expiry date.  The RSA has told Insurance Ireland and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the extension to the driver licences.<br/><br/>Processing times for driver licences are taking longer than usual at the moment with standard applications processed within a 12 to 15 day average as opposed to the normal three to five day average.  This is due to higher volumes of applications, inclusion of a postal option for those aged over 70 and more complex Brexit-related cases.  The introduction of the extension to expiry dates of licences will result in reduced applications.  We are undertaking a number of measures with the service provider which will improve the rate of processing and we anticipate that turnaround times will return to normal levels shortly.<br/><br/>For those who need to apply for a licence or a learner permit, the NDLS centres remain open for essential workers.  In addition, our online application service <i>ndls.ie</i>has been successfully rolled out and those with a public service card and a verified MyGovID account can apply for their licence or permit online.  To date, in 2020, more than 40% of customers have applied online.<br/><br/>I know members are anxious about the backlog that is building up in the driver testing service so I will provide an update on this.  From the outset, we should not underestimate the impact Covid-19 has had on the driver test and the challenges faced by RSA driver testers to deliver the driver test safely during this global pandemic.  The RSA's priority is the safety of its staff, test environment and customers.  We have strict public health protocols in place to achieve this and, to date, since reopening in July 2020, we have conducted almost 90,000 driver tests.  The service is being delivered safely and in line with public health advice.  Our driver testers are working to test people in cars, trucks and buses so that supply chains can remain open and those deemed as essential under regulations can continue to provide their essential work.  I must commend our testers on their commitment to road safety and to delivering a vital public service at this time.<br/><br/>The waiting time for a driver test, pre-pandemic, was six weeks.  As a result of Covid-19, the suspension of services for more than four months and ongoing restrictions have all generated significant backlogs.  The extension of Covid-19 level 5 restrictions by Government until at least 5 April means that the driver test service can only deliver driver tests to essential workers.  Since we can only test essential workers, we are not able to fill all our available capacity so most recently circa 25% of driver test slots are going unused.  We expect this to persist during level 5 restrictions.<br/><br/>It is not possible to provide waiting times for the driver test because the service is not operating as normal.  As tests are only available to essential workers and we have surplus capacity we can offer test slots to essential workers almost on demand.  What we can say is that we have 98,414 applications on hand and of these 5,670 hold a test appointment in the coming weeks while 62,024 are waiting for a test.  The remaining 30,720 are ineligible for a test.  Those who are ineligible are generally customers who have not completed mandatory lessons.<br/><br/>If all customers who are eligible to be tested at present, that is, if there were no restrictions, were offered a test appointment in chronological order, we estimate that the average waiting time would be more than 20 weeks.  The RSA is making good progress in recruiting an additional 40 driver testers sanctioned by the Minister of State and our expectation is they will be available to conduct tests by the end of June 2021.  In addition to the existing complement of 138 driver testers, this will add much-needed capacity to the service.<br/><br/>However, this will not be enough to get waiting times down to the service level commitment of an average of ten weeks. The RSA is submitting further proposals to the Department of Transport seeking approval for an additional number of driver testers, on a temporary basis, to tackle the backlog.  <br/><br/>The RSA launched a new customer portal, <i>MyRoadSafety.ie,</i>on 30 November 2020.  It is a one-stop shop for all RSA services.  Initial teething problems with the new system led to issues for our driver test customers, in particular long call waiting times to access our customer care centre, CCC.  This was compounded by the large number of customers contacting us looking for a driver test date.  We have assigned additional resources to our customer call centre and reduced the call waiting times by more than 50%.  However, volumes are continuing at high levels with driver testing wait times being the main query.  We continue to improve this service.<br/><br/>I am happy to take questions from the Chair and committee members.</p></speech>

I will take the first Fine Gael slot.</p> <p>  I go back to Mr. Waide's point that there will not be enough driver testers.  There are 138 driver testers in place at the moment and there will be another 40 by the end of June to meet the commitment of an average waiting list time of ten weeks.  According to my analysis of the figures, there are roughly 68,000 people awaiting tests, 5,670 of whom have appointments as essential workers.  There are a further 30,720 who are awaiting the approved driver test hours from instructors.  There are just short of 100,000 people in the mix awaiting driver tests.  In addition, there are 80,000 people awaiting driver theory tests.</p> <p>  The waiting list is 100,000 and the existing number of RSA testers is between 138 and 140, which will increase to 178.  If the RSA runs with existing testers, how many weeks will it take?  I did a quick calculation and I reckon it would take about 20 weeks.  How many additional testers does the RSA require, beyond the 178, to get the average waiting time down to ten weeks?</p></speech>

We had expected to be at seven at this point but due to the pandemic we are not.  The question is around how quickly we get to seven or eight tests a day.</p><p>The short answer is that we would need 40 additional driver testers to get to ten weeks by February 2022.</p></speech>

Has the RSA made a submission to the Department of Transport for these further 40 driver testers?  The RSA is seeking to recruit 80 additional driver testers on top of the 138 it has at present.  Some 40 have been approved and recruitment is under way and it expects to have them in place by the end of June.  Has the RSA submitted an application to the Department of Transport for the additional 40, to bring it up to 80 testers?</p></speech>

It was with a view to having them on the pitch earlier this year.  It would have brought our waiting times to ten weeks, assuming we are able to deliver seven or eight tests per day by the end of this year.  The Department granted us sanction to take on 40 additional driver testers on the foot of that submission which is still live with it.</p></speech>

The number will then be 218.  How quickly can the RSA have these 80 additional testers in place if it gets the sanction?  If they are in place and the level 5 restrictions are lifted, how quickly can the 218 driver testers reduce the backlog of more than 100,000 waiting on driver tests, many of whom are young people?  It has huge implications for jobs and cost of insurance.  Insurance could be reduced by between 30% and 80% for a young driver.</p> <p>  Can Mr. Naughton give me the logistics of getting sanction, having the additional driver testers in place and having things operational, so that the waiting list is reduced from 20 weeks to ten weeks?

If the additional 40 come on board, I would like to see the timeframe on the recruitment be brought back from October.  Everything should be done because this is an enormous issue for ordinary people who cannot get driver tests.  Once level 5 is lifted, it is hugely important that, dare I say it, the RSA is able to drive on with speed on this issue.  I thank Mr. Naughton and Mr. Waide.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Waide for the presentation.  On the significant increase in capacity in driver theory tests that looks set to materialise in mid-April, how will it be done and will it include the online element?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-02a.862" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021030200002#C03200"><p>I can take that question as well.  At pre-pandemic theory test capacity, we were able to have normal waiting times of up three weeks by doing 15,000 to 17,000 theory tests every month.</p><p> To deal with the backlog that happened over the first level 5 restrictions, we moved up to being able to do between 22,000 and 25,000 tests, and that helped us to loss some of the lost ground.  Clearly, with further level 5 restrictions during October to November, and also from late December to now going on to April, much more fundamental measures are needed.  Over the last month or six weeks, we have engaged with the service provider, Prometric, to see how to bring back the waiting times and meet the demand that is there.  The puzzle that is now signed off on is that the capacity will be doubled over those coming months.  The plan initially had been that if we were back up and running on 5 March, that for the months of April, May and June, potentially, 50,000 tests could be delivered in each of those months.  That is pushed out now obviously because we will not be back up and running until April.  If we look at the number of people who have test appointments at the moment, the number is a little over 82,000.  What that extra capacity will do is generate slots into the system that either new people can apply for or in the case of existing people who have slots up to October and November of this year, they can pull back and apply for another earlier slot during the year.  They are both options that are available to either existing candidates or new people wishing for an appointment.  That is signed off on with the service provider.</p></speech>

That has been really successful.  Obviously there have been issues in terms of evaluating the applications.  We want to make sure that security, invigilation and connectivity are secure and adequate and that any learnings coming out of that will be applied to the car tests when we roll it out.  On foot of that, we are also having conversations about how to roll this out for car tests.  While most of the conversation during the last couple of weeks and months has been around additional capacity, we have also been having conversations about the online capacity.  Currently, the plan is that by June, we should be able to roll out some capacity for cars.  Our expectation is that we will be able to do about 1,000 a month.  That is why the Deputy will understand why we concentrated on the much higher numbers available in the centres.</p></speech>

I note it has been stated that because of the restrictions whereby the RSA can only test essential workers, some testing centres or testers are operating at 75%.  There is an earlier blockage in the system because some essential workers cannot get a test because they cannot complete their essential driver training, EDT, lessons.  Why does that blockage exist?  Has the situation been reviewed?  It is an anomaly that essential workers have been prevented from sitting a test when there are available test spaces because they cannot get lessons.</p></speech>

We do not know the numbers because when people apply for a test they do not tell us their occupation.  The public health advice that we have received is that driving instructors should only be doing pretest lessons and not the mandatory EDT lessons.  That is the public health advice that we have got and that is what we abide by in terms of the advice to driver testers and our customers.</p></speech>

Therefore, anybody who has a renewal, their licences will be extended by ten months.  There was no announcement at that stage about learner permits.  I understand that the Department is considering the matter.  It would be a decision nationally for ourselves.  We do not need EU sanction because learner permits are a national matter.  So that consideration is happening in that space, I understand.</p></speech>

I am pleased that extensions have been given because I was finding in the constituency office an inordinate number of elderly people who did not have access online and were unable to do a walk-in service in the offices of the authority, which is regrettable.  My office was open with all of the Covid prevention measures in place and we found ourselves having to do the online work for them.  I fail to see why such work could not have been done in the RSA offices.  However, we were happy to do it and, thankfully, it worked out in many cases.</p> <p>  The real issue is young people who, as the Chairman has said, are waiting to get their tests.  In addition to the other considerable burdens on young people as a result of Covid, the delay is causing enormous stress.  The witnesses have indicated that the RSA has sought to get 40 additional staff.  Will they be recruited as full-time staff for the RSA?</p></speech>

There is a considerable backlog, as we have already said.  We need to bring that back down to ten weeks and at that point it will be stabilised.  There is a secondary exercise that we in the RSA have to do at that point.  We must consider what do we need to do to maintain it at ten weeks or less.  The people we are taking on now are on temporary contracts.  When we bring back our waiting times to ten weeks and stabilise, because that will take a considerable number of driver testers to do that, at that point we will do an estimation of how many driver testers do we need to maintain a continuous ten-week waiting time, and we will then make that submission to the Department in terms of permanency.  So how many of the driver testers we have at that point do we need to be permanent to maintain or even reduce the ten-week waiting time.</p></speech>

The authority should be trying to get to a point where it can do tests within two weeks, quite frankly, because ultimately when one brings it down to that level, the RSA will need the same amount of people to do the tests.  If the RSA sets the bar at ten weeks then it is the same number of people who are required if one sets it at two weeks.  The RSA also needs to have a greater number of temporary staff to cater for a surge in demand at certain times of the year.  To address the kind of situation that we have, the authority needs a more flexible pool of testers.  Of course, it needs the standard group who are there all of the time on full-time contracts but the job lends itself to having part-time staff appropriately trained that can be brought on at relatively short notice.  I ask the RSA to give consideration to this matter.</p> <p>  I wish to check an aspect of the authority's overall operation.</p><p>People who wanted to change from a British driving licence to an Irish licence have had difficulty in doing this during the lockdown period.  Without a public services card, they do not seem to be able to do that.  Can Mr. Naughton enlighten us?  Is there any way, in the current climate and without access to the offices, for someone who wants to replace a British licence with an Irish licence to do so without a public services card?</p></speech>

People can apply online with a public services card if they have one.  Otherwise, attendance at the office is needed to do business in that fashion.  In 2019 and 2020, and to date in 2021, 71,000 people have exchanged their licences.  That was very near the number that was expected of those who hold UK licences.</p></speech>

We are all frustrated by the delays.  I have received emails about this, including one from a young man who applied to take the driver theory test on 27 July last year but is still waiting.  Like Senator Dooley, I wonder if we could be more innovative and expeditious in our approach to driver testing and essential driving training?  I note from Mr. Naughton's remarks to the Chairman that the RSA gave four options to the Department.  On the driver theory test, Mr. Naughton speaks about rolling it out, but why are we waiting until June to roll it out?  The four options to the Department include recruiting 100 testers on an 18-month contract.  Could the RSA not break those contracts into chunks of six months or two months given that we will be in level 5 until 5 April at least and maybe beyond? </p></speech>

Could these be broken down into shorter term contracts to hire additional testers?</p> <p>  With regard to the driver theory test, Mr. Naughton referred to 1,300 trial online theory tests taken for the bus and truck driver test.  Why are we waiting until June to roll this out when we should be increasing capacity online now?</p></speech>

The Senator will appreciate that, from an invigilation and anti-fraud point of view, an online test is a much more involved process than doing the test in the test centre.  The 1,300 trial tests were for bus and truck drivers.  The numbers for car drivers will be some 100,000 per month, which is much greater than already undertaken with the bus and truck theory tests.  The volumes will be greater and, therefore, the infrastructure and capacity needed will be greater.  This is why it will be at least June before we could do that.</p></speech>

There are a number of measures we need to take to be absolutely sure the test is the same as if the person went to a theory test centre.  These are the considerations that need to be taken into account.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to the contractual period.  To attract people to becoming driver testers we need to offer a decent contract.  We need to offer contracts of 18 months at a minimum.  The training period is six or seven weeks and there is a lead-in time for recruitment.  When offering contracts and trying to attract people we need to offer a minimum time to ensure we get good people into the service.  That was the thinking around the duration of the contract.</p></speech>

Something less than the leaving certificate is sought but in practice it is not academic qualifications that are critical.  It is really around people, assessment service and the ability to deliver a quality service.  These are the skill sets we look for rather than academic achievement.</p></speech>

One person who contacted me lives in Cork city and had booked a driver theory test for 27 July 2020.  The earliest appointment available to him was 31 January in Ennis or 16 February in 2021 in Cork.  These dates were cancelled due to level 5 restrictions and he has now been given a new date of 2 June 2021.</p> <p>  My driving licence expired in the middle of last summer.  I thank the NDLS staff in Cork who were very efficient, courteous and professional.  While in the queue, I watched how they dealt with people and I want to give them credit for the way they handled the system.  I thank them for that.</p></speech>

Why are we settling for ten weeks?  If the RSA was to set a target of a two or three-week waiting time, how many testers would be required in the short, medium and long term?</p></speech>

My feeling is that for the most part people need certainty around the test day.  That is the critical issue.  Once they know it will be in eight, ten or 12 weeks, they plan around that.  They do their lessons and are ready to go on the day.  The critical issue is that they have certainty on when a test date will come up for them.  In the coming months, the RSA wants to provide a number of tools on our road safety portal to give people more certainty about when they can expect a driving test so they can plan around that.</p> <p>  On the Chairman's broader question, this is about resources.  Once we get to a steady ten weeks and we need, say, 140 testers to maintain the waiting time at ten weeks, if we wanted to bring that down to eight, six or four weeks, we would need greater numbers of driver testers.  It is a resource issue and a matter for the Government in how we allocate resources to the driving test as against other services.  If, in the conversation with the Department and the Government, they are open to having lower waiting times, we will certainly be open to having the conversation on doing that.  We have the capacity internally in the RSA to make that happen.</p></speech>

When those 80 testers come in the RSA will be able to function thereafter on a complement of 140 driver testers, with an average waiting time of ten weeks.  Am I correct in my analysis?</p></speech>

It would be a good measure to look at, and it is something we could follow up with the Department on the RSA's behalf.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has agreed to share its second slot with the Green Party.  I call Deputy Leddin, who is substituting for Deputy Matthews.  He has seven minutes.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for attending, in particular Mr. Waide.  I was very happy to receive the letter he sent last week about parking on footpaths and cycle lanes to both Deputy Matthews and me.  This is a very serious issue around the country and he acknowledged the seriousness of it in his response.  We look forward to the RSA campaign that will be rolled out nationally to try to change driver behaviour so that people do not park on footpaths and cycle lanes.  The onus is on motorists to give priority on the footpath to vulnerable road users and to those who have mobility impairments instead of thinking that their responsibility is to let the driver pass more safely.  The greater responsibility is to let those walking on the path get by.  I thank Mr. Waide for that.</p> <p>  On the subject of the theory test, we have seen quite a worrying trend in the past year where the rate of injury to pedestrians on roads has increased.  That is because a lot more people are out walking due to Covid and also because the lower traffic volumes mean that traffic tends to go faster.  Are the witnesses considering addressing the issue in the roll-out of the driver theory test?  That is perhaps a question for Mr. Naughton.</p></speech>

As things stand, the test includes questions about pedestrians and the interaction of drivers with them at pedestrian crossings and the use of footpaths and so on.  Normally, every 18 months or so there is a revision of the theory test.  At the next revision we will look at the casual factors that lead to crashes and injuries on the roads and review and update the theory test accordingly.  That is generally the approach we take to adapting the theory test in accordance with what is happening in real life on the ground.</p></speech>

I urge him to give it the priority it deserves because those trends are quite worrying.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to comment on the ambitious roll-out of active travel infrastructure across the country.  The Government is trying to make walking and cycling in particular a viable option for people in towns, villages and cities.  Does the RSA have interactions with other national authorities such as the National Transport Authority, NTA, or Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and does it input into the decision-making on the roll-out of active travel infrastructure?</p></speech>

The answer is "Yes".  We are engaging on an ongoing basis with other organisations and delivery agencies on road safety.  Most recently, for a number of months we have been working in partnership with said organisations &ndash; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Transport, the NTA, TII and all of the key delivery agencies - to develop the forthcoming road safety strategy that runs to 2030.  All of the matters, including those mentioned, are part of the discussions and detailed strategy and action plans.</p> <p>  I welcome the committee's view on the road safety strategy and specific interventions.  We have involved a wide range of stakeholders, not only the public sector organisations but the public as a whole, and we have reached out to political parties to seek their views on particular aspects of road safety and the transformation that is required over the next ten years to reduce the fatalities and serious injuries occurring on the roads in Ireland.  There has been ongoing consultation and discussion and it will evolve into a detailed strategy for the next ten years.  As a country and society, we are committed to vision zero, which is zero fatalities and serious injuries by 2050.  The programme for Government commitment is a 50% reduction in fatalities and serious injuries by 2030.  I look forward to those activities and actions that address many of the road safety challenges we have, including the specifics touched on by Deputy Leddin.</p></speech>

The final issue I wish to address is mobility scooters.  They are important tools to help people to maintain their independence.  I appreciate that the upcoming legislation on powered personal transporters excludes mobility scooters, but I would welcome the views of witnesses on how mobility scooters are provided for in road traffic legislation from a road safety perspective.</p></speech>

Whatever the sustainable mobility solution, it is extremely important that we maintain and enhance road safety.  Deputy Leddin is correct that as an organisation we have contributed to the legislation on e-scooters.  If I may, I will bring in my colleague, Mr. Michael Rowland, who has been leading our response and contribution in particular on the e-scooter part of the legislation.  He will comment further in that regard.</p></speech>

In particular, we have made recommendations on the permitting of devices for the rental schemes to ensure there is not an over-proliferation of e-scooters on footpaths or where there are other vulnerable road users, but that the scheme is well regulated.  We have also made recommendations on the guidance in terms of speed limits and where these devices should be used.</p><p>That relates in particular to the protection of other road users but also given the known speed tolerance for deaths and serious injuries of vulnerable road users in collisions with motor vehicles.  We have recommended that these scooters should operate within speed limits in no more than 50 km/h zones, but ideally, their use should be curtailed to 30 km/h zones, where possible.  Consideration needs to be given to the proliferation of these scooters where there are interactions with heavy goods vehicles.  Importantly, we have also highlighted the need for these devices not to be used on footpaths where there are vulnerable road users or pedestrians.  We have also made recommendations on the age limits of who can, and should, use these vehicles.  In line with that, we have recommended that the age limit should be 16 or older.  We have suggested that maximum speed limits of 20 km/h should be considered for these devices.  We have also made recommendations to the Minister and the Department on the use of personal protection equipment, PPE, and in particular, the use of helmets, considering the differing characteristics that these devices have when compared with the traditional bicycle in respect of the stability of the vehicle and while encountering uneven road surfaces.  The mandatory use of helmets, when using these vehicles, should be considered. </p><p> The RSA has an important role to play in the training, education and awareness campaigns.  We have welcomed the recommendations of the Minister in respect of us embarking on a major campaign to make other road users and potential users of these vehicles aware of their requirements under the rules of the road.  We have also made suggestions on the vehicle standards themselves, because that is critical to maintaining safety standards.  We are also working with the European Union on type approval, which we believe will need to be rolled out-----</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses.   There are a few points I would like to raise.  First, I received an email this week from a young constituent who is completing his leaving certificate.  He wants to be a paramedic more than anything.  To be a paramedic, one must have a full licence.  It is a requirement of enrolment into college, which is unique for any third level course.  He has applied for a B category theory test, and has a date for the test in May 2021.  Going on current waiting lists, it could be well into August before he could provisionally obtain his full licence.  With such a delay, he will not get his college place.  He is already looking at plan B and the possibility of taking a year out.  It is ludicrous that a delay in obtaining a driving licence would inhibit a 17-year-old who is planning a career as a paramedic in such a way.  It is a front-line health service profession.  The issue must be looked at.  There are a number of students in this predicament, right throughout the country.  In a normal year, it would be tricky for them to get a test date but it is particularly awkward this year.  I ask Mr. Naughton to respond.</p></speech>

If the case concerns a school leaver aged 17, they would first have to get a car licence.  I believe that Deputy Crowe said that the individual in question needs a C category licence, which means that they will first get their car licence, then move up to get the C category licence.  Therefore, in actual fact, it would take some time for them to get this licence.  It brings into question-----</p></speech>

Once he has a learner's permit, he will have to wait for six months before he can sit the test to get the licence.  In certain circumstances, we will facilitate people who need such licences for urgent purposes.  That is something that can be considered.</p></speech>

It is quite a unique situation.  A student who is going to study business or arts does not need a driving licence.  It might be desirable and something that their family wants for them, but it is not essential.  It is a requirement for someone who wants to undertake a course to become a paramedic.  That sets them quite apart from other students.  We all want to see young people get their driving licences but this situation sets these students apart from others in their age cohort.</p> <p>  The next issue I wish to raise it that of BE licences, which are required for towing dual-axis trailers.  Many people in rural Ireland, for example, farmers towing cow or horseboxes, use and require such licences.  A farmer from County Clare recently told me that when his licence came up for renewal, he submitted all the paperwork.  Lo and behold, when he got back his licence, the capacity to tow a trailer had been removed from it.  He went to the ends of the earth in trying to get an answer, and was told that there is a minuscule box on the form asking the licence holder if he or she wishes to keep their trailer licence on renewal of the driving licence.  That goes against the whole spirit of licence renewal.  The whole idea of renewing a licence is that the holder of a licence running close to its expiry date applies for it to be renewed and extended.  There are a number of cases, but not many, such as that to which I referred.  Those who have lost their BE licences in such circumstances, should have them reinstated immediately.  It is most unfair on farmers, and those in rural Ireland, in particular.  I ask Mr. Naughton to respond.</p></speech>

Normally, one has some time, ten years in most cases, within which it is live.  I am not sure of the individual circumstances in which somebody will not retain it.  Perhaps they did not tick the box when completing the form.  However, that would not prevent them from going back and reinstating it on their licence.  Certainly, in the NDLS, when a person attends the office, the agent behind the counter will tell actually that person that he or she has other categories on the licence and will ask him or her if he or she wishes to renew them as well.  We are conscious of that.  Therefore, if there are individual cases, I would certainly be happy to hear about them to see what could be done.</p></speech>

I wish to make one final point.  It concerns small public service vehicle, SPSV, licences, which are used by those who typically provide a local minibus or vital service.  There are currently huge delays in the granting of these licences.  The SPSV licence is a requirement for those who want to gain employment in that sector.  In recent months, we have seen how schools, particularly in rural areas, have been pressurised because of the Covid restrictions in respect of seating limits on buses.  It requires increasing numbers of drivers being able to take on contracts in rural areas.  If the drivers cannot take the test, they cannot drive the buses and play their role in that system.  Can Mr. Naughton tell members anything about how the process can be sped up?  The delays are denying people the opportunity to take up employment and keeping some of them on the live register unnecessarily. </p></speech>

It needs to be streamlined and made clearer.  That is just my experience, although it has been said to me many times in emails and phone calls from constituents.  It is not streamlined.  There is a great deal of gobbledegook that needs to be narrowed down to show what the service is and what the requirements are.</p></speech>

This is a huge issue throughout Ireland, and in particular in rural Ireland and my constituency of Tipperary.  Many of the general questions I had wished to ask have been asked and I will not repeat them.  The delays are causing significant problems for young people especially and have implications for jobs, the economy and insurance premiums being levied on young people while they await a test.  As I understand it from the figures, 68,000 people are awaiting a test, 30,000 are in the process of taking lessons, and 80,000 are awaiting the theory test.  It might be too much to ask but do our guests have the figures to hand for the waiting lists in Tipperary?  If not, I would appreciate it if they forwarded them to me.</p> <p>  I have a slight concern about the issue of testers.  Additional testers are needed, but given that many of them will work part time, I worry about their commitment to the job.  I am looking at this in the context of standardisation across the system.  It is not unusual for me to be told by a person who has taken a test that he or she had a stickler of a tester.  There seems to be a variation in the reactions of people who have taken a test.  Some of them find the test person to have been very nice and approachable and tell me he or she understood that they were nervous, treated them with care and gave them the kind of attention they deserve, whereas in other cases, people have told me that the tester was not nice to them.  For instance, I know of one tester who failed five people in one week, each of whom had been through lessons and had done the necessary preparation.  How are tests benchmarked within the RSA system?  How does the RSA ensure an equal standard across the system?  I am concerned about that number of people being brought in on a temporary, 18-month contract.  How can it be guaranteed that a temporary tester will be as good or as qualified as someone who is permanent and has been working within the system for years?</p> <p>  I very much welcome the submission that Mr. Rowland made in respect of e-scooters.  I am in favour of e-scooters but they must be strictly regulated.  We have all been to countries where e-scooters are licensed.  It is terrible to see them zigzagging between cars and on footpaths between people, where they are a danger to pedestrians.  I support many of the items within the submission.</p></speech>

Everyone is entitled to be treated with integrity, dignity and so on.  We very much emphasise that in our training and when talking to driver testers to ensure that level of quality will be given to every customer who comes in.  Whether it is the first or the 20th time he or she has taken the test, it is essential the customer be treated with dignity and respect.</p> <p>  As for the standard, we have a quality assurance policy.  The initial phase of any quality assurance has to be the recruitment process, followed by the training and then the on-the-ground supervision that happens when testers are in their local test centres and assessing driving tests.  They are the individual steps and that is monitored monthly.  Of course there will be variation.  I have examined data from throughout the EU and it is a reality that there are variations in terms of pass rates.  Even in the case of the 2020 leaving certificate, there was a difference between the calculated grades and the exam results of previous years.  Every driving test is different.  There are different road, weather, pedestrian and traffic conditions.  I assure the Deputy, however, that for the RSA, the integrity of the test is really important and we fully agree with him in that regard.  Everything we do is to try to ensure the customer coming in the door will receive a fair, transparent test.</p> <p>  In regard to the taking on of driver testers, I would like to think that within the 18-month contract, the combination of training, supervision and so on will lead to a commitment on their behalf to be with us and to want to make a career with us in future if that opportunity arises for them.</p></speech>

If somebody has failed the test, he or she is unlikely to give feedback in case it would jeopardise their chances in the future, but it would be good if people could do so.  I am not 100% happy with the aptitude and approach of some testers to people who are taking tests.  I have had too much negative feedback in that regard.  It is important that a system be put in place, if it is not already in place, whereby the applicant can give feedback that is treated confidentially within the system.</p></speech>

It is not just for the candidate or the customer to give feedback to the RSA.  There is another channel for the driving instructor to speak to the driver test supervisor and to convey any issues he or she may have.  Both channels are there and we encourage their use.  If there is an issue that is perceived by customers, we want to know about it and to improve our services by acting on any feedback we get.</p></speech>

I will commit the RSA to examining how we can receive that feedback in a more formal way, with the feedback remaining anonymous, because I recognise the Deputy's concern about the sensitivity of feeding back to the organisation about the customer experience.  That is at the heart of what we do.  It is about road safety but we also have to ensure the customer experience is satisfactory.  I welcome that suggestion and we as an organisation will take it away for formal consideration.</p></speech>

I compliment them on the work they do.  Following on from the questions of Deputy Lowry in respect of testers, is it not time for testers to wear a body camera for their own protection as well as to provide feedback for the organisation with regard to how tests are being run?</p> <p>  The year before last, I took to the streets of Dublin on a bicycle purely because I had been critical of cyclists and was challenged to do it.  Cycling around the streets of Dublin was taking my life in my hands. It was absolutely frightening.  I compliment the Government and the various county councils on the greenways that are being put in place around the country.  Cycleways are needed desperately.  Bearing that in mind, is there any prospect of the RSA running cycle training courses in national schools?  I am thinking of a person or a group of people travelling around the country to deliver one-week programmes that would help kids to sort of get into the essentials of cycling.  It is not as simple as putting one's leg over the crossbar of a bicycle and taking off, although far too many people think that is what it is about.</p> <p>  Mr. Rowland addressed the issue of e-scooters.  I have serious concerns about them.  In my part of south Dublin, there are three or four people who commute on a single-wheel vehicle without handlebars.  I have no idea how they brake, take corners or anything else.  These vehicles have a single wheel.  The rider stands on a sort of a platform with one foot on either side of the wheel.  What is the legality of such vehicles?  Where do they fit in with regard to road safety?</p> <p>  Cars have changed drastically since my day when we had crash gearboxes and God knows what else.  Today, cars are such a gathering of technology that it is not funny.  All cars now have satellite systems, reversing cameras and parking sensors.  Cars have sensors such that the driver is warned of oncoming cars when opening the door and is warned when changing lanes.  When is the driving test going to be brought up to speed to meet the technology?  I sometimes think the technology might have reached a stage whereby it has lulled us into a false sense of security that we can do no wrong while behind the wheel of a car.</p> <p>  On the issue of the employment of testers, I am aware that several former military people wish to move to the RSA.  They worked as highly skilled driving instructors in the military.  The issue of pension abatement has stopped them taking public service jobs.  Has the issue of pension abatement come across the desks of the witnesses at any stage?  </p> <p>  I thank them for their time and appreciate any answers they can give me.</p></speech>

I know there are other questions relating to cycling and e-scooters.</p> <p>  The issue when it comes to the usage of body cameras is the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  I am not in favour of bringing in body cameras because there are probably privacy issues to be considered.  It is a little more complex than might be thought at first blush.</p> <p>  On the issue of vehicle technology, I fully agree with the Senator that there is a need to look again at the driver test.  In fact, as recently as two weeks ago, this issue came up at an EU licensing committee meeting.  A new licensing directive will be brought into being in the next 18 months.  Some of the conversation at the meeting was certainly around how technology has changed driving and how we can adapt the test or the licensing process to take account of that.  That is certainly part of the thinking and will definitely see the light of day in the next 18 months or so. </p> <p>  Pension abatement has not really become an issue.  It may be the case that those who would be affected just did not apply in the first instance.  I am not aware of it as an issue in terms of it prohibiting people from taking up employment with the RSA but there is no doubt that if a person would lose some of their pension as a result of taking up another post, that would certainly be a deterring factor in terms of going for the post.  I am not aware of it being an issue that has arisen for the RSA.</p> <p>  I will pass on to Mr. Waide who will answer the other questions.</p></speech>

It is a cycle training programme delivered by accredited trainers at national schools throughout the country.  The programme has been in place for several years and is very popular.  There is great take-up of it by schools.  The Cycle Right programme is delivered to a particular standard by trainers who are trained to that standard.</p></speech>

Senator Craughwell is quite right.  Several of these are less stable on our roads, including hoverboards.  I suspect these are what the Senator has seen.  We recommend that they would not be included in the definition of e-scooters as proposed by the Department.</p></speech>

There are three in the Sandyford area that I see on a regular basis.  The vehicle I have in mind has what is like the wheel of a wheelbarrow with a platform on either side.  The person stands legs astride on this thing.  I have no idea how people manage it.  The hoverboard is another thing I would have a serious difficulty with.  I really want the place to be safe for cyclists.  I understand the frustration of cyclists.  I live on the side of the Dublin Mountains and we get cyclists every Saturday and Sunday going up to Enniskerry and on to the mountains.  The number of people who get on their bicycles is amazing.  Sadly, a few are not responsive to Covid-19 rules and regulations.  I appreciate the answer from the Road Safety Authority officials and their presence today to listen to what we have to say.</p></speech>

The capacity of testing is major and the committee needs to send that correspondence.</p> <p>  I wish to double up on what Deputy O'Rourke said earlier.  We need some sort of correspondence to deal with the anomaly of essential workers being able to have tests but not necessarily being able to have lessons.  Obviously, wherever this goes we must have some interaction with approved driver instructors and their representatives.</p> <p>  I will start with approved driver instructors.  We all spoke previously about the lack of access in test centres of toilet facilities, etc., which people need in work.  Have we any news or progress in moving that on?  One issue that has come up relates to the annual driver instructor permit renewal.  It costs a considerable amount of money.  I gather the figure is approximately &euro;250.  Businesses are under pressure and we are talking about putting in supports across the board.  What is the possibility of looking at a waiver in this regard?  I wish to deal with that point first.</p></speech>

We acknowledge this has been a contentious issue.  We also acknowledge that driver instructors have a major role to play in the whole learning-to-drive process.  We have acknowledged that publicly.  However, in terms of the protocols we have in place to prevent spread of the virus, we have strong rules around who can access the driver test centre.  We have conducted more than 90,000 tests since last June or July, when we returned, without any notified cases of virus transmission.  We strongly believe that those rules must remain in place while the pandemic is with us.  We would be delighted to welcome back ADIs when the conditions allow and when we get support from public health to say that is feasible.  However, right now it is not feasible and I believe that to do so would put our ability to continue to deliver driver tests at risk.  A whole architecture is necessary in respect of driver instructors but we do not have that in place.  We do not foresee that happening until the pandemic is no longer a factor.  I will ask Mr. Rowland to deal with the question of the renewal of the ADI permit.</p></speech>

People have already voiced that concern in respect of safety features of e-scooters.  Some of this lies in the fact that we are dealing with something that is unregulated and unlicensed.  Obviously, we welcome any level of regulation.  Have the RSA officials looked into international best practice, what is working and what is not working?  We are often given examples from parts of Britain where we have seen schemes in operation and parts of Germany and so on.  What aspects of these systems would we be dealing with?  Would we be allowing for a situation whereby local authorities would be able to operate e-scooter projects in same way as the DublinBikes scheme?</p></speech>

We also consulted with our colleagues in Europe to see how they were dealing with those issues.  That Transport Research Laboratories, TRL, report made a number of recommendations following which we made recommendations to the Minister at that time.  These are reflected in the submission we made to the Department last week on how these scooters should be regulated, dealing with safety, speed, who can use them and where they can be used, and all that goes with the safe use of these vehicles.

My committee colleagues have covered the driver licence element of this in good detail, so I will not revisit that.  I thank the witnesses for their responses on that.  On the matter of e-scooters, and further to what Deputies &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Leddin and others said, where does Mr. Rowland see e-scooters fitting into the overall transport network of first-mile and last-mile solutions in five and ten years' time?  We seem to have been fighting long and hard for improved infrastructure for bikes, but in fairness there have been huge leaps forward on this in the past months.  E-scooter use has exploded in the last few years and months.  When we plan road safety policy and transport infrastructure, to what extend have e-scooters entered the conversation on how we will plan our cycle lanes, our safe lanes and our regional towns?  For example, I live in Swords and we are hoping at some stage to have a MetroLink.  I hope to be able to cycle or get an e-scooter from our home to a MetroLink stop that may be too close to drive to but too far to walk for a daily commute.  What conversations are taking place about five and ten year's down the line, and not just about this legislation?  If the use of e-scooters grows at the current rate, they will be incredibly common in our major towns and cities, as common as the use of bikes if not more so.  I am interested in Mr. Rowland's thoughts on that.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell referred to cycling in Dublin city.  Some 20 years ago I witnessed a cycling fatality in Dublin city.  It was a horrific thing to happen and to have witnessed.  It highlighted to me how unsafe our city is.  It is welcome to see cycle lanes developed but to what extent will they be improved and networked?  As with the pencil bollards, which are necessary for traffic segregation, what is the long-term plan for these lanes which are unsightly.  It would be great to see them replaced with a different type of segregation, perhaps a lower kerb, when other road users and particularly motorists are used to and accept the fact that cyclists have parity and need extra protection on our roads.  I am interested in Mr. Rowland's thoughts on the future for e-scooter use.</p></speech>

This is the function of the National Transport Authority and the Department of Transport.</p></speech>

We have made a number of recommendations on how they could be used on our roads.  The road safety strategy, which our CEO, Mr. Waide, referred to earlier, will also look at micro-mobility or e-scooters.  I expect there will be a number of recommendations on the safety measures and how they can be used.  From the Road Safety Authority point of view, in addition to education and awareness, we are also responsible for the type approvals and ensuring that those types of vehicles or scooters are safe and meet a required standard.</p></speech>

I will take two minutes and I will give two minutes each if others would like to be brought back in.</p> <p>  Apart from the driver test, the committee is doing pre-legislative scrutiny on the road traffic (miscellaneous provisions) Bill 2019.  The Minister has indicated that he will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to deal with the whole issue of e-scooters and e-bikes.  Could I get a summary under a couple of headings?  I understand that a speed of 25 km/h is being considered.  The RSA has put in 20 km/h.  It has not yet decided on an age limit.  Will Mr. Rowland elaborate on why the RSA believe the age of 16 and over is important?  It will not be classified in any way.  Is there a need for a register for these types of personal powered transport vehicles, PPTs, that are coming in?  What about the whole area of where they are allowed to be used?</p> <p>  I am amazed that more cyclists are not killed in Dublin.  I often get a bus or a taxi to Heuston Station and I am amazed at what I see.  While it is hugely positive to see so many cyclists, it is certainly an area that requires a duty of care from cyclists and from drivers so that nothing happens.  What is Mr. Rowland's perspective on where the PPTs should be allowed?  There is talk of them on cycle lanes and bus lanes and not being used on footpaths and not being allowed on national roads or motorways.  Greenways will be looked at separately.  Will Mr. Rowland go through those headings of speed, age limit, the need for a register and where they should be allowed to park and be used?  Mr. Rowland said they should be regulated by local authorities.  Should they be more properly regulated by the RSA or the NTA?  The rapid growth in the number of these e-scooters and e-bikes, as mentioned by Deputy Smith, is quite amazing.  It is a positive feature but there are elements to their use that cause severe worry with regard to safety.  Will Mr. Rowland go through those headings?</p></speech>

The submission was based on a previous submission we had made in 2019.  We recommended a speed of 20 km/h at that time.  Given the vulnerability of road users and that these are unprotected vehicles, we felt that a 20 km/h speed limit was an appropriate one for consideration.  I know the Minister suggested 25 km/h.  I do not disagree with that, but we suggest that 20 km/h would be an even better speed limit.</p><p> On the age of users of powered vehicles, again, we felt that given that they can achieve quite significant speeds on the roads and that anybody under 16 would not have the necessary skill sets or abilities to use them in a safe manner.  It is important that whoever uses them has the ability to use them and we were concerned that children could get their hands on these vehicles and that they could be seen as a toy when in actual fact they are a means of transport.  That was the important issue for us in terms of the age being set at 16 years or older for potential users of electric scooters.</p><p> It is not within our gift to say where the scooters can be used, but we suggested that they could be used in 30 km/h zones and that they should not be used on high-speed roads.  We also made a recommendation that, if possible, we need to limit their use in areas where there is a proliferation of heavy goods vehicles.  Those are among the recommendations that we have made.</p><p> You referred, Chairman, to the local authorities.  One of the suggestions was that it could be done nationally, or it could be done by local authorities.  It will be up to the Department to decide.  What is important is to ensure that we do not have an over-proliferation of these vehicles.  We have seen situations where there has been an over-proliferation-----</p></speech>

From a road safety perspective, we need to limit their use to appropriate use and ensure that the users are safe, educated and aware of the dangers.  If a register helps with that, we would welcome it, but I do not think it is within my gift to make such a recommendation.</p></speech>

If it is, how long will it take or what will the format of it be?  It is important that the legislation we progress would allow for cities like Cork to launch an e-scooter scheme this summer as we prepare to reopen cities in a safe way.  I welcome the contribution.

I am interested in the restriction that is preventing us from getting to eight tests a day.  Does it specifically relate to Covid-19 restrictions?  What is the likely timeframe?  Related to that, has there been any exploration of overtime, adding extra hours to the working day or working at weekends?  Is it a five-day service or a seven-day service?  Have the boundaries been pushed and tested in that regard?</p></speech>

At that point we had planned to move to seven tests a day towards the end of December or the beginning of January this year and to provide eight tests a day perhaps two months or so thereafter, but the new level 5 restrictions really impacted on that.  Right now, all of the reasons that we are doing six tests a day rather than eight tests a day are down to Covid.  The Deputy will understand if I say that we are not quite sure when we will get back to doing seven or eight tests a day because it depends on the progress of the suppression of the disease.  As I mentioned earlier, that will have a big impact in terms of us managing our backlog.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Rourke had a second question.</p></speech>

In many centres we are currently under-subscribed in terms of taking up test slots.  In a number of centres where we still have a backlog, we are considering restoring overtime on Saturdays and that is something that will happen in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I am looking for the figures for waiting times for tests in Louth, in particular for the new test centre in Drogheda.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Naughton have any figures for the remaining number of applications for the transfer of Northern Irish licences for cars, trucks, etc. due to Brexit?  Do any issues arise in that regard?</p></speech>

I will include that detail in the documentation I will send to the committee post the meeting.</p> <p>  On the exchange of licences, it was suggested in 2019 that there were probably 70,000 to 80,000 UK or Northern Ireland licence holders resident here.  Right now, we have exchanged just more than 71,000.  The numbers are falling in terms of daily intake which would suggest we have pretty much reached peak exchange.</p></speech>

I am not a philistine, but a couple of issues arise.  I have noticed an increased number of cases where there is more than one person on the vehicle during a commute.  This is probably a question for Mr. Waide.  I frequently see an adult and a child or two adults on e-scooters.  To me, that would require the RSA to start providing the Government with some sort of advice with respect to the legality of that.</p> <p>  The second issue I wish to raise is insurance.  I know many in the cycling fraternity will not like me to mention the word "insurance", but Deputy Lowry mentioned a situation where some of these vehicles are weaving in and out of traffic.  In the event of an accident, surely a car owner or scooter owner is entitled to claim for any repairs for damage caused, whether it is a car hitting an e-scooter or an e-scooter striking a car.</p></speech>
