Otherwise we will proceed.  As this is a public meeting, the chat function on MS Teams should only be used to advise participants of any technical issues or urgent matters and not for general comments or statements.  I remind members who are participating remotely to keep their devices on mute until they are invited to speak.  When they are speaking, I ask that where possible they have their camera switched on and be mindful that we are in public session.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate in the meeting from outside the precincts will be refused. </p> <p>  This meeting is to discuss issues of child poverty.  I welcome the following: Ms Anna Shakespeare, chief executive of Pobal; Dr. Margaret Rogers, national manager with better start national early years quality development; Ms Jennifer McCarthy Flynn, head of policy at the National Women's Council; Ms Heydi Foster Breslin, CEO of An Cos&aacute;n; Ms Karen Kiernan, chairperson, and, Dr. Tricia Keilthy, member, of the National One Parent Family Alliance; Ms Danielle McKenna, project manager with Rialto Youth Project; and Ms Gillian O'Connor, team leader of Dolphin House Homework Club. </p> <p>  The order will be Ms Shakespeare, then Ms McCarthy Flynn, Ms Kiernan and finally Ms McKenna.  Anyone else who is present is welcome to answer questions.  </p> <p>  I advise the witnesses of the following in relation to parliamentary privilege.  As all the witnesses are appearing before the committee virtually, I need to point out there is uncertainty if parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if they are directed by me to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  </p> <p>  Everybody was allocated three minutes' speaking time so I ask people to bear in mind our time restrictions and keep to their time.  There will be questions and answers with members afterwards.  Each member is given five minutes' speaking time, to include questions and answers.  </p> <p>  I thank Ms Shakespeare for being with us and ask her to give her opening statement in her own time.</p></speech>

I am chief executive of Pobal, and am accompanied by my colleague Dr. Margaret Rogers, national manager, better start national early years quality development.</p> <p>  Pobal works on behalf of Government, managing funding and providing support for approximately 31 programmes in the areas of social inclusion and equality, inclusive employment and enterprise and early learning and care.  Pobal does not have a role in policymaking but we support Government in its decision-making by providing it with evidence such as good practice case studies, evaluations, demographic information and programme data that can serve to inform Departments in their policy decision-making.  </p> <p>  Pobal&rsquo;s deprivation index is Ireland&rsquo;s primary social gradient tool, used by numerous State agencies and Departments for the geographic identification of disadvantage and targeting of resources towards communities most in need.  Practical examples of its application include assisting in the development of the recently launched core funding model for early learning and care and school-age childcare, resource allocation modelling for city and county childcare committees and the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  </p> <p>  Pobal&rsquo;s role in early learning and care and school-age care includes: operational programme administration and funding of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme; the national childcare scheme, NCS; the access and inclusion model, AIM; as well as better start quality development and learning support for service providers and research support for the early years sector  </p> <p>  Pobal manages or supports a number of other programmes which help address child poverty through the provision of funding for services for children and young people around education and training and through improved employment and labour market access for families and other measures aimed at tackling social exclusion and providing health and well-being supports.  Examples of Pobal&rsquo;s role in these areas include: supporting SICAP, which includes three particular groups where child poverty might feature; administering the community services programme, CSP; and managing the allocation of funding for the Healthy Ireland programme.</p> <p>  Through targeted supports to the early years sector, the administration and management of the social inclusion and community development programmes and supports provided to community and voluntary organisations working with children, youth, marginalised and excluded groups, Pobal contributes to the achievement of Government's ambition around the alleviation of child poverty and the promotion of safe, inclusive and healthy communities across Ireland.</p><p>We are very conscious that this is one of a number of meetings the committee is convening on child poverty, and we have submitted some additional resources that may be of value to the committee as it explores this agenda.  Thank you again, Chair, for the opportunity to appear today.  We are happy to take any questions members may have that would be of assistance to the committee.</p></speech>

The National Women&rsquo;s Council was pleased to be invited to speak today and we are very pleased to share this opportunity with our member, An Cos&aacute;n.  An Cos&aacute;n's CEO, Ms Heydi Foster Breslin, is with me.  The statement we will read incorporates An Cos&aacute;n's statement also.</p> <p>  As a 190-member organisation, our members are the National Women&rsquo;s Council.  For us a child&rsquo;s poverty is the poverty of her family, her household and her community.  As other contributors will discuss, one-parent families are the most at risk of poverty in Ireland.  With 86% of those families being headed by women, child poverty is a significant gender equality issue.  As well as some of the protection and income supports that will be discussed today, it is recognised in the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 that supporting and resourcing the women&rsquo;s community development sector is a key to providing supports and services needed for socially excluded women to challenge this inequality.  An Cos&aacute;n provides an excellent exemplar and is a recognised and highly regarded model of women&rsquo;s community development and education, wrap-around support and intervention.   </p> <p>  It has been said that the true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.  Social exclusion, deprivation, a stifling lack of opportunity and exposure to the harsh effects of economic fragility can press down on even the most resilient, particularly young children as they are setting out in life from this challenging starting point.  An Cos&aacute;n has been providing a path to a better future for women and children, as all women's community development organisations do, for over 35 years.  It passionately believes in the transformative power of education to change a person&rsquo;s path.  By empowering a woman and educating her, we empower her whole family to value and appreciate the benefits of education.  For the women using An Cos&aacute;n's services, education is their hope.  It is their chance to build a sustainable and equitable future for themselves and their children.</p> <p>  For the little ones starting out in life, An Cos&aacute;n uses its expertise and resources to help them develop in those crucial first five years of their learning journey.  It uses best-in-class learning and development practice to help children make their first steps in the world from a more equitable place. </p> <p>  Community education&rsquo;s roots in Ireland can be traced back to the idea of no classes without cr&egrave;ches and the emancipation goals of the women&rsquo;s movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  At An Cos&aacute;n, they know that integrated support services for children and families are critical to addressing the intersectional nature of poverty.  Intergenerational education breaks the insidious cycle of poverty.  That is An Cos&aacute;n's aspiration for the "one generation solution", raising up women through education so that they and their families can escape poverty forever.  In just one generation they can and do break that cycle.</p> <p>  Equity of access to education is key to tackling intergenerational child poverty.  Equity means those who are furthest behind are able to access high-quality education, from the early years to lifelong learning and development.  Every woman in Ireland deserves the right to be able to access community education.  Every child in Ireland deserves a right to benefit from a start in life which includes a warm, caring environment; a high-quality curriculum delivered by well trained and well recompensed professionals; a range of qualified supports to promote child development; scaffolding to help children learn to regulate their behaviour and life stage transitions; and the development of a love of learning. </p> <p>  Equity of access to education is key to tackling intergenerational child poverty.

This is the measure of treating our most vulnerable that we can all be proud of.  It shifts the odds in their favour and delivers that one generation solution to poverty.</p> <p>  This is not an An Cos&aacute;n issue, as members all know.  It is not a Tallaght west issue.  The need for integrated services exists right across the country and across our society.  It is at its most urgent where poverty is most deeply concentrated.  In An Cos&aacute;n, early years professionals, counsellors, family support workers and educators provide courses in adult education, higher education, literacy and digital skills.  We all know that all women and children have a right to equity of opportunity in our wealthy, civilised society.  We have seen over the past four decades how, as a society, we all face the same storms.  We all face recessions, financial crises and now a pandemic.  Let us be in no doubt, however, that we are not all in the same boat.  Some of us have many advantages whatever the weather, while others are struggling to hold on even in normal times.</p></speech>

I am here to represent the ten national organisations that are the members of the National One Parent Family Alliance.  I am CEO of One Family and chair of the alliance.  I am joined by Dr. Trisha Keilthy, head of social justice and policy with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</p> <p>  Since 2016, at least nine independent reports detailing the poor living standards and inequalities experienced by one-parent families have been published.  Each of these reports paints a similar devastating picture of children growing up in the grip of poverty, deprivation and housing insecurity.  We know that the vast majority of children living in daily consistent poverty in Ireland live in one-parent families.  We know that lone parents are more likely to have lower incomes from employment, higher poverty rates, less savings and higher reliance on social welfare.  They are much more likely to be homeless or living in insecure accommodation, and to experience stigma and social isolation.  All the data and evidence show that it is structural barriers that are the problem.  It is the inappropriate policies, legislation and the cost of the living that mean that one-parent families are poorer than two-parent families.  This is not down to individual parental failings or poor choices.  It is on the State.</p> <p>  The research also tells us the solutions.  It provides policymakers with a whole series of solutions that can help move these children and families out of poverty for good.  The programme for Government includes the commitment to fully implement the 2017 report on the position of lone parents in Ireland by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It is imperative that government understands and removes the barriers, and promotes policies and laws that support children living in one-parent families to have a life free from daily poverty.</p> <p>  The recommendations we are going to focus on today are as follows.  There is a need for our social protection system to be based on evidence and to be benchmarked against the cost of a minimum essential standard of living.  We want to have the jobseeker's transition payment, JST, extended to parents until their children reach the end of secondary school in recognition of the additional caring responsibilities of lone parents and the much higher costs of raising a teenager.  We want the discrimination against babies of lone parents ended by amending the Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit Act to ensure one-parent families have the same level of support as two-parent families.  We want investment in publicly-provided early years care and education with free childcare for children in one-parent families.  This is in line with the commitments under the EU child guarantee.  We need to develop an independent system to assess and enforce child maintenance payments and to ensure they are not counted as parental income or doubly assessed by our social protection system.  Housing is crucial so we are recommending a specific task force in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to review the impact of housing insecurity on one-parent families and develop appropriate solutions, including a much-needed family homelessness plan.  To highlight the education point that has been made, we need Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants to be made available to parents who wish to study part time.</p> <p>  In order to achieve these priorities, we strongly recommend that a new national child poverty plan contain an ambitious poverty reduction target and supporting actions specifically for one-parent families.  In order to achieve that, we are recommending that an interdepartmental senior officials group be established to co-ordinate supports to ensure a successful decrease in child poverty rates so that the next generation will not have to live the way this one is unfortunately living at the moment.</p></speech>

We move to Ms McKenna and her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Danielle McKenna" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021121400002#B00700"><p>I am project manager of Rialto Youth Project.  Ireland has higher rates of child poverty than the EU average.  It is estimated that a quarter of children in Ireland are currently living in poverty.  It is such a complex and multifaceted issue but with only a short amount of time available to us, we will focus on how education and housing deeply impacts children living in poverty.</p> <p>  The OECD has stated that children and young people from working class areas have been the most impacted by the global pandemic in their educational progression.  We have a youth work team and two after-school projects in Rialto Youth Project.  From connecting with the local schools we already know that literacy levels among children and young people are not even close to the national average when young people are transitioning into secondary school.  The statistics show that less than 10% of young people from working class and marginalised communities go on to third level education even if they are in an access programme.</p> <p>  One of our core beliefs is that education is a key way out of poverty.  Often when we talk to young people about educational experiences, they describe feelings of being powerless and of being left behind.  Children are extraordinary.</p><p>They show incredible resilience and desire to connect, learn, play and develop.  However, we see children who are clouded in shame &ndash; a shame that does not belong to them or their families.  The shame rests at the feet of the State which has perpetuated structural inequality towards working-class children and their families for generations.  There are studies that have tracked children's hopes and dreams for the future.  For working-class children there is a time in their young childhood where the reality of their positioning in society becomes apparent.  This invisible bubble is understood by children, particularly those in working-class areas. From 2012-16, we did a project with Ms Fiona Whelan and BrokenTalkers called Natural History of Hope where 250 stories were collected from girls and young women growing up and working in Rialto and they talked a lot about the metaphor of class as &quot;the bubble&quot;.  One of the quotes from that is as follows:</p><blockquote>	Can you see it ...?  The bubble?  We're inside it.  You see everything and everyone through the bubble.  And everyone sees the bubble when they look at you.  They make decisions about you.  They tell you, you can't.  They tell you, you won't.  They tell you, you'll never.  They measure you with invisible rulers.  You will come to love the bubble and hate it.  What does your bubble feel like ...?  [Mine's] ... like a shell on my back.  It's heavy [but] I hope yours is ... floaty and ... easy to get out of. </blockquote><p>That is many young people from working class communities' experience of growing up in generational inequality where education attainment may have been low and where there are higher rates of families with unemployment and of one-parent families on incomes that do not match those of the living wage today.  It is not only education that is the issue, but housing that does not meet their needs.  This is a serious issue.  We already know that we are in a housing crisis but for many young people from working-class communities being priced out of the market is not the issue.  Being able to afford the rent is not the issue.  They are not even getting invited to that market.  Renting is not even an option for them.  Hidden homelessness among young people has doubled in the past five years but we believe that this number is much greater.  I could probably think of 30 young people right now who might be living with extended family.  They are not down on the floor of the people they live in with.  They are couch-surfing.  They are living in overcrowded accommodation where they pull out a mattress from under a sibling's bed at the end of the day and sleep on the floor.<br/><br/>Dolphin House is one of the largest remaining flat complexes in Dublin which is currently going through a decade of regeneration with only one of those phases being complete.  Overcrowding and damp conditions are significant issues which determine whether children might have a dining room table to have their dinner or to do their homework at.<br/><br/>We need to address the long-term impacts of children experiencing poverty, to identify children and families most at risk of persistent poverty and support their emotional, social, physical and developmental well-being.  Unless we do this, we are not only describing poor outcomes for child but talking about affecting their life chances.<br/><br/>The issue needs to be addressed also in policy and with policy solutions.  There is soon to be a formalised European Union child guarantee that states that every child in Europe needs to have access to free healthcare, free childcare, decent housing and adequate nutrition with a real focus on children from marginalised communities.  Our question is, what would that look like in Ireland and how could this be guaranteed?</p></speech>

The numerous reports talked about what can be done and how the situation can be improved and the consequences if we do not act.  Most of the witnesses before the committee have been working in this field for a while and are experienced and knowledgeable about what is happening on the ground and about these reports.  I guess what I want to hear more about is where are the roadblocks.  The witnesses are engaging with Deputies and with Departments.  Where are the roadblocks?  Where is the bureaucracy getting in their way?  We have all these reports and very little changes.  What is the stumbling block?  What is the roadblock?  Equally, what are the policies that have worked?  What are the things that we should be doing more of?  What assist - a policy or scheme - that works are we not doing enough of?</p> <p>  I am conscious as well that Ms McKenna was talking about the access programmes.  These are normally held in quite high regard but, from what Ms McKenna says, they are not helping enough the issue of an educational divide at third level.  Obviously, there is much going on right back from when a child is born and the access schemes only kick-in in the middle of secondary school.  Much damage and harm is already done by that point.</p> <p>  I guess those are my two questions.  What are the roadblocks that the witnesses have experienced and why have these reports not been implemented previously?  What are the policies that we currently have that work and we should be spending more time on?</p></speech>

This could then, at an administrative level, be potentially rolled out at a local level as well through existing local structures to try and reach the children in need around the country.</p> <p>  A big block is the silent nature of work on policies that cut across each other between Departments and agencies.  This happens all the time.  A parent might get a support in one way and it is taken off the parent in another way.  It is not co-ordinated.  The citizen, the parent or person is not at the centre of the process; it is the other way round.</p> <p>  There is a really big issue with not seeing that one-parent families are different.  They cannot achieve what two-parent families can.  They need additional supports.  It should be okay morally, ethically, socially and politically to do that.  We still have some mentality from the culture of mother and baby homes - judgment around people parenting on their own - that is very unhelpful and can block and get in the way of some of this progress.</p> <p>  Those are the things that do not work.  I do not know if Dr. Keilthy wants to say anything about what works or if I am putting her on the spot there.</p></speech>

I suppose what we have seen recently is using evidence to determine what our social welfare system should be based on.  The introduction of a higher rate of qualified child allowance for children over 12 is a very positive move from Government.  It is recognising the extra costs of raising a teenager and it is a very targeted intervention in terms of addressing child poverty.  What we would like to see is the whole system being benchmarked against the cost of a minimum essential standard of living.  At present, the gap between social welfare income for a one-parent family with two children and the cost of a minimum standard is &euro;82 every week.  That parent has to borrow, go into debt or cut back to make ends meet, but if we had a system that was adequate, that addressed poverty and that provided people with enough to meet the cost of living it would give people the basis to access opportunities, access education and employment and allow families to plan for the future.  At present, we have a system where people are barely staying afloat.  If we had a system that was properly indexed and benchmarked against this metric, we would have a much greater impact on poverty levels in this country, particularly where we have very deep levels of income inadequacy experienced by one-parent families as well.</p> <p>  In terms of what works well, I would point to experience in other countries in terms of child poverty structures.  Ireland is very good at developing policies but when it comes to implementation we can meet various roadblocks.  In New Zealand, for example, they set up a child poverty unit to coincide with their Child Poverty Reduction Act 2018.  They legislated for their targets.  They have a child poverty unit, which is based in the Prime Minister's office so that it is driving action from the top and it is ensuring that there is that interdepartmental focus.  What they did was amend their Public Finance Act to ensure that their budgets are comprehensively addressing child poverty.  This is only a recent initiative and it is yet to be seen what impact it will have.</p><p>We need to look at what other countries are doing so we can have the targets fully addressed and ensure that implementation is driven from the top but also reaches down to our local authorities.  We would also like to see local authority action plans in terms of driving that.  Those are some examples.</p></speech>

We believe in access programmes and think they are very valuable.  Unfortunately, they happen when a young person is going from secondary to third level whereas we believe they need to begin in primary school.  One of the core ways out of poverty is early intervention and prevention, so we really want to look at access programmes and young people who are already struggling in primary school.  By the time they get to the end of secondary school, the access programme is no longer beneficial.  As important as they are, access programmes do not look at the intergenerational educational inequality that is in existence for many young people.  That needs to be supported alongside community-based projects where the projects bridge the gaps and help young people in their pathways in education.  It needs to be at a community level and at an access level but also at a State support level.</p></speech>

While early years services and extra support for children are very important, we also believe there is a third intervention that is needed and we call this the one-generation solution.  We know that if we educate a mother, we empower her whole family to value and appreciate the benefits of education.  We know that if we can raise a woman up through education, her family can escape poverty forever in just one generation.</p> <p>  I will not provide the committee with the names but I will offer real cases of how young mothers have used education to transform their own lives and that of their children.  A mother and two children were living in a hotel in Tallaght.  The mother was very depressed because of her housing and financial situation and she was parenting alone.  She had one child attending school and came to An Cosan with the other child.  We provided a place in our early years services but we also looked at how we could work with that mother.  She had no leaving certificate or other formal qualification but she has now completed a degree in addiction studies and is in full-time employment in a caring profession.  She and her two children are living in a two-bedroom apartment.  Everyone&rsquo;s story is different but what is most striking is the confidence that personal development and education brings to a young mother both as a woman and as a parent.</p> <p>  There was a question on how policy could be improved to support our work.  Recruiting and retaining early years specialists is a major challenge for our providers.  Scheme capitation rates need to reflect salary levels that are appropriate for professionals with qualifications, and terms and conditions that allow for paid holidays and occupational pensions.  Stable workforces are achieved through good conditions and professional development opportunities, and the cost involved must be recognised if quality is to be continually improved.  For example, our Lifestart home visiting service supports parents who are under pressure and encourages them to play with and read to their children, developing attachment between mothers and babies.  Attachment and bonding can be a problem when mothers are under huge stress and research has shown the impact this can have on the child's future.  This service is entirely funded by private donations.  It needs to form part of core funding from the State for services such as ours which prioritise vulnerable families.  Assessments and early intervention is essential for children but the HSE services, already under serious pressure, have been greatly affected by Covid.</p></speech>

There are eight others left to speak so, unfortunately, I will have to limit speaking time.  I will come back to Ms Foster-Breslin on the next round of questions.

I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  I cannot say I enjoyed the contributions because they were sobering and hard to hear.  The first line of the submission from Rialto Youth Project suggests that Ireland has higher levels of child poverty than the EU average, which is stark.  What is the main cause of that?  Is this a warped culture of not looking after this issue, of keeping it all within the family and making sure that the family looks after it, without putting in the important structures around the family that the State should?  We have heard of the mother and baby homes and the attitudes and culture towards single parents.  Is it a cultural thing and, if so, how can we best fix that?  That is a question to the Rialto Youth Project.</p> <p>  I am not sure who mentioned the national action plan on child poverty, which also came up at a previous meeting, in particular that there is an action plan and a localised individual plan for each area.  We have action plans in urban areas but I believe rural poverty can sometimes be overlooked.  I would like to hear an opinion, from whoever mentioned that point, with regard to individualisation, localisation, the national action plan to bring that down to a local level and the best way to do that.</p></speech>

Our view is that people may be broke but it is actually the system that is broken, and that is what we need to start talking about.  We need to move it from being an issue of shame for people who do not have enough money to the system that has broken and failed families.  Families are being failed, children are being failed and we believe it is generational inequality.  It is around the social and economic marginalisation that makes poverty happen.</p> <p>  We need to look at who the communities are that are being left behind, and it is very often children and young people of families from working-class and marginalised communities.  That is where the investments need to happen.  We have seen community services being cut for more than a decade.  Since the fall of the Celtic tiger, we have watched the decimation of projects.  We have watched the decimation of after-school services and we are about to go into that again, given after-school services are going to be cut, particularly those in working class areas or marginalised communities.  What we are seeing is that the resources are being taken from the community and families are growing up in housing that does not meet their needs, in addition to the issues of access to education and healthcare.  One of the issues we also see in research is that children from marginalised communities are very often much further behind in their medical development and social development.</p> <p>  We need to look at what is really going on for the people who are being left behind and how we begin to invest in communities and in children.  We need to actually invite the people to the table.  How is it that we are engaging with people or talking to them about the needs that must be met within communities?  For us, the issue of poverty is a State issue.</p></speech>

At a previous committee meeting on this topic, Senator McGreehan referenced the revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, RAPID, and area-based initiatives.  It is about looking at what has worked.  We have had RAPID, the local development and social inclusion programmes, the Limerick regeneration framework, for example, and that implementation plan.  We currently have the Dublin north-east inner city initiative, the area-based childhood programmes and the community safety initiative of the childhood development initiative.  As to the important benefits of area-based initiatives, they all say that they work but they need to include the establishment of structures that allow the communities to participate in the decision-making process.</p><p>It is very much a bottom-up development to improve service delivery and increase State investment in areas of high deprivation.</p><p> Colleagues have referenced the gaps in alignment with national and regional policy.  We need to make sure that if there are area-based initiatives, they are coherent and speak to each other.  Clear and effective co-ordination and a shared vision and set of objectives are needed between the regional and national policy, as well as people on the ground to co-ordinate, rather than sending the money out into the system and expecting different parts of it to speak to each other.</p><p> The area-based initiatives have made important and strategic financial contributions to local development, but there is a need for a longer-term, large and co-ordinated investment across all areas of development.  There is significant evidence to support that.</p><p> In terms of what should happen, the learning is limited co-ordination of local initiatives has been one of the areas where we have faltered.  There is a need to strengthen leadership across the programmes and strengthen the whole concept and practical aspects of community engagement.  Extensive planning should form the key element of future area-based initiatives development.  There should be strategies for meaningful community engagement, because some of the reports that we have looked at have said the area becomes full of initiatives and far too busy with them and that they need to be joined up to become coherent.</p><p> There is a need to continue to invest in building an evidence base of what works and what does not work.  That can guide policy implementation on future investment by the Government.</p></speech>

A whole-of-society approach is needed to its implementation with Government, local government, community organisations and employers all working together.  These already exist.  The infrastructure is already there.  An Cos&aacute;n has 210 community partners it works with throughout the country.  Some 50% of the population does not have basic digital skills and 20% do not have literacy skills.  In areas of high poverty with a higher proportion of early school leavers, these figures are much higher.  The new national strategy needs to be resourced in order that those, such as An Cos&aacute;n, that have the expertise can provide additional literacy to those who need it.  Otherwise, they will be left further behind in the digital divide.  Women experienced the brunt of the pandemic.</p></speech>

It is worrying.  Will the witnesses from Pobal tell me more about the geographic identification of disadvantage?  How are the data collected?  Are they based on service users?  How do we know what is hidden?  It is important we realise that.  We spoke about generational inequality.  There are family barriers, some of which can be historical.  Does Ms McKenna find that families get disheartened because they are asking for help and it is very hard to get that support, when one is knocking on door after door.  Does she see that as a big issue?</p> <p>  Previous speakers spoke about the child poverty action plan.  What is the best way to start that?  We all know about housing and families who are moving from family to family, couch surfing or sharing a room, a hostel or B&amp;B.  We then have to work through our local authorities and make sure proper payments are made, which becomes an issue when one is moving around.  With regard to a child poverty action plan with all the groups together and getting everyone together, how do the witnesses see we could start to make that change?  We need to make change.</p> <p>  I spoke today about my area where I know of families that have taken children out of school, good schools, and put them into other good schools, because there is no hot meal programmes and they want their children in schools there are such programmes.  Christmas is coming and we see that it is such an important time for children and there are families that look for food parcels or hope to get a parcel.  We need to work more with families and children that need that support.  I see these issues in my area.</p> <p>  I again thank everyone.  We all have to work together and make sure we make that change.</p></speech>

There is an opportunity, as was mentioned, with the EU child guarantee.  We can politically focus on that and develop a plan.  It is unclear how much funding will be available for it, but it is not very significant.  There is a need and opportunity to have a broader, whole-of-government child poverty action plan.  That is where we are saying there is a possibility, when a national plan is in place, to look at local implementation structures.  The ones used for children at present are children and young people's services committees.  They could be very useful.</p> <p>  As part of the recommendations we made in our submission, we were saying most poor children live in one-parent families and to focus on them.  The EU child guarantee also talks about very marginalised families such as Roma, Traveller and ethnic minorities and those living in direct provision, whose children are very marginalised.  There is an opportunity to do something for some of those children by focusing on specific target groups.</p> <p>  Structural national policy barriers also need to be removed, including making work pay for lone parents; letting them get into education and keep child maintenance or making sure there is a system for that to be paid.  Many of the problems are at a national policy level and need to be resolved at that point.  We say get that bit right and then look at how things can be improved at a local level.  People need something to work with and they do not necessarily have it yet.</p></speech>

The index is commissioned by Pobal every five years, following the completion of the national census.  It is used by State agencies for the geographic identification of disadvantage and is primarily used to help target resources towards communities that are most in need.  To answer the Deputy's question, the index uses a series of data points from the census to establish levels of disadvantage under three domains: demographic, profile, social class composition and labour market situation and gives a rounded view of the lived experience of disadvantage, beyond simply measuring income and poverty.</p> <p>  The resulting index provides a deprivation score of between plus-50 and minus-50 for every small area.  We have used it, as have other parts of the State infrastructure, for example, in resource allocation modelling for the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, LEADER, the city and county childcare committees and most notably, as a key input into the DEIS identification model used by the Department of Education.  Schools' designation as DEIS, as all the attendees would know, is considered a key factor in their eligibility for the Department of Social Protection hot school meals programme.</p> <p>  In the context of the commitments contained in the First 5 programme, which is at the heart of this strategy for babies, young children and their families, we are currently providing technical expertise to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on the potential application of that index as part of the model for identifying early learning and care settings with a high concentration of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Rather than the geographic location of the early learning and care provider or centre, we would use the locations from which those babies or children come as the mechanism by which the core funding might be established around that.  I hope that is of assistance to the committee.</p></speech>

Our experience is that it can be challenging for families to access help.  Within communities where there is multi-generational education inequality and poverty, and with that there is a very real experience of isolation and shame that further marginalises families and makes it really difficult to access services.  We believe in community-based services and projects like our own because we are based in the community.  We have established long-term relationships with the community.  We have a solidarity approach so work alongside children and their families in that community development piece.  We really look at how we can challenge those inequalities with families.  I think that people and communities do feel that the Government has failed to act.</p> <p>  In terms of tackling poverty, there are very real and tangible issues around housing, health, fuel and food poverty, and the longer-term issues concerning education.  I am based at my organisation's homework club in Dolphin House and an important part of our service is to provide hot meals.  Such provision assists children to develop socially and we meet a real need.  For us it is about those long-term sustainable supports for community-based organisations like ourselves that are needed to tackle poverty.  The effects of income poverty are linked to health inequality - children experience more ill health - and there is housing and labour market disadvantage.  We see that children in poverty experience multiple and cumulative disadvantages that are inexplicably linked to all of these things.  Parents who have access to resources can support their children in things like school readiness, which are really important for their long educational journey.</p></speech>

The Sutton Trust is a UK charity.  It has released a report that shows 57% of people in primary and secondary schools and 30% of middle-class people participated in daily online lessons but only 16% of pupils from working class families participated.  That shows we need to continue to invest in a community-led recovery from the consequences of the pandemic that have been experienced by vulnerable children and families.  There are very fragile families in difficult circumstances and they need our national Government to ensure there are responses on the ground.  Many of my colleagues have mentioned that the way to do this already exists through community organisations.  They are poised and we are poised to act if properly resourced to do so.  The Government must invest in social and community providers so they can offer realtime responsive supports to help children and communities recover otherwise Covid will be another wedge that separates the haves from the have nots and the gap in life chances will grow among children of different backgrounds from their earliest years.  We already have what it takes and work well together so we just need to be properly funded.</p></speech>

Ms Foster-Breslin, I think, mentioned the New Zealand model where the national child poverty action plan was taken on by the Prime Minister where it was centrally assigned.  In previous hearings, on the same topic, we have heard about the model that was used by the new Labour Government in Britain where there was a centralised child poverty unit run from Whitehall by the Department of the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair.  Some witnesses, including Ms Kiernan, talked about the need for strong leadership at the centre of government in order to implement a national child poverty action plan and I ask the witnesses to elaborate.  Is that the best way?  Does an action plan require a centralised joined-up approach that is led from the top in order for us to deliver at a local level?  </p> <p>  Similarly, we have heard in previous sessions about the importance of investing and how a public universal child care system is key to targeting and eliminating child poverty.  I ask the witnesses to offer a view on how best to roll out an early years education and care programme that targets child poverty.   </p></speech>

I will address the second part of her question and perhaps colleagues will respond to the earlier parts.</p> <p>  In terms of a co-ordinated central unit and leadership, I agree that is extremely important because we have seen, as mentioned earlier, how there can be an awful lot of really good projects done at a local level, of which the ABC programmes and others are examples.  Consistent delivery and integration into the mainstream, as far as possible, of progressive universal services so that children and families who avail of those services do not themselves feel stigmatised by the process, and the process of progressive universalism, as implemented through the AIM project, demonstrates how that can happen.</p> <p>  To answer the second part of the Deputy's question on a universal child care system, this country has the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme.  It is a fully publicly-funded universal programme that caters for children aged three to five years.  ECCE is on a par with any of the models that operate in other European countries that we might look to as models of provision in other circumstances.  Where we are lacking is in extending the programme to both younger and older children.  The core funding model, which was published in the past two weeks, alongside the workforce development plan indicates a direction of travel.  It has put a strong statement by Government on the table in terms of the intention to move to a much more publicly-funded and publicly-managed system.  We look forward with great anticipation to seeing that begin to be implemented.</p> <p>  Our sense, again under the EU guarantee, is that every child should have a right to access equal quality, and the availability of early learning and care to meet their needs from a child-centred perspective rather than exclusively from the perspective of a labour market intervention.  The balance needs to be struck in terms of what is in the best interest of children, what will benefit them in their educational journey starting from birth, and how that will be consistently supported and have consistent quality.</p> <p>  The workforce development plan is very welcome.  It is an extension of incentivised qualifications to work with the youngest children.</p><p>These are children from birth to three years who are in day care settings.  I suppose we can see the beginnings where we are moving towards that process and, I hope, the notion of working in partnership for the public good.  It is about building the infrastructure and competent system that will enable us to move to a fully funded public system over time.</p></speech>

From our engagement with some people working in New Zealand, we know it has seen first the establishment of the child poverty unit in the Prime Minister's office, and the Prime Minister is also responsible for child poverty reduction.  That has really driven the agenda of reducing child poverty from the top down.  The most effective change brought through in that country's child poverty Act was the amendments made to the public finance legislation, meaning there must be a co-ordinated approach for well-being and child poverty.</p> <p>  Even with the best plans that we have, we know the process can be quite siloed because the budget process is quite siloed.  When it comes to decisions around policy changes and budgetary decisions that affect children's lives, we can have one Department providing a support that may be taken away by a decision taken in another Department.  For example, if there is an increase in the minimum wage or in social welfare payments and there is no corresponding increase in thresholds for childcare subsidies, the benefit of that would be lost in some cases.  It is really about considering the thread and interdepartmental connections between policy and budgetary decisions and making sure they are maximised to give the best poverty reduction impact.  That would be really effective.</p> <p>  In the context of a national co-ordinated plan, we would love to see a specific target for one-parent families because levels are so high.  It has been a quite intractable matter for many years through boom and bust, when lone parents have experienced some of the highest rates of poverty.  That is continuing, along with people with disabilities.  We need to ensure there are very strong and targeted supports and interdepartmental work in that respect.</p> <p>  On childcare, the National One Parent Family Alliance strongly supports the public provision of childcare.  Looking at countries with the highest rates of employment among lone parents and the lowest rates of child poverty, these are countries with very high publicly provided subsidised childcare.  From our perspective, it is not only about moving to the public provision of childcare and ensuring that it is adequately funded in order to have quality childcare for children and affordable childcare for parents.  There must be good pay and conditions for workers as well because many lone parents work in the sector as well.  We must ensure that is part of the whole mix.  We see the new report that has been published and we hope there is action in that regard.  Free childcare should be provided for lone parents under the child guarantee as well.</p></speech>

I come from a family of early school leavers, and this was not by choice but more because of need.  I am showing my age but even getting to do the intermediate certificate was an achievement for someone in my family in getting that far.  That is not to say anything about my parents, who did their best.  They were early school leavers and I was an early school leaver as well.</p> <p>  I will also mention An Cos&aacute;n.  I went back to education in my late 20s, getting to third level and finishing my degree in An Cos&aacute;n.  I am eternally grateful to An Cos&aacute;n for giving me that opportunity.  The learning experience there was really welcome.  We used to meditate before class and it was a really relaxed atmosphere.  As somebody who was at the time very wary about the education system because of my experience going through it as a child, it was a really welcome experience.  It allowed me to be me in that classroom.</p> <p>  There has been mention of empowering women and the whole family through education.  As a father, I am thankful I was able to break through that cycle of poverty I was in.  Without education, I have no doubt that I would not be sitting here having this conversation with the witnesses.  I do not usually talk about myself this much but one of the members of the National One Parent Family Alliance is the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  It allowed me to access its bursary in order to pay for my educational journey and without that there was no possible way for me to finish that education.  It also contributed to my food bills on a weekly basis.  Without that, I would not have got through the journey either.  I have much gr&aacute; for both of those organisations.</p> <p>  There was mention of an ambitious poverty reduction target but I want to tease that out.  What would that look like and how can we as a committee assist in realising that target?  A tangible matter that should be simple to resolve is the expansion of the SUSI grant to single people and part-time courses.  Are there barriers in this regard or how can we help with that as well?</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Ward for his kind words about the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The Deputy asked what the target would look like.  Currently, we do not have a child poverty target.  The previous one ended in 2020.  The data are not published but it looks like we will not make that and we could be quite far off.  It was to reduce the number of children living in consistent poverty to 37,000 or fewer by 2020.</p> <p>  All of us here would agree that a new target should effectively be zero.  We do not want any child to grow up in poverty.  A target in and off itself will not do this and we need resources behind the target.  We need political will and accountability mechanisms in order to ensure a child poverty strategy or plan can be implemented properly.  The National One Parent Family Alliance wants a headline child poverty target for all children but also a sub-target for lone parents, given there are such high rates of poverty in one-parent families.  There should be very targeted actions directed towards families and children who are parenting alone.  It is really important from our perspective as we have never had a sub-target specifically for lone parents.  As Ms Kiernan mentioned, the EU child guarantee provides that framework because particularly at-risk and vulnerable children are named in that guarantee.  That would also include children of ethnic minorities, those in care and homeless children as well.  We must ensure we are naming, measuring and targeting those children while providing support to them as well.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the SUSI grant and one of the most effective actions would be to support more lone parents into further and higher education.  If somebody is trying to balance caring responsibilities with work and study, it may be impossible.  Opening that to part-time study is something we see as potentially really effective.  We know the SUSI scheme is being reviewed by the Minister with responsibility for further education and we have written to him about that request.  We are hopeful that when the review is completed, it will be one of the recommendations.  It would require legislative change and budgetary considerations but would be one of the best investments the Government could make.</p></speech>

Our parents do not have the resources that exist in some communities so they cannot contribute the fees that can be charged elsewhere.  This lack of resources at home also means that little ones should get more support when they are with us if they are to have outcomes that are comparable with their peers in much wealthier neighbourhoods and families, such as in Dublin 4 and Dublin 6.  There are additional supports for disadvantaged primary and secondary schools.  The Minister said he plans to allocate additional funding for disadvantaged early learning and childcare providers.  This is urgently needed.</p> <p>  In An Cos&aacute;n we try to generate money to employ family support workers and counsellors to help with parenting, provide educational materials and food, money advice, mentoring, job coaching or support with addiction.  We try to work on an inter-agency basis, helping our families to access supports.  In turn, we take referrals from Tusla, the HSE and others of children and families with extra needs.  We are committed to addressing the needs of the furthest behind first, but we need extra resources to do so effectively.  This must be recognised in how funding is allocated.  In addition, there is a ten-year Government strategy to improve the lives of children and their families from birth onwards.  As I mentioned earlier, while the early years and extra supports for children are very important, we also believe a third intervention is needed.  We call this the one-generation solution.  We know that this works.  We must continue to educate women and mothers so we can empower their families.  In that way the entire family begins to value and appreciate the benefits of education.  We know that if we can raise a woman through education, her family can escape poverty forever.  I was delighted to hear that Deputy Ward benefited directly from the education services that An Cos&aacute;n provides and to see how amazingly he is doing.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the support we get from Pobal.  It supports us and that is how we manage to do a lot of the work we do.</p></speech>

I support the expansion of SUSI.  To expand that to part-time study would seem to be a straightforward and practical thing to do.  A potential way to start with that could be within certain cohorts of applicants.  One model that has been used successfully in early years over a number of years, and my colleagues here will be familiar with it, is the qualification route, because regulation required that people be qualified.  Learner funds have been used over a number of years, and within the workforce development plan there is a plan now to have part-time degree programmes that would be provided free of charge to existing staff.  As was mentioned earlier, the staff working in early years are primarily women and are largely in low pay.  This is an initiative to promote their career development, to improve the quality of early learning in care and to give them access to degree-level programmes to complete or enhance their qualifications.  That is a model that could be transferred and replicated in other sectors and areas, if that initiative were taken by the Government in different areas.</p> <p>  The other fundamental request we would make with regard to funding for early learning and care is that we would reach the OECD recommended targets within the first five or certainly within the next ten years.  We are probably somewhere between a third and 50% towards the full target, which is 7% of GDP.  Countries that have excellent models of childcare would be well over 1% and up to 1.5% in some cases.  However, we are not even at the halfway point to a good average, so that is certainly an area that needs considerable support across government to implement that.  Alongside that there is the notion of multi-annual funding security so that the people coming into early learning and care and parents have security about the quality of care that is offered to children.</p></speech>

I did not anticipate how anxious this conversation would make me today, but it has.  It is clear we know all the solutions and we know what helps and what does not.  We know about increased child benefit, social housing, the resourcing of services and multi-annual funding, but there is something lacking in how we engage with the systems.  It is like we have created this idea that opportunity exists or if we create more opportunities we just need people to avail of them.  However, that is not accurate.  It is a myth if we do not begin to address the actual inequality in people's environments and their ability to engage with or recognise an opportunity even if the funding systems are available.</p> <p>  I believe all these solutions and these policy areas are existing in something invisible, the bubble we are not talking about, which is a State and policy agenda that is primarily neoliberal.  That is infecting policy relating to childcare and housing.  How can we address this if we do not talk about some of the larger, top-down issues, instead of forcing people to feel the shame of poverty and to discuss in their communities how they solve their poverty that they did not even help to create in the first place?  It existed before they were born.  How can we start having real conversations about how we invest rapidly and aggressively in communities, pay people to go to education and pay people well in their employment and start talking about progressive tax systems so we can end child poverty and support women?  My question is for Ms McKenna and perhaps Ms Kiernan or Dr. Keilthy.  Are we failing to have those larger conversations about systems and the structural inequality that exists?  If we do not start looking at that, we will only be moving from each of those policy points and trying to fix them.  Is there something larger we should be doing so we are not only lifting the luckiest people or the ones who can recognise the opportunity but whereby we can transcend whole communities beyond poverty, not just lucky women, lucky families, those who could engage and those who might have had a little support?  Does anybody have thoughts on how we can take whole communities out, not just create opportunities for some of the luckiest within those communities?</p></speech>

As I am sitting here and listening, I am thinking there is a class-based inequality here that is often skirted around or that we are uncomfortable discussing.  In Ireland, people are particularly hesitant in some ways to identify that.  We always purposely use the language around that because we understand and see all the time that this class-based inequality exists.  In the multigenerational project we did, it was local people who were saying that a bubble exists and that they know they are in it, that it makes a difference and makes their experiences more challenging.</p> <p>  There is also the gender-based focus.  It was said earlier that the parent in 86% of one-parent families is female.  We cannot ignore that issue either.  Where have women been left in this?  They are trying to support and raise their families essentially alone in many ways.  Looking at children in working-class communities, and people talk about the zero-to-three age group as extremely important as education starts from birth, but research shows that children who are in persistent poverty by the time they are three years old are already nine months behind other children in terms of their school readiness.  At three years there is already that barrier.  Where does that leave children and their families?  Children might manage in early primary education but it has been shown that those in persistent poverty are already experiencing marginalisation and feeling alienation.  That is the reality for children.  We see them coming in here all the time.</p><p>They already know that the struggles that they have and the life that they have is different from children from other areas.  By the time they are in late primary school, those challenges are compounded even more.  The transition from primary to secondary school is a pivotal time in children's lives and for their family and adolescence.  It is a really difficult time to navigate anyway.  The gap around those education inequalities just widens even more, and early school-leaving compounds those issues.  In terms of looking at the educational aspect, those children are on a path where the road to higher education or the labour market is already compromised or foregone for many of them within communities where there is a risk of other issues that children are always having to navigate and figure out.  </p><p> For us, in terms of after-school projects, we have faced a recent challenge around the universal funding that is available for community-based after-school projects.  From our point of view, we are not a childcare service.  We see ourselves as doing really important community development work that happens with children around their educational, social and physical development in all those sorts of ways.  Members of the Dublin 8 After School Alliance presented to the committee in October on the challenges that are facing us.  The universal funding that is there now is going to mean that within the next year to 18 months, community-based after-school projects are going to have to close their doors.  In Dublin 8 alone, that will mean that up to 500 children will not have access to that community-based support that provides hot meals and a space that they can come to and develop their education, social, recreational skills and all those really important things in children's and young people's lives.  </p><p> I absolutely agree with the Senator.  We know the things that can change in terms of poverty and that, but who is willing, at State level, to take that step and take those risks and say "enough is enough"?  How are we really going to impact on very real issues facing children and young people in working-class areas?</p></speech>

It is really interesting, because we know that what we do in Ireland is incremental change.  We do pilots.  There are some things we do a lot of.  What the Senator is talking about is a much more system-wide radical change.  Perhaps I am naive, but I would hope that if we did put an interdepartmental, cross-government national child poverty action plan in place with an implementation plan and a political resource and a funded resource to run it and drive it, we might start on that road.  The Senator is right.  The outliers and those inspirational people who make it are great, but they are not everybody.  I know that we are talking a lot about working-class communities and I completely agree with what is being said.  We are not embedded in one; we are a national organisation.  The communities we see are one-parent families and they are everywhere.  The parents are sometimes from middle-class backgrounds and their income drops.  They have the same problems as perhaps people from poorer backgrounds.  They did not expect to end up where they have ended up.  They may have different resources and resilience.  When you are parenting on your own or you are a sharing parent in a relationship and your relationship ends, everything is upended.  You need more money and you may need to be able to have two homes for children to live in.  As we know, many people are ending up homeless.  One-parent families are still seen as anomalies.  Getting separated or divorced are still seen as an anomaly.  We can see that in the social welfare code and legislation.  We can see it everywhere.  It is codified.  For some reason, in Ireland we have not yet absorbed the fact that a huge number of children are born to unmarried parents, partnered or otherwise, and a huge number of children - one in four - live in a one-parent family.  Many children live in step and blended families.  We have got to cope with this family diversity.  We must understand it and support it.  We do not yet do that.  We are still boxing everyone in.  The siloed approach that we mentioned earlier from Departments and at the political level is lethal.  That is what is causing some of the problems here.  DEIS was mentioned earlier.  Some 50% of poor children in this country do not go to DEIS schools.  They are not getting the support that they need in schools, and yet DEIS is there as the programme.  We are leaving so many children behind.  That is why targeting is so important here.</p></speech>

We know that close to 100,000 children in Ireland are in consistent poverty, with another 200,000 at risk.  We know that this year, organisations such as Depaul have seen really worrying increases in calls for help.  The submissions and experiences of the witnesses are essential in helping the committee to understand and advocate for change.  Regarding what Senator Ruane said, I do not think we can really have a discussion about reaching equality, whether it is gender equality or equality for children in one-parent families, without having a conversation about childcare in this country.</p> <p>  My first question is for the representatives of the National One Parent Family Alliance.  It has called for investment in public early years care and education, with free childcare for children in one-parent families.  Currently, the States spends 0.3% of GDP on early years, which is far below the European average of 0.8% and the UNICEF recommended benchmark of 1%.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate, for everybody watching and for the committee, on the importance of a publically-funded model of childcare for one-parent families.  </p> <p>  There are similar issues with the social protection system.  The practice of social welfare rates being solely dependent on the decision of a Government at each budget that we see every year is not only ignorant of the reality of life for so many thousands of people in Ireland, but it is also very paternalistic.  The National One Parent Family Alliance has highlighted the importance of a social protection system that is based on evidence and is benchmarked against the MESL.  I ask the representatives of the alliance to expand on that.  If there is time, I also have a question for the representatives of Rialto Youth Project, but I will leave it at that for now in case there is not time.</p></speech>

It highlights both the barriers faced by young people in marginalised communities, but also people's capacity to thrive when supported properly.  I want to ask about the kind of practical support that the project offers.  Homework clubs help young people develop learning skills and also often provide a space to do homework, a luxury many people do not have at home.  I ask the representatives to discuss the impact of those kind of projects and how the State could support them.  The arts-based education programmes also feature prominently in the work of the Rialto Youth Project to explore and address issues that affect younger people.  I ask the witnesses to talk about and give examples of arts-based projects and the impact they have had on the people they are working with.</p></speech>

First, with regard to the social protection system and how we can ensure that it is based on evidence, the National One Parent Family Alliance is advocating for it to be benchmarked against the MESL.  We know this is what is required to meet a decent standard of living in society, one that allows people to live with dignity and to meet their cost of living.  It is based on the research from the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  It is focus group, consensus-based research, which estimates the cost of the basket of goods needed in Ireland to both meet basic needs and participate in society.  We see this as the most effective way to ensure that our social protection system addresses poverty and ensures a life with dignity.  From our point of view, the current gap between core social welfare rates for a lone parent with two children and the cost of the MESL is &euro;82 per week.</p><p>To bridge that gap, we would need to see that progressively realised over a number of budgets.  Ideally, this would be set out in advance such that people could plan.  They would be able to live with certainty then, knowing, if they are on a fixed income, what their income will be for the following year and knowing they are able to meet the cost of living, which is at crisis point at the moment for many families, particularly those parenting alone who are trying to meet all the various pressure points on family budgets, particularly at Christmas time and winter, when energy prices are so high.  It is about ensuring that the system is effective, allows people to meet their costs and addresses poverty.</p><p> The National One Parent Family Alliance supports the public provision of childcare.  We also support the provisions under the EU child guarantee that will ensure free access to childcare for children in one-parent families.  We know from evidence from across the world, particularly in Nordic countries, that the provision of publicly funded, subsidised childcare is one of the most effective ways of making work pay for lone parents and ensuring that it is of high quality in order that children get the best start in life</p><p> We welcome the expert group's report and hope this can be acted on such that we ensure we invest significantly in our childcare system in order that parents can access employment and education and that families can move out of poverty for good.</p></speech>

We are based here in Rialto.  We work with more than 300 young people from ages five to 25, as we said.  Investment to us looks like everything from investment in the practice, the work and the strategies to investment in where we work.  Right now I am sitting here in the middle of a Portakabin that is about to fall down around us.  It was built in 2008 and we were told it was part of a five-year plan.  We have not been part of the conversation on regeneration.  When we spoke to the State about facilities and the need for community facilities in our base at the heart of this community, we were asked whether we could go somewhere else, work in a local school or find a temporary building.  We said no and that we needed to be in the heart of the community.</p> <p>  Ms O'Connor spoke about relationship building with communities.  Workers have been here through decades of work.  There are people who live in the community, who have grown up with the project and who now work here in the project.  The majority of people who work in Rialto are from the area or from areas like Rialto so they really understand the needs of the community.  We are sitting here in a Portakabin with a leaking roof, with lights that often do not work and with very little access for more than 100 children every day.  Those are the kinds of resources we need.  Resources should be put into the building, the safe spaces, the space where children come to sit and do homework every day, their youth space, where they do their crisis work, their one-to-one support with their youth worker, their developmental processes and, as was mentioned, the arts processes, which is one of the fundamental pieces we really believe in here in Rialto.  We believe that critical social education is a real way of radical change.  It is not just about giving young people the space where they can explore arts for play, which we believe in; experience and vocation are also really important, as is a platform to have their voices and stories heard.</p> <p>  The bigger question for us is who is listening.  We often work with local artists in collaboration and look at the platforms by which we can support young people and communities.  There is an intergenerational issue and an inequality that we work with.  We often work not only with young people on these projects but with an entire community.  It is about putting it out there into the public domain.  Who is listening to the voices of young people?  All these policies and strategies are great, but how many young people and families from working-class areas are at the table making the policies?  Many of them are involved in the strategies that support their lives and the lives they need to live to thrive.  That force is very often what art brings.  At the moment one of the projects we are doing in conjunction with Fiona Whelan and BrokenTalkers is called What Does He Need?  It is about looking at intergenerational masculinity through a lens of working-class communities and that idea of how young men are shaped by but also influence the world they live in, taking a needs-based approach to look at that under a critical social arts-based practice lens.  We really believe in the work we do here.  We believe in the investment in this work and community and community projects.  That is where we think resources need to go.</p></speech>

It is crucial that we take time to discuss the issues of child poverty and how we respond to it as a country.  Every child should have the best start in life.  It is not acceptable to me or, I am sure, any other member of the committee that children continue to live in poverty in Ireland.  As a Deputy, I have countless constituents in Mayo who are suffering because of a lack of a proper income and because, increasingly, children do not have access to the basic services, be they special needs or health services.  We all strive to see the provision of the necessary and available resources to support the target of eliminating child poverty.</p> <p>  My first question is to each of the representative groups.  What are their top three resources needed to bring about the biggest change in addressing or eliminating child poverty?</p></speech>

Ireland is currently at 0.3% and we need to head up to 1%.  From a cross-government perspective, it is a question of where the money gets spent and whether it gets invested in early learning and care, building that entire competent system so every child has - "standardised" is probably the wrong word - but a similar positive experience of interacting with early learning and care, the same opportunities for development and the same interaction with quality service provision provided by staff who are well educated and understand and know what that looks like.  The evidence is overwhelming that that works and that those children then become the future of that country.</p> <p>  Dr. Rogers works with early learning and care providers directly in the context of supporting them to implement national curriculums in order that the child's experience of early learning and care, whether they are in Mayo or Dublin, is consistent.  That needs to be funded and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is on that journey in the context of the recent publications on the core funding model, the expert group and the full implementation of the First 5 policy as a really good starting place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.77" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Margaret Rogers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021121400002#K00900"><p>I will follow on from that.  Again, looking to the EU child guarantee, there are very clear areas for investment that need to be looked at there.  Early childhood care and education is one.  Education and school-based activities or out-of-school activities and recreational and social activities for children are another, including at least access to one healthy meal every day and access to fundamental primary healthcare for all children.  We know from the research that underpins the child guarantee that more than double the number of children with disabilities or special educational needs leave school early relative to their able-bodied peers in school.  In that area we have demonstrated through the access and inclusion model over the past five years that children with disabilities, even those with quite complex health needs, can participate in mainstream services with their peers in their own community.  It is that kind of model, as I mentioned earlier, of progressive universalism, where the services are available locally to the children within their peer networks, progressing to meet their individual needs, individually assessed.  Those are the things: education, health and childcare, from the point of view of children's development to enable parents to work and stable, secure, adequate housing.</p><p>As Senator Ruane said earlier, what is required is the co-ordinated political will to put those things together in a concentrated way.  The national development plan offers a similar opportunity, alongside the EU guarantee, to ensure that some of the fundamentals are put in place for children and families in Ireland.</p></speech>

The public health nurses have been taken away from working with children to undertake Covid-related tasks during the pandemic.  Even in normal times, these nurses were covering everything, including care of older people.  Specialised nurses should be visiting babies and families.  A huge backlog exists of children who have not been seen for their development checks.  This can have a major impact on the stress levels of parents.  Investing early in children, including the provision of more funding for home visiting and early years services, has a great impact, as does funding for preventative and intervention services for children and families.</p> <p>  I do not recall which of my colleagues mentioned the demonstration project rolled out to early years services and primary schools.  Speech and language and occupational therapies were allocated for services and work with staff and children to support areas of children's development.  The project was successful and demonstrated the benefits of early intervention.  It must be rolled out nationally in communities with high levels of child poverty.  We also need core funding.  As not-for-profit, grassroots organisations, we are at the heart of these communities.  We are ready on the ground and must be funded properly because our early years staff need to be properly trained and funded.</p></speech>

There are high-level issues that we know are challenging in respect of child poverty, and then there are specific things that we are thinking about that perhaps apply to one-parent families.  One of the important aspects is the need to target.  We may need quick wins along the way as we try to achieve more systematic change and become a country that does not tolerate child poverty from the top down.  In that respect, there is a need to target those families and children who need interventions.  We are talking in this context about one-parent families, families where a child or parent has a disability and minority ethnic families.  We must get the processes and systems right to be able to achieve that goal but we really need childcare services.  We need high-quality, funded, publicly-available childcare as the bedrock of change.  We also need families to have roofs over their heads.  Those are the current failings in the system that we must try to address.</p> <p>  There are also specific issues in the context of social protection, involving making work pay and enabling people to get into education, training and employment.  To be honest, those issues represent the possibility of quicker wins, if there was the will to do them.</p> <p>  I am sorry for not answering the question clearly.  It is a great one, if we can figure these aspects out.  One of the things we could do, for example, is implement the recommendations of the 2017 report of the Joint Committee on Social Protection concerning the position of lone parents, which is mentioned in the programme for Government.  Much of what we want is contained in that report.</p></speech>

We need that reinvestment in community-based projects.  Honest accountability is also important for us.  We talk a lot about the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures policy, which finished in 2020.  What did that achieve?  Is there accountability?  Who is being held accountable?  Is the State ready for an honest conversation about what is happening to children in poverty, particularly those in working class communities experiencing marginalisation?  Is the State ready to talk about the perpetuation of inequality and neoliberalism in that context, as Senator Ruane mentioned?  That is what we need to do first.  It is not about the resources, but about the conversations that must happen.</p> <p> Policy implementation is another important issue for us.  We brought about the EU child guarantee, which refers a great deal to free access for children, particularly for those most at risk, to services in areas such as healthcare, childcare, education, nutrition and well-being.  What does policy implementation and ongoing review look like in that context?</p></speech>

As many people will be aware, an independent child maintenance review group has been sitting for the last 18 months or so.  It is due to report to the Minister in early 2022.  This is a critical plank for reducing and eliminating child poverty in one-parent families.  It is important that the recommendations are focused on reducing child poverty, as well as reducing conflict in families.  We look forward to seeing what may be recommended.  Hopefully, communities such as this one may get to review and respond to that report.  It is of great importance, however, because the way child maintenance is treated by the State means that many families are less well off when they are receiving, or supposed to be receiving, child maintenance payments.  That is untenable for families at this stage.</p></speech>

It is certainly the case for people, and especially lone parents, that it can be more challenging to live in rural areas.  Primarily, that is because of a lack of public transport, but energy poverty is also a greater risk for people living in rural areas who may rely on solid fuel or oil-based heating as well.  In respect of addressing poverty, therefore, we must examine the difference between urban and rural areas and ensure there is investment in energy efficiency measures and public transport.  Equally, we must also ensure that lone parents, specifically, can access opportunities such as training and education and decent employment where they are living and that regional development plans are put in place.  That is important for accessing employment and ensuring children and families can move out of poverty.</p></speech>

That should be used as the foundation to inform policy.  As was mentioned, we know that as many children again are not living in DEIS areas as are in DEIS schools.  It underpins the need for universal and accessible services for children at all stages in their health, education and housing.</p><p> I will again state that the upcoming national development plan provides the State with an enormous opportunity to move and progress towards a more publicly funded and managed early learning and care system based on planned areas of need, where we know there are gaps and capacity issues and, potentially, that private enterprise is not really interested in developing those areas.  The opportunity to develop models of publicly funded and managed early learning and care settings, with qualified staff, that will meet the needs of children comprehensively and yield the benefits that we know investment in early learning and care can provide is immediately available to the State.  It is worthy of consideration by this committee.</p></speech>

The use of tools such as the deprivation index, for example, across government in the context of its funding and programmes is a real opportunity for it to engage in a much more targeted approach to combating disadvantage and poverty.  One recent example is that of a Department we had never worked with before, namely, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  We worked with it around the allocation of its community climate action programme funding and built in deprivation scores into how that funding was allocated for the development of communities.  It is about building the thinking across government that resources are used in a way that targets disadvantage.  That would certainly be our experience and is our recommendation to the committee.</p></speech>

We work with 210 community partners throughout Ireland.  There are differences, but good practice in child development can be applied in different localities as long as it is done with local community participation so that it is tailored to local needs.  Funding needs to be structured on a multi-annual basis in order that medium- to long-term prevention and intervention planning can be properly deployed.</p></speech>

The shame that these children and their families experience does not belong to them.  We know that children living in poverty experience multiple and cumulative inequalities linked to their health, housing, education and well-being and that this follows them throughout their lives.  Parents with more resources are able to give their children a better preparation for life.  We know that class-based inequalities, whether urban or rural, exist.  Is the State ready to respond to the structural inequalities that are perpetuated through generations?<br/><br/>I will finish on the bubble we spoke about from the arts and theatre piece we did:</p> <blockquote> 	They make decisions about you.  They tell you, you can&rsquo;t.  They tell you, you won&rsquo;t.  They tell you, you&rsquo;ll never.  They measure you with invisible rulers. ... My bubble feels like a shell on my back.  It&rsquo;s heavy.  I hope yours is light and floaty and beautiful.  And I hope it&rsquo;s easy to get out of. </blockquote></speech>

I apologise for the lack of in-person engagement but, as members know, it is in accordance with current Covid-19 restrictions.  I have received a note from Deputy Leddin to the effect that he will join us after 3.30 p.m. or 3.45 p.m.</p> <p>  I am very pleased that we are having this session with the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Eamon Gilmore, the EU Special Representative for Human Rights and EU special envoy for the peace process in Colombia, before the end of the year.  I welcome him on behalf of the committee, albeit in a virtual format.  He is no stranger to this committee.  The object of today's exercise is to discuss the matter of Mr. Gilmore's work as EU special representative and special envoy in the areas mentioned.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that we will hear Mr. Gilmore's opening statement followed by a discussion, with questions and answers from members of the committee.  I again ask them to be concise in their questions to allow all members an opportunity to participate.  Hopefully, we will have a second round, should it be so desired.</p> <p>  I remind witnesses - not that there is any need to remind the former T&aacute;naiste - of the long-standing parliamentary practice that we should not criticise, or make charges against, any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as in any way damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, any potentially defamatory statements will attract a direction to discontinue.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege that, again, will be well known to a former long-standing Member of the House.</p> <p>  I remind members of the parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make that person in any way identifiable.  I also remind members that due to Covid restrictions, they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located within the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Gilmore for joining us and invite him to make his opening statement.  We are all very grateful that he has taken time out to engage with the committee.</p></speech>

It is a great privilege to join this meeting to discuss with members the two mandates that I carry out on behalf of the European Union.</p> <p>  In February 2019, the Council appointed me European Union Special Representative, EUSR, for Human Rights.  That mandate was renewed earlier this year until March 2023.  Since October 2015, I have been the European Union&rsquo;s special envoy for the peace process in Colombia, a position to which I was appointed by the then High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini.  The current High Representative and Vice-President, Josep Borrell, has reappointed me to that role to run in conjunction with my terms as EUSR for Human Rights.  The two roles are highly compatible.</p> <p>  Following my appointment in 2015, I had the privilege to attend regularly in Havana during the final stages of the negotiation of the historic peace agreement between the Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC.  I again attended in Havana in late 2016 for the renegotiation of the peace agreement following its defeat in a plebiscite.  Since then, I have been accompanying the implementation of the agreement, initially through the last 18 months of the Government of President Santos and then the full term of President Duque's administration.</p> <p>  Three weeks ago, between 22 and 26 November, I was in Colombia to participate in events marking the fifth anniversary of the peace agreement.  These were attended for two days by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres.  I accompanied President Duque and the Secretary General on field visits and spoke on behalf of the EU.  That week, and the presence of Secretary General Guterres, marked a significant milestone in the Colombian peace process, which urged all parties to acknowledge what has been achieved and to recommit to the full implementation of the agreement.</p> <p>  The Colombian peace agreement brought to an end the longest and bloodiest conflict in the Americas in the 20th and 21st centuries.</p><p>The conflict lasted for 53 years.  Some 250,000 Colombians lost their lives, 6 million were driven from their homes, up to 100,000 are still missing and there are more than 10 million victims.  The FARC has disarmed and formed a political party called Comunes.  A total of 90% of its members are still in the process of reincorporation or reintegration, for which the EU has provided considerable financial support.<br/><br/>An innovative victim-centred system of transitional justice has been established, including a truth commission, a missing persons agency and a tribunal known as the JEP.  The JEP, although subject to criticism and attack in its early years, is now firmly established and is proceeding to hear cases against both former guerrillas and state actors.  It recently found the collective leadership of FARC to be guilty of crimes against humanity, a finding that has been accepted by most of the FARC leaders concerned.<br/><br/>The JEP was recently strengthened by the agreement reached between the Colombian Government and the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, which provides for the continued existence and work of the JEP.  It was also significant that the fifth anniversary event convened by the JEP was the first occasion at which President Duque, the former President Santos and the Comunes leader, Rodrigo Londo&ntilde;o, all met in the same place.<br/><br/>Other aspects of the agreement that have been progressing include the bottom-up process of integrated rural development known as the PDETs, which is also supported by the EU, and the recent decision to proceed next year with the election of 16 additional members of congress from the areas and populations that were worst affected by the conflict.<br/><br/>As we know from our experience on this island, however, the implementation of any peace agreement can sometimes be slow, frustrating and uneven.  The Kroc Institute from the University of Notre Dame, which reports on the implementation of the Colombian agreement, states that by October 2021, 30% of the stipulations in the Colombian agreement had been completed; a further 18% are at an intermediate stage; and a further 37% have been initiated and 15% have yet to be initiated.  There is considerable scope for improvement, which is why the EU consistently calls for the full implementation of the agreement, particularly because of its integrated nature.<br/><br/>At this stage, the EU's principal concerns include the alarmingly high number of killings of human right defenders, social leaders and former combatants, mostly in remote areas of the country, and the need for increased and improved protection and for accountability.  In that regard, the EU has provided funding to assist the work of the ombudsman and for the establishment of a special investigations unit in the office of the national prosecutor.  I hope to hold the next EU-Colombia human rights dialogue early in the new year, and these issues, especially those relating to human rights defenders, will be high on the agenda.<br/><br/>The second principal concern relates to the need to accelerate the process of rural development and land reform.  The agreement sets a 15-year time horizon for this work, five years of which have elapsed.  The implementation of this chapter of the agreement will require significant additional Colombian resources.  Third, there is the continuing and growing problem of illegal drugs and other illegal economies, from which much of the violence stems.  The implementation of the plans for crop substitution contained in the peace agreement will be key.  There is also a need for a fuller discussion, in Europe and the United States particularly, on the relationship between the consumption of cocaine and violence in Colombia.<br/><br/>Fourth, the Covid-19 pandemic has also impacted on implementation.  The impact of the pandemic on the informal economy in Colombia, together with pre-existing inequalities, contributed to the large-scale strikes and public protests that took place in the country in the second quarter of this year and resulted in large numbers of peaceful protestors being shot dead.  I travelled to Colombia in June of this year and met the strike committee, representatives of young people and business leaders, as well as the president and the leadership of the police.  I urged respect for the right to peaceful protest, for accountability and for dialogue between the authorities and strikers and protesters.<br/><br/>During my most recent visit to Colombia, a few weeks ago, I was struck by the strong appreciation at all levels for the support of the international community for peace in Colombia, and by the particular welcome for the EU's role in this support.  As we know in Ireland, international support for the peace process was essential.  In the case of Colombia, the role of the UN has been central, with consistent interest and support from the Security Council, of which Ireland is now a member.<br/><br/>In that context, I express my recognition of the role Ireland has played.  Over the years, Irish civil society organisations, churches, trade unions, development agencies and parliamentarians from North and South have regularly visited Colombia to express support for peacebuilding and for the defence of human rights, all of which contributed to the climate in which it was possible to advance peace negotiations.  The decision by the Government to open a resident embassy in Bogot&aacute; has greatly increased Ireland's visibility and presence.  I express my thanks also for the secondment of an Irish official to work with me on Colombia and on my human rights work, to which I will now turn.<br/><br/>Human rights, democracy and the rule of law are in the DNA of the EU.  They are included in the treaties, they are conditions for membership of the EU and they are reflected in the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Union.  All the EU's trade agreements and the framework agreements with countries outside the EU contain human rights clauses and obligations.  The EU's system of trade preferences for third countries requires compliance with core human rights conventions.<br/><br/>The EU, together with its member states, is the largest financial contributor to human rights and democracy in the world.  The European instrument for democracy and human rights alone commits to &euro;1.5 billion over the next six years.  One example is the funding the EU provides to protect and support human rights defenders.  <i>ProtectDefenders.eu</i>provides support through civil society organisations such as Front Line Defenders, which is headquartered In Ireland, and has helped more than 46,000 human rights defenders in the past five years alone.  Another example is the election observation missions that are organised by the EU, 98 of which were organised in the course of the past five years.<br/><br/>In 2012, the Council decided to create the office of the EU Special Representative for Human Rights as an added dimension of the EU overall effort.  On my appointment, in 2019, the role was widened to put greater emphasis on international humanitarian law and international criminal justice.  More recently, when the new EU action plan on human rights and democracy for the period 2020 to 2024 was unanimously adopted by member states just a year ago, I was given responsibility to guide its implementation.<br/><br/>In carrying out my mandate, I principally engage with governments, usually at ministerial level.  Some of this is through formal human rights dialogues and some I chair on behalf of the EU, such as in recent times with Brazil and the African Union.  Other engagements occur through bilateral visits and bilateral meetings, and of course, during the pandemic, much of this was carried out virtually.<br/><br/>I also represent the EU at multilateral human rights forums and events.  Earlier this week, for example, I spoke at a civil society conference on human rights in the Middle East and north Africa; this morning, I spoke at Finland's parliament to its advisory board for international human rights; and tomorrow, I will speak in Geneva on the human rights dimension of the digital future.<br/><br/>Engagement with civil society is also an essential part of my work.  Last week, I participated in the opening panel of the annual EU-NGO forum, and yesterday, I met civil society and opposition leaders from Belarus.  I relay the appreciation they expressed to me regarding the adoption by members of parliament throughout the EU, including in Ireland, of individual Belarus political prisoners.  I take this opportunity to express my feelings about the prison sentences handed down in the past couple of hours against opposition leaders in Belarus.  Some of these prison sentences are politically motivated and they are brutal.</p><p>I again repeat the European Union's calls for the release of political prisoners in Belarus and for accountability for those organising and administering the repression. </p><p> I do not want to summarise all of my engagements but it may be of interest to the committee for me to give some examples of my work.  Between 27 November and 2 December, I visited Brazil, where I co-chaired the EU-Brazil human rights dialogue and visited Bel&eacute;m in the Amazon region to meet with civil society and indigenous representatives and with courageous human rights defenders.  The visit enabled me to underline the EU&rsquo;s expectations that Brazil will deliver on its commitments at COP26 and the nexus between environmental protection and human rights.  I might also mention that Roger Casement was British consul in Bel&eacute;m in 1908 and 1909 and that it was there that he prepared his report on the human rights abuses in the rubber industry.</p><p> I visited Ukraine in October to meet Government Ministers, to visit eastern Ukraine and to engage with human rights defenders and representatives of the Tatar community from the illegally occupied Crimea.  While there, I expressed the EU&rsquo;s support for Ukraine with regard to Crimea and the areas of eastern Ukraine not controlled by the Government.  I saw at first hand the hardships being faced by people living in those areas and the fragile nature of the ceasefire, which has led to the concerns regarding the mobilisation of Russian armed forces on the Ukrainian border which are now to the fore.</p><p> In early October, I visited central Asia to speak at the civil society forum.  I also had discussions with the Presidents of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan about the human rights situation in each of those countries and about the regional response to the crisis in Afghanistan and how the human rights situation in that country should be addressed.</p><p> In November, I co-chaired the European Union-Africa Union human rights dialogue with African Union Commissioner Bankole.  Inevitably in that dialogue, we discussed the conflict in Ethiopia.  That conflict was also among the issues I discussed with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, during the first ever European Union-Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, OHCHR, strategic dialogue, which we held in early October.  While I have had regular contact with High Commissioner Bachelet and the European Union is a strong supporter of her office and very active at the Human Rights Council, when High Commissioner Bachelet attended the European Union Foreign Affairs Council earlier this year, it was agreed that our relationship and co-operation should be put on a more formal and strategic footing.  We intend to have the next meeting of this strategic dialogue early in 2022.</p><p> In my human rights dialogues, I usually meet with the representatives of civil society and, when possible, parliamentarians.  In Brazil, for example, I met with the chairpersons and members of the human rights committees of the Senate and Congress.  In Ukraine and Kazakhstan, I met with the chairpersons of the justice and foreign affairs committees.</p><p> There have been many significant developments during my mandate.  These include the resumption, even during the Trump Administration, of the EU-US consultations on human rights, which had been in abeyance since 2015.  The relationship with the US on the issue of human rights and democracy has significantly improved over the past year.  We have also seen the resumption of a human rights dialogue at local level with India after a seven-year lapse and the holding of the first ever human rights dialogue between the European Union and Saudi Arabia in September of this year.  Other developments include the adoption last December of the EU global human rights sanctions regime and the commencement of sanctions for human rights violations under that regime.  The EU has shown support for the International Criminal Court, ICC, over the past three years in the face of threatened withdrawal by some countries and the sanctions imposed by the Trump Administration on senior officials of the court.  I was directly involved in discussing the ICC with the then US Administration and I welcomed the decision by the new Administration to remove those sanctions.</p><p> In this relatively short presentation, it is possible only to touch on some of the countries and issues with which I engage but, before moving on to committee members' questions and observations, I want to draw a few conclusions from my work as special representative for human rights.</p><p> The first relates to the rise in authoritarianism throughout the world.  All across the world, we are seeing democracy under pressure with consequences for human rights, such as the shrinking of civil society space and restrictions on fundamental freedoms such as freedom of the media, freedom of assembly and freedom of expression.  The Varieties of Democracy, V-Dem, study, which measures the health of democracy and freedom over time, states in its last report that 68% of the world&rsquo;s population now live under either absolute autocracies or electoral autocracies and that the levels of democracy and freedom experienced by the average global citizen are back down to levels last seen 30 years ago.</p><p> The second relates to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on human rights, on the most vulnerable and especially on women.  It will take a long time to unwind many of the emergency measures.  The third relates to the several human rights crises which have emerged in the past few years including the repression in Belarus to which I have referred, the plight of women and girls in Afghanistan, the violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Ethiopia and the coup in Myanmar.</p><p> However, there are also positive trends.  We have never been closer to the global abolition of the death penalty.  Last year, just 20 countries carried out executions.  That is 20 too many, but we need now to collectively think about what more is needed to complete abolition.  A second positive trend relates to the lessons the world is learning from the Covid-19 pandemic including the importance of multilateralism and the UN institutions and, in the human rights field, the renewed emphasis on economic, social and cultural rights, which is also reflected in the EU's action plan.  Related to this is the emergence of business and human rights as an area of particular interest.  I know that this is a topic to which the committee has been giving some attention in recent times and I welcome that.  It is also one which is receiving a much higher priority at EU level.  I look forward to exchanging further with the committee about that.  I thank the committee again for its invitation and attention.  I am happy to respond to the questions and observations of members.</p></speech>

I will now turn to members of the committee.  Given the wide-ranging nature of the overview and of the work under discussion, I propose to take observations and questions from a number of members before reverting to the special envoy for a response.  We will start with Deputy Brady.  I see Senator Joe O'Reilly and other members of the committee indicating.  I will take them in the order in which they raised their hands.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021121400002#C00300"><p>I thank Mr. Gilmore very much for his very comprehensive statement.  I commend him on his ongoing work, which is very important.  I refer not only to his work on human rights in general but specifically to his work in Colombia with regard to the peace process.  It must be said that agreement was historic, although it has been five years since its signing.  There has to be some profound concern about the lack of overall progress on the implementation of the peace agreement.  The lack of implementation by the Colombian Government of some of the crucial and critical obligations under the agreement has left the peace process weakened.  It is also denying the Colombian people the opportunity to experience what I see as the agreement's transformative potential to build a sustainable and lasting peace within Colombia.</p> <p>  I have a couple of specific questions arising from that.  More than 290 former members of Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC, have been murdered since the signing of the peace agreement, leaving aside all of the murders of front-line human rights defenders, trade unionists and civil society leaders.  Does Mr. Gilmore recognise FARC's compliance with its obligations under the agreement?  What more can be done internationally to ensure maximum pressure is put on the Colombian Government to support the transitional justice mechanisms, which are key and critical to the success of the peace agreement?</p><p>What support can the EU and Mr. Gilmore give, or what pressure can they apply, to the Colombian Government to maximise efforts to implement the agreement in its remaining time in office?</p><p> What efforts is the EU making to respond to the human rights crisis in Colombia and to hold its government to account for its slow implementation of the key human rights-related areas of the peace agreement?  This year, many protests took place in Colombia.  This committee has heard a great deal of evidence from Front Line Defenders, human rights activists and civil society groups.  I have been in communication with them over violations of people's rights and the murders that have been carried out by police and state officials within Colombia.  How are the EU and Mr. Gilmore following up on police violence during the protests to ensure justice for victims and that state officials and the Colombian Government are held to account for human rights violations, including murders?  How can there be faith in the Colombian state's ability to hold its police force to account in light of such a history of impunity?  These are not just my observations but those of people on the ground who have seen murders being carried out by state forces without anyone being held to account, unfortunately.</p><p> This committee has given some focus to the issue of business and human rights.  Last week, members of the Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights, ICBHR, appeared before us.  It published a fantastic report &ndash; I am unsure as to whether Mr. Gilmore has seen it &ndash; entitled &ldquo;Make it Your Business&rdquo;, which outlines many of the its concerns over the global impact of corporate harm.  The report lists a series of countries across the world aside from Colombia, including Israel and its illegal settlements, Pakistan, Uganda and Kenya.  The ICBHR states that, due to exploitation by major corporations, we have seen the forced removal and displacement of indigenous peoples from their lands, exploitation, etc.  Like me, many organisations working in this field in Ireland and at EU level see a major reluctance to put in place a binding UN treaty designed to make international corporations and other enterprises accountable in their home countries for their activities overseas.  This committee has dealt extensively with the ESB and its involvement in the Cerrej&oacute;n coal mine in Colombia where there are major human rights violations yet the ESB continues to act with perceived impunity.  Why is there such a major reluctance at EU level to sign up to a binding UN treaty?  There have been eight rounds of negotiations so far and the EU is seen as one of the bodies that is dragging its heels on signing up to a treaty.</p><p> I will raise a final point before allowing the Chair and other members to contribute.  In terms of human rights violations, why is there such reluctance by the EU to put in place concrete measures to ensure that the human rights of Palestinians are protected?  We have had report after report.  This State has been the first EU state to declare formally that Israel has de facto annexed Palestinian lands illegally through its expansion of settlements within occupied territories.  Why is there such a major reluctance to hold Israel to account for the continuing human rights violations within the occupied territories in Palestine?</p><p> I have listened to the opening statement and there was no mention of Palestine.  I ask Mr. Gilmore to point me to someone else.  I know that Mr. Michael Ling has given huge focus to this and produced comprehensive reports on the apartheid system that is being perpetrated by Israel.  Why is there a reluctance to take on Israel and hold it to account for its continued human rights violations, which allows them to continue to act with impunity? </p></speech>

We have been friends for years and know each other for quite a while.  It is nearly an embarrassingly long time but it still has been a good experience.  I have always admired his work in public life and it is great to have him with us.</p><p>I have read the submission he made.  However, I am at a slight disadvantage as I have not heard him or heard what he might have said additionally as I had to conduct a vote in the Seanad.  I was struck by the report compiled by the Kroc Institute in the University of Notre Dame, which shows that there was 30% after five years, which is a pretty low percentage for final completion of the stipulations in the agreement.  There is also only 37% initiated and 15% have yet to be initiated.  Those statistics are not overly encouraging.  Having said that, they are a great contrast to the horrible statistic related to the war previously, as described by Mr. Gilmore.</p><p>I want to hone in on three things that he referenced as EU concerns and, obviously, as his own concerns.  There is the question of the killing of human rights defenders, social leaders, trade unionists, etc.  That is an atrocity and that is wrong.  In any situation inflicting state violence on people is never an acceptable <i>modus vivendi</i>.  Can Mr. Gilmore point out a strategy?  Has he detected a willingness to move on the part of the Colombian Government?  Does he have a level of hope about the situation?  Can he recommend anything?  Bearing in mind that I may have missed what he said earlier, can he make suggestions that might assist people to move on?  I mean both within the UN, the EU, etc.  The situation is depressing.  If there is anything that we can do to improve things then we should do it.  Violence is to be condemned in every scenario.</p><p>I am interested in the third aspect, which is illegal drugs.  Mr. Gilmore correctly said that crime is very interlinked with the illegal drugs trade.  There is a big requirement to substitute that with normal commerce and agriculture.  Surely the international community would have a particular interest, and from the perspective of self-interest, to deal with the issue.  Is there more potential for the international community to get involved in trying to eliminate the problem, which in itself is a problem for the world and is a problem within Colombia as it gives rise to violence?</p><p>The next issue that Mr. Gilmore outlined concerned the pandemic.  It would be interesting for us to be aware of the vaccination rates in Colombia and how Covid had impacted on Colombian society.</p><p>One assumes that in a society with such fragility, coming out of a shocking war and grappling with a new peace, the impact of the pandemic has to have been particularly awful.  How much of a setback has it been?  I know that Mr. Gilmore has been hands-on there too.</p><p> I ask Mr. Gilmore to elaborate on those issues.  I salute his great work.  I join with Deputy Brady in expressing our outright horror at any State engendered violence, illicit murders of people within the country or even the turning of a blind eye to drug crime.  I know that will be a unanimous view among members.  State perpetrated crime is a shocking deterrent to any kind of normal society.  I thank Mr. Gilmore again.  It is great to have him with us.  He does great work.</p></speech>

Colombia has been the subject of some discussion and debate in this committee over the past year or more.  Mr. Gilmore has spoken about his work and about the importance of the European Union engagement.  He has also spoken about wider international support for the peace process in Colombia, with particular reference, presumably, to the United States, all of which is laudable.  I ask Mr. Gilmore to address the domestic buy-in or the buy-in on the part of civil society in Colombia to the peace process.  Any peace process is hugely dependent on support from within.  I wonder about the extent to which that has wavered, changed or remained steadfast over the period of five years to which Mr. Gilmore referred.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Gilmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021121400002#E00300"><p>I will first deal with the issues relating to Colombia that were raised by Deputy Brady, Senator O'Reilly and the Chairman.  It is not true to say that the agreement has not been implemented.  The agreement is being implemented.  We can argue about whether it should be implemented more quickly and fully and the European Union has consistently taken the view that the agreement should be implemented in full and that the implementation should be accelerated because it is integrated.  We need to recognise what has been achieved.  FARC disarmed in seven months.  The decommissioning of weapons by the IRA took seven years under our peace process.  The Colombian agreement has already established a victim-centred approach to transitional justice and a truth commission, which is due to report in the middle of next year, has been established.  Some 23 years after the Good Friday Agreement, we still do not have a truth process in our peace process.  The transitional justice mechanisms are working.</p> <p>  I can confirm to Deputy Brady that I recognise the compliance of FARC with the agreement.  The leadership of FARC has been consistent in its political commitment to implementing the agreement, turning away from violence and pursuing its political objectives by democratic and peaceful means.  A measure of the FARC leadership&rsquo;s commitment to the implementation of the agreement is its acceptance and acknowledgement of the decision of the transitional justice system to find the FARC leadership collectively guilty of crimes against humanity, mainly in respect of the charges that were brought against them for kidnapping.  I do not know of any guerrilla movement or former guerrilla movement anywhere in the world that has been so accepting of the way an agreement has been implemented.</p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked me about the transitional justice mechanisms and the work they have done.  The transitional justice mechanisms went through a shaky start.  They were subject to political criticism and to attack from various people in the political system.  Attempts were made to move the goalposts and change the legislation.  The Constitutional Court of Colombia took a strong position on that.  The transitional justice system is working now.  Two things testify to my confidence that it will continue to work.  First is the event it organised three weeks ago as part of the fifth anniversary event.  The other Colombian players, including the President of the country, attended the event and acknowledged the work it is doing.  There is no going back on the work of the transitional justice system.  Second, the agreement that was made with the Colombian Government by the ICC was important in this regard because the ICC has effectively said that it has confidence that the transitional justice system will do its work, that the ICC will keep in touch with the JEP and that as long as that is the case it will not further pursue the preliminary investigation it had started.  However, the ICC has also said that if there is a change in that it is free to return to its investigation.</p> <p>  I refer to the killings of former combatants.  Deputy Brady is right that around 300 former combatants have been killed to date.  Huge numbers of human rights defenders, social leaders and peaceful protestors were also killed during the protests and strikes earlier this year.  Most of those killings were not carried out by the state or its actors but by others.  Most of the violence in the remote areas of Colombia is coming from non-state actors, including FARC dissidents, the Ej&eacute;rcito de Liberaci&oacute;n Nacional, ELN, Clan de Golfo and different illegal armed groups and cartels that are mainly associated with the drugs trade, though this is not exclusive.  Some of the killings that took place during the protests were carried out by police.  I have already raised those issues with the President of Colombia, the head of the police service and others in Colombia and there have to be full investigations and accountability for those killings.  The President of Colombia agrees with that, as do the police.  The chief of police talked to me about plans they have for the reform of the police and lessons they have learned arising from those protests.  Those are issues I will be following up when we carry out the human rights dialogue with Colombia next year.</p> <p>  I refer to Senator O'Reilly&rsquo;s questions about cocaine and crop substitution.  The peace agreement provided for a system of voluntary crop substitution and so far about 100,000 growers or families have opted into that.  The Government has committed that it will honour the compensation payments that have to be made to them.  However, that is only a small proportion of those who are growing cocaine in Colombia.  There are practical difficulties with the implementation of the crop substitution programme and one of those practical difficulties is the intimidation and violence which is perpetrated against leaders of the crop substitution movement.  For example, the Government agency goes out and has a meeting with farmers and growers in a particular town or village, the farmers and growers agree to opt into the crop substitution and elect a committee and then the local community leader who leads that committee gets intimidated, attacked and, sometimes, killed.  That is what is happening on the ground.</p><p>To address Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, I said that we needed to give some thought in Europe and also, in particular, in North America to what more the international community can do to address the cocaine problem, where 70% of the world&rsquo;s cocaine was coming from Colombia.  This cannot be done by telling farmers and growers that they have to stop doing it, by going in to spray their crops or by sending in the army to destroy the crop.  There has to be a response at the demand end.  That is something that policymakers in Europe and North America need to address by either enforcement or other measures.  Many different policy options have been talked about as to how to address the issue of cocaine, in particular, which is the issue we are talking about in Colombia, and to a lesser extent marijuana, because there is a considerable amount of marijuana also grown in the country.  This is an area that policymakers need to address.  The consumption of cocaine and the illegal nature of that trade is leading to people being killed in remote parts of Colombia and probably other countries as well.</p><p> The Chairman asked about the buy-in by civil society and there is such buy-in.  On my last visit to Colombia I felt that there was a greater degree of political consensus around the implementation of the agreement than I have seen in the past five years.  The agreement got off to a shaky start in the beginning and was defeated by a small margin in a plebiscite and had to be renegotiated.  It was the central issue in the presidential election that took place in 2018 and the country was very polarised around it.  We are now at a point where all of the political forces are committed to implementing the agreement.  There are differences in some emphasis and on the pace with which it is to be implemented but there is a political consensus which is shared with civil society.  There is a need for a greater degree of dialogue between government and civil society and, in particular, between the Government and the National Strike Committee, and young people who were part of the protest movement in the early part of this year.  The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, talked with President Duque by phone about the issue in the middle of those protests and expressed the alarm of the European Union about peaceful protesters being killed.  He asked me to visit the country in June, which I did, and I had the discussions that I referred to earlier, following which I also discussed my conclusions with President Duque.</p><p> On the other issues that have been raised and on the business and human rights issue raised by the Deputy Brady, it is not true to say that there is a major reluctance on the part of the European Union to engage on the need for a global treaty on business and human rights.  First of all, this is moving very slowly.  We already have guiding principles which have been established by the United Nations.  Those guiding principles require countries to adopt national action plans.  Ireland is one of the few countries that has done so and in fact there are very few countries in the world which have adopted national action plans.  There are about 30 of these now, half of those are member states of the European Union.  In the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020-2024 we have agreed that there will be a framework to enable and encourage the rest of the EU member states to adopt national action plans and to implement the guiding principles.  To be blunt about it, in circumstances where there are only around 30 countries willing to work on this, in other words to go with the guiding principles, the prospects of us getting to a treaty very soon are not great.  The European Union is at the table and is participating in the discussions that are taking place in Geneva but there are a couple of problems.  </p><p> The biggest problem is probably the proposed scope of such a treaty.  At the moment the proposal is that it would apply to transnational corporations but that it would not apply, for example, to state companies.  There are big countries in the world, some of which do not necessarily share the European Union&rsquo;s view on human rights and their importance, which have big state companies that would be exempted from such a treaty.  The ESB, referred to, for example, by the Deputy Brady, would probably not be covered by the treaty as it stands at the moment.  That is an issue that has to be addressed.  It is partly in recognising that, that the European Union itself now intends to proceed with the introduction of mandatory due diligence legislation.  The EU Commissioners Reynders and Breton are currently working on a proposal which would introduce due diligence legislation in respect of human rights and environmental obligations for larger European companies and companies operating in the European market.  I have been discussing that with Commissioner Reynders and the hope is that that legislation will be considered by the Commission in the early part of next year.</p><p> Similarly, on the issue of Palestine, there is not a reluctance on the part of the European Union to hold Israel to account.  In fact the European Union and its member states are the biggest contributors in supporting the Palestinian National Authority.  We have a dedicated special representative who deals with the Middle East peace process and I work very closely with him.  The Deputy is correct, however, in that there is not unanimity within the European Union and Council on the issue of Israel and Palestine.  Under the treaties we require unanimity to agree a common position on foreign policy including the issue of human rights in foreign policy.  We then adopted the action plan when the High Representative went to the Council just this time last year, in November 2020, with the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020-2024 and asked the Council if it would agree to lift the unanimity requirement at the Council for its decisions on the issue of human rights alone.  To date, that has not been agreed.  This is a matter for member states, and I am not aware if this committee has given any thought to this, but it would be helpful if the Council were to agree to lift the unanimity requirement just on human rights issues and not on all foreign policy issues.  This would also be helpful to my work on Palestine.</p><p> I believe I have covered the questions.  Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly asked about the vaccination rates in Colombia.  I believe they are in excess of about 60% now but I can get the exact figures for the Senator.  The good news is that the number of infections in Colombia is dropping.  They were very high when I was there in June and there was a great deal of concern about it but during my last visit I was told that the numbers are dropping.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and Mr. Gilmore for his statement and contributions to date.  In contrast to Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, we have not met before so it is a pleasure to meet him and it is a pity that we cannot meet in person in the committee room but these are the times that we are in.  I want to put on the record that our party, and it is reflected generally, and Ireland are very proud of him and of the work that he is doing in the very important role that he has at the moment.  We wish him well in his continued efforts.</p> <p>  Mr. Gilmore has acknowledged the work that is being done over the past five years on the implementation of the agreement from 2016.</p><p>It is very important, and I accept that things are going in the right direction.  None of this is easy.  Having said that, a thousand people have been killed since 2016.  Some 65 of those killed in the past year were environmental and land defenders in Colombia.  A third of those attacks were targeted at indigenous and Afro-descended people.  Half of them were small-scale farmers.  I want to mention one particular activist among the 65 who were assassinated.  Juana Perea Plata was abducted and assassinated by a right wing militia because she organised a campaign against the establishment of commercial port in her local area.  While there have been many achievements, we should not be patting ourselves on the back just yet.  I do not think Mr. Gilmore is doing so.  It is a process and it will have to continue.  There is a lot of very hard work ahead.  I will be interested in Mr. Gilmore's comments on the issue of risk to environmental and land defenders in Colombia.</p><p> With respect to the presidential elections that are due to take place next year, does Mr. Gilmore consider that these may pose a threat to the process?  I do not think that question was asked, and I did not hear him speaking about the matter.  Given the amount of work that has been done and that he has done, does he see risks and is he engaging with the various parties, Opposition politicians and civil society groups in advance of those elections?</p><p> On the use of foreign aid funds, the departmental briefing note states that Ireland has contributed more than &euro;117 million in funding to peace building and conflict resolution in Colombia between 2016 and this year.  The European Union Institute for Security Studies is concerned that the implementation of the peace process is not adequate in that the principles of the peace accord are not matched by the projects that are being carried out and funded.  How satisfied is Mr. Gilmore that EU and Irish aid is being transparently distributed and properly used by the Colombian Government in this peace process?</p><p> Many people in Colombia look to the European Union as an actor that can make a real impact.  One thing we could be asking the Colombian Government to ratify is the Escaz&uacute; agreement, which, I understand, is similar to the Aarhus Convention in Europe.  It would provide safeguards for activists in respect of access to justice provisions.  Perhaps Mr. Gilmore could update the committee on what the EU is doing to discuss ratification of the Escaz&uacute; agreement with the Colombian Government.</p><p> I note Mr. Gilmore's response to Deputy Brady on the sustainable corporate governance directive and the push by the Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights.  He mentioned that Ireland has adopted an action plan and was one of the first to do so, which is very welcome.  I would like to hear Mr. Gilmore's thoughts on going further and bringing in legislation in that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021121400002#G00200"><p>I thank Mr. Gilmore for his time and his statement.  They are very much appreciated.  On the 15% of stipulations in the Colombian Agreement that have yet to be initiated, is there something that is making them more challenging to implement?  Is there something unique relating to why they are there?  Like many other people, I find inertia incredibly frustrating.  Where progress is being made an end result will eventually be reached but where there is no movement whatsoever it should and does raise a red flag.</p> <p>  I completely agree with Mr. Gilmore regarding cocaine harvesting and the cocaine farm in Colombia.  There is a phenomenal amount of work to be done at the demand end of this equation.  It is pointless to some degree for farmers' crops to be destroyed.  They are simply going to be replaced because the demand does not shrink; indeed, there is a growing demand.  When Mr. Gilmore speaks of the need for a fuller discussion in the United States in particular, what does that look like in his experience?  If it is to be functional, there needs to be a level of co-operation and engagement with civil society and in terms of government and the legislative programme for that actually to be effective.</p> <p>  I do not want to harp on for too long about the human and business rights issue.  Mr. Gilmore has given it significant time already.  I want to follow-up on a question asked by Deputy Leddin about the national action plan being progressed, almost into individual countries and legislation.  If there is friction - and it may be a bit generous to call it friction - between transnational and state companies in terms of the proposed scope, is it a positive step for companies to be introducing legislation?  Is there a role for countries to bring in individual legislation?  Given that the EU is working as slowly as it is, we could be having this conversation in 30 or 40 years.  In the interim, what steps could individual countries take to influence that area of business and human rights?</p> <p>  Mr. Gilmore spoke about the rise of authoritarianism, which caught my attention.  This is something we have seen throughout the world.  I note particularly the report stating that 68% of the world's population now live under absolute or electoral autocracies.  Given the restrictions that have been put on civil society and the shrinking of that area, what impact does Mr. Gilmore feel social media is having?  We know how social media works in terms of algorithms.  If I tend to watch videos of a certain description or with a certain kind of content, more of them will be pushed at me.  Is that having an impact?  Is it being used primarily to push one view?</p> <p>  I am most heartened to hear Mr. Gilmore mention the impact Covid-19 has had on human rights.  Generations of women have fought long and hard and those hard-won gains cannot be unwound because of this pandemic.  I have said it to other witnesses before the committee that this should be a catalyst for more female participation in certain areas, whether politics, activism or education.  In Mr. Gilmore's view and experience in the job he does, how is that going to pan out?  Are we moving back 15 or 20 years in terms of the gains that have been made already, or are there areas or countries that are looking at it from a more future-proof perspective of ensuring that there are more women's voices at the table?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021121400002#G00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Gilmore to the meeting.  It is nice to see him again.  I congratulate him on the work he is doing across the world and in Europe, for Europe and for us.  Deputy Clarke has stolen some of my thunder.  I was going to ask about democracy on retreat across the world as well.  I was taken by the line in Mr. Gilmore's speech that 68% of the world's population now live in autocracies.  Many articles are being written on democracy in retreat, and there is worry about that from within and without.  We have seen attacks from abroad on democracies.  As Deputy Clarke has said, elections are being interfered with over the Internet and so on.  There is also interference from inside, from the extreme right and the extreme left in some countries.  Mr. Gilmore might comment on where he sees this going and what democracies can do.  I am taken by President Biden's initiative on democracy.  He is also worried about it and, possibly, about the state of democracy in his country.</p> <p>  Could Mr. Gilmore comment on the impact of the situation in Venezuela on Colombia?  I note reports stating that 5.6 million people have left Venezuela.  More than 1 million of those have settled in Colombia.</p><p>I think they got some legal status recently.  Last October the border between the two countries reopened and there were some issues around what is happening there.  Will Mr. Gilmore comment on the impact of the latest events relating to Venezuela and Colombia?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Gilmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021121400002#H00200"><p>I will start by responding to Deputy Leddin.  There is no doubt the single biggest concern that the European and I have about the implementation of the peace agreement in Colombia and the human rights position there is the number of people being killed.  These include former combatants, social leaders and human rights defenders.  As we have said, many of these human rights defenders have worked on environmental matters.  In turn, many of these are women and indigenous or Afro-Colombian.</p> <p>  There is a battle for the environment and this is very much related to what went on at COP26.  We can speak, for example, of protection of the Amazon and the territories in its region or issues relating to deforestation.  We can consider the problem of both legal and illegal mining along some of the rivers connected to it.  There are people who are defending the environment, trying to stop deforestation and protect a sustainable way of living with that very sensitive ecosystem and environment.  These people are increasingly being put at risk.  This often happens in remote parts of the country where the presence of the state is very limited or, in some places, it does not exist at all.  People are being intimidated, killed and put in harm's way.</p> <p>  We rely first on the office of the ombudsman in Colombia to do much reporting on this work and that is one of the reasons the European Union has provided additional funding for the office.  In the discussions we have with the Colombian Government, the first item on the agenda, invariably, is the position with the continuing violence in these parts of the country and the need for more protection and a more comprehensive approach to the provision of security.  There are provisions in the peace agreement to provide for systems where local communities are involved in the development of security.  We talk about that.  Of course, there is the question of accountability.  This relates not just to those who carry out the killings but those who are behind them.  They must also be brought to account.  Again, it is one of the reasons we provided finance for the establishment of what we call a special investigation unit in the office of the national prosecutor in Colombia.  It is to look not only for the gun that kills somebody but on whose behalf that shot was fired.  That is an approach we are taking.</p> <p>  I was asked about the Escaz&uacute; agreement.  We have spoken about it and about a year ago I did a dedicated event that was organised by civic society in support of Escaz&uacute; agreement.  It is an issue we will discuss at the forthcoming human rights dialogue.  I am not in a position to speak about the deployment of funding from individual EU member states.  In respect of the peace agreement, we essentially fund three main areas.  One is the establishment of the special investigation unit I have referred.  The second is support for the reincorporation or reintegration of former combatants, and we have provided substantial funding for that.  The third area is the support for rural development, which is being done through a bottom-up approach that I have referred to.</p> <p>  On the forthcoming presidential election, I have been talking to some people, either declared candidates or people who may be candidates.  From what I am seeing, I am confident there will be a continuation of the implementation of the agreement.  I am not hearing or seeing candidates who are outright opposed to it at this point.  The European Union is considering sending an election observation mission to observe those elections but a decision has not yet been taken on that.  We had a preliminary team looking at the election environment.  The previous elections were the most peaceful in Colombia in over 30 years and I hope these will be peaceful as well.</p> <p>  In addition to the presidential election we are also looking at the elections for the 16 special seats, some of which are in more remote and vulnerable areas in the country.  We are going to have a close look at those.  When I was there three weeks ago I participated with the electoral commission in the launch of a particular campaign that the European Union is supporting.  That is basically about providing support to women candidates, not for their electoral activity but to help fight intimidation.  There is much of that on social media and many people are facing risks.  We are paying particular attention to that.</p> <p>  That probably addresses some of what Deputy Clarke raised.  She asked about the 15% figure but it is not just about that.  It is also about the 37% that has been initiated but, frankly, has not got very far in some cases.  The common thread here relates to resources.  Much of this agreement will be very expensive to implement, particularly rural development elements and those relating to payment of reparations to victims.  There are also elements relating to crop substitution.  The next stage of the implementation of this agreement is one where more resources will be required from the Colombian Government and Colombian society.  It is something I expect to be addressed in the context of the forthcoming election.  There is the question of putting one's finger on what is being held back; as with many countries, it is a question of resources.</p> <p>  What can individual countries do on the business and human rights agenda?  It is open to countries to move ahead and some European countries have done that.  For example, Germany has introduced due diligence legislation and the Netherlands is considering it.  I attended a Finnish parliamentary committee - it was virtual, of course - this morning and that country is also talking about it.  It is something the Legislature could certainly consider.  It is also fair to say the European Union will lead on this and it is not a case that it will drag its feet.</p> <p>  In the discussions I have had with the private sector and business organisations, I see a willingness to proceed with this.  Many companies are very concerned about their own corporate reputation.  I remember being in a third country that was trying to size up how serious I was about the trade preferences as there were human rights issues.  I made the point to those people that they should not be as concerned about officials in buildings in Brussels as the European consumer.  If the European consumer thinks a product is made with child or forced labour, he or she is likely to leave that product on the hanger.  Companies are increasingly aware of that.</p><p>Therefore, there is probably a greater willingness than is sometimes appreciated, among businesses and the private sector, to move ahead with this.</p><p> I was asked about Covid-19 and women.  The biggest impact, right across the board, has probably been on domestic violence.  Unfortunately, with the Covid situation and lockdown, we have seen a dramatic increase in domestic violence and violence against women, right across the world.  That has to be urgently addressed.  It is one of the reasons, for example, the Istanbul Convention in the context of Europe is so important and why it is so regrettable that Turkey has withdrawn from it.  </p><p> One sees social media as having a great liberating effect.  It is a great tool that will help support human rights defenders; bring us evidence much more quickly about abuses of human rights and enable the recording of violations and abuses of human rights that can in turn be used as evidence for the purpose of accountability.  Of course, as we know, there is also the abuse of social media, such as its abuse by states for surveillance of their own populations and abuse in the political sphere, sometimes in an organised way, to intimidate and bad-mouth opponents, much of which targets women, especially those active in the political sphere.  The European Union has a code of conduct with the main platforms.  There is a digital services Act in the process of being discussed and maybe some of that will find its way into the Act.</p><p> Deputy Stanton referred to the retreat on democracy.  The 68% includes not just absolute autocracies, but also electoral autocracies.  One could probably argue all day about whether particular countries should be included on that list, but the point we need to be aware of is that the graph is moving the wrong way.  We are seeing more of a shift in the wrong way, as far as democracy is concerned.</p><p> There are several impacts of Venezuela on Colombia.  One of them has been the issue of migration and refugees.  There are 2 million Venezuelan migrants in Colombia.  It deserves great credit for the way in which it has received and welcomed those migrants.  It has, as the Deputy said, provided them with access to public services.  It decided, for example, that every child born in Colombia of Venezuelan parents, irrespective of the status of those parents, was automatically given Colombian citizenship.  Much can be learned in Europe from how South American countries, many of which are not as well resourced as European countries, have dealt with the migration crisis arising from Venezuela.  In Brazil, where I was recently, more than 250,000 migrants have been similarly received and welcomed.  There is a lesson to be learned from that.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the importance of Mr. Gilmore's work in Colombia on behalf of the European Union, which includes ourselves in Ireland, as an active member of the Union.  I acknowledge the expertise and experience he brings, having regard to his many years in domestic politics here, with particular reference to our peace process and the value that brings to the Colombian situation.</p> <p>  The Colombian peace process has been a priority issue for this committee over the past number of years and the past 15 months since the general election saw a change in the configuration of this committee.  That notwithstanding, the Colombian peace process has been high on our agenda and we thank Mr. Gilmore for his engagement.  We acknowledge the work he is doing.  I also acknowledge the work here in Ireland of the Colombian ambassador, H.E. Patricia Cort&eacute;s Ortiz, who keeps this committee regularly informed and updated and has made herself available, often in challenging circumstances, to deal with sensitive issues on the matter of the Colombian peace process.  We wish Mr. Gilmore continued good fortune, acknowledging the challenging nature of that peace process.</p> <p>  Mr. Gilmore mentioned the prisoner situation in Belarus.  We had the opportunity, earlier this year, to have an in-person engagement with Ms Tsikhanouskaya when she was in Ireland.  We were very much impressed by her energy, work, commitment and courage.  Since her visit to Ireland, we see on a daily basis that she has been actively engaged, not only throughout the European Union, but beyond.  What more can be done towards the protection of human rights in Belarus?</p> <p>  We and the European Union have called for a new round of fresh and fair elections.  It is fair to say that will not happen in the near future or the medium term.  There is absolutely no inclination on the part of the Lukashenko regime to engage in any further elections.  Short of calling for new elections, what does Mr. Gilmore think can best be done from his office or the European Union?  We see today a fresh round of prison sentences, many of which appear to be a consequence of revenge for international engagement, rather than being grounded in any due process.</p> <p>  I will briefly turn to Syria, which has not been mentioned.  Of concern is the fact that Syria has faded from our front pages after in excess of ten years' horrific conflict.  This does not in any way mean that the human rights situation there is anything but acute and dire.  With regard to the humanitarian situation in north-eastern Syria, huge numbers of people face an acute shortage of drinking water, given the low levels of the Euphrates river.  We also see, for example, the situation of prisoners in Syria, for example, in one of the more notorious prisons where prison visits are reliant on the payment of extortionate sums of money by the relatives in order to gain access for a very short visit and tens of thousands of people spend many years languishing in prisons, often on pretty frivolous or groundless means.  I hope that notwithstanding the fact the Syrian conflict has faded, the engagement on the part of the European Union continues.  It causes me some concern to see some EU governments moving towards a recognition of the Assad regime.  How is Mr. Gilmore's work impacted by such moves?</p> <p>  I see Deputy Leddin offering again for a supplementary.  I will call on him before reverting to the special representative.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021121400002#K00100"><p>I thank the Chair for letting me contribute again.  I want to return to the issue of Colombia.  Mr. Gilmore rightly mentioned the challenge of the drug industry over there and that 70% of the world's cocaine is grown in Colombia.  The special representative mentioned that there is a responsibility on the part of Europe - I would say western countries generally - to tackle the demand side and I would agree with him.  Mr. Gilmore mentioned enforcement and stopped short of saying anything else.  I am interested to hear whether he has other views on what the appropriate policies might be.  I am not an expert.  I do not expect Mr. Gilmore to be an expert either but I am wondering whether there are conversations in Colombia around what appropriate policy might be.  It seems we have had particular policies in Ireland, in Europe and across the western world with respect to drugs for a long time and they have not been effective.  They have not served the developed countries well and they certainly have not served countries such as Colombia well.  It seems appropriate that we would have a discussion, perhaps not only about enforcement but also about liberalisation and regulation with a view to reducing harm in our own countries and, of course, in countries such as Colombia as well.  I am interested to hear if there are conversations along those lines happening in Colombia and if there is anything we should be listening to in respect of developing our own policies over here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Gilmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021121400002#K00200"><p>I agree with you, Chairman, about the great contribution that the ambassador, H.E. Ms Cort&eacute;s Ortiz, has made to the representation of Colombia in Ireland since she became the first resident Colombian ambassador in Ireland.  Indeed, I had the privilege of participating with the ambassador yesterday at an event organised by the Glencree centre.</p> <p>  On that subject, I also thank you personally, Chairman.  You were Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade at the time when I was appointed as special envoy for Colombia and I want to thank you for your enormous support at that time.</p> <p>  On Belarus, I also agree with you, Chairman, about the sentences that have been handed down today.  Mr. Tikhanovsky, Sviatlana's husband, has been sentenced to 18 years in prison.  He was charged with impeding the activities of the central election commission even though he was in jail when the elections took place, and with organising mass disorder even though he had been arrested and imprisoned before the protests took place after the election.  These are politically motivated charges.  This was a politically motivated sentence.  It was, as the Deputy said, an act of revenge.  It was intended not only to exact revenge on him and the other leaders who have been imprisoned, but also to frighten the rest of society.</p> <p>  There are a number of things that can be done.  It is true that the issue of clarifying the legitimacy of the Government of Belarus can only be resolved by new elections.  Getting to that point, of course, is another question.  The European Union in recent days has agreed to provide an additional &euro;30 million to support Belarusian civil society, including those who are effectively now in exile, as many of them are.  In the short term, we have to give attention to the situation of the 900 plus political prisoners, to continue to put a focus on their situation and to continue to call for their right to have visitors from church people, doctors and family.  That is an important humanitarian demand that we have to make consistently.  We have to continue to support civil society in Belarus, and we are continuing to do that.  Importantly, we have to continue to keep a focus on the need for accountability.  Lukashenko and the people who are around him, right down to individual prison officers who are in some cases torturing and mistreating prisoners, need to understand that there will be accountability, however long it may take.  That day will come.</p> <p>  On the issue of Syria, I agree with you, Chairman.  The immediate priority that the European Union is giving to Syria is the humanitarian situation which you have described.  The European Union is still the biggest contributor to the humanitarian effort in Syria.</p> <p>  An issue you have also raised that I am conscious of is the need to continue to focus on areas of abuse of human rights and violation of international humanitarian law, all of which we saw in Syria after the cameras and the public attention had moved on.  Syria is very much a case in point but there are many other examples in different parts of the world.  It is understandable that we give attention to what is in the news today but I am thinking all of the time about the situation of women and girls in Afghanistan and, indeed, the humanitarian situation now in Afghanistan.  The reports we are getting are alarming.  I am also thinking about the situation in Myanmar after the coup that took place there last February, which is rapidly descending into a civil war situation, and of course the situation in Ethiopia which has been the subject of much attention by the EU at the Human Rights Council, including our proposal that there should be a special session of the council to consider the report from the high commissioner.</p> <p>  Deputy Leddin raised in a supplementary question a direct question which probably requires more time than we can give the last question at an event such as this but it deserves honest discussion.  The Deputy asked whether this is being discussed in Colombia.  It is not, actually.  The big issue being discussed in Colombia centres around the crop, the spraying of it, the forced eradication of it, the tensions that gives rise to between local communities and law enforcement, the violence associated with the illegal trade, and the operation of various illegal groups and cartels.  There is an awareness and sometimes the issue of what is being done to address the demand side is raised.</p> <p>  In speaking about this, I am reflecting my own view.  I am now six years dealing with the situation in Colombia and I think we need to have a very honest discussion in society.  Some people say politicians should lead on this.  Perhaps that is the case and there needs to be a political discussion on it but I think there needs to be a wider discussion in society about the use, in particular, of cocaine, which is the main drug coming out of Colombia.  As I said, there is marijuana as well.  That discussion involves what is the most effective policy approach to take to it.  As Deputy Leddin says, is the question one of decriminalising use, regulating it in some way, seeing a more thorough enforcement of the laws that are there or perhaps promoting campaigns of reduction of use or whatever among users?  That conversation needs to be an honest one and it needs to be around what will be effective because what I have seen in Colombia for the past six years is that the line of coke leads directly to dead bodies in remote parts of Colombia.  Such bodies are mostly of poor people who were trying to make a living and found themselves on the wrong side of the law or of some illegal gang or vested interest.  That problem is not solved by telling the growers to stop growing it or even, ultimately, by crop substitution.  Of course, crop substitution would be the key part of it.</p><p>They are not going to switch to growing coffee or avocados.  If there is an armed gang in your village effectively gathering up the profits from cocoa growing, there is likely to be enormous money from it. That is the conversation that needs to be had.  That is probably the biggest contribution that Europe and North America can make in the years ahead to the sustaining of peace in Colombia.  It is not about telling them what to do; it is a question of what we can do, from our end, to address what is a shared problem.  This is not just a Colombian problem; it is a global problem and we are part of it.  We need to reflect on it and talk about it.  I would be happy to contribute my tuppence ha'penny worth to discussion of whatever policy might be considered.  Of course, in doing so, we must consider that it is illegal criminal gangs that are involved in this.  It is not just a case of the cocaine end of it, because illegal and international criminals move from one context to another.  That has to be part of the discussion as well.</p><p> I thank the members and the Chairman for their generosity with their time.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Gilmore for his presentation.  I was listening.  I want to put on record my horror at the serious erosion of democracy in Belarus.  I cannot believe that Ms Tsikhanouskaya's husband was sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment.  She is nine days older than me and has two young children like me.  It strikes me that as a committee, we should make some sort of point that we are outraged by this.  It is very upsetting for Ms Tsikhanouskaya to receive this news.  We have discussed the issue of the Uyghur muslims and the Chair has provided us with an update.  There are serious issues relating to the erosion of democracy all over the world, as the Chair highlighted.  I thank Mr. Gilmore for his presentation.  It was fascinating and I really enjoyed it.</p></speech>

That is a good note on which to bring matters to a conclusion.  I might just give the floor to Mr. Gilmore in respect of Belarus, as mentioned by her.  Perhaps he would like to leave us with a final message from his office in terms of his priorities between now and into the new year.  I thank him for joining us and congratulate him on the many initiatives that he is undertaking in his capacity as EU Special Representative for Human Rights and Special Envoy for the Peace Process in Colombia.

Even before the sentences were handed down, we had been looking at how to keep the Belarus situation progressing and attention focused on it.  We had decided that we would give particular attention to the individual cases of political prisoners and those who, in many cases, are not as well known as Mr. Tsikhanouskaya and the others who were sentenced today.  I have reacted publicly in the past few hours to the sentences today.  I expect that others in the system and our representative and spokesperson will probably be doing the same.  We can expect quite a strong reaction from the European Union.  However, we should also remember that we are talking here about people.  I mentioned earlier the practice of the adopting of individual prisoners by members of parliaments in member states.  It is very good at maintaining contact with those prisoners, insofar as it can be done.  It is important for their morale that they hear the support, and not just that the support is happening, because the regime will try to stop them getting the news of the support, but that they hear the support that there is around the world.  We will do everything we can to get them released.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I welcome from the HSE Mr. Michael Fitzgerald, chief officer, community health organisation, CHO, 4; Mr. Jim Ryan, head of operations, mental health services, HSE community operations; Mr. Mark Kane, HSE estates; Mr. Kevin Morrison, acting head of mental health services; and Dr. Sinead O'Brien, executive clinical director, Cork mental health services.</p> <p>  Before the opening statements, I must point out to our witnesses that there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege will apply to your evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.

We thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss Owenacurra with it.  I apologise for last week.  We were in the middle of a red alert in counties Cork and Kerry.  Colleagues, including myself, were quite busy throughout that day, as members can imagine, ensuring that patients, residents, staff and our premises were intact and safe during the course of that spell.  We apologies for that, but it was a weather piece that we obviously could not avoid.  I wanted to mention that before I commenced.</p><p>As the Chairman outlined, I am joined by Mr. Jim Ryan, head of operations, mental health services; Dr. Sinead O'Brien, executive clinical director of Cork mental health services and consultant psychiatrist; Mr. Mark Kane, assistant national director of HSE estates; and Mr. Kevin Morrison, acting head of mental health services, Cork Kerry Community Healthcare.</p><p> The Owenacurra centre is a mental health services continuing care unit in Midleton, County Cork.  It is registered with the Mental Health Commission to provide a service for 24 people for psychiatry of later life, continuing mental health care and mental health rehabilitation.  There are currently 15 people resident in the centre.  Cork Kerry Community Healthcare advised the mental health subcommittee in its hearing on 21 September 2021 of the difficult decision taken in June to begin the process of ceasing services at the Owenacurra centre.</p><p> The background to the decision was that it became clear following an assessment of the information available that the current building environment and layout did not allow for the needs of a modern residential centre.  The centre had also been criticised by the regulator on a number of occasions.  Initially, the plan was to refurbish the centre but, as we moved to the more detailed planning stage, serious concerns emerged that any level of such refurbishment could not bring the building to the standard required.  Advice from external construction experts, along with HSE estates, which was shared with the committee previously, informed the HSE in its difficult but necessary decision to close the centre.  This was not our original plan for the valuable services at the Owenacurra centre and, although it was a difficult decision, there was no other option open to us.</p><p> The immediate priority remains the welfare of the remaining residents of the centre.  We have been working and continue to work with each resident individually and to consult their families to agree an appropriate alternative placement based on their assessed needs and will and preference.  Residents will be moving on a phased basis and the planning on that work is ongoing.  Discussions with residents and their families are led by a consultant psychiatrist and multidisciplinary team.  Specific meetings with family members continue at this time as suitable placements are being identified.  In order to keep residents and families informed throughout the process, a key contact lead is available to support and act as a facilitator between residents, their families and the project team.</p><p> A residential-type setting for several residents is being sought locally to provide a supported model of living which may, with some further rehabilitation, suit the needs of some residents in the medium term.  It is important to state the emphasis is on supporting people with mental health needs to remain independently living, where possible, in their own homes and communities.  There is an extensive community-based service operating in the local area, including a home-based treatment team and multiple specialist services.  A possible location has been identified to restore the day service in the town and negotiations are under way in respect of specific premises.</p><p> When it has been vacated, the Owenacurra site will be used to build supported living accommodation for mental health service users.  Discussions have commenced with the local authority to explore options in that regard.  These discussions are at an early stage and we will proceed with developing proposals to this end in the coming months.</p><p> The closure of any centre, particularly one that provides residential care to service users, causes concern and uncertainty for residents and families.  We understand that the Owenacurra centre has provided a valuable service to residents in a unique location for many years.  The HSE, however, is committed to working closely with the residents to find appropriate alternatives suitable to their needs.  The original timescale for the closure of the centre was six months.  This has been extended to ensure additional time is provided for the transition of residents to the appropriate settings.</p></speech>

As the Chairman is aware, this centre is in my town.  I have been familiar with it for a very long time.  I personally knew many residents who lived there, some of whom are no longer with us.  I have been to the centre on many occasions, so I know it quite well.</p> <p>  I am on record as stating that this situation could have been handled far better.  The fact that it was to close in October and, obviously, there was no plan for the residents, as has now been evidenced, led to a lot of angst, disquiet, worry and so on among families and residents.</p><p>I think that is acknowledged by everybody involved.  It could have been handled much better.</p><p> I wish to ask Dr. O'Brien a question about the kind of service that is currently being provided in the centre.  It is a 24-hour staffed service.  If the centre were not to close, would the service continue?  Are there many other places in Cork or elsewhere in the country where such a service is currently being provided?</p></speech>

The continuing care service that is operating in the Owenacurra centre would have continued for a period because, obviously, we were not aware of the scale of the premises issues.  However, it is fair to say that we have seen that, over time, there has been a decrease in the requirement for continuing care facilities as more people who have severe and enduring mental illness have the benefits of services such as early intervention in psychosis and rehabilitation psychiatry teams and, therefore, more people are able to live their lives in the community with support.  As outlined in A Vision for Change, the number of people requiring continuing care residences is expected to decline over time.  We also have high-support hostels in the county and these provide a model of 24-7 supportive care.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.149" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sinead O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121400002#C00400"><p>The first key difference is the level of staffing in a continuing care unit.  For example, in the Owenacurra centre there are four staff on duty.  That staffing level was increased due to concern relating to the premises.  In a high-support hostel, however, there are two nurses by day and one nurse by night with a health care assistant.  The level of staffing reflects the degree of support individuals need.  Although we focus on the great work our nursing colleagues provide, I must emphasise the importance of a full multidisciplinary team because individuals need to benefit from other disciplines such as social work, occupational therapy and clinical psychology.  We have the advantage of a new rehabilitation psychiatry team being introduced for Cork, which is most welcome and will, no doubt, benefit individuals in both the continuing care units and the high-support hostels.</p></speech>

All present would agree with her that the best practice is for people to be looked after in their communities and homes for as long as possible.  These are settings with which they are familiar.  What is the level of need for a centre such as that in Owenacurra in a large area such as east Cork which covers, as she knows as well as I do, the towns of Youghal, Midleton and Cobh, right up as far as Glenville?  It is an area the size of some small counties and has a similar population.  Will there be a need for a centre such as Owenacurra providing the kind of service it is providing in east Cork and keeping people close to their own communities with which they are familiar?</p></speech>

We need access to be within a reasonable distance.  As regards where our current continuing care facilities are located, we have the St. Stephen's campus and St. Catherine's, which is located at St. Finbarr's Hospital, and then we have high-support hostels throughout the county.  I think it-----</p></speech>

I wish to focus on east Cork.  Am I right in saying that if the centre at Owenacurra closes, the nearest facility will be St. Stephen's Hospital?  As Dr. O'Brien is aware, St. Stephen's is in a rural area far from any town centre.  At the Owenacurra centre, the residents are familiar with the town centre.</p><p>They can walk up and down the street.  I have met and know many of them.  They engage me on the street regularly.  They are there with their friends, neighbours and so on.  It is familiar to them.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the difference between what is happening in Owenacurra at the moment and what might happen in St. Stephen's.  Is there any plan, or any need, to have a centre such as Owenacurra in east Cork, covering areas such as Youghal?  It is a long distance from Youghal to St. Stephen's for families and others.</p></speech>

It is important that all the people of Cork have access to services in a timely manner and that all our facilities are available to everyone.  It is important to focus on community integration.  The Deputy quite rightly pointed out that the St. Stephen's campus is on the outskirts of Glanmire.  However, we have a therapy programme which includes our own transport to allow people to integrate within the Glanmire area and further afield for outings.  That would be-----</p></speech>

I am concerned about east Cork and large towns such as Midleton, Youghal and Cobh, as well as all the small towns in between that will not have a service.  What Dr. O'Brien is saying, if I heard her correctly, is that the service will be moved to Glanmire.  That is not acceptable to the people or the taxpayers of east Cork who I represent.  We want a service like the one being provided in Owenacurra at the moment and envisaged for St. Stephen's to be provided in east Cork.  In other words, we must keep services like Owenacurra going.  Dr. O'Brien said that the numbers and the need will be reduced but the need will still be there.</p></speech>

There will be many different sites, not just St. Stephen's campus, where services will be available and where rehabilitation will be focused on enabling people to move on with support, depending on individual needs, to the community.</p></speech>

There is ongoing negotiation with regard to the arrangements around that centre.  We hope to close off that arrangement, all going well, over the coming weeks.  If we are in that position, we would hope to open in the first quarter of next year.  We would obviously have to open it in the context of the current Covid restrictions but that is the case for all services, as we well know.</p></speech>

Dr. O'Brien mentioned the reasonable distance for services.  There is St. Catherine's ward in Cork city and St. Stephen's Hospital, Glanmire, is very rural.  There are also services in Kanturk, Mallow, Fermoy, Macroom, the Western Road, Cork, Blackrock, Cork, and two places in Skibbereen.  It is farcical that we will have no services in east Cork.  I have a basic question for whoever can answer it.  Has the HSE bought a premises in Carrigaline that is being refurbished at the moment?  That is a "Yes" or "No" question.  Why the HSE has not invested in a premises in Midleton is beyond me.  Dr. O'Brien mentioned that there is a decrease in demand for services.  There will never be a decrease in any area.  In our current Covid pandemic, the demand for mental health services has gone off the Richter scale.  People will get sick no matter what you do.  The services are not being fully resourced.  It is very timely that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, announced &euro;500,000 for mental health day services in east Cork this morning.  That is pretty good timing.  What will that be spent on?  The HSE does not have a plan.  It is a secret when it comes to the day services and what building it is going for.  The people watching this meeting this morning need to know whether that centre is closing.  If it is, will there be 24-7 respite care services in east Cork and the Midleton area, serving from Youghal up towards the city, including Cobh and Carrigtohill?  Is that going to happen?  If not, the HSE should let us know now because this will end up a talking shop and I do not want that.  My biggest fear is that when the services are gone, they are gone.  I submitted nine parliamentary questions on this issue.  Luckily, I got the replies yesterday.  Each one of these questions was different but six of those nine have an identical response and the other three are also identical to one another.  In other words, the answers are being copied and pasted.  Even we as public representatives are not getting replies to the questions we are asking on behalf of the families and residents in that centre or the people we represent in east Cork.  It is very disappointing.  Did the HSE buy a premises in Carrigaline and is it refurbishing it?</p></speech>

The HSE's opening statement mentioned A Vision for Change.  We have a catchment area of over 94,000 people in east Cork.  The HSE is obliged to provide a service when areas reach around 100,000 people.  We are fairly close to that and yet it is moving services back into the city, even to the far side of the city, and there is no mention of east Cork or Midleton.  I cannot fathom that.  Mr. Fitzgerald also mentioned discussions with families.  One person - I will obviously not mention names - told me that they were due to have their third meeting with the HSE today.  They asked in advance who would be present and again they got no information.  There is something happening there.  I have also been informed that there is no cohesion between family members and residents in the centre.</p><p>They are not being met together.  I do not know what is happening with the communication there.</p><p> There is another thing I want to find out.  Mr. Fitzgerald said the building was not fit for purpose in July, yet did he say there are 15 residents there?  We now have July, August, September, October, November and December and it seems it is still fit for purpose and the HSE can magically cure the building defects by putting in extra staff.  I do not accept that.  That is why I am very angry.  I cannot understand why everything seems to be moving away from east Cork.  I cannot believe it.  I refer to Kanturk and public transport.  Many of these people are elderly.  The HSE is taking away these people's freedom.  No matter what the HSE says, it just keeps coming up with excuses to the effect that it is doing X, Y and Z, everything will be great and it will put in more of this, that and the other but it is not putting it into the pot in east Cork.  That is what I am trying to say.  It is going from Cork city all the way over to north Cork.  The east Cork catchment area all the way down to the Waterford border is huge and we will be left with no services.</p><p> I will ask three simple questions.  First, because I want the people outside of the committee to listen and to hear what the witnesses' answer is, will the Owenacurra centre close indefinitely with the loss of all the respite beds?  Second, when will the HSE replace those respite beds in Midleton to serve the people of east Cork?  If it will not do so, why not?  Third, I appeal to the other Deputies here because there are Deputies at this meeting who are part of the Government and I am blue in the face from raising this with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly.  I ask those Deputies to go back to their party representatives and to appeal on behalf of the people of east Cork to keep the services there open.  It is not the building; it is the service itself.  We all know - let us be honest and call a spade a spade - that if those long-term respite beds are gone, they are gone.  The witnesses should not tell us that fewer people are getting sick and that there will be less demand on services.  That is an absolute crapshow.  My God, if we could predict this, we would have a lot of things cured, whether dental services or GP services, so the witnesses should not spin that to people.</p><p> Finally, I cannot figure out how the HSE can go and find the money for a building, purchase it and start refurbishing it on the north side of the city, again miles away from east Cork, yet it could not find a suitable site in Midleton or even carry out works on the same site.  It could have probably put in temporary respite beds in Youghal and Fermoy because the demand for these services will always remain but it just chose to say, "No, we will close it."  I mean no disrespect to the previous speaker.  Yes, putting in community living for the elderly is a brilliant idea but if the HSE cannot find the money to refurbish a place, I do not know where it will find the money to start building houses for these people.</p><p> I ask the witnesses to answer my questions honestly if they can.  Are these services in Midleton to go?  Are they coming back?  Will they be replaced?  I do not think they will be.  I do not want the people in east Cork or Midleton or those people with residents in that centre to waste their good energy asking for it to be kept open if the HSE has made up its mind to shut it.</p><p> I know I have three minutes left.  I might come back in.</p></speech>

The Deputy raised a couple of issues.  The service that has been provided in the Owenacurra centre and that was registered with the Mental Health Commission was for continuing care and rehabilitation purposes.  Our intention is that we will re-provide the day services in the town and, as I said earlier, we are actively pursuing that at this point in time.</p></speech>

I hear the Deputy's concern, though, about continuing care and rehabilitation required for inpatients.  We hear that very clearly.  The reality is that we need development in the greater Cork area for good centres and good, appropriate beds in order that we can deliver that to what will be a decreasing number of people who will need that level of specialist service.  We have already developed our thoughts as to how and where we have to do that.  Going back to what Dr. O'Brien said earlier, we have to take the broader Cork area into account.  We have to look at the specialist-led services we are providing.  We have very much a community model to provide to the broad community.  It is also important to say that that is in line not just with mental health services but with other areas.  The east Cork areas the Deputy has talked about form a community healthcare network area where we are providing additional services in primary care, chronic disease and older persons' services in general.  Again, the model is one whereby we bring the service locally, there are specialised teams and it is supported and provided or led by consultants.  That is the model with which mental health services fit exactly.</p></speech>

Thank you, Chair, and I thank Mr. Fitzgerald again for his reply.  My fear is that while everything looks very well in plans and on paper, Mr. Fitzgerald said the services are consultant-led.  We have problems with recruitment of consultants and so on at the moment.  My biggest fear, therefore, is that east Cork will lose its vital services and that the HSE is trying to fix something that is not broken.  Now we realise we will not even have something to fix and the people of east Cork will be left behind.  I understand the role and the model the HSE must follow but my point is that we have lost that vital service in Midleton and it is not coming back.  Anyone who wants to access those services in the east Cork area will now have to go into the city or north Cork.  If that is a good model and practice, we are in trouble and we will be in trouble in the future.  I am disappointed.  You do not get everything you want every day but I thank Mr. Fitzgerald for his honesty and the reply to my contribution.  The people in Midleton and east Cork need to know that that centre will close and that that respite care is gone.</p> <p>  Thank you, Chair, for your patience.</p></speech>

It is extraordinarily serious.  Mr. Fitzgerald and the representatives here with him from the HSE are very aware of just how concerned all of us in the constituency of Cork East are by what the HSE is trying to do in Midleton.  I wish once again to express here today, as I have done both internally at our recent Oireachtas Members' health forum held in Ballincollig and previously at the committee, my extraordinary concern at the loss of this service in the Midleton area.  The Owenacurra centre is an incredibly important supervised centre for residential mental healthcare.  It is a facility that is deeply important to the availability of immediate mental healthcare services in the Midleton area, and I would be very concerned if the HSE were to withdraw it from the area for a number of reasons but particularly given the information that has come to light in recent days.  We are told on the one hand that the HSE is moving away from this model yet, on the other, when you go down to Cork South-Central and look at what is happening in Carrigaline, there are other residential centres being financed by the HSE.  I have a problem with that.</p><p>I have a problem with an area the size of east Cork being left with no residential mental healthcare service.  It is unacceptable.  I have outlined this to the HSE previously.  A number of suggestions I have made to it include purchasing residential houses to provide care in the community.  However, my understanding is it will only be getting one house, which will provide nowhere near the number of beds required given the existing level of demand in the Midleton area.  This is a concern.</p><p> Another concern is communication with the families.  I am hearing about many mixed messages from those with whom I am engaging.  That is not good enough.  The announcement was originally made just before the D&aacute;il went into recess, and it is not fair on the residents of the Owenacurra centre that the situation has been playing out in this way for the past six months.  Even if the HSE presented a plan for closure, the style in which the situation has been managed is unacceptable.  That is wrong given the circumstances of the service users involved.</p><p> I have heard, as I am sure all here have, many concerns from residents' family members about where people will be relocated to.  I wish to ask for a couple of points of clarification about the statistics.  I will revert with a further round of questions later.  How many service users' families has the HSE some degree of agreement with about relocating their family members?  How many residents are in the centre today?</p></speech>

As of today, there are 15 residents in Owenacurra.  Two individuals are expected to move within the next week.  I have been part of some of the family meetings with the core multidisciplinary team, including consultants and psychiatrists, responsible for the centre, and Dr. Ruth Collins, the clinical director of the north Lee mental health services, has been present at others.  We have had open and honest discussions with families and have met families and the residents when the residents wanted that to be the format.  In terms of each individual, we have discussed the clinical recommendations and personal preferences, and we have agreed with the family the type of service that would best meet that individual's needs.  Of the original 19 residents, six will be moving towards nursing home care, nine will require high-support hostel-type care and a further four individuals are expected-----</p></speech>

We heard at the Oireachtas forum that the HSE was willing to utilise the site for future mental health services.  Six months on, surely someone at this meeting will clarify whether rebuilding a fit-for-purpose Owenacurra Centre with full-time residential care and the same level of assistance that is provided at the current centre is a possibility.  If it is not, will one of the witnesses explain why that is so?</p></speech>

We have rooms at that facility that are 7.5 sq. m, but we all know the current standards would require something like rooms of 22 sq. m.  There is a gulf between the existing accommodation and the accommodation that is needed.  This is why there is such a significant uplift to be done.  No one at this meeting would want us to reinvest in a building that would afterwards still fall far short of what was needed from a standards perspective.  Under the current standards, we would have to go from 1,050 sq. m to 2,000 sq. m, and that 2,000 sq. m would still not include elements like the day unit, external therapy spaces or the external support accommodation that was required.  We also have to provide elements like public and staff parking spaces, etc.  When we consider the matter in the round and given the size and appropriateness of the building that is needed, site constraints would prohibit such a building on that campus.  We have reviewed the matter and this is the strong conclusion to which we have come.</p></speech>

I believe it has actually identified a location.  As Mr. Kane knows well, I am talking about a residential mental healthcare service that has 24-hour staffing and supervision.  If the square footage of the site is an issue, no one would be disappointed or upset at reducing the current number of beds by a fraction to accommodate the construction there of a new, purpose-built residential facility.  How many rooms are in the Owenacurra centre?  Dr. O'Brien has the answer.</p></speech>

Again, I will stress that this does not look at things like external therapy spaces.  It certainly does not look at anything by way of the day service that is currently on that campus as well.  Specifically, with regard to residential accommodation to an appropriate standard, it is circa eight to ten bedrooms.</p></speech>

It is very hard to figure out what exactly the motivation is for this change in service and what would seem to be a significant reduction in services at a time there is generally a greater recognition of the need for improving rather than disimproving them.</p> <p>  What families want and are looking for in the main is a building that will be brought up to a good enough standard.  They are not looking for state-of-the-art facilities.  Very often, when organisations are trying to change things to suit themselves, we see that the best is the enemy of the good.  We are told that something is not perfect and not state of the art so we must change it.  We are not looking for state of the art.  We are, however, looking for a decent service and improvements to be introduced to the existing services.  I find it very hard to understand why exactly the HSE is closing down this service.</p> <p>  The point has been made about the 15 existing residents.  We are told that six are moving towards nursing home care.  What does moving towards nursing home care mean?  We are told that nine are going into high-support hostels.  That is not what the people themselves or their families want.  There is an obvious saving in staff.  One cannot help but think this is part of the motivation and that rather than meeting the needs of people with significant dependencies in the mental health area within east Cork, the HSE is forcing people to fit into its requirements.  I cannot help but think that is what is motivating this.</p> <p>  I want to address a couple of questions to Mr. Morrison.  In June, when he was announcing the closure, he said, "the centre must close because the building is not suitable and cannot be brought to the standard needed and that you deserve."  He went on to say that "as we started planning for a refurbishment, it also became clear the work would not be enough to bring the building to the standard quite rightly required by the Mental Health Commission."  In a letter to the Taoiseach's office in July, he stated, "... no matter what refurbishment takes place, the building could not meet either building standards or the high standards set by the Mental Health Commission ..."</p> <p>  A strong impression is being given to residents and their families and to public representatives that the commission's concerns played a large part in the closure decision.</p><p>It is also implied that other facilities are of a better standard yet some alternative facilities can involve dormitory-style accommodation in ward-based settings, for example, St. Stephen's Hospital and St. Catherine's ward.  How does Mr. Morrison reconcile those communications with the reality of those alternative placements where the HSE is proposing to move people from what are essentially single and, in some cases, small rooms to dormitory-style accommodations in St. Stephen's Hospital and St. Catherine's ward?</p></speech>

We came into this from the perspective of looking to see whether we could refurbish the building.  I will defer to my colleague in a second with regard to the detail of that.

This is an approved centre.  It has been criticised and that is a matter of public record in the context of the Mental Health Commission's reports.  The Deputy will have noted that in the last of the Mental Health Commission's reports, the size of the bedrooms was specifically mentioned and a number of other criticisms were made of this particular facility.  In briefings and in answers to parliamentary questions, the criticisms of the Mental Health Commission were taken into account.  However, the most important piece, as I outlined to the Deputy in my answer to the last question, was the fact that we had independent assessments in respect of the building.  These indicated that no matter what we did with the building, it could not be brought up to an appropriate standard to deliver the service that we wanted to provide there.</p></speech>

The HSE does not appear to have specific proposals for the use of the site.  There is general talk about the possibility of housing.

It is our intention that we want to provide the type of independent supported living that we talked about.  That, along with the supports we intend to put in and actually have in place at the moment in east Cork, is what we feel to be sufficient to meet the needs of the particular area.  If we need a long-stay continuing care facility, it will have to be across a greater geography than just east Cork.  Up the main road from us, which is only 15 to 20 minutes away, we have a very substantive HSE-owned site at St. Stephen&rsquo;s.  The St. Stephen's centre, and the Deputy is correct as she mentioned these a little earlier, certainly struggles from a compliance perspective and does not have all of the services in the proper environment that we would like.  Our intention would be to replace the unit in St. Stephen&rsquo;s, which would then be used as a facility for a broader part of the area in the context of the provision of continuing care.</p></speech>

Can I take it from that then that the HSE&rsquo;s plan for east Cork is to have zero residential facilities and to move people to St. Stephen&rsquo;s facility?  That seems to be what the HSE is saying, namely, that it sees no qualitative difference between that and long-stay hostels and that it has no intention of replacing these residential places.  The reason I ask is because that is directly in conflict with the Sharing the Vision policy, which suggests that one needs three sites with around ten placements for a population of that area.  The previous speaker was not able to give that number, but I have it and it is three sites of ten placements for that population size.  Is Mr. Fitzgerald saying that the plans that the HSE has are directly in conflict with Sharing the Vision.</p></speech>

I do not wish to cut across Mr. Kane but I have read all of the reports.  As he may know, I worked in this area in the past.  I appreciate the amount of information that he has provided.

The Deputy will appreciate this point having worked in the sector previously.  One of the most fundamental things that would have to be issued in advance of anybody carrying out an assessment is obviously a brief.  The latter is what we measure the assessment against.  It would be very difficult to develop a brief in respect of Owenacurra Centre when we-----</p></speech>

We have talked a great deal today about the size of the building and about room sizes.  In some of the building reports we were furnished with, the room sizes are listed differently and various numbers are given.  The request from the families was to carry out a review of the veracity of the claims made in the report,  That review was denied.  I do not think it is an unreasonable request considering that there are various pieces of information that are at odds with each other have been provided.  It would be fairly standard and par for the course that there would be a review of the building reports.</p><p>If Mr. Kane wants to continue, I would like to take him up on his discussion around the future of the site.  I would like to understand the figures he gave us in terms of occupancy.  Are those numbers run for a 24-bed site or for a 15-bed site?  It is completely unclear.  I would also like to understand if the calculations were done on the basis of a single-storey building.   That would probably be extraordinary in this setting.</p><p> As estates manager, perhaps Mr. Kane can address the issue of the size of rooms.  He and I both know there is no statutory requirement in respect of the size of a room in a nursing home or residential care facility.  I know that because I am trying to have it made a statutory requirement.  We can have best practice but it is not enforceable.  Saol Nua in Skibbereen has smaller rooms.  Is the HSE intending to close Saol Nua?</p></speech>

The idea that we would always have single-storey buildings is extraordinary.  I have never come across it.  The benefit to people who have mental health difficulties of a site that is in the centre of a town would be significant.  I cannot understand the choice to make that single-storey calculation.</p> <p>  I want to move on to the Mental Health Commission report.  The HSE has said in a lot of its correspondence with me through parliamentary questions and in other documents that the decision was made in June.  The Mental Health Commission reviewed the building in February.  When it came back in June, nothing had been addressed.  I am wondering if the decision was really taken in June.  Otherwise, surely there would have been action on some of the issue the commission raised.  Where does this leave us with the Mental Health Commission?  It is interesting that it declined to come to this session.  The HSE has effectively weaponised its report.  In no place did it say we should be closing Owenacurra.  It said it was not fit for purpose but it said that about many other facilities.  I would say there are very few facilities in Ireland that actually meet the requirements of mental health residential care.  If we held every mental health facility in the country to the standards to which the HSE is holding Owenacurra, we would have a tsunami of closures.</p></speech>

In respect of when decisions were made, I will hand over to my service colleagues.  Before I do so, it is important to note two critical points.  The Mental Health Commission described the premises in Owenacurra as a critical risk.  We have very few facilities containing bedrooms of 7.5 sq. m. with no en suites.

We are working on two fronts in respect of that.  First is to replace where we can some of those units and, second, in the interim to do works that would maintain them and keep them at some level of ongoing delivery of service.  Those are two important pieces of it.</p> <p>  In the context of the Owenacurra Centre, taking account of the information that became available to us and considering what we could or could not do in terms of the future, I took the decision that we would cease the service in Owenacurra in its current state.  In fairness if the Deputy takes a view of Owenacurra, there were day services provided at the centre of it, there were offices for staff and a variety of therapeutic services ongoing inside in the middle of where people lived.  When we hear of the small rooms without an en suite, when we know and see the type of building that it is-----</p></speech>

I do not claim to know all the complexities of this issue.  I gather there is a situation where we have a unit in Midleton and residents have been there for decades in some cases.  It is largely a successful place where people can live their lives and so forth.</p><p>There is obviously a lot of emotion attached to that, whether people are residents or a relative of a resident.  My understanding from the last number of months, when I got to know this issue, although it has gone on for much longer, is that the HSE intends to close the facility and does not have an alternative as such, so the residents will be divided and allocated to other locations.  That is an extremely traumatic situation for the residents and their relatives.</p><p> My main question is this: is the closure of Owenacurra final?  Is that the final decision or can this be reviewed again in regard to an alternative for the residents?  Is there any alternative facility in the vicinity of Owenacurra?  That is my first question and I will ask a second question after that.</p></speech>

We did not take that decision lightly, as I said in my opening statement, but on the basis of the various reasons that I outlined.  The condition of the building was the main concern we had.  When it came to the spending of money on it, we could not guarantee that we could bring it up to a standard that would pass muster into the future.  That is the reality.</p> <p>  The second piece concerns the residents.  The Deputy is right that it is difficult for the residents and we completely appreciate that.  There are people who have lived for a long time in that residential setting.  As Dr. O'Brien said, we are working with each of those residents very carefully and with their families as well.  Of course, it is very traumatic and we are working with them in terms of an appropriate placement, some for nursing home care and some for high-support hospital care.  It is hoped that some people, with more intensive rehabilitation, will be able to return to more independent living.  For that purpose, we are examining at least one residential setting that we would like to have as a start-off in the town.  We could bring people there, if they so choose and if they have the ability to do so, in order to again commence independent living.  As we said, we would also be working with the local authority to replace the unit for the purposes of independent living into the future.</p></speech>

Obviously, the 15 residents have been there, some for a very long time, but they cannot be on these calls.  What are their thoughts on the issue of Owenacurra closing down?  At the end of the day, that is the important voice in all of this debate.  Has the HSE talked to the residents about the fact that the facility is going to close in the very near future and that this is the alternative?  What do the residents think about the decision to close Owenacurra?</p></speech>

Yes, the residents expressed shock initially, when the announcement was made.  We have had a series of meetings with the families and there are very constructive meetings around discussing the real options in terms of alternative accommodation and the support services that will be in place for each of the individuals, based on their assessed needs.  That is an ongoing process.  I accept that the announcement was not an expected announcement, and the families and the residents have been working very constructively with the team in terms of finding the best solution to meet the assessed needs of each individual.</p></speech>

This is a policy matter.  I am asking where it came from.  Who was driving it in the beginning?  When was it first mooted?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.336" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121400002#R00500"><p>The concern was raised.  Initially, we were considering that we would refurbish this unit and at least keep it going and bring it up to some level of standard.  When we were able to see the totality of information from the professionals who examined the centre and bring totality on all of the different aspects from the perspective of fire protection and the fabric of the buildings within the total environment, it became clear that if we were to continue to invest in it, we could not guarantee that it would be brought to a place where it would be fit for purpose or that it would not be found wanting.  That is what emerged in the course of that work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121400002#R00600"><p>How did that change of mind take place?  Originally, it was intended to carry on, to refurbish and to upgrade insofar as was possible, and to continue providing services.  That changed as a result of what?  I am not as familiar with Owenacurra as I would like to be but I am familiar with the procedures that apply in such circumstances.  I would like to know who decided, &ldquo;Sorry, we are going to change the whole system, we are going to shift this around, we are going to put it to a different use altogether and do whatever else we are going to do with it.&rdquo;</p> <p>  In addition, what is the long-term intention?  Anything I have heard so for is not in concert with what I would regard as the long-term intentions for that site.  That is an added question.  What are the long-term intentions?</p></speech>

It came to the position where I decided, as I am the chief officer for the CHO and I take responsibility for these particular services, that we were not in a position to invest additional funding into this unit because it was not fit for purpose and we could not make it fit for purpose, regardless of what investment we could put into it.</p> <p>  To answer the second question-----</p></speech>

We had a condition survey carried out of the premises.  That was done by way of an independent building surveying consultancy that is internationally recognised, and they applied an internationally recognised approach to their assessment.  They would have identified some of the mechanical and electrical services within the building as being what they describe as either a condition C or a condition D.  To put that in English, condition C is for systems that are defined as &ldquo;poor condition with evidence of major defects&rdquo; and condition D is defined as an &ldquo;unacceptable condition&rdquo;.  For example, certain mechanical and electrical systems - some of the electrical distribution, some of the heating, some of the hot water systems and some of the building fabric itself - would have ranked at C or D when we had it independently recognised.</p><p>That is part of the decision-making criteria that we would have fed back to our colleagues in mental health.</p><p> We would have also carried out - to address one of the points the Deputy is making on the grounds of fire and fire safety and the building fabric - an asbestos survey.  Given the age of the building - it is a Roh-Fab building which was built in the very early 1970s - it would have been developed and constructed at a time when asbestos was a reasonably commonly used building material.  As a result, we identified elements of asbestos in the building as well which are being managed safely today.  If there is any work to be done and it is disrupted, it causes a significant risk in the context of how we manage the dispersal of asbestos.</p></speech>

There is asbestos in many buildings and it is being extracted under strict safety guidelines that are in operation all the time.</p> <p>  I will end with this.  There are many old buildings throughout the country that were previously semi-derelict and that have been converted in recent years.  Some have been converted into housing accommodation, hotels and various other alternatives.  This was done satisfactorily and with all the grounds necessary kept in mind.  Is there something relating to Owenacurra Centre that would not apply to all these other buildings?  I go back to my original question.  What are the long-term intentions for Owenacurra Centre?  What else will happen in the area that might affect its long-term use.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.344" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Kane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121400002#S00300"><p>I will answer the first part and then hand over to my colleagues for the question on long-term position.  Deputy Durkan is correct.  The HSE has brought a number of its older buildings back into use.  I cannot ignore that this is a Roh-Fab building and the fact that it was envisaged to have a lifetime of 40 to 50 years.  We are now at the outer end of that and the building, in the context of its fabric and structure, has reached the end of its useful life.  We have workhouse buildings that were constructed using cut-stone granite.  These are much more robust and have greater longevity and that is why they are being reinvested in.  We can invest in them with a level of certainty.  Unfortunately, when I look at documents such as the climate action plan, I will not be able to bring a Roh-Fab building in line with current climate action requirements, as outlined by the Government.  A significant amount of the mechanical and electrical system are at their end of useful life, as independently confirmed for us.</p> <p>  When you look at Owenacurra Centre in the round and consider the unacceptable deficiencies in the accommodation with 7.5 m2 bedrooms that do not have en suites, the level of investment that would be needed in order to bring the building fabric and the mechanical and electrical elements to a reasonable standard, the age of the building, how it was constructed and the fact that it is beyond the end of its useful life the restricted size of the site, all the essential systems, such as those relating to heating, electrics, etc., being at their end of useful life and the premises falling short in terms of what is needed, those are the considerations that probably set Owenacurra Centre apart from some of the other buildings Deputy Durkan quite rightly refers to that are even older but that we have invested in.  I will hand over, maybe to Mr. Fitzgerald and colleagues, for the second part.</p></speech>

We have already had preliminary discussions with the local authority, and we will be engaging with it and with the approved housing bodies in relation to bringing that plan to fruition.</p></speech>

It gave the committee members an significant insight into the impact this closure would have on the residents and what was ahead for them.</p><p> I am conscious that we have not heard from the residents directly in these Oireachtas meetings so far.  I want to highlight the wonderful work that the broadcaster, Mr. P.J. Coogan, did.  I would recommend that anybody who is watching here today look it up.  Mr. Coogan interviewed the residents and their families.  I believe Mr. Coogan won an award for these interviews.  I would recommend anybody, including anybody from the HSE, to listen to those because it was such a huge impact on those families and the residents.</p><p> I am also aware that the families of Owenacurra are mindful of the many other families who require these respite and long-stay placements for their loved ones in east Cork.  These families, who have been in contact with us, want us to focus on the broader service loss to the region going forward.</p><p> I am conscious I have not got a huge about of time but I have a few questions.  The first question I would like to ask our witnesses today is, do they agree that people who require the framework of a 24-hour staffed residential placement have the right to live in their own community?  The importance of the residents living in their own community was highly stressed in that programme by Mr. Coogan.  They are able to go out their door.  They are able to walk down the street in their own community.  They are welcomed into shops and into the library.  They feel at home there.  Do the witnesses agree that people who require the framework of a 24-hour staffed residential placement have the right to live in their own community?</p></speech>

It is of such importance that each individual is supported to live as independently as possible with a focus on quality of life.  We are committed to delivering on the model of care, as outlined in A Vision for Change, where people have early intervention and access to rehabilitation teams.  It has been recognised that early intervention can result in recovery.  We all know that recovery is not a single point; it is a journey.  It is important that people have that support over a period of time.</p> <p>  It is recognised that some individuals will need focused residential rehabilitation.  The focus is very much on rehabilitation and having the advantage of experts from different disciplines, such as social work, occupational therapy, psychology, clinical nurse-----</p></speech>

Why are they being taken out of east Cork?</p> <p>  Mr. Fitzgerald stated that it is only down the road.  It is half an hour down the road for those residents.</p><p>It is a good distance.  They cannot just walk out of their home and go down to the shops.  I am very concerned about that.  I will move onto another question on that issue.  There was a Mental Health Commission inspection of St. Stephen's Hospital and one of the alternative facilities for east Cork service users who require long-term placement.  The 2021 inspection report has not yet been published but some Owenacurra centre families are keen to know what the compliance rating for St. Stephen's Hospital was and what issues were raised by the commission as concerns or reasons for enforcement action.  Will Dr. O'Brien please talk us through those issues?</p></speech>

Obviously, I need to be very conscious of the confidentiality of the individuals concerned.  The St. Stephen's campus is only being considered for a very small number.  In fact, only one resident has expressed a wish to go to that campus.  It is not actually being suggested as a suitable location based on individuals' assessed needs.  That is very individualised.  As we said earlier, we recognise that the premises in St. Stephen's Hospital needs significant investment.  We hope that can be provided over the coming years.  With regard to the individuals in the Owenacurra centre, I cannot stress enough that there has been a multidisciplinary assessment.  Each individual has had nine assessments to determine the level of support and expertise they need to live a life they have identified as what they would like.  They have had significant input in deciding where they would like to be based.</p></speech>

There are three community residences in the area, one each in Fermoy, Mallow and Kanturk.  Each residence is staffed 24 hours a day and has 14 single <i>en suite</i>rooms.  That adds up to a total of 42 rooms for a population similar in size to that of east Cork.  There is a waiting list for these north Cork residences.  I understand that people who had previously been placed in ward-based settings in St. Stephen's Hospital, for instance, have been able to move to community-based living in facilities such as those Deputy Hourigan mentioned earlier, like Solas Nua, which is being established in Mallow.</p><p>Does Dr. O'Brien believe the service model in north Cork is progressive?  Why does the HSE not plan to provide a comparable 24-hour staffed service in towns such as Cobh, Carrigtwohill, Midleton or Youghal to serve their local populations into the future?</p></speech>

The Senator quite rightly pointed out that a number of residents who resided in units in St. Stephen's Hospital that are now closed successfully moved out into the community.  There is a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team in north Cork.  The input from that team has allowed people to develop skills that allow them to live more independently.  As it stands, there are some vacancies in the three residences in north Cork which the Senator mentioned.</p></speech>

We also have a weekend nursing service and, therefore, can potentially provide a seven-day service to support people in their homes.  In July of this year, we also increased the number of psychiatry of later life consultants.  The psychiatry of later life model predominantly involves seeing people in their own homes.  People can also be seen in nursing homes to ensure they are supported.  In the first quarter of 2022, the multidisciplinary rehabilitation team will also be working in this area.

It started with my colleague, Deputy Stanton, when he said this has not been handled well to date.  This meeting demonstrates how badly it has been handled and the serious questions that remain.  Is Dr. O'Brien aware that the Mental Health Commission is strong on the issue of out-of-area supports?  Given what that commission has said, how can she justify a situation where somebody in Midleton or Youghal will have to travel at least an hour to get the type of 24-hour support they need and their family will have to travel at least an hour to visit them?</p> <p>  On top of that, there is the type of supports in terms of the staff ratio that exists, for example, in St. Stephen's, which is not to say a word against that facility, compared to the staff ratio in Owenacurra.  One would have to conclude that there is much more attention to clients, patients and residents in Owenacurra.  Does Dr. O'Brien accept she is going against the strong recommendations of the Mental Health Commission by closing this facility?</p></speech>

Dr. O'Brien is telling the committee that she is withdrawing that support from that community in east Cork.  This will only get worse for the HSE.  From what I have heard so far in this committee, this will snowball.  I suggest the HSE changes its position on this rapidly.</p><p>I move on to respite, which has been mentioned here but not to the degree it should have been.

If they need respite, they will have to go at least an hour away from home.  These people may just need respite to give their families a break or so their treatment can be reviewed.  A multidisciplinary team, as Dr. O'Brien mentioned, may recommend that they need respite.  If that happens, they are in a situation where the HSE is facilitating that they go outside the explicit recommendation of the Mental Health Commission and go out of area, which would be beyond an hour.

They worried about family members who are moving from what is clearly their home, where they are comfortable and very much part of the community, to the unknown.  The unknown in some cases could be hostel accommodation.  We need to think about where those individuals are going because there are going to be difficulties.  There is no date for the closure but what happens if a family takes a stand and says that it does not want their family member to move?  What if there is a refusal to move?  Where will the HSE be left in that situation?</p></speech>

Obviously, as Dr. O' Brien said, for confidentiality reasons, we cannot get into the ins and outs of individual cases but up to nine assessments have been undertaken with those affected.  The discussion is predominantly with the people themselves but we are also talking to their families.  I want to reassure the committee that great care is being taken.  When we talk about high-support hostels, we are using terminology that is used for a very specific type of service or facility.  Its usage is long-established.  We did not make up that term.  It is part and parcel of the service.  It is a service provision area where people will go and hopefully have a more independent style of living.  We cannot give up on that goal.  What we said earlier is that some of the people who are resident in the Owenacurra centre today need long-stay care in nursing homes while others will, with support, hopefully be able to become more independent than they are right now.  The future for us has to be that we are making a gain for every person who can, where possible, live independently or live independently with supports in their own home and their own community.  It is in our interests to get this right.  There are two cohorts of people to look after.  There are the current residents but also the current and future users of services.  We must ensure that they are given priority and that we can maintain them so that they do not have to enter into continuing care if that is not necessary.  That is a hugely important aspect of all of this.</p></speech>

Is there an expectation that demand for services will decline in County Cork or in east Cork?  I would have thought that demand was increasing in the context of a growing and an ageing population and demand would be expected to increase rather than decrease, which is why that statement jumped out at me.  Ms O'Brien said that numbers were expected to decline.  Was she talking about numbers at the Owenacurra centre or overall in the area?</p></speech>

The Chairman is quite right that we have seen an increase in overall demand for mental health services.  What I was referring to was the fact that with early intervention and intensive rehabilitation, the numbers requiring continuing care residence is expected to decrease, as outlined in A Vision for Change.  The focus is on supporting people in the community to live as independently as possible, with the appropriate support.  We have seen an increase in demand for services and that is why we have significantly increased the services in east Cork specifically.  We have seen the benefit of the east Cork home treatment team, where people can be seen in their own homes or at a preferred location.</p><p>We have also seen the benefit of the support of the psychiatry of later life team for individuals who are over 65.  We also have a seven-day service nursing service so people can be seen in their own home, seven days a week, if that is what is required.</p></speech>

I do not know the Owenacurra centre or east Cork but I do know that people have rights.  Deputy Buckley has filled me in on what went on in the past.  There seems to have been a failure on the part of the HSE and successive Governments to properly resource the centre and this is coming home to roost now.  It reminds me of a saying that my own nanny used, namely that a stitch in time saves nine.  There has not been any stitching in the Owenacurra centre for a very long time.  Red flags were raised on numerous occasions.  It was reported in 2016 that electrical repairs were needed.  Other reports were prepared that referred to structural concerns and the size of individual rooms.  There has been an absolute failure on the part of the HSE with regard to the centre and there needs to be accountability for that.  I am calling for an independent inquiry to determine how we got to this point.</p> <p>  The residents are being punished because of the failures of the HSE but they are the one group of people that has no say in this whatsoever.  We are moving residents from their own single rooms into six-bed dormitory style rooms in places like Glanmire.  In the context of human rights, do all 15 residents at the centre have family support?  Have all residents seen the alternative accommodation that is being proposed?  I have worked in this area and I believe that moving people from a residential setting that is their home into high-support hostel accommodation is a regressive step.  I ask the witnesses to answer those two questions.</p></speech>

In terms of additional supports, the Irish Advocacy Network provides a weekly service to the Owenacurra centre.  A representative of the network has made herself available to any of the residents or their families who wish to avail of support.</p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's last question on looking at the different options, when options get to an advanced stage residents are getting the chance to look at different facilities.  In fact, some of the residents have gone to see facilities and after reviewing them have informed us that they did not want to take up those places and that opinion has been respected.</p></speech>

She also said that while there is increasing demand for mental health services, there will be a decrease in the demand for the likes of the Owenacurra centre, a 24-7 mental health facility.  At this very moment in time, however, only 5.4% of the overall health budget is directed towards mental health services but Sl&aacute;intecare reckons that 10% of the overall health budget is required.  In that context, I would not be very confident about seeing positive change in the near future.  I would not be very optimistic in that regard.</p><p>Where are the people in east Cork at this moment who need care in the likes of Owenacurra?  Where are they to be placed and do they not have a right to remain and live in their communities?</p></speech>

The national clinical programme for early intervention in psychosis has been piloted in a number of areas, including in Cork, and it has been clearly demonstrated that with early intervention, this can lead to functional and overall recovery.  Investment in these areas is absolutely the way forward and can lead to people living absolutely full lives.  The early intervention in psychosis service is being rolled out in east Cork and people are being supported in a very timely way with the home-based treatment team.  Again, they can be seen on a seven-day basis, which is most welcome.  We are all aware that services need to respond to people on a seven-day basis and not just a five-day basis.</p></speech>

The reality is there will be a need for a 24-hour service encompassing a community mental health facility in east Cork.  With the closing of Owenacurra, it means the service will be gone for the people of east Cork.  A number of members have said that is not good enough.  It is heartbreaking.  I again read testimonies yesterday of the residents living there and it is absolutely heartbreaking to think these people's homes, structure and daily routines will be affected in this way.  It is absolutely heartbreaking.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned they have assured families in briefings that no dangers are posed to the residents in Owenacurra from building issues.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Butler, has nonetheless said in answers to parliamentary questions that there is a serious fire risk.  How can those statements be reconciled?</p></speech>

To clarify, we stated earlier that additional staffing has been applied to Owenacurra to ensure the building is clinically safe.  We have always said, as we have done again today, that there are unacceptable conditions in the building.  We brought in an independent conditions survey team and it has identified those items.  We have done that in an independent and transparent manner in order to help us come to a decision and conclusion on how best to advance the matter.</p> <p>  There are specifics on building items.  We have of course put in place some mitigation measures relating to fire works and we have done some interim works to de-risk the position to a sufficient level.

I go back to my very first point, which is that some of these matters were raised in numerous reports over the years.  These were either not looked into or taken seriously enough, or else there was not the will from the HSE at that stage to close Owenacurra.  There is definitely a need to have a retrospective and independent inquiry to find out what the failures from the HSE were as they related to Owenacurra.  That is so the likes of this does not happen again.</p></speech>

Over &euro;420,000 has been provided for ongoing maintenance and upkeep of Owenacurra over the past number of years.  That is in response to questions being asked by the members in advance of today's meeting.  The point remains and Owenacurra is probably unique relative to a number of other healthcare facilities.  I mentioned that the construction is a Roh-fab material and the suppliers of such products speak of it having a 40 or 50 year life.  That is the external fabric and structure of the building and it has reached 50 years.  We must look at how fundamentally intrinsic some of these building matters are and they may not necessarily be applicable to other methods of construction.</p></speech>

Deputy Hourigan's point earlier about weaponising the report of the Mental Health Commission is valid.</p></speech>

I know I have only two minutes so I have a quick comment and question.  It is incredibly frustrating when asking about 24-hour residential for the answer to speak about community mental health teams and people's placement in home care.  Characterising A Vision for Change as saying we will never need 24-hour high-dependency residential placements is a mischaracterisation.  We have adequately covered how there will now be zero placements in east Cork for this.  To say a move towards decongregated settings and community health teams, which I absolutely welcome, will negate the need for any 24-hour placements is a mischaracterisation of A Vision for Change.</p> <p>  Much of what we are discussing today comes back to a duty of care for people who are very vulnerable.  Families are depending on the HSE to uphold the duty of care for relatives living in long-stay mental health facilities.  I inquired about this kind of duty of care aspect as it relates to vaccinations at St. Stephen's Hospital, which has been much discussed today, and elderly long-stay patients.  My parliamentary question was not answered because GDPR regulations could be breached.  I assure the HSE that I am not looking for anybody's name but I am asking that when the Model Business Park HSE corporate staff and staff and patients in St. Stephen's Hospital were vaccinated.  I simply want to know the timeline.  Will the HSE commit to sending me that information? </p></speech>

It may not have been said here already, but if it has, we should be clear about it.  We are not saying the need for long-stay care has been negated at all.</p></speech>

They have said there are zero plans for places in east Cork because we have community mental health teams, home care and weekend cover.  That is the answer that has been repeated three or four times during this session.</p></speech>

It is an important point.  With respect to other long-stay care facilities, we want to replace the unit at St. Stephen's Hospital.  It is a very important facility where we have land and we want to replace it.  There are also difficulties there with the regulatory piece but it is an important centre.  We also need to replace St. Catherine's unit in St. Finbarr's Hospital.  There are a number of challenges for units in Cork as they are not fit for purpose at this point with regard to regulatory issues.  They should be replaced.</p> <p>  As Dr. O'Brien has said, we must take a broader view of where those services can be provided so we can get an appropriate date when a bed is required to meet the needs of a person with mental health requirements.  We absolutely must put our full and utter focus on maintaining people in their own homes.  I have worked in these services for almost 40 years, and for a good 30 of those, we spent our time trying to develop services in the community and get away from 24-hour institutional care and very large services that were difficult to close over a long period.  It is an important point.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised a different matter on access to vaccines.</p></speech>

I always felt it was wrong that people were walking through the Owenacurra centre, which was the home of residents.  Various people were walking into the centre on various days.  Physically separating the two services is a good idea and I look forward to our guests letting us know where that day care centre will be located and whether planning will be needed for it.  There will be a centre where people can go during the day and receive therapy and treatment and so on.  I believe there were between 40 and 60 people per week availing of that.  Is that correct?</p> <p>  What is coming from this meeting and the previous meeting on this issue is that the continuing care currently being provided in Owenacurra will be lost to east Cork.  It will not be provided anywhere in east Cork.  Mr. Fitzgerald has told us his plan is to build houses on the site, but he does not have a budget for that yet.  If the plans to redevelop Midleton Community Hospital, which is next door to this site, are anything to go by, we could be waiting for quite a while before we see houses on the Owenacurra site.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Fitzgerald provide an indication of where we are with the building of the new hospital across the road?  That 50-bed unit is badly needed and will free up all that complex.  The HSE may have other plans for that.  I suggest that rather than building houses on the site, the HSE should, as was stated earlier, build a ten-bed unit that could be used for continuing care.  It could make it a two-storey building and the upstairs could be used as offices for staff and so on.  That would alleviate many of the concerns that all colleagues present, and the community at large in east Cork, have mentioned.  I ask Mr. Fitzgerald to consider that and revert to the committee on it.  Alternatively, the HSE could consider the next step down, which is a high-support hostel, on the site.  Like the Chairman, I do not like using the word "hostel" in this context.  It jars with me too.</p> <p>  Even if the HSE were to apply today for planning permission to build on the site, it could take quite a while for that permission to come through and so on and there could be objections.  In light of that fact, am I right in saying we can give comfort to the current residents that there will be no pressure whatsoever put on them to move out if they do not wish to do so?  Getting back to the question asked by the Chairman, if a person states he or she does not wish to leave but rather wishes to stay in the centre, which, as was stated, has been the home of a particular person for 34 years, can that person be allowed to stay there until we have more clarity in respect of the centre?  The centre is now physically safe from a fire point of view.  Works have been carried out and the kitchen, which was a concern, is no longer operational.  In addition, the number has reduced.</p></speech>

We are proceeding with that, as was stated earlier.  As regards the new community hospital, I ask Mr. Kane to provide the most recent set of indicative dates we have in respect of that development.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, the community nursing unit on the grounds of Midleton Community Hospital is part of a national programme that will deliver seven community nursing units.  That national tender negotiation is currently well advanced.  We expect to see the start of the 50-bed community nursing unit in summer 2021.  That offers a great opportunity in terms of the ongoing reimagining of the Midleton Community Hospital campus.</p><p> We have what are locally known as the front hospital and back hospital buildings.  To go back to a point made by Deputy Durkan in respect of the HSE and the repurposing of existing buildings, we envisage an absolute repurposing of the front hospital and back hospital when we have the new community nursing unit developed.  We will certainly see those buildings offering a fantastic opportunity for primary care services to be enhanced in east Cork.  That feeds into the fact that, when it comes to every primary care centre we do now, we work very closely with community mental health services.  We see that offering a great opportunity for consolidating the community mental health teams.  We will also have the ongoing enhanced community care programme and will consider how that will be rolled out and the opportunities arising from the fact we now have buildings that we will repurpose for the likes of responding to chronic disease-type issues in the east Cork area.  This community nursing unit is a great opportunity and we will be noting the comments of Deputy Durkan in respect of reimagining and repurposing those existing buildings from a primary care community mental health perspective.</p></speech>

If I heard our guests correctly, a ten-bed unit could fit on the site.  Could that be considered?  It may be possible to provide a high-support hostel or a continuing care unit there.  If the HSE does so, it will have alleviated many of the concerns and fears of members who have contributed today, as well as those of the whole community and all the families that have been in contact with us.</p> <p>  On top of that, the HSE might also consider a similar centre in Youghal and maybe one in Cobh.  East Cork is a growing area.  The population number is due to explode under the current relevant plan.  It is an ageing population.  These centres will be needed because the population is growing and ageing.  As colleagues have stated, it is better to have people being looked after in their own communities as far as possible.  I ask Mr. Fitzgerald to consider that.  I do not want an answer today.  Instead of going ahead with supported housing, I ask him to consider what I am suggesting.</p></speech>

I am not at all satisfied by what I have heard at this meeting.  Above all else, it comes down to the basic fact the HSE will strip my local area within my constituency of its existing residential mental health care services.  For example, in Kanturk in north-west Cork, there are 13 single en suite rooms, while in Mallow there are 14 single en suite rooms.  In Carrigabrick in Fermoy, there are 14 single en suite rooms.  In terms of Midleton, Cobh and Youghal, the HSE is reducing the number to zero.  It is just not acceptable for anyone to accept that, make sense of it or try to defend it, as has been so strenuously done by the HSE today.  It shows an entire disregard for the needs of that area.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanton is right.  The east Cork area is one of the fastest-growing metropolitan regions in Ireland.  A new town is being built outside Midleton.  The current size of Carrigtwohill is due to multiply.  Youghal and Cobh are growing.  The HSE wants to strip the service out of the area.  What the HSE is doing is not about the physical standard of the building; it is about withdrawing a service from the community.  It could rebuild the building.  It could put a second floor on it if it needed the required usage of the full site.  That could easily be done by putting another floor onto the building.  The HSE representatives should not try to sell that one to me, the families or the people of east Cork.  Simply on the basis of population growth alone, we need to retain a mental healthcare service in the east Cork area that is residential and staffed 24 hours a day.</p> <p>  As Deputy Buckley noted, if this is all taken away, it is very hard to see how it will come back.  Given the historical issues in the Midleton area, of which all present are aware, what the HSE is trying to do is beyond comprehension.  I have tried to engage with it constructively, as have all members, but there is no point asking a question because I will not get an answer.  Those are my concluding remarks.  It is just not good enough.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.434" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1452" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021121400002#EE00100"><p>I want to return to the issue of independent living.  I do not have any faith in it because the timeframe is way too long.  Would the HSE consider retaining the existing services in Midleton while working around the difficulties?  The witnesses referred to other alternatives but I do not believe they are there.  If they are not there as alternatives, they are not an option at the moment.  Would the HSE retain the existing services until everything else that has been spoken about is in position?  At the moment I am very worried.  The HSE is talking about building this, moving that, refurbishing the other but it does not even have money.  It is like going into the bank and trying to cash in thanks; it does not happen.</p> <p>  I also want to touch on A Vision for Change, which refers to three community residential units of ten places each to be provided per 100,000 population.  We are at just over 94,000.  We have talked about policy all morning but the HSE is working against its own policy.  Do the witnesses accept that under no circumstances should the HSE shut down the services in east Cork?  It should expand them and, as another Deputy said, the HSE has the option to have ten-bed units in Cobh, Youghal and Midleton.  Why is the HSE trying to close down a service when it knows that the demand will be more intense over the next couple of years?  With a growing and ageing population, the demand for these services will only increase.  The HSE is saying that there will be other services in place but it is not possible to rent a one- or two-bedroom house or apartment in east Cork at the moment because of the demand so I do not know where the HSE is going to get properties.  </p> <p>  Reference was made earlier to east Cork community care.  I googled that but could not find anything.  I am trying to point out to the witnesses that services are not in place at the moment.  There is no backup plan and there is no cash to do anything.  The HSE wants to get rid of services while the population is growing.  The witnesses quote A Vision for Change but that document says that there should be three ten bed units per 100,000 but the plan is to take 18 to 20 beds out of east Cork.  </p> <p>  I will repeat my question.  Will the HSE consider retaining the existing services until everything else they have spoken about is put in place?</p></speech>

We also have the home-based treatment team that Dr. O'Brien spoke about, as well as our community mental health team.  They are based in east Cork and they provide services and clinics throughout east Cork in various locations.  We can send details on those to the Deputy after this meeting so that he is clear about how to access those services, which is normally through GP referrals.  Those multidisciplinary teams are very much in existence.</p> <p>  The building in which the current continuing care facility is based is simply not fit for purpose and we cannot make it thus or bring it up to a standard that is acceptable in terms of people living there into the future.  We need to consider the supported living model, which we absolutely intend to do, to retain that type of service.  That is in keeping with the policy to maintain people in their own homes and communities where possible.  In fairness, that has been a huge success.  The teams we have put in place in east Cork mean that we do not have to build more and more long-stay, 24-hour residential settings for people because there is no other alternative.  The alternative is actually in place today, with people living successfully in their own homes and communities while receiving those services.  We must have faith in the policy itself, which aims to keep people in their own communities.</p></speech>

I have listened to what Mr. Fitzgerald has said.  I believe we will be back here again, perhaps in 12 months' time.  As many of the Deputies on this call are well aware, between 2000 and 2002, we had 69 suicides in east Cork, the majority of these occurring in Midleton.  Despite this, Mr. Fitzgerald is telling me we do not need services in this town.  I do not know from where he is getting his advice.</p></speech>

There is a very significant level of service in east Cork, including mental health services.  That is very important for those who use those services.  I do not want to give the impression that there will be no service left in east Cork.  A substantive and important service will remain in east Cork into the future.  If we get more resources for community-based services, we will be delighted to broaden the service in east Cork and increase its opening hours.  That is our intention.  I thank the Chair very much.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I thank them for their attendance today.  It is the committee's view that we do not want to see any facilities closing down.  We want to hear news of more facilities opening.  This is a difficult time for the families and loved ones of those who are facing into uncertainty.  I welcome the fact that the HSE is still engaging with those individuals and families who are still in the Owenacurra Centre.  I wish it well in those discussions.</p> <p>  That concludes the business for today.

Today we hold the first meeting in a series of three meetings at which we will look at urban regeneration within our cities, towns and villages across the country.  Today we will focus on the repair and lease scheme, compulsory purchase orders, dereliction and vacancy in general.  Over the course of the three meetings we will look at a lot of other factors that have an influence and could assist us with bringing life, vibrancy and living back to many towns and villages.  Dereliction and vacancy are often obvious to us because they are a tangible thing we can see as we walk through towns, but the underlying reasons for and the solutions to dereliction and vacancy may not be as obvious.</p> <p>  We have a number of witnesses attending who have a lot of experience, as we will have at our second and third meetings on this topic.  They include practitioners, academics, architects and many others who have an interest, a lot of experience and competency in this area.  Today we are joined from Dublin City Council by Mr. Richard Shakespeare, deputy chief executive at the planning and property development department, and Mr. Paul Clegg, executive manager of the planning and property development department.  Mr. Dave Dinnigan is the acting assistant chief executive at the housing and community services department, and Mr. John O'Hara is city planner.  From Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council we are joined by Mr. Ivan Grimes, director of services, and Mr. Paul Johnston, senior resident engineer.  From the UCD school of architecture, planning and environmental policy we are joined by Ms Orla Murphy.  I understand that Ms Murphy is also co-director of the UCD centre for Irish towns.  From Anois we are joined by co-directors Dr. Frank O'Connor and Ms Jude Sherry.  I thank you all for your attendance and the written submissions you sent in in advance.</p> <p>  I will read out a brief note on privilege.  Members are reminded of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  Members attending remotely from within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meeting.  This means they will have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present within the Leinster House complex.  Members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy, and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that that privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The opening statements that were submitted in advance of the meeting will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  I also extend a welcome to anybody who may be watching the meeting on Oireachtas TV.  I think there has been quite a level of interest in this series of meetings.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Shakespeare, on behalf of Dublin City Council, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Dave Dinnigan, Mr. Paul Clegg and Mr. John O'Hara.</p> <p>  Ongoing urban regeneration has been a central feature of city council policy in response to the widespread dereliction of the 1980s.  With the help of the Urban Renewal Act 1986 and other incentives, there have been notable urban renewal and regeneration successes, including the Dublin docklands, the new Grangegorman campus and many more smaller interventions.  This has enabled the population of the inner city between the canals to increase by more than 50,000, bringing increased vitality to this part of the city.  In accordance with both the national planning framework and regional policy, the city council continues to be proactively engaged in the ongoing regeneration of the city in respect of vacant sites and infill development.  The new draft city development plan, currently on public display, sets out a core strategy for the successful growth of our capital city over the next six years and beyond.  By 2028 the city council must provide for an increase in population of approximately 35,000 people.  The achievement of the core strategy requires a proactive commitment to urban regeneration at all levels in the city.  In addition, the draft development plan has identified the need for strategic regeneration plans for Dublin Industrial Estate and the Naas Road and Ballyfermot areas as part of the City Edge Project, which is a collaborative project between the city council and South Dublin County Council.  At a more local level, the development plan seeks the regeneration of brownfield sites throughout the city, including vacant and underused sites with the potential for infill housing, mews lanes and vacant upper floors.  The regeneration of the inner city will be greatly enhanced by recent urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, funding for both the north and south inner city concept areas, totalling approximately  &euro;170 million.</p> <p>  Having set out the context of urban regeneration policy in the city, I now propose to address the more specific issues that the committee requested we address.  The working definition of "residential vacancy" used by the city council is a home that is not occupied and has remained so for longer than six months and is not currently marketed for sale or rent by the owner.  There are many reasons a property may be vacant, including legal disputes relating to title or wards of court.  The city council is tasked by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to implement a vacant homes action plan.  In response to this requirement and the actions outlined in Rebuilding Ireland under pillar 5, the city council has appointed a vacant homes officer and initiated early actions to identify and return to use vacant homes in its administrative area.  This includes the active deployment and promotion of the two main market interventions available, that is, the repair and lease scheme, and the buy and renew scheme.</p> <p>  In 2017 the city council undertook a pilot street survey to test a methodology for identifying vacant homes in four electoral divisions.  A total of 213 potentially vacant homes were identified.  Of those, just 49 were confirmed as vacant by neighbours or non-occupants, with 16 being confirmed as vacant long term.  Of those 16, 13 were determined unsuitable for either of the incentive schemes, leaving three homes remaining that may be suitable.  The survey was used to form a realistic view of long-term residential vacancy and helped diffuse the assumptions that there were over 30,000 vacant units in the city as per Central Statistics Office data.  Survey results show that Dublin's vacancy is nuanced and often conflated with availability and non-occupancy.  In short, the survey shows that there is no "low-hanging fruit" for residential dwellings in Dublin that are vacant and available for use as social houses.  It is understood that the CSO plans to deploy an enhanced approach during the next census to residential properties that appear to be vacant and Revenue will obtain useful information about vacant residential property from the local property tax revaluation.  Coupled together, these data should provide a more realistic picture of residential vacancy in the city.</p> <p>  The repair and lease scheme allows owners of private properties to avail of interest-free State loans to refurbish a property to private rented standards and, in return, lease it as housing stock.  While initial public interest in the scheme was encouraging, once the details of the scheme were published interest declined.  Eleven applications were received, with only two completing.  The buy and renew scheme allows the city council to acquire long-term vacant property from private owners at a current market valuation and then refurbish it and return it to use as housing stock in a timely manner.  The city council has acquired 68 properties, of which 41 have been refurbished and returned to housing stock.  An additional 27 properties are undergoing refurbishment works and near completion, and there are plans to bring an additional 99 into the housing stock over the coming years.</p><p> The city council established an active land management unit in 2016 to provide a more proactive approach to targeting underutilised, vacant and derelict lands and buildings in the city area.  The public's view of what constitutes a derelict site can be very varied and is not always in accordance with the legislative definition set out in the Derelict Sites Act 1990.  For a site to be determined to be derelict, it must meet the criteria set out in the Act.  In our experience, dereliction arises where there are title difficulties, probate issues, owners with personal difficulties, a lack of finances, and companies in liquidation.  The council's approach, therefore, is to engage actively with owners with a view to agreeing with them what works are required to prevent a property from becoming or remaining derelict.</p><p> The council, through the effective exercise of the legislative provisions in the Derelict Sites Act 1990, proactively strives to achieve the eradication of dereliction in the city and the return of derelict sites to active use.  The council has had an ongoing acquisition strategy since 2017 but will only acquire compulsorily as a last resort.</p><p> The number of derelict sites acquired compulsorily is just part of the story.  The council's experience is that, in the face of compulsory acquisition, some sites have been rendered non-derelict and removed from the derelict sites register; owners may be actively seeking planning permission or have obtained planning permission for redevelopment; and derelict sites may have been placed on the market and are at varying stages in the sales process, which offers the prospect that they will be redeveloped and returned to active use. </p><p> The vacant sites register was established under the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015.  The Act aims to bring vacant land in urban areas into use.  Since January 2019, sites that meet the vacant site criteria outlined in the Act and entered on the register for one calendar year are subject to a levy.  The levy currently stands at 7% of the market value of the property.  There is no interest payable on unpaid levies.  It is worth noting that the Act provides for appeals at every step of the process, which has the effect of slowing down entry in the register and applying the levy.  </p><p> The city council uses its compulsory acquisition powers as part of its active land management strategy.  Recent CPOs include those concerning the Abbey Street Lower&ndash;Abbey Theatre redevelopment, Emmet Road, Ryder's Row and Main Street in Chapelizod.</p><p> Once again, many thanks for allowing me to present this afternoon.  My colleagues and I can expand on the issues if requested.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleague Mr. Paul Johnston, who is the senior resident engineer in Waterford City and County Council's housing department.  He is one of the people who came up with the concept of the repair-and-lease scheme in the first instance.  I have a very brief opening statement.  After that and the conclusion of the other statements, Mr. Johnston and I will endeavour to take any questions members may have.<br/><br/>Since 2016, Waterford Council has been actively seeking to reduce the number of vacant homes across Waterford city and county.  This was in the context of census 2016 data, which indicated that the number of vacant residential units in Waterford was nearly 5,200, or 13.6 %<b></b>of the total residential stock.  That cannot be sustained in the context of increasing demand for social and private housing.<br/><br/>Working with our councillors, we put in place an action plan.  Some of the key objectives are to maximise the potential for the reuse of empty homes for social and private housing; increase public awareness of the issue of vacant properties to give people an opportunity to bring issues to the council directly; improve streetscapes in cities and towns; promote the availability of funding, schemes and initiatives designed to tackle vacancy; and, important in a social context, reduce the level of local antisocial behaviour that can often occur in long-term vacant properties.<br/><br/>A vacant homes team was established in the housing department.  Its primary focus was to identify and record vacant units and assess the options available to bring those units back into occupancy.  The team works to encourage vacant property owners to allow their properties to be used for social housing through the repair and lease and buy and renew schemes.  We have taken enforcement action through CPOs.  In our experience, the repair and lease and buy and renew schemes have been particularly effective in Waterford.  The use of CPOs has had more mixed results, with legal delays and challenges in some instances, but we intend to continue to use the CPO process.<br/><br/>There are approximately 320 units in the repair and lease scheme pipeline in Waterford, including 140 that have already been returned to productive use since the scheme commenced.  There are approximately 50 units in the buy and renew scheme pipeline.  Both schemes, particularly the repair and lease scheme, have delivered one-bedroom and two-bedroom units for us, particularly in urban areas where demand for this type of accommodation is most acute.  Both schemes have been used in combination with initiatives such as the living city initiative and planning exemptions that allow vacant commercial and retail buildings to be converted into residential accommodation.  Interest in the repair and lease scheme is very high in Waterford.  The Department recently approved a scheme that will deliver 71 units within a former convent building.  In this regard, we will be targeting elderly residents primarily. <br/><br/>To date, we have applied CPOs to approximately 49 vacant dwellings to return them to use for housing purposes.  There have been mixed results.  The success rate is probably around 50%.<br/><br/>We acknowledge the ongoing support the council has received from the Department through funding it has provided and also the encouragement and advice it has given us, particularly when we were implementing the repair and lease scheme.</p></speech>

I am speaking today as a registered architect, an assistant professor in UCD school of</p> <p> architecture, planning and environmental policy, and co-director of UCD's Centre for Irish Towns.</p> <p>  As a key policy objective of Project Ireland 2040, the national planning framework, compact urban settlement in towns and cities is acknowledged as fundamental to the future social and spatial sustainability of the country, for several reasons.  First, it supports demographic growth, bearing in mind that the population is predicted to exceed 6 million by 2040.  Second, it allows for the effective use of existing infrastructure, including for transport, water supply, sewage, energy and data.  Third, it promotes the reuse of buildings already built &mdash; and their embodied carbon &mdash; over new build, with its associated carbon dioxide emissions.  Finally, compact urban settlement can support social cohesion through the design of walkable neighbourhoods and good public spaces that link to well-used amenities and support inclusive multigenerational access to services, culture, education and business.</p> <p>  This objective is now embedded across policy at all scales in Ireland, including in Our Rural Future: Rural Development Policy 2021&ndash;2025; Housing for All: A New Housing Plan for Ireland; the Climate Action Plan 2021; regional spatial and economic strategies for the three regional assemblies; county development plans; local area plans; and as expected in the forthcoming town centre first policy.</p> <p>  What is less clear is how this policy objective is implemented on the ground, and how challenges facing our towns and cities in achieving this objective are addressed effectively.  The challenge of vacancy and dereliction, which is the focus of this meeting, has more recently been broadly acknowledged as a barrier to achieving compact urban settlement.  </p> <p>   Neither vacancy nor dereliction is a new phenomenon in Ireland.  Several important recent studies have examined vacancy under different lenses.  Dr. Philip Crowe's report, How data on vacancy is created and used: Case Studies from Scotland, Denmark and Philadelphia, analyses and compares methodologies for measuring and understanding vacancy internationally.  The report offers clear descriptions of how vacancy is measured and highlights, in particular, the vacant property indicators model as used in Philadelphia to combine data sets to predict the likelihood of vacancy at any time.  Dr. Kathleen Stokes and Dr. Cian O'Callaghan's report, Taking stock of Dublin's vacant sites and properties: A review of existing policies and measures, notes that vacancy and the reasons behind it are nuanced and that means and tools to measure it vary.</p><p>It recommends five key actions with a view to supporting &quot;targeted and effective political responses&quot;.<br/><br/>Third, the town centre living initiative synthesis report, authored by SpaceEngagers, documents and analyses the Department of Rural and Community Development&rsquo;s 2018 pilot town centre living initiative, whose aim was to test pilot strategies to understand the various causes of and measure vacancy in town centres in Ireland.  The report recommends 15 key actions.<br/><br/>A summary of these studies is beyond the scope of this statement, but I draw the attention of the committee to them and the many recommendations contained therein.  I would be happy to discuss these further, particularly those relating to finance, during the questions and answers.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these reports and studies have not yet translated to action and implementation.  It seems we have yet to comprehensively understand what we mean by vacancy and who should be charged with tackling it or how.  Vacancy is not a blanket term and means different things to different people.  It can vary over time and have many causes.  It can be temporary or long term.  It can apply to sites, whole buildings, or parts of buildings.  It can apply to dwellings, but also to other types of building.  It can be linked with dereliction, but is not always.  A small percentage of building stock will always be vacant and needs to be to allow for regeneration, movement of people and businesses, change of ownership, etc.  However, large volumes of long-term vacant space, which we have in Ireland, leading to potential dereliction and-or coupled with hoarding of built assets is neither normal, desirable nor sustainable.<br/><br/>I will look at data and how we measure it.  How do we know the extent of these different types of vacancy?  In 2018, as part of Rebuilding Ireland, the then Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government published the national vacant housing reuse strategy, which among other actions called for the establishment of &ldquo;robust and reliable methods to identify and track vacant property and land&quot;.  However, we have as yet no robust, comprehensive or dynamic system for tracking vacancy across types and time, despite having a range of disconnected modes, and this has tended to confuse the narrative around vacancy in the country.<br/><br/>What do we have?  At the national scale, the census has the benefits of capturing data with a high degree of accuracy.  However, it is periodic and only records data on dwellings.  GeoDirectory&rsquo;s quarterly residential building report and commercial vacancy report provide national snapshots of key metrics of national building stock, including vacancy, holiday homes and dereliction. <i>VacantHomes.ie</i>seeks to engage the public to record and report vacant buildings, although gathered data is not publicly available.<br/><br/>At county level, all local authorities are required to maintain separate registers of vacant sites and derelict buildings.  In addition, the Heritage Council&rsquo;s collaborative town centre health check programme has conducted baseline reporting of ground floor vacancy in 15 towns and developed a methodology and knowledge base for building collaboration and partnerships as sustainable methods for ongoing management of town centre regeneration.  In the Government&rsquo;s newest housing policy, Housing For All: A New Housing Plan for Ireland, action 19.12 requires the Department of Finance to &ldquo;Collect data on vacancy levels in residential property with a view to introducing a vacant property tax&rdquo;.<sup>v</sup><br/><br/>Despite all of these data, reports and hundreds of pages of policy, there is still no Department or agency responsible for comprehensively co-ordinating a programme of mapping, documenting and understanding vacancy and land use patterns at the national, regional and local scale.  The result is, unfortunately, a haphazard approach that leaves us still without a clear understanding of the scale of vacancy, its underlying causes and necessary actions to ameliorate it.<br/><br/>As Stokes and O&rsquo;Callaghan point out, &ldquo;Vacancy and dereliction are symptoms rather than causes of the unequal housing, property and development regimes [in] Irish [towns and] cities.&rdquo;<sup>vi</sup>For example, as they point out, less visible forms of vacancy include short-term lets, which can have the effect of removing properties from the long-term rental market.  At the date of writing, Westport, County Mayo had only two available dwellings to rent listed on<i>Daft.ie</i>, despite there being 252 available short-term let Airbnb options.  This is under-the-radar vacancy, but it has a significant impact on the sustainability of the town. <br/><br/>This lack of a co-ordinated approach to town centres and city districts means that buildings, which are valuable assets connected to expensive infrastructure and stores of embodied carbon, and all of which are owned by someone, sit idle.  Meanwhile long-term homeless figures are again rising, at 8,130 in Focus Ireland&rsquo;s October report.<br/><br/>From ongoing research and experience in this area I would make a number of observations.  First, we already have access to significant volumes of data, but are we asking the right questions?  Are we asking the difficult questions?  We also have ample legislation and policy but there is a curious lack of action and accountability.  Why is this?  Why is there a reluctance to collect vacant site levies? Why are the powers of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, which include CPO and levy powers, not used to their full capacity?  Why is the ownership of all property not in the public domain, when in other countries this information is a matter of public record and interest?  An outsider looking on might be justifiably confused and wonder whether it might be the case that the <i>status quo</i>of empty untaxed assets, be they vacant, derelict, used for short-term lets or buildings that are held onto and used as quasi-pensions, sometimes suits some of us? Otherwise, why would we not simply do the work that is already mandated in policy and legislation?  <i>Cui bono</i>?  Who benefits?<br/><br/>Second, a single point of responsibility and partnership is needed.  A co-ordinated, supportive partnership approach, which Ireland currently lacks, is needed.  We could learn from our neighbours in Scotland.  Faced with similar challenges, they have developed an exemplary framework, informed by a town centre first approach, which combines a single comparative data platform, Understanding Scottish Places, with the USP Your Town Audit and place standard and town centre toolkits within a supportive mechanism of the Scotland&rsquo;s Towns Partnership.  Scottish Empty Homes Partnership and Scotland's Towns Partnership ensure knowledge is shared and comparable, actions are co-ordinated and a partnership approach to compact urban settlement is collaboratively developed and delivered at all scales, from national to local, while still respecting the unique character of towns and city districts.  The Heritage Council and the UCD Centre for Irish Towns have built good relationships with colleagues in the Scotland&rsquo;s Towns Partnership and the University of Edinburgh and they have generously shared their knowledge and experience and stand willing to help us.  <br/><br/>Third is the need for a co-ordinated and collaborative approach.  Towns and cities are unique places, and no one-size-fits-all solution will work for every place.  Equally, fixing vacancy and dereliction on its own will not fix towns or city districts.  However, a partnership approach, informed by publicly available, comparable data, could connect with local authorities and communities in towns to support common baseline audits, and, in parallel and of equal importance, help develop locally tailored, participatory vision plans that support compact urban places to be connected, climate resilient, healthy and beautiful places to live.  Progress and action can then be managed and assessed relative to baseline checks and goals unique to each place but co-ordinated nationally.  The recently announced town centre actions plans are welcomed, but it is suggested that they might be of more value, if co-ordinated by a partnership model and based on a common structure with inclusion, design and sustainability at its core.<br/><br/>We should be actively implementing all our CPO and levy powers.  However, unless we understand our towns and cities at a granular scale, as well as the macro forces that continue to shape them, and can benchmark them in time and space relative to one another, we will remain unable to imagine to them as they could be.  A co-ordinated approach, using common metrics, participatory tools and methodologies within an open, supportive and participatory framework that harnesses design skills to respond to the unique conditions of people and place is essential.</p></speech>

The most destructive myth in Ireland is that our Constitution protects private property above all else, when it clearly states that private property rights ought to be regulated by principles of social justice and common good.  The State is not upholding its side of this foundational social contract by allowing extreme levels of vacancy and dereliction to persist.  This is a dereliction of duty.</p> <p>  Dereliction is a pollutant that visually reflects inequalities in society.  When many people are struggling to find a secure and affordable home or dying on our streets, others are allowed to leave homes empty with no repercussions.  This is a social crime and a scandalous waste of precious resources that is actively reducing the market supply of properties and increasing prices and rents.  High levels of vacancy and dereliction have a detrimental impact on community well-being, sense of place, physical and mental health and the local environment and economy.  This is compounded by the excessive loss of heritage through neglect and destruction.</p> <p>  Construction is already the most wasteful sector in Ireland, so bringing buildings back into use is the best way to transition to a circular economy, where existing buildings are treated as valuable material banks by ensuring all materials are retained at their highest value, in their current structure, potentially saving millions of tonnes of embedded carbon.</p><p>Simply put, the most sustainable building is the existing one and we need urgently to abolish demolish and bring every building back into use.<br/><br/>In June 2020, we started a daily dose of dereliction through a Twitter thread which, over one year, amassed nearly 450 derelict properties and sites, all within a 2 km radius of Cork city centre island.  Viewed by millions, this daily shining a light has caused the Irish nation to wake up to the reality that we have normalised derelict Ireland for far too long.<br/><br/>In March, we released the report This is Derelict Ireland, a <i>pro bono</i>study that debunks ten deadly myths of dereliction.  It is the first ever study of its scale and depth in Ireland and the conclusion of two year's research analysing 340 derelict properties.  This has led to a national movement with hundreds of people across Ireland sharing images of derelict Ireland.  To complement this online movement, we created a walking festival to end dereliction, in collaboration with the Community Action Tenants Union, CATU, Cork.  The first festival was in Cork City in September and the second one took place in Dublin with Reclaim Our Spaces and CATU Ireland.</p></speech>

Although it is not perfect, the simple fact is the Derelict Sites Act is not fully enforced.  We urgently need all local authorities to hire vacant homes officers, register all derelict properties, and remove vacant discount from business rates.  We propose Revenue collect the 7% annual dereliction levy and any new vacancy tax and ring-fence it for legal support to local authorities and to establish a one-stop shop.</p> <p>  With the tenth highest vacant homes rates in the world, the majority of which are in our urban centres, it is no wonder many view these places as unliveable.  Yet these are the key to quickly, sustainably and cheaply densifying our villages, towns and cities, since all the necessary infrastructure and resources already exist.  We simply have to join the European renovation wave with realistic incentives that prioritises urban heritage buildings.</p> <p>  Many of our urban centres need a positive disruption to kick-start their regeneration, otherwise known as a "leaba the", a hotbed of innovation through meanwhile-use of vacant commercial properties, which we launched in collaboration with the Heritage Council&rsquo;s collaborative town centre health check programme, CTCHC, programme.  This is a wonderful regeneration opportunity that needs to be realised.</p> <p>  The culture of owners leaving a building derelict and falling onto the street with no repercussions or costs to them has to end.  With our current escalating land and properties prices, owners are rewarded for their bad behaviour from the guaranteed rising asset value.  This is not the foundation of a healthy society or economy.</p> <p>  We call on the committee to ensure all effective policy measures are put in place to utilise all vacant and derelict properties in Ireland, as homes or as creative, commercial, community and play spaces.  We have identified a toolbox of international policy measures that takes a three-pronged approach to tackling dereliction and vacancy through addressing usage, custodianship and ownership.  These include a vacancy tax, compulsory sales and compulsory rental orders, meanwhile use, and stricter building control.</p> <p>  If we do this, the opportunities are unlimited.  Tackling dereliction and vacancy provides a unique opportunity to provide homes and places to play, create and work.  This is what the people of Ireland want.  Let us do it now and end this pointless waste, neglect and vandalism.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for taking the time to listen to us today and taking an interest in derelict Ireland.</p></speech>

I apologise to all the attendees.  I thank them all for their submissions and for all the work they do daily on this very important issue.  I have read all of their submissions but also followed their work.  As a former city councillor, I am most familiar with Dublin City Council's workings.  I thank all the attendees and very much appreciate their work.</p> <p>  From our perspective, the housing crisis requires us to sweat every single asset, and using existing built property is the most sustainable and efficient way for us to increase the housing stock.  It is a major priority for us.  The submissions make it very clear this is not a simple issue.  It is complex and a nuanced approach needs to be taken to it.  Waterford's example of the repair and lease scheme shows very much how significant progress can be made when there is a focused, proactive approach.</p> <p>  In terms of the submission from Dublin City Council, I suggest we need to come back to the urban regeneration of public spaces and buildings.  It is a piece of work all on its own.  My questions are to do with private properties.  Dublin City Council undertook a street survey in 2017 of four electoral divisions.  I wonder which four they were, because the council's contribution is stark.  It says there is almost nothing there.  That is not the lived experience in the city.  The lived experience in the city is we have considerable dereliction.  We have far too much vacancy and dereliction, and I appreciate there is a distinct difference between both.  From the city council's perspective, there are 162 electoral divisions, so I would be interested to know which four were surveyed.</p> <p>  I would also like to know whether the city council is taking a co-ordinated, proactive approach to using all of the tools available to it.  From an outsider's perspective, of somebody living in the city, there are compulsory purchase orders, CPO, powers, vacancy tax, derelict and vacancy registers and a register for dangerous buildings.  However, are they working in a co-ordinated and proactive way to turn the vacant properties into habitable and inhabited properties?</p></speech>

We were looking at the census information at the time and what we were trying to drill down to see was exactly how many dwellings could be used for the repair and renewal scheme.  The census at the time was looking at vacancy or occupancy at a particular point in time.  Having discussed it in detail with the enumerators, we know that an awful lot of effort was put into determining vacancy at that time.  However, that was the definition of vacancy for the purposes of the census.  Having drilled down, we saw there were approximately 16 vacant properties, five of which were protected structures, which would not be suitable to be brought in as social homes.  We were trying to determine how many of these would be used as social homes.  A few of them were commercial units as well.</p> <p>  Senator Fitzpatrick asked whether there was a co-ordinated approach.  There is.  For derelict sites, we need to remember and look to the definition of a derelict site.  Dereliction is about where land detracts to a material degree from an amenity or character.  We keep an eye on approximately 400 active derelict sites.  We have 75 sites on the derelict sites register.</p> <p>  In our experience, people do not deliberately let their properties go into dereliction.  There are title and probate issues as well as owners who have personal difficulties and a lack of finance.  We find that engagement helps a lot with dealing with dereliction.</p><p>We charge levies on the 75 sites on the derelict sites register.  We have 45 sites on the vacant homes register and approximately 200 active sites.  There is a big and co-ordinated approach on our part.</p><p> We have four active compulsory purchase orders, CPOs.  We have not targeted individual CPOs on particular dwellings.  However, we welcome it when we get a focus from the census.  As a result of the data that will come out from the analysis of the local property tax by the Revenue Commissioners, we will have a clearer idea about the number of vacant homes we have.  I have only been talking about the residential end of things.  I have not been talking about commercial vacancy.  We are anxious to see the actual level of vacancy so that we can use the powers we have under the repair and lease scheme.  We will not be found wanting.  We will take whatever action is required once there is a clear analysis of the data.</p></speech>

As another contributor mentioned earlier, we have a vacant homes officer who works with our various teams, including our housing and legal teams.  We use our extensive area management presence locally to identify them.  We probably have a better understanding and methodology because it is not fixed at one time; it is continuous.</p></speech>

I thank all our guests for their important presentations.  In particular, I want to say to Ms Murphy that there were a lot of incredibly useful and practical suggestions in her presentation as to how we tackle the issue she raised around implementation.  I compliment Anois on its innovative campaigning work.  Please keep it up because it is important to keep highlighting this issue.</p> <p>  In response to Mr. Grimes and Mr. Shakespeare, I acknowledge that local authorities are doing an enormous amount of work, often under the most difficult of circumstances in terms of a lack of staff and funding.  While some of the remarks I am going to make are very critical, they are not in any way critical of Mr. Grimes, Mr. Shakespeare or their teams.  The problems are elsewhere.</p> <p>  The idea that large volumes of homes can be left vacant in a housing crisis is the equivalent of hoarding food in a famine.  The State and its agencies simply should not have allowed this to happen for so long.  When I compare the targets that were set under Rebuilding Ireland with the level of delivery under what Mr. Shakespeare rightly highlighted as the two main Government policy interventions over the past five years, the policy has been an abject failure.  Anybody who is honest about it knows that.  We were promised 3,500 repair and leases by the end of 2021.  We probably have approximately 273.  That is an 8% success rate, which is shockingly low by any standards.  No targets for buy and renew were set by the previous Government but we only got approximately 670 units.  That means that even with a very modest set of targets we are way behind.  What is concerning me is that the actual targets that are set in the current Government's housing plan for bringing vacant units back into stock, 2,500 by 2026, is even less ambitious although, given that the policy is going to be, broadly, the same as the previous one, perhaps it is a more realistic target.</p> <p>  Ms Murphy has made a compelling case for sorting out the data war.  I have always been of the view that the Central Statistics Office figures are far too high, for a variety of reasons, and I have always used the GeoDirectory figures.  Even if we think the GeoDirectory's figure of 92,000 is too high and the true figure is one half or one quarter of that, we are still talking about thousands of units in areas of high demand.  The data we have from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage shows that it is quicker and cheaper to bring a unit into use through buy and renew than to build a new unit.  That is before one deals with the important sustainability, urban regeneration and place-making points that Anois and Ms Murphy set out.  I am incredibly disheartened by how little progress there has been, despite the hard work of many people on the ground.</p> <p>  I think Ms Murphy has answered a fair number of my questions.  I am going to ask Mr. Grimes and Mr. Shakespeare an awkward question.  Ms Murphy set out a clear methodology for getting the baseline figures and until we have those figures, everything else is a mess.  Do Mr. Grimes and Mr. Shakespeare think the proposition Ms Murphy has made could be implemented quickly and what would it take to establish that clear baseline so we know exactly where it is?  Will Ms Murphy give us a little more information about the success in Scotland?  Did they have a good framework?  There will probably be a third round of questioning so I will be hanging around to pester our guests with more questions.  Perhaps I will leave it at that for the moment.</p></speech>

Given the relative complexity of the tools and data sets that are there, I do not know how quickly that can be tidied up.  I am not expert in that field at all.  I defer to Ms Murphy as to how that will be worked through.  Anything that makes it easier would be welcome.</p></speech>

Anything that can improve the data we have and which we can utilise is worth exploring.  We looked at data sources a number of years ago, starting with the census.  The problem with the census is that it gives information on an area but it does not give addresses.  Even going beyond that, and I think a number of contributions have referenced this point, the knowledge that a property is vacant does not tell one who owns it, why it is vacant and what are the other issues around it.  It would be worth exploring.</p></speech>

Will she elaborate on that?  I think that aligns with Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.480" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021121400002#E01500"><p>I would be happy to elaborate.  My intention is not to undermine the good work that is going on in lots of places in the country and with lots of different pilot strategies and different approaches that have been trialled over the past number of years.  However, even hearing the volume of approaches that are being taken, some of which have been presented today, underlines and highlights the urgent need to bring it all together so that we are all talking about the same thing when we speak about vacancy.</p><p>We have a lot of data sets to avail of.  The approach taken in Philadelphia involved layering those data sets so that we can combine them and ask of them different questions in order that we can understand what is partially vacant, what a short-term let is, what is a commercial property and what is residential vacancy, and can track this quite quickly over time.  GeoDirectory is very powerful.  The fact that we have postmen and postwomen on the ground who know their local area intimately can be combined into national data sets and updated quarterly.  It is quite powerful as one tool.  It gives us a very accurate national picture but that is irregular.  </p><p> How do we bring that together?  First, we need the will to recognise that this is useful and then we need a single national platform to do that.  Understanding Scottish Places is an open platform data set that allows us to look at all of the information online and compare different towns and cities, not just to do with dereliction and vacancy but also to do with statistics that may be gathered in the census regarding commuting patterns, education facilities and the different types of homes we have so we can compare, contrast and track data.  Unless we know what we have, it is very difficult to make plans for what we need to do.  This must occur at a national level.  Through advances in GIS systems and the various agencies collecting data, which have been highlighted in the Stokes O'Callaghan report in some detail, this can very easily be translated into a national data set but we must have the will to put that into action and resource it properly.  </p><p> The partnership approach in Scotland emerged out of a recognised need to have a town centre first approach.  This applied to rural towns but also to city districts.  That was parsed at what that meant.  The responsibility for it was put directly under a high-level department.  It was not placed with a department of housing or a compartment of rural and community development but, in our case, placed under the Department of the Taoiseach because it is cross-cutting.  It must cut across all policies and not be siloed into one or the other.  Within that, there are links to the data sets we have but also to common tools and methodologies that we would use so that we are not trying to stick individual sticking plasters on different problems around the country but are co-ordinating that into one approach that can be adopted and adapted depending on the scale of the place with which we are working and allows us to see what is working where, how that can impact on different places and track it over time.  The Heritage Council's collaborative town centre health check programme is excellent but is only happening in 15 towns and is pretty much led single-handedly by Alison Harvey with the support of collaborators in the towns.  She has a long queue of other towns that want to be part of that programme but it is not yet a national programme.  It cannot be because it does not have the resources to do so.  There are similar tools in Scotland such as the Understanding Scottish Places audit tool and the Place Standard tool.  These are commonly used and can be rolled out in any town, neighbourhood, community or city.  Again, they are comparable and digitally linked so that the information gathered can be compared and the same tools and methodologies are used nationally.  </p><p> There are quite simple tools.  I acknowledge that it is a complex problem but vacancy and dereliction are symptomatic.  Fixing vacancy and dereliction will not fix our urban places.  It is a larger and more holistic problem that needs a national co-ordinated partnership approach that is not siloed into any Department or local authority but works from the high level all the way down to a bottom-up approach that is supportive, uses partnership, gathers all of the partners, agencies and local authorities together, and makes best use of our existing policy.  We have a lot of policy that is really well written and has very admirable objectives but there is a blockage concerning how that translates into action on the ground.  All of us see this in our daily lives as we move around cities and towns and can see that whole streets are still vacant.  The principal street in our capital suffers hugely from vacancy and dereliction.  This is something that any visitor to our country sees as his or her first port of call when he or she visits our country but it is also the case in many rural towns.  It is also seen in towns with high levels of short-term lets that are not yet rent pressure zones.  This is translating into an unsustainable future for those towns because they simply cannot sustain new populations coming to them.  We will have a significant population increase so we must act with urgency on this and do it while reducing our carbon emissions by 7% every year so it is a massive challenge that needs national co-ordination and the resources behind that to deliver it.</p></speech>

We need to address this issue, which is why this committee is placing such an emphasis on it.  I read all the opening statements with interest.  I agree with Mr. Shakespeare's thesis that this issue is very complex and that there are many reasons we have vacant properties in the middle of a housing crisis.  Not only is the analysis of four electoral divisions within Dublin City Council, which showed that there are only 16 vacant units within it, not reflective of the wider issues within the council area, it is not a credible figure compared to the reality on the ground.  Even allowing for those 16 units, Mr. Shakespeare mentioned that 13 of them were unsuitable for use by the schemes.  In his response to Senator Fitzpatrick, he mentioned that some of the more protected structures were not suitable but that is not something that is not permitted under the schemes.  In Waterford city, a project has commenced that will deliver 72 units in a former derelict Little Sisters of the Poor nursing home, which is a protected structure in the heart of the city, under the repair and lease scheme so I do not accept that protected structures cannot be included in the scheme.  I also put it to him that the figure of 11 applications under the repair and lease scheme in his opening is not accurate because Government figures state that 39 applications were made to Dublin City Council and only one lease has been delivered accumulating two units, which is shamefully low.  I am not picking on Dublin City Council because 23 councils across this country have delivered five units or less under the repair and lease scheme in the past four years and eight local authorities have not delivered a single unit.</p> <p>  If we contrast that with my own local authority in Waterford, which has delivered 122 units under the repair and lease scheme, that accounts for 45% of all units nationally.  I welcome the director of services, Mr. Ivan Grimes, and Mr. Paul Johnston.  I would like to ask them a direct question.  Why is Waterford City and County Council able to achieve these figures?  Do Mr. Grimes and Mr. Johnston feel there is an ability to enhance this repair and lease scheme so that we can target units for cost rental for middle-income earners as well as social housing?</p></speech>

We will double-check our figures but we went through it again this morning.  The repair and leasing scheme was well advertised and promoted at the time and there was a lot of interest and phone calls from proposers.  That narrowed down quickly.  That might be because there are some different market conditions in Dublin from the rest of the country.  It was felt the interest-free loan was not attractive and people were more looking for grants, which is understandable but the scheme was what it was at the time and we had to implement it.  In some cases the minimum length of ten years for the lease was seen as too onerous for some individuals.  The private sector also felt it might have been able to achieve greater income on the condition of 80% of the market rent.  There were a few options and they were the general comments people went through as proposers getting on to Dublin City Council at the time.  It seems like the repair and leasing scheme was not particularly attractive, despite quite a lot of effort being expended on our team&rsquo;s behalf to engage with proposers.</p> <p>  The buy and renew scheme was much more successful and seemed to fit the appetite of the market much more.  One ruinous house on a street or road can have a deleterious effect on the whole neighbourhood, so bringing one or two units back into us makes a significant difference.  Even though 68 units looks comparatively small given the size of the city, it would have made a huge difference in many areas of the city centre.  It would be our hope and expectation that we would be able to add another 99 units to that number in the coming years.  We are active in promoting the scheme.  We use every opportunity we can, but at the end of the day the two schemes are as they are and we have to implement them.  We are also relying on proposers from the open market to engage with us.</p></speech>

It took quite a while to get it going and Senator Cummins will be aware of that.  Initially we were dealing with individual property owners and the scheme does not really suit them.  It is more suitable for multi-unit properties or owners.  For example, we have had a number of pubs that have gone out of business and been converted into multi-occupancy units, especially in Waterford city.  About three years ago we engaged with the local estate agents and auctioneers on the scheme.  They are a good source of information about owners and they know about properties that are vacant and people who are interested in turning a buck, for want of a better word, from their vacant properties.  It is hard work getting the scheme up and running, but once it gets up and running, it delivers and it sells itself.</p></speech>

It is something we have been considering and that we would like to explore further.  The basis of it is that it has proven successful to us in Waterford, given that it has been targeted at social housing.  When it is considered that the model is based on a discounted rent of up to 20%, the basis of an affordable rental is there already.  That would have the benefit of being able to provide a mixed tenure refurbishment in town, village and city centres, which can only be of benefit.  If that mixed tenure can be brought to this, it opens it up even further, so that would be our request.</p></speech>

The Government figures from <i>gov.ie</i>are 39, which shows there is only a 5% conversion rate between applications versus delivery of units on the ground.  If that is compared with Waterford, there is a conversion rate of upwards of 40%.  Something is seriously wrong there and we have not had sufficient answers on that.  It is not good enough just to say we have to rely on proposals that come to us.  It takes work to identify these units and make the owners aware.  There is an ability to deliver multiple units within a single property and that is what needs to be worked at.</p></speech>

The next slot is a Green Party slot, which I will take.  I refer to the compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers the councils have.  One of the witnesses from Dublin City Council mentioned that it has four active CPOs and the witnesses from Waterford City and County Council mentioned that it has 49.  We know that Housing for All has a target of 2,500 CPOs by 2026, which is 500 per year.  Does more need to be done to provide the councils with more resources to be able to purchase properties compulsorily or do changes need to be made in the CPO process to allow them to meet that target?  Why does Dublin City Council only have four active CPOs?</p></speech>

We also need to add into that figure the number of derelict homes we have compulsorily purchased, which is 25.  We have not looked to purchase individual vacant homes compulsorily.  The CPO powers are set out in legislation and there has to be a clear purpose.  We have not identified individual homes that we will compulsorily purchase.  We have concentrated our efforts on what we consider to be derelict homes.  The four CPOs we have are Ryder&rsquo;s Row, which is a derelict site in the centre of the city, Main Street in Chapelizod, Emmet Road, to facilitate the redevelopment of St. Michael&rsquo;s estate, and Abbey Street, to do with the development of the Abbey Theatre.</p></speech>

On the CPOs used to acquire property, we have concentrated our efforts on bringing derelict houses back into the social housing stock.  We have not looked at compulsorily purchasing vacant residential homes.  It goes back to the earlier point about identifying what is a vacant and available home that we can look to acquire.

We had a steady flow then up until Covid, which has put a spanner in the works.  The process is, by its nature, time consuming and there is a cost to the local authority for each CPO.  We have legal costs and, assuming everything goes well, there is the cost of conveyancing, but if there is a challenge, then the costs mount up quickly.</p><p>From our perspective, the 49 units that we targeted for CPO were ones we had received complaints about from neighbours about dumping or antisocial behaviour and in respect of which the owners could not be found or they would not engage.  We prefer to encourage the owners to come through with the repair and lease and the buy and renew.  Although effective, CPO is time consuming and costly.  </p></speech>

There is a definition of a derelict site under the Act.  Did the witnesses stick closely to that definition?  It is my experience dealing at local authority level that often when a site is to be a deemed to be a derelict site, the director of services or somebody else in the council takes the view that proving that would be very difficult.  What has been the experience of the witnesses?  I am sure they did not simply look at sites and deem them to be derelict.  Did they apply the strict criteria that the department of services member of a local authority would have to apply because it is a legal definition?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.511" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jude Sherry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021121400002#H01500"><p>I thank the Chairman for the question.  To finish the quote raised earlier, the legal definition of dereliction is that it "detracts, or is likely to detract, to a material degree from the amenity, character or appearance of the land in the neighbourhood".  The key phrase for us is "in the neighbourhood".  Unless a house is isolated and in a rural area - we live in urban areas and we are talking about urban regeneration - it is about the effect the dereliction has on the neighbourhood.  When it comes to the definition, the Derelict Sites Act 1990 goes on to provide a number of different examples of what can constitute dereliction.  It is quite a broad definition.  Some people criticised the broadness of that definition and there have been quotes in the press to the effect that it leaves councils to take in their own interpretation of what dereliction is.  Dr. O'Connor and I agree with that broad definition from the point of view that it is in regard to what is considered derelict in the neighbourhood.  </p> <p>  In terms of our lived experience of moving to the city centre of Cork from another historic city that is built on a marshland, namely, Amsterdam, there was a massive contrast for us.  In Ireland, there is not the same high level of care and maintenance given to our built environment.  There can be challenges in identifying what is and what is not derelict.  When it comes to our lived experience in Cork, in all honesty we are considering buying hard hats to wear as we walk around the city because there have been numerous cases of parts of buildings falling down and buildings collapsing in the city.  This is not something we have experienced.  It resonates more to when we visited Havana in Cuba and the news reports there of collapsing and crumbling buildings.</p></speech>

We went back quite a few times to confirm the dereliction.  We eventually had 450 on the thread over 12 months, but we left a couple of hundred more properties out because we stopped after one year.  At the time we started the thread, there were approximately 95 properties on the Cork City Council derelict site register.  Based on our short study of a 2 km radius of Cork city centre, we came up with a figure of 450, but it could have been a couple of hundred more.  That shows there is a lot of discrepancy in terms of the figures.</p></speech>

There is one particular example in Cork city where the property is listed as a derelict property on the derelict site register.  Cork City Council tried to CPO the site.  To put this in context, the building's two double bay windows have completely collapsed and it has been completely boarded up.  It is uninhabitable.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la agrees that it is uninhabitable.  It stated that in its current form, the property does not present as a danger structure but that it is distinctly unsightly in the area.  This is an area where there are many examples of residential and other structures in different structural conditions, inclusive of buildings in poor structural and visual presentation.  Up until the 1990 Act, dereliction was defined as a visual pollutant only.  The 1990 Act broadened that scope.</p></speech>

I apologise on behalf of Senator Boyhan that he cannot be here as he is currently in the Seanad Chamber dealing with the marine planning Bill.</p><p>I have been involved in construction since the early 1980s.  I am from rural Limerick, where I was a councillor for six years prior to my election as a Deputy.  Throughout my time on the council I saw a great deal of dereliction and I continue to see it now.  As foe what contributes to dereliction and how can we help, as I see it, the biggest contributor to dereliction is conservation laws in regard to buildings.  I refer to Kilmallock, which is a 14th century town.  I have worked there in construction.  There are many barriers when it comes to the regeneration of derelict buildings in order that we can get people back into our towns and villages and added to that, the cost is unbelievable.  </p><p>Limerick City and County Council tried to bring properties back into use through the repair and lease scheme but that did not work.  People would not support it on the basis that it was not viable owing to the associated cost and the lack of contractors and tradespeople.  The city and county council then sought to secure properties through the buy and renew scheme that, to me, was a better option, but problems arose in regard to ownership of the buildings.  The council tried to identify who owned the buildings, in respect of which it engaged with the National Asset Management Agency<b>, </b>NAMA, and the banks in regard to titles.  At present, I am in regular contact in regard to at least 15 properties that are held up in respect of titles.  These are properties in towns and villages that could be brought back into use such that people could live in them if the titles were sorted out.  In the case of one title, the last known owner was 52 years ago.</p><p>That building has been lying idle for the past 23 or 24 years, and the council is still seeking title in respect of it.  There are other buildings that have been held up because of banking situations, and the council has issued compulsory purchase orders.  This is a more expensive way of doing it but it is the only way we can get some of these properties out of dereliction.  Some of these houses are only 15 years old and are reasonably modern buildings.  Again, it is being held up and a lot of it is to do with the banks, title and bad debtors.</p><p> I am fully behind anything that will bring any building out of dereliction and get people back into the towns and villages around Limerick and the rest of the country but we have to tackle conservation.  If we are talking about iconic buildings then we do need to protect the structure.  If someone is in a position to protect the structure and bring it back into a habitable state, even from the point of view of tourism, that is fine.  However, we have houses that are protected structures but there has been nobody living in them for the last 20 or 30 years and we need to get people into them.  If they are in a streetscape, let us keep the front facade and roof structure of the building, but then we must make it viable to knock the rest and rebuild in order to give people up-to-date accommodation that can be efficiently heated, which would lead to lower energy costs.  We need to move forward.  I have been doing this for almost ten years, namely, trying to get people to keep the front facade of buildings but get the rest of the building into good economic repair.  I know of a two-bedroom house that was repaired and extended at the back to add a third bedroom.  Insurance companies would not insure the entire building because of conservation issues but they would insure the back of it.</p><p> All of this is to do with conservation laws.  While I am big into my history, I am also big into housing people who need to be housed.  I am interested in housing people in our towns and villages, which will increase footfall and help to sustain local businesses.  I am all about that.  Whatever it takes to make our towns, villages and rural areas sustainable needs to be supported.  We have to tackle conservation.  At the moment, as we all know, the increase in building costs globally has added approximately &euro;40 to &euro;50 per square foot to the cost of rebuilding houses.  Specialised work in the context of conservation could add &euro;100 to &euro;120 per square foot because of the shortage of skilled workers.</p><p> I invite the witnesses to come to Limerick.  I can take them around every part of Limerick because I know all of it.  I invite them to help me to tackle the derelict houses and streetscapes that have been derelict for 20 or 30 years because of policies, regulations, stipulations.  We have to have policies but we also have to look at the people in our counties and those from other counties that want to move in to our areas to start families or set up businesses.  We have to welcome them, but we will not do it if our policies are stopping the rebuilding of Ireland.</p></speech>

The first relates to cost.  We carried out an interesting study in collaboration with Mayo County Council.  We looked at Ballinrobe town, one of six pilot towns in a vacancy study.  We looked at three long-term vacant properties in the town and came up with possible design solutions to get them back into use.  Some of the buildings were protected structures but the design study proved that it was eminently possible and feasible to redesign protected structures to make beautiful, sustainable living homes within the town.  The fabric is not the barrier.  However, when the models were costed, it was discovered that even though, on a per metre squared basis, the cost did not exceed that of a new build on a greenfield site, when one added the cost of the work to the cost of the building itself, the resulting capital asset was not equal to the money spent carrying out the works.  That is a huge problem in terms of getting access to mortgage funding.  If someone needs to take out a loan to do this, even if he or she is minded to take on one of these properties, the current financial structures make that very difficult to achieve.  The problem is not the heritage of the buildings but the systems around them that form barriers to reuse.  It is important that we protect the heritage value and nature of our towns and cities because we cannot replace that.  It is a building life thing but the best way to do that is to reuse the buildings, and design does not preclude that.</p> <p>  How do we create a much more supportive approach?  I would point to some of the findings in the town centre living initiative which contains some suggested actions which might achieve that.  These include financial incentives to help people who want to take on these properties to do so.  Such incentives include, for example, the removal of all VAT for taking on one of these structures to reuse it as a family home.  Another suggestion is the introduction of disincentives in respect of people who continue to hoard these buildings so that they get released to market, possibly at a lower rate than they are being held onto for the moment.  I would point members to that report-----</p></speech>

I must ask members again to try to keep their contributions within the six minute limit.  The longer members take to ask questions, the shorter the time available for answers.

I especially want to thank Ms Sherry and Dr. O'Connor for the work they have done in Cork and nationally in terms of sparking a valuable conversation on this.  I would encourage them to keep up the work they are doing.  There is nothing more frustrating and anger-making for people than seeing vacant, derelict buildings that are not in use, especially those who are struggling to buy, paying very high rents or at risk of homelessness.  It really gets them in the gut and is like a kick in the teeth.  It is a huge problem for the wider community as well in terms of how wasteful it is and the negative effect it has on an area.  It is vital that we introduce a vacant homes tax as quickly as possible for the reasons outlined by Ms Murphy.  While it must be economically viable to bring properties back into use, there must also be disincentives for people to hang on to unused buildings.</p> <p>  My question relates to the opening statement from Ms Sherry and Dr. O' Connor.  The appendix contains a figure for the number of derelict homes, as counted by GeoDirectory, of 22,754.  This does not include commercial buildings so the figure could be significantly higher if such buildings were included.  In contrast, there are only 1,548 derelict properties on the derelict sites registers across Ireland.  Why are so many derelict buildings not making it on to the derelict sites register?  That question is for Dublin City Council initially and then for Ms Murphy, Ms Sherry and Dr. O'Connor.</p></speech>

We also have another 300 to 400 active files that we keep an eye on.  Our aim is not to get a property onto the derelict sites register but to deal with the dereliction.</p><p>Based on our experience, property owners do not deliberately let their properties go into dereliction.  We find that it arises because of title difficulties, probate issues, people with personal difficulties and lack of finances.  We have found that by engaging with people and trying to assist them, in the main people have been proactively working on their derelict properties.  Where we have had no response, we have compulsorily acquired 25 properties with another 12 are in the offing.  In the main, they have been refurbished and brought back into use as social homes.</p><p> It is about engaging with people.  It is not about putting them onto the derelict sites register.  It is not about Dublin City Council getting income from derelict sites.  We are doing all we can to encourage people to maintain their homes and not let them to go into dereliction.</p></speech>

The registers need to be publicly available, including online, because for the past year and a half people have not been able to call into local authority offices in their county to check registers.  I do not see any reason for them not being online.  That does not preclude engaging with property owners at the same time.  Properties can be recorded and put on the derelict sites register and engagement can happen simultaneously.  I cannot understand why it does not happen.</p></speech>

It is a law that should be used to its fullest because dereliction is on such a large scale and has gone on for so long.  Nine months ago, we reported hundreds of properties to Cork City Council.  Only four of those have been put on the derelict sites register in those nine months.  Obviously, we understand it takes time to put a property on the derelict sites register.  However, 72% of the derelict properties we identified, all within 2 km of Cork city island, have not been registered in the derelict register.</p> <p>  We have concerns when it comes to that approach of negotiating and working with the owners before a property goes on the derelict site register because as citizens, we do not have that transparency of knowing how many properties are under negotiation between owners and the local authority and for how long that negotiation has been going on.  For instance, Cork City Council claims it is investigating about 90 properties.  It has been 90 properties since 2019.  They may be a different set of 90 properties, but as citizens we just do not know.  That transparency is lacking when a property does not go on the derelict site register.</p></speech>

There is scope for appeals and it can be delayed.  In recent years we have taken the view that we will avoid putting properties on the register and rather encourage the owners to bring them back into use.  That is evidenced by the figures in my opening statement.</p></speech>

It is about enticing people to reuse a property.  For example, in Amsterdam people are required to register a property and if it has fallen into vacancy, not necessarily dereliction, people are encouraged to bring it back into use.  We need to begin to look at it that way.</p> <p>  In the middle of a housing crisis, we also have large build-to-rent properties being left empty, which is an absolute scandal.  That does not strictly fall under dereliction or going through a CPO process but, as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan said, there needs to be the stick of a vacant site tax for something that can be reasonably used for housing.  We need to do everything we can to reasonably bring it back into use for housing.  Based on my experience on Dublin City Council, I know of many houses where we do not necessarily know who the owners are.  It might be somebody who is either not living within the jurisdiction or in the local area and it is very difficult to get them to bring the property back into use.</p> <p>  With that in mind, I want to address the issue of funding so that local authorities can do the work we expect of them.  Sometimes we criticise local authorities too much for not bringing properties back into use.  We are inclined to think that everything is the local authorities' responsibility while at the same time not giving them the funding and powers to allow them to do that.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Clegg about the status of a property in Dolphin's Barn that Dublin City Council sold to a developer in 2017 because it did not have the ability to bring it back into use.  The developer then sat on it, did not bring it back into use and did not fulfil the terms of the agreement.  The same applied with the Iveagh Markets, which fell into dereliction after the property was disposed of and not brought back into use.</p> <p>  I want an explanation on Chapelizod.  It is a whole village.  I am delighted to see that Dublin City Council is moving to place CPOs on the sites in question.  Those buildings have been sitting there and through the derelict sites register the owner or developer has put pretty pictures in the windows.  It is still a village where there could be tens if not hundreds of homes that have been left vacant.  I ask Mr. Clegg to outline the status of the CPOs he mentioned in Chapelizod village.</p> <p>  The Plough Pub is another problem.  Dublin City Council bought that property with a view to getting a developer to build it and then leasing it back from the developer.  That again comes down to funding for local authorities.  Dublin City Council simply does not have the funding to be able to bring that back into use.</p> <p>  Does Ms Murphy know of any international comparators besides Scotland which have good data sets that not only identify dereliction but also vacancy?  Do Ms Murphy and Ms Sherry believe there is a place for "meanwhile use" within vacancy and dereliction?</p> <p>  I hope I did not go on too long.</p></speech>

She also mentioned the Plough Pub.  That site was one that was agreed to be disposed of by the city council.  We will actively look at the conditions of any agreement to ensure that developers do not breach those agreements.  In the main, after we make a disposal, the developers do not do so.  The Senator mentioned the Iveagh Market.  As she is aware, that site is currently subject to a mediation process between three parties.  I cannot really comment on the case.  A CPO is in place for Main Street in Chapelizod.  We are acquiring a number of derelict properties there.  Was the Senator asking about an overall regeneration plan for Chapelizod?  Is that her question?</p></speech>

That is the main issue.  I understand the constraints on the council.  Even if the sites are not the subject of a CPO and belong to the city council, I want to know what supports the Department is putting in place in terms of those large-scale sites.  From my experience on the city council, I recall that the default position is to sell sites on to the developer to be developed.  We were told that we could not develop sites ourselves because we did not have the resources to do so.</p></speech>

There are some sites we will develop ourselves, some that we want to dispose of, and others in respect of which we will get support from the Department.  With regard to the sites that I mentioned, when we talk about the Plough Pub, we are not, in the main, talking about a finance issue.  In that instance, we are looking at a practical way to deal with a property that has fallen into severe disrepair, and the most expedient way to bring it back into active use.  There is a mixed bag and a number of ways to deal with this area.</p></speech>

It offers a massive opportunity to use that vacancy as way to renovate, innovate and regenerate areas.  However, it only happens in other countries because they have strict building controls and costs associated with vacancies.  For example, in Amsterdam, it costs &euro;50,000 to keep a one-acre vacant site vacant.  The authorities there work with users, most often creative users, such as artists, designers, musicians and restaurateurs, to help them make use of these spaces in a fairly innovative way.  It can increase footfall significantly and regenerate areas.  I have lived close to large areas of Amsterdam where they have used it.  It regenerates a whole area and brings life back onto the streets that would otherwise be dead if vacancy was left to become normalised as it has in Ireland.  It is a massive opportunity to use sites, but it only generally works when there is a cost associated with vacancies.  In the likes of Amsterdam, it is the owners who go to the local authorities looking for meanwhile use of the buildings; it is not the local authorities that chase down the owners.  That is potentially the difference.  The owners are the proactive ones looking to reduce their costs because Amsterdam and other cities and countries actually heavily enforce their building controls.  There were significant dereliction and vacancy problems in Amsterdam in the 1970s and 1980s.  It is only by-----</p></speech>

I wish to thank the witnesses and, in particular, Anois, for sending in a comprehensive that we looked at in our private meeting in advance of today's session.  It is really impressive and comprehensive and contains a lot of information to tackle the misinformation that is out there regarding dereliction.</p> <p>  I come from the private sector, which I worked in before I became a Deputy.  I am all about best practice and sharing and setting targets.  I firmly believe that if you do not measure it, you will not change it.  No matter what statistics are used, whether they are from the GeoDirectory or the CSO, there is huge potential in unlocking vacant houses and turning them into homes for people.  The first step, as I see it, is quantifying the issue.  I do not believe that looking at four out of 162 electoral divisions and branding their figure of derelict houses, to use Mr. Shakespeare's term, as a realistic view of vacant housing, is how to do it.  Ms Murphy has outlined the solution to that data issue.  I think we really need to take on board her expertise and the international best practice, which she cited.</p> <p>  The second step, as I see it, is engaging with the homeowners and incentivising action.  Waterford City and County Council has proven to us that this is possible within the schemes that already exist, which are underutilised by most local authorities.  I am really pleased that representatives of the council are here today to give us a blow-by-blow account of how they achieved success through the likes of the repair and lease scheme.  I ask Mr. Grimes to use his experience not just to become a showcase for the success of how these schemes can be delivered, but also to provide a blueprint for how to do it right.  What we need to be doing is almost effectively developing a playbook on how it can be done - something that can be lifted and shifted to other local authorities in order that they can utilise the tools that have been spoken about, such as reaching out to estate agents and auctioneers, and the different tactics employed to make it a success.  That is how we learn.  There is no need to reinvent the wheel.  When we have a success story, we should utilise it and ensure that local authorities can use it.  All of us parliamentarians here are working in primarily different local authority areas, but we all work with colleagues in other local authorities.  Us having that information can help us to work with them, their housing directors and chief executives to bring homes out of dereliction.  I hope Mr. Grimes can lead the way on this and partner with the committee on it.</p> <p>  My first question to Mr. Shakespeare is as follows.  Does Dublin City Council have a full-time vacant homes officer?  It was great to get further context in the early part of the meeting when he explained a little more about the on-street engagement that takes place in respect of homes.  I sat down to read the council's submission before today's meeting.  It made for stark reading that the council could only find three vacant properties that would be worth tackling.  The council's statement mentions an initial figure of 213, which was then whittled down to three.  I am wondering where that figure of 213 came from.  Was it from the GeoDirectory or CSO, or was the figure based on the council's own findings as the reality on the ground?  I am interested in hearing if the council intends to look at the other 158 electoral divisions in the local authority.  If the council got something like a playbook from Mr. Grimes, would it consider applying his method and Ms Murphy's methodology in an attempt to turn more vacant properties into much-needed homes?</p></speech>

We will quite happily work with Mr. Grimes and his team in Waterford.  It can be difficult, though, to take a one-size-fits-all approach to these things.  The Deputy talked about sharing best practice.  We are in a constant learning environment.  None of us has the monopoly on the right way of doing anything, to be fair.  On the Deputy's question on the vacant homes officer, we do have a full-time officer.  On the initial figure 213 and the three vacant homes, it was a small sample size.  It was just to give us an indicative approach to it.  I think we are probably better off waiting for some of the census data and the local property tax returns, which we can layer over our data.  I fully agree with Ms Murphy in terms of the layering over of data.  It brings us to different levels of understanding the problem.  Hopefully, that has answered the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

There are probably bodies that Dublin City Council could be engaging with, for example, in terms of the Local Authorities Members Association and the Association of Irish Local Government doing information sessions for other councillors who could in turn start working with their local authorities a bit more effectively on this.</p></speech>

This is a really serious issue.  From my time in Cork City Council for 12 years and now in the D&aacute;il, I think it is a scandal.  My own constituency of Cork North-Central is blighted from the inner city areas to the rural areas with dereliction and vacancy.  Since I have come to Dublin for the past almost two years as a Deputy, the amount of dereliction and vacancy up here is nothing short of a crime.  I have spent the summers here for the past number of years and found that dereliction and vacancy is not an inner city problem, it is in every town and village and rural area, and it is being allowed to happen.  From what I can see, the Government, the Department and the local authorities will not tackle landowners who are hoarding land.  It is a complicated issue, but the major points are people holding land to maximise profit and the lack of funding to local authorities to hire the staff to compulsorily purchase the properties and the legal costs involved.  That can only be solved by support from central government and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p> <p>  I have questions to put to Anois, to Mr. O'Connor and Ms Sherry in regard to dereliction.  I see in my own constituency the antisocial behaviour, the gangs and the dumping that are caused when there are derelict and vacant sites.  In the work that Mr. O'Connor and Ms Sherry have done, going around to the hundreds of sites, what are the detrimental issues they see in regard to vacancy and dereliction?  For Professor Murphy who spoke in regard to vested interests and the holding of assets, does the professor believe that the current legislation on derelict sites and the levies and compulsory orders that exist are strong enough to tackle dereliction?  Is it the case that the local authorities and the Department are just not enforcing the law?  Can Mr. O'Connor and Ms Sherry answer first and then Professor Murphy?</p></speech>

When we talk about dereliction and long-term vacancy it is not just about the owner or about using the spaces, it is actually about the impact it has on the wider community.  Unfortunately today it has been disappointing to hear more about the owners of properties and the respect maybe given to them over that given to everyone else in the community, which is quite disheartening.  As a citizen who lives on a street with multiple derelict properties, and as Deputy Gould pointed out, I also live in the same area, Blackpool, and there is dereliction anywhere we walk in the area, nearly every street in this community has dereliction.  We only have to speak to our neighbour to realise the impacts it had, whether it is risk of rats, fires or collapsing buildings.  The illegal dumping that happens around dereliction is disgusting.  Much research shows there are far wider impacts and detrimental impacts on our physical and mental health from dereliction.  Research from the Scottish Land Commission identifies four main areas of impacts which are impacts on our mental and physical health, the obvious environmental pollutants and also the wider economic impacts from opportunity loss from loss of footfall and loss of investment confidence.  However, for us it is the community impacts, the loss of heritage, the community's reputation and the self-confidence in the area.  That is research that has shown the wider effects, that actually compared two areas with the same socio-economic backgrounds and if one area has high levels of vacancy and dereliction it has higher physical health problems and lower life expectancy.  It actually affects wider areas besides just a lack of use of spaces.</p></speech>

Ms Sherry mentioned antisocial behaviour.  If the Irish Government, if the State is not willing to enforce the law, what message does that give the citizens?  If it is okay to leave a property derelict, but it is not okay to dump on the street, then basically what we need to do is make sure the law is enforced.  Then the antisocial behaviour would reduce significantly.</p></speech>

They are seeing people being allowed to leave homes empty and go derelict all around them.  What message does that send to these children?  It is that they are less important, that they are not deserving of a home but others can leave their spaces empty for as long as they want without any repercussions.</p></speech>

It is an Act that confers extraordinarily broad powers on local authorities.  It is possible, as we are hearing today, that properties are not being put on the derelict sites register for various reasons.  This points to different approaches being applied in different ways in different places.  What I see as necessary is that we have a strategic approach that decides nationally what is the correct way that, for example, this legislation and the policy need to be actioned on the ground so it provides high level support and ensures local authorities have support from policy on the top to carry out the clear actions that they are allowed to do under the legislation but also at the same time that supports communities on the ground to get these properties back into use.  None of us disagree that this is a systemic, widespread, long-term problem.  We need system-based thinking to try to come up with various solutions - and it is a complex problem - at the national scale, the regional scale and the local scale.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

People are coming to my office every week who cannot rent houses or get social housing.  People are being given notices to quit, evictions and they look around their communities and look at vacant properties that could be turned into housing.  It is a scandal.  Local authorities are not being encouraged nor funded by the Government to do this.</p> <p>  I do not think it should be up to local authorities to feel or to give their impression.  The law is the law and they should enforce the law.  If a site is derelict they should apply the levies.  There are 13 local authorities that do not apply any levies and 21 of them will not collect 1 cent.  How are the Government and the Department allowing 21 local authorities not to collect any derelict sites levies while there are sites lying idle everywhere?  It is a scandal.</p></speech>

With the number of hands still indicating there is still an hour ahead of us.  The points made by Anois on the impact of dereliction on the wider community, as opposed to a solution to the housing crisis, is very important because what we want to do is identify solutions to dereliction.  That is not just to deliver more housing units.  It is because of the lived experience all of us have of the problems it causes.  I will take this opportunity to come back and clarify Dublin City Council's street survey because it is interesting and captures exactly the problem we have.  Of the 213 vacant homes there were 49, almost one quarter, identified by neighbours as being non-occupied, and 16 of those were long term.  Can Mr. Shakespeare explain the difference between those two figures for me?  What is the difference between the 49 being non-occupied and the 16 being long-term non-occupied?</p></speech>

That is the six-month rule.  So 90 days is long-term vacancy.  That reduces the figure of what was observed as being vacant and confirmed through a number of sources then being proposed through the schemes we have available to us.</p></speech>

One would like to think the local authority would have a watching brief on those 49 properties to see how many will go into that long-term category.  While those 49 properties are unoccupied, they have an impact on the community.  Illegal dumping is the principal problem in my area.  In unoccupied homes the grass is overgrown, the back garden becomes overgrown and rats become an issue.  Then there is the problem of illegal dumping.  We are trying to arrive at solutions here.  Is it the case that the local authorities have very few powers relating to those properties in the six-month category and longer?</p></speech>

There could be dumping in a front garden.  We receive lots of complaint on that and actively pursue the owners or occupiers to tidy up their gardens.  They might have buddleia growing.  We understand the impact that a dwelling like that can have on the whole street.  That is how we are somewhat conflating vacancy and dereliction.  However, we act on it.  The Deputy will be aware that our area office will contact us to alert us to a particular dwelling which, say, has dumping in the front garden and we contact the owners.

Is that fair?</p></speech>

However, we look at photographs now and they speak for themselves.  If someone has a boarded up house, that is derelict and we act on that.  We contact the owner and if there is no engagement we will go to acquiring that dwelling compulsorily.</p></speech>

Can Mr. Dinnigan give an insight into some of the derelict garden sites in Finglas west that were identified, which may have been sold off to builders who went bankrupt and so on, and how they were turned around.  There were a lot of solutions that delivered some of those sites back to the community.</p></speech>

We go in the direction that works well.  In some cases, there were very derelict homes and we engaged an approved housing body to go in and retrofit properties.  In other cases, we have gone in with colleagues in the development department to compulsorily acquire a unit where it has been difficult.  In other cases, we might do a simple acquisition and look for funding from the Department.  We look at a range of things and hopefully do what is the most effective.  Often we deal very closely with local elected representatives and the area office to do things.  In other cases, there can be family circumstances that are a little bit sensitive and that must also be handled carefully.  We take our read from the area offices and, obviously, our own investigations.  Then if needs be, we engage with the development department to take more extreme action of a CPO because it is the only option available to us and it is the most expedient way of bringing the unit back into stock.</p></speech>

The work of Professor Murphy and her colleagues, some of whom I know quite well, for more than a decade have found us where we are, endeavouring to recreate our historic centres that have ended up in their current position.  It was not that people were not interested.  Since the Act of Union, there has not been a lot of money in this country.  It is only in the past 20 years that we went through a boom and we are back in that space now.  We want to invest in these places.  It is provided for in the programme for Government.  I know from my experience as an architect and one working in the protected structures area that they are really expensive.  It is not fair to say that they are cheaper than new builds.  They are not.  I know from working with clients that they are more expensive to repurpose.  That is down to building regulations, which include fire, access, insurance, retrofitting and the planning process itself.</p><p>My questions have kind of been answered.  They were around the Housing for All policy that is being implemented and the measures to rebuild our town centres, including the vacancy offices.  Dublin City Council said that it has appointed somebody, which is great.  The council has been quite quick, unless the person was already there.  I heard that money was given to local authorities but it had been tagged on to someone working there.  However, if there is a specific person that is great.  Is the vacancy officer mapping out the vacancies in Dublin?  I would interested to hear first, how long it was envisaged that would take, if they have had those meetings.  Second, what are the legal and constitutional impediments restricting CPOs?  What legislative mechanisms can we put in place to make that an easier process?  Is it something that we will learn as we go forward because we have not been here before?  We have not compulsorily purchased large quantities of buildings across the State <i>en masse.  </i>What has Dublin City Council's experience been?  I am sorry that I am only going to the council.  I know that Waterford has had good experience because it has done quite a bit of work that I have seen.  How long is the council giving the vacancy office to map Dublin?  I refer to vacancy, not dereliction but the officials can include dereliction.  Is there anything that we as legislators can do to speed up the CPO process?  </p></speech>

He works with all the different teams within housing and the law department.  We rely on the data that comes from the census and the property tax assessment.  The Deputy will have heard about <i>vacanthomes.ie</i>where people can report vacant homes in their area and we can go out and carry out inspections.  We carry out 380 inspections a year based on information that comes in to us.  We also have the advantage of the local area office in each of the five electoral areas.  The managers at the senior level know their areas and work closely with communities and residents' associations and, indeed, elected members.  We are not exclusive about where the information comes from in respect of what we go out an inspect.  There is also a visual element that our guys on the ground can tackle.We are very happy that we have that person in place.  They have gained huge experience in the past three or four years around what is realisable around the two schemes.<br/><br/>We think the building renewal scheme is very successful even if the numbers might look comparatively small.  People have spoken about the material effect on the rest of the neighbourhood and the street when a derelict or ruinous house is brought back into commission and a family is living in it again.  It is something we would be keen to pursue.  Repair and lease has been less successful in the city and there are reasons for that.</p><p>Nevertheless, it looks as though there is good practice for us to learn from.  If that is shared with the rest of the local authority, we would be very happy to see whether there is anything we can implement in the city to let it grow and expand.</p></speech>

My understanding is the push the Government wants is to ensure we find these units and, if they are not being used after six months, CPO them.  Do our guests see an issue with our current legislative space or can we do that easily, in their experience?</p></speech>

The powers of CPO are clearly laid out in a number of items of legislation.  Before a local authority can acquire land, there has to be a clear purpose for the CPO.  All going well, a CPO can be achieved in about 18 months, but there are complications.  What delays a CPO can be its size, the rental and reference process where all the interests have to be determined and the question of whether there are objections, which can go to an oral hearing.  In the main, it can take quite a long time for the oral hearing to happen.  After that, there could be a judicial review of the process.</p> <p>  CPOs are expensive and the market value has to be paid.  In addition, there could be a disturbance or a commercial property could experience a loss of profit or good will, and there could also be professional fees.  As a process, however, there are no inhibitions in the legislation that is in place.  It is more about identifying, in the first instance, the clear purpose for the CPO.</p> <p>  If we identify a vacant home, we do not just say we will purchase it.  In the first instance, for all CPOs, we want to acquire by agreement with the owner.  In the main, however, regarding the residential element, our compulsory purchases have targeted derelict homes to bring them back into social housing.  If, following surveys that are carried out, there are clear data and statistics on vacant homes that will arise next year, that is something we can then consider in the context of acquiring homes.  As part of our social housing programme, Dublin City Council acquires homes throughout the city that are for sale and that go back into housing stock, although I appreciate we are talking about vacancy in particular.</p></speech>

Is a housing crisis, where there is a shortage of housing and long waiting lists, not a good enough reason to enter a CPO process?  Is that not the critical question we need to ask here?</p></speech>

In the context of our severe housing crisis at the moment, why is it that local authorities in general do not proactively pursue vacant properties and derelict sites as a significant potential part of the solution to our housing crisis?</p></speech>

A reference is done on a CPO and the property we are going to acquire is clearly defined.  Perhaps, in future when we have data, a CPO could be done of a particular area, whereby we would identify four or five vacant properties, but we have not clearly defined vacancy or identified what vacant properties we should acquire.  Somebody with a vacant property can also sell it on the open market, so the question then is why the property has not been sold.  There may be issues with probate or the title.  When we clearly define what a vacant property is, we can look to acquiring property for residential purposes.  The property that is available has to be clearly defined.  As I said earlier, CPOs have to have a clear purpose-----</p></speech>

I do not think CPO is the solution here.  The CPO process, in my experience on the city council, can take ten years from when a property has been identified, and still properties are not being returned to the housing stock.  This is not just Dublin City Council; it relates to all the local authorities.</p> <p>  My question is a broader, more strategic one.  Why are the local authorities not actively targeting, in a co-ordinated way, these vacant, unused properties to bring them into active housing use?  Is it just too complicated or too expensive?</p></speech>

I think it boils down to what is called the Pareto principle.  More energy and effort is needed to get a relatively few number of vacant properties occupied than is the case to select larger sites or to rezone land for greenfield development, which is still a priority in some areas throughout the country.  The latter is easier to do and can be done with far fewer time and resource implications.  We should be doing both in parallel.  Pursuing vacant properties alone will not be the solution to the housing crisis.</p></speech>

A number of them that are listed as being under Dublin City Council's ownership are being removed because they are being developed under the new Housing for All strategy, such as in Shanganagh or Ballymun, where a further 100 units were proposed today.  I welcome that, and we could hold a full meeting on the issue of holding local authorities to account to ensure they deliver on that.</p> <p>  My concern relates to commercial units, which are found in every village.  Ballymun shopping centre is one of them.  For those derelict sites that are in either public or private ownership, is there a method for the local authorities to turn them around, given that owning commercial properties does not come within their role?  Another committee member mentioned a pub earlier and we know the controversy around that.  My instinct suggests there is no policy tool that assists the council to develop commercial properties because it is a housing authority rather than a commercial development authority.</p></speech>

There is a perception the developer might do something, and a bad planning application has been lodged.  I do not want our guests to respond to any individual case.  My point is it does not appear the local authority has the policy tools to deal with those sorts of commercial sites.</p></speech>

We would basically be acquiring a derelict site.  When it comes to developing the site, the whole disposal process, as it is set at the moment, would be that this site could only be used for social housing.  Even though a site like that might be best used for some sort of mixed-use development, in the main any public sites that we have are used for public housing.  Basically, in that instance, we would be acquiring a developed site that we could not, in effect, develop for its best use.  That could be mixed use or it could be entirely commercial.  It is best left to the private sector to acquire and develop that site.</p></speech>

Anybody looking in on this meeting will be tearing their hair out.  I am certainly tearing out what little hair I have left on my head.  It seems to be excuse after excuse.  The Government can only come up with policy interventions.  We cannot do this on our own.  We need local authorities to deliver under the schemes that are in place.</p> <p>  To paraphrase Mr. O&rsquo;Hara's response, he said essentially that we should be dealing with greenfield sites as well as pursuing this mechanism to deliver housing.  Nobody is suggesting we should only go through this mechanism.  It has to be both.  However, it seems from the responses that witnesses are saying this area is not worth the effort and it is much is easier to deliver units on greenfield sites.  I just do not accept that.  It takes a lot of work but we can unlock developments.  We need to utilise best practice.  Louth County Council has utilised CPOs to great effect and Waterford City and County Council has utilised the repair and leasing scheme to great effect.  We need to take best practice from those areas and apply it across all local authorities without exception.</p> <p>  What targets do Dublin City Council and Waterford City and County Council have for the repair and lease scheme for 2022, 2023 and 2024?  Will the witnesses comment on the commercial aspect, on which Deputy McAuliffe touched?  Regulations are in place which exempt, in the case of a certain number of classes of buildings, proposals to change from commercial to residential use from planning requirements.  That does not include pubs and restaurants.  Mr. Grimes mentioned that a number of derelict former pubs had been brought back into productive use.  I have seen this personally.  People are living in such units as we speak.  Do the councils agree that we should extend that exemption to include former pubs and restaurants that have been derelict and vacant for a number of years?</p></speech>

This changed slightly in the last two weeks when some developers came in to the scheme with multiple units.  That looks promising but I do not want to talk about something that has not come to fruition yet.  However, there seems to be a bit of a change there.  We saw that the buy and renew scheme seemed to be the most successful pathway for us.  For this reason, significant resources were directed at that scheme which is where the viable projects came through, and that continues to be the case.  We referred to 99 units under that scheme over the next couple of years.</p></speech>

On the other point, extending the current exemption, that would certainly be helpful.  I mentioned that we have had a number of developments.  Unfortunately, some closed pubs have come in under the repair and lease scheme, while others have come in under our social housing programme.  I will let Mr. Johnston answer on targets.</p></speech>

We have specifically targeted vacant properties through both schemes as part of our social housing delivery.  Approximately 30% of our delivery has been through the return to use of vacant properties.  We have done that deliberately because of the benefits it provides.  Some 25% of our applicants want to live in Waterford city centre and this approach is a clear and obvious way of delivering that.</p> <p>  To answer the Senator&rsquo;s question, we do have targets.  Going forward, we have approximately 50 units per annum under the repair and lease scheme.  As Mr. Grimes mentioned, the planning exemptions have been beneficial.  Again, much of this is about value and how things are valued.  The value of public houses has changed.  One has to look at the value in property and the use in property.  Much of this relative.  It goes back to the value of the information, which was mentioned, how it is used and how that value is brought to bear to get all of these properties back into use.  As the Senator mentioned, the exemption does not currently extend to licensed premises.  I believe that was because the licence on a premises was a way of controlling that.  A further change would be required to get those premises into use.</p></speech>

In the three years since the regulation came in, we have had 78 notifications.  This has a potential for just over 200 homes or apartments.  Every home and conversion is good and will improve the poor image of dereliction from some of these shops and public houses.  However, it is not a solution to the housing crisis.  It is a part solution but we need housing at volume to deal with the housing crisis.</p></speech>

Is the problem legislative deficiencies in the Act itself?  Is it a lack of resources, either human resources or financial resources, required to use the Act?  Anybody can answer any question but I would specifically like to hear from the local authorities on this one.</p><p> Regarding legislative deficiencies, Ms Sherry and Dr. O'Connor from Anois pointed to Scotland as having strengths and mentioned compulsory sales orders as one example of the comparative strengths of the Scottish regime.  Are there others?  I ask the witnesses to be succinct when replying.</p><p> Going back to the local authorities, would they find compulsory sales orders more attractive than compulsory purchase orders?  This would mean they could get an order stating something had to be sold on the open market, presumably by public auction, and let the market decide its value and what would be done with it.  Inevitably most people would agree there could be commercial opportunities for some derelict sites.</p><p> I am not an architect and I do not have Deputy Duffy's level of expertise.  He mentioned the difficulty with bringing old buildings back and the expense.  My understanding is that an old building is not subject to new build regulations if it is maintained but there is a bit of a grey area if substantial construction work is required.  If something is being brought back from dereliction, there may be an argument that it involves substantial construction work and then it may be subject to the building regulations.  Perhaps this is a question particularly for Professor Murphy to answer.  Is this the case?  Nobody is suggesting they should be turned into hovels or substandard accommodation, but account needs to be taken of the fact they are very old buildings and it will be very difficult to achieve A status insulation.  Is there a case to be made for a specific project or regime covering old buildings being brought back into use so they may not have to meet the very highest standards?  I do not suggest that substandard accommodation should be acceptable but there should be something lower.  It is something that Shelley McNamara, and notwithstanding that she is my namesake and is from Clare, I have never met her, has proposed by way of trying to bring our towns and town centres back from dereliction.</p></speech>

It is not that we are reluctant to use the Act.  It is more that we believe we can use alternative means to bring vacant and derelict property back into use.  As I outlined in our opening statement, we have been relatively successful at that in Waterford in recent years.  It would be very interesting to flesh out the Deputy's comment on compulsory sales orders.  Whatever about challenges to compulsory purchase orders, I would expect significant legal challenges to compulsory sales orders.  It is an interesting thought.</p></speech>

It is something we use quite extensively.  There are some changes we would like on interest payments.  We have 76 sites on the register and we are looking at approximately 400 active sites from a dereliction point of view.  The Act is positive from our point of view.</p></speech>

Perhaps some clarity could be provided afterwards as to whether it is a legal possibility.  The reason we have proposed a three-pronged approach to tackling dereliction and vacancy is because no one approach or no one piece of legislation will tackle it on its own.  For instance, France has shown that a vacancy tax, which we urgently need, would bring approximately 13% of vacant units back into use.  We can see it is effective and it does work but on its own it is not enough.</p> <p>  We see vacancy as the gateway to dereliction.  Long-term vacancy in a building will lead to dereliction.  Dereliction relates more to impact on the community.  A home that has been vacant for five years has an impact on the community as we lose out on neighbours and the area is made less safe from having fewer people in it.  Amsterdam takes a proactive approach.  As it has already tackled the dereliction problem, there is only a 2% vacancy rate.  Amsterdam takes a very proactive approach to tackling vacancy through compulsory rental orders.  Instead of trying to change ownership of the building, the authorities want to make sure all homes are used.  If a home has been empty for longer than six months, it is the owner's responsibility to report it.  If the owners do not report it within six months, they are fined &euro;2,500.  If they do not pay this fine, they can be fined up to &euro;15,000.  If they do not bring the home back into use within a year, the council can put a tenant into the building to make sure it is used.  The owners have no say about this but they do maintain ownership.</p> <p>  Likewise in Barcelona, new laws have been introduced.  If a building is empty for longer than a year, the council can put someone into it but the owners receive only half the market rate of the rental.  We can see that rental orders-----</p></speech>

A protected structure does not need to meet the nearly zero energy building standard.  There are exemptions in the building regulations.  However it is perceived as an obstacle because the combination of part B on fire regulations and part M on universal access and conservation status can mean that, collectively, it can be challenging to bring these buildings back into use.  A one-stop shop that builds support from the local authorities to help owners use the building is what is needed in this case.</p></speech>

I do not think it is the case that one local authority is doing really well and others are not.  In fact all of the figures for local authorities are poor.  It is just that some are much poorer than others.  This is no criticism of the staff in local authorities.  I do not envy the job they have.  When we see just 8% of the repair and lease target met across all local authorities over five years, we begin to see Professor Murphy's point about a systemic problem and this is the more important point to raise.</p> <p>  We have spoken about data and some of the structures.  My specific questions are for Mr. Grimes and Mr. Shakespeare and to Professor Murphy and Anois.  Looking ahead, if we want to ramp up bringing back into use vacant and derelict properties, what do we need to change with regard to the financing and types of schemes we are running to ensure any local authority that wants to ramp up its bringing back into use of vacant units, especially for mixed use for social, affordable and non-residential, can do so?  From the experience of Mr. Shakespeare and Mr. Grimes, what would be helpful in terms of flexibility in the schemes?  Do Professor Murphy and Anois have lessons from other jurisdictions, perhaps Scotland or elsewhere, on what else they are doing on the financing and structure of the schemes to tackle this issue?</p></speech>

As Mr. Clegg alluded to, we need to develop an affordable rental model that could go side by side with the repair and lease scheme, which would give mixed tenure.  One would also bring in more properties because some property owners are resistant to going down the social route.</p></speech>

It is about whether we want to further subsidise those schemes to make them so attractive that they grow or whether resources would be better spent elsewhere.  That is always the key decision.</p> <p>  We want to develop every strand given the crisis we are in and the waiting list.  Earlier Dr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; Downey made a point about resource intensification into a particular strand.  That does not give me the quantum of houses that would really start to address the housing list.  It is about getting the calibration right.  It does not help if a scheme is not attractive to the market.  It might be welcome to make an urban adjustment to the repair and lease scheme to reflect the different circumstances in different construction markets.</p> <p>  The buy and renew aspect is particularly strong and there is another element.  We do not want to get into competition with first-time buyers in a lot of areas.  That issue needs to be carefully managed.  The buy and renew scheme is the more attractive strand to us so continued funding, support and approval from that end would certainly be worthwhile. </p> <p>  It is critical to define a vacancy because it would mean that all of the different data gathers can work off the same definition.  The figures that are coming at us include everything from 30,000 down to single thousands. </p></speech>

Did that bring many vacant commercial properties back into use?  What has been the experience?</p> <p>  I have questions for both councils in Waterford and Dublin.  How many section 11 notices have they issued in the previous three years?  The officials may not have the figures with them so I would appreciate if they could send them to us after the meeting.  </p> <p>  For both local authorities, how many vacant sites do they own?

The anecdotal data indicates that the property probably changes hands and gets developed.  I can talk to our head of finance and see because that is the best way to ascertain information on whether they come into the rates net.  I will get back to the Senator on the section 11 notices.</p> <p>  In terms of the potential yield from the city council's own sites, we have 17 sites at various stages that have a potential to yield north of 3,500.  One might say that is O'Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road so that is the scale.  Mr. Clegg has the number for section 11s.  </p></speech>

Due to the combined value of the projects north of the River Liffey being in excess of &euro;100 million we must go through a completely new process with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The situation is less complicated on the southside.  We have established a project team to deliver on the overall urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, scheme but there are individual project managers who are working, say, on Parnell Square at the moment.  We are about to go to tender on the Victorian fruit and vegetable market.  We are on site for a couple of pieces on the southside in term of the public realm.  We are making progress but one of the biggies is to get over the hurdle of putting together a business case for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because the combined value of the projects is in excess of &euro;100 million for the concept area on the north side of the Liffey.  I hope that I have answered the question.</p></speech>

Is it her experience that to bring a derelict or commercial building back into residential use, the regulations are cumbersome, awkward and difficult for somebody who wishes to carry out that work?</p></speech>

It is an awkward process and one must jump through a number of hoops such as comply with the fire and building regulations.  Is there something that we can do to keep the standards as high as they should be but make the process a little bit easier?</p></speech>

At the moment it feels as if we have built a system that is barrier-based when, if we think about the problem, what we want is to flip that situation completely so that the system is support-based.  This afternoon we have heard about local authorities engaging with people in their towns and city districts to help them with derelict properties but I do not think that is happening in a co-ordinated way, and in a way that can be a softer approach and is also supported by more streamlined legislation.</p><p>It is a complicated process and there are financial barriers.  We have had many reports to try to understand those barriers and opportunities.  This links to a point I wanted to make in response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question.  We should not forget that we need to have confidence in our urban areas being beautiful, attractive places to live and that people will then want to move into them.  When we do that, we should make sure that any property that has been vacant for a long time is released back to the market.  There needs to be some kind of taxation strategy to disincentivise active hoarding.  At the same time, we have to build confidence to make the procedure as easy as possible and to be supportive in everything we do, so that we do not see legislation as being barrier-led but enabling-led.</p></speech>

We have developed that in the city to help people.  We need to streamline the processes to get rid of the barriers.  Our experience of the Living City initiative is that there is a comparatively low uptake.  We are veering towards recommending that a grant system be introduced, as in Amsterdam.  One gives a person a grant of up to &euro;25,000 and that person has to comply with certain measures.  Rather than "Bungalow Bliss" or apartment bliss, we can get on with a certain typology.</p></speech>

It needs everything done to it, including work on the roof, ceiling, electrics and plumbing.  It is way more cost effective and cheaper for us to buy or do a new build or turnkey on the same street as us.  It is one third of the price.  If we are just renovating an old home, we have to do many things and build many things.  There is a great guide from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage about building regulations for old homes.  It is called Bringing Back Homes - Manual for the Reuse of Existing Buildings.  It was extremely helpful.  It demystified those building regulations and showed that they were not a barrier for bringing homes back into use.  Half of the properties that we identified in Cork city centre are homes and none of these building regulations prevents homes being brought back into use.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Mr. Shakespeare identified a couple of challenges with that.  One is that no interest is payable.  He pointed to the appeals mechanism being there at every stage and being cumbersome and difficult for local authorities to overcome.  As we move to the new zoned land tax, are there particular lessons that we can take from the experience of local authorities to see how we can build those into the guidelines?  One of the practicalities is that local authorities will be tasked with mapping out the areas that will come under that.  Are local authorities adequately resourced to do that?  Can that update be done quickly every year?  There are exclusions from that.  Do the witnesses have any advice about how we tackle the appeals issue?  That would be valuable because it is important that this works.</p></speech>

A key lesson from the vacant site levy is that, whatever levy has to attach to the land, it cannot attach to the individual.  If you dispose of a site, it is zero down again.  To avoid anything like that, any levy or tax has to apply to the site.  Regarding resourcing implications, I would be lying to the Deputy if I said I knew.  We need to see what will come at us.  We will assess that and deploy whatever resources we need to try to get it done as efficiently as we can.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the appeals process.  We have identified that there are four appeals avenues.  One is when we propose putting a site on the vacant site register, after which people can make a submission to us.  If we decide to continue, people can appeal to the board.  When we put a value on it, they can appeal to the Valuation Tribunal.  When we send out the demand, they can appeal the demand to the board too.  It is cumbersome, with the submission and the three appeals processes.  Waiting for the result of an appeal puts the case in abeyance.  That is the point that we would make.</p></speech>

After the submission is made, I would ask why there is the potential for another appeal.  When the demand is sent out, it has to be clarified by the Valuation Tribunal.  The board has to decide that it should be subject to the vacant site levy.  It is hard to understand the rationale behind that final appeal process.</p></speech>

I have seen perfect examples of it in my own county, Waterford.  I would like this meeting to lead to workshops being held across local authorities, where best practice can hopefully be replicated.  If the speakers have some time in their concluding remarks, could they address the Living City initiative and what they would like to see in the continuation or otherwise of that scheme?  Would they support an increase in the age limit of the property and extending it over a longer period?  What specifics would they like to see implemented?</p></speech>

According to the figures I have, Dublin City Council has &euro;3.5 million of derelict site levies outstanding and it has only collected &euro;142,000.  Over &euro;1 million of derelict site levies have not been collected.  Will someone explain those figures?  The derelict site levy should be issued and collected.</p></speech>

However, every derelict site charge is attached to a property.  They are always payable.</p><p>As Mr. Shakespeare said, they travel with the land so we will ensure that a charge is put on each property for any outstanding levies.  The interest rate is quite punitive as well.  The 7% and the interest rate can be inhibitors to development for people who cannot afford it so there is a balance to be struck.  The charge follows the property and it is always collectable.</p></speech>

As I said at the outset, this is a series of three meetings the committee agreed to because we want to look at all the issues around vacancy, dereliction, urban regeneration and all the different schemes and objectives there are.  I would like to give each of the four groups a minute each to mention the salient points they would like us to do something about as legislators.  I will start with Anois.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.673" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Frank O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021121400002#T00300"><p>We have normalised dereliction and vacancy and we have a culture that accepts that is the way things are.  We need to prioritise the needs of citizens over &ldquo;the poor owners&rdquo;.  We need to proactively target the law and bring in new measures.  Other countries have done this so why can we not do so in Ireland?  There are no more excuses; this needs to happen immediately.  We should not have people on the street in Ireland at any time of the year and it is particularly heartbreaking coming up to Christmas.  The social contract has to be fixed and now is the time to do it.  We can have no more excuses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.674" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021121400002#T00400"><p>We all agree that the system is broken because of the persistence of this vacancy and dereliction issue and its negative impact on our towns and cities.  We need a different approach and that approach has to be collaborative, system-led and supportive.  We have legislation and policy and we need to make them happen and be deliverable on the ground.  We need evidence and data to prove what is working and what is not working and have long-term plans to deliver.  We do not necessarily need more solutions but we need to think more collectively, collaboratively and effectively about the solutions we have and how we implement them with better effect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.675" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ivan Grimes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021121400002#T00500"><p>One of the previous speakers mentioned having targeted delivery in vacant stock and that is critical.  The existing schemes provide timely delivery and they are prompt and cost effective.  They are delivering one and two-bed units in urban areas where they are critically needed so from our perspective they are ticking a lot of boxes.  There is also the point of regeneration, which we should not forget.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-12-14a.676" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Shakespeare" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021121400002#T00600"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I will not say today was an enjoyable experience but it was informative and I hope we helped in that regard.  If the Chairman is asking me for a wish list I would say that if we could truncate some of the processes it would be helpful.  Sometimes the one-size-fits-all approach does not really help.  There need to be local exceptions as both Mr. Grimes and Mr. Dinnigan have said about their different experiences of the two schemes.  We must get clarity on the data and how we use it to deliver better outcomes for everybody.</p></speech>

I am sorry if I had to cut members off but they can see the level of interest; members still have their hands up so we could go on for another few hours.  We have another two meetings in this series and we will produce a report.  If anything occurs to the witnesses in the meantime and they wish to make written submissions or to add further to questions they were asked then we would be happy to take those written submissions and try to include them in the report, which we hope to produce early next year.</p></speech>
