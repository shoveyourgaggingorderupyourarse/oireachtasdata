We take the 12 items of correspondence as noted.  I want to discuss one item, namely, that relating to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in private session at 4 p.m. when we are discussing the draft report on the stimulus package.  A draft of the committee's report, Stimulating Enterprise in the Economy, has been circulated and will be considered in private session, with a view to it being published tomorrow.  Additional reports are being drafted on testing and contact tracing and Covid-19 in nursing homes, and an interim progress report is being prepared.  We have had extensive discussion of the fact that they are being prepared, rather than their contents, in the working group.  We can discuss the actual draft report at 4 p.m.</p></speech>

It is my first chance to address the committee.  I have been going through some of the reports that were circulated.  The World Health Organization has warned that the Covid-19 pandemic risks sparking a global mental health crisis.  It was very telling this morning to see the Mental Health Reform survey on the impact of Covid-19, which was published this morning and in which all 75 Mental Health Reform member organisations were invited to take part.  Some 74% of Mental Health Reform members agreed that the Government has not done enough to address the mental health impact of the Covid-19 pandemic; 92% agreed that the mental health services required additional resources to deal with the mental health impact of the Covid-19 pandemic; 48% reported that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on their organisation in the month prior to completing the survey; and 55% had to cancel fundraising events or delivery of services while another 10% are expected to do so in the near future.  Some 76% had to withdraw services they normally provide due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  It goes to show the strain that seems to be coming down the line for mental health services and mental health provision over the next while.  How do Mental Health Ireland's members see themselves addressing these issues?  What additional resources and supports are needed, financially and organisationally?  That is taking into consideration that the World Health Organization recommends that 12% of the health budget should be allocated to mental health.  Currently, Ireland stands at 7%.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate Mitchell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#B00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  The survey we published today really does show the increase in prevalence of mental health difficulties, but also the increase in demand on mental health services and supports.  While the sector has been incredibly responsive and has adapted very quickly to the increased demand and need in terms of mental health, it does not negate the fact that there are challenges for these services.  As the Deputy rightly mentioned, many of our member organisations have stated that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on their organisation.</p><p>Some 75% reported that they had to withdraw services they would normally provide, while 35% reported that there has been a negative impact on fundraising and earned income in the past month.  More than 50% reported increasing demand on their services and more than 80% identified that they expect increased demand in the future.  It is imperative that the community and voluntary sector, in addition to public mental health services, receive additional support and resources.  The survey indicates that 50% of the members who responded had not received assurances from the relevant Departments and agencies that their funding under existing funding agreements and periods was guaranteed.  That is a very practical measure that could be taken in the first instance.  We are coming up to budget 2021 and it is imperative that there is a clear commitment to adequate resourcing for mental health services in the public and community and voluntary sectors.</p><p> Ireland's new mental health policy was published on 17 June.  It places an increased focus on a continuum of mental health services and supports, from early intervention and mental health promotion right through to specialist and acute services.  It identifies the need for enhanced community and primary care supports.  Through that policy we need to see adequate funding of and investment in services.  The new policy should be fully costed this year and there should be a commitment to funding for the years to come.</p></speech>

I represent the Dublin Mid-West constituency and grew up in north Clondalkin.  As the representatives of Jigsaw know, that is where the service was first located.  It was borne out of a need for intervention after a spate of youth suicides in my area.  Many of those children were the sons or daughters of friends and neighbours of mine.  Jigsaw decided to restructure, move out of the area and go from providing a five-day comprehensive service within our community to a proposed one or two-day satellite service.  I was part of a very strong campaign to retain the service in north Clondalkin.  The campaign is a testament to the work of Jigsaw in north Clondalkin.  The community rallied around to keep the service there because of the vital work it was doing in our area.  With the onset of Covid, many residents and others in the greater Clondalkin area are a little in the dark regarding the current status of the service that is available.  What will the new service look like?  When will it be operational?  Where it will be located?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joseph Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#C00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question and for his support of Jigsaw over a considerable period, particularly in Clondalkin and its surrounding areas.  As he will know and other Deputies will probably be aware, there has been a significant surge in demand and need for support across all of the Jigsaw services.  We suspended face-to-face services on 12 March but, from today, we will be able to again roll out those services.  It is particularly important to state that, given the significant increase in demand - there has been a 200% increase in those seeking support through our e-mental health platforms - we have worked very hard in recent months to provide phone, video and online support.</p> <p>  In regard to support offered in Dublin south-west in particular, we are providing support in Tallaght which will cover all of the south-west Dublin area.  We had planned to open outreach support in the Clondalkin area in April but, as a result of Covid-19, we obviously had to suspend that face-to-face support.  Our plan is to roll it out and continue to do so.  From next week, we will be able to provide face-to-face support in the Dublin south-west area.  We are currently able to provide phone, video and online support and have been able to do so since March.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#C00400"><p>One of the problems with the service being moved from Dublin mid-west to Dublin south-west is the lack of public transport and infrastructure.</p><p>There are many areas that would not have a direct bus route up to Tallaght in the Clondalkin and Lucan area, which makes matters quite difficult.  It is also quite difficult for young people who are suffering from mental health trauma, or whatever they are experiencing at the time, to get on a bus or some other form of public transport and make their way somewhere when they may have something that is really local to them.  When consideration is being given to the location of the satellite service, could this to be taken on board?  This would be really appreciated by the people in Clondalkin because they would have easier access to the service there than to that in Tallaght.  In a further question on the face-to-face operation that is due to start on 20 July, how does Jigsaw see this happening and will it have an impact on waiting lists and waiting times?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joseph Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#D00200"><p>We are following all of the HSE and Government guidelines as to providing face-to-face supports, adhering to social distancing and so on.  We have conducted an audit of our 12 centres across the country and are providing the appropriate supports within them.  We have been offering young people phone and video support and will continue to offer that combined level of support.  Some people need direct, face-to-face support and they need to be able to come into the centre and have it as a safe space.  We will be prioritising those young people.  We hope that some young people will be able to have their initial assessments within the centres and can then continue the support either through the video service or by phone.  We are hoping to be able to provide a wider breadth of entry points into the service by using various different technologies, as I have outlined.  We will have to wait to see if there is an increase in referrals, particularly in the context of young people looking for face-to-face support.  We will be encouraging them to avail of a number of different options.</p></speech>

There was a stigma about talking about how one felt when I was growing up around the area, especially among young men.  One would be worried about what other people thought.  I commend Jigsaw because one of the impacts it has had in north Clondalkin is that it allowed young people to have a place where they could talk about how they were feeling.  Not only could they speak in a safe place with Jigsaw, they were also bringing knowledge of this back out into the community and having that peer support and help for each other.  I thank Jigsaw and the witnesses for coming here today.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leo.</p></speech>

On different service delivery types, options and pathways for young people coming in, does Dr. Duffy believe that the online options are working better for people than the face-to-face service or is the interaction different?  What is his experience of the nature of this enforced change?  Can Dr. Duffy speak about this in a qualitative way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joseph Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#D00600"><p>For some young people, it is an adjustment, particularly if they were attending the service before and had relationships with particular clinicians.  For some other young people, the idea of getting support online is a very good introduction because they can do that anonymously and build up their confidence in terms of connecting with it.  We are seeing a 50-50 split between phone and video.  There are certainly young some young people who need the one-to-one support because, based on family circumstances or the physical space at home, they may not have a safe space in which to make a call.</p></speech>

The problem in this regard has been exacerbated in certain circumstances.  Are our guests concerned about an increase in the number of referrals relating to abuse or to domestic issues that are having an impact on the children who are presenting?  Have our guests seen something of this nature or not?</p></speech>

We have seen the importance of a supportive adult in the life of a young person and some young people have been, shall we say, pleasantly surprised by how their family have come together to support them at a difficult time, when they are missing out on some of the normal structures, such as school, friends and sporting activities. </p><p> There are certain families who are experiencing extreme distress and stress at this time and, sometimes, that is manifesting in more conflict in relationships at home.  Certainly, as Dr. Duffy was explaining, having different entry points to the mental health system, and having low threshold entry points where people can engage anonymously, provides an opportunity for some young people to flag if they are experiencing abuse at home and to receive the appropriate support or be signposted and directed to the appropriate support.</p></speech>

Is that what he is saying?  It has been a very different picture for different children, has it not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Longmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#E00300"><p>Absolutely.  One of the messages we always talk about in Jigsaw is the importance of trusted adults in the life of young people.  We see that communities and families can play a very important role in supporting young people's mental health.  Maybe some adolescents might have been a bit sceptical about that but when they were trapped at home with their parents, they actually found that families bonded and came together, and that shared time together proved to be a supportive thing rather than a difficulty.  There has been a range of experiences, without a doubt, and it is very hard to say there was only one experience for young people during the Covid restrictions.</p></speech>

Of course, when a young person has a relationship with a clinician, to move that online is very difficult.  On the other hand, we have all of these different entry points that we are all experiencing in different ways, which can provide greater access, and we have had this different, disrupted experience of having more time with family, more time at home and a slower pace, all of which have different impacts on general well-being and mental health.  It is interesting.</p> <p>  While I have enormous time and respect for Mr. Longmore's sector, other sectors are experiencing similar disruptions in the delivery of their services.  For example, I was talking to Multiple Sclerosis Ireland about the difficulty in providing physio and other support.  It is happening in every sector but it is interesting to hear about the complexity of the different experiences.  As I am out of time, I thank the witnesses. </p></speech>

How do we compare to other countries in Europe with that spend?</p> <p>  Older people who have been cocooning, many on their own, have experienced increased isolation and increased pressure, and some may have early-stage dementia.  There is a lot of concern that while older people have historically been very independent and very settled in their communities, they are particularly isolated.  How can we improve our services for older people, particularly mental health services? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.34" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Rogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#E00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  It is a very important piece.  We have received some very good advice from the WHO in recent weeks in regard to the management of Covid but it also gives advice on the level of resources we should invest in our mental health services.  Its minimal recommendation is 12% of the entire health allocation.  In Ireland, in the past we spent up to 23% of health spending on mental health and when I began my career in the mid-1980s, it was at 12%.  We have drifted downwards and, unfortunately, we do not compare well with our European colleagues and we do not even compare well with ourselves in that regard.</p> <p>  To provide a mental health service in the best of times with 7% of health spending is difficult, and this clearly is not the best of times as there is an additional demand coming.  We hear some unhelpful language about a tsunami of need coming.</p><p>That will present itself in a variety of ways in that people have been dislocated and unsettled by the experience.  The lives of everyone, including individuals who have not been ill with Covid, who have not had an ill family member or who have not experienced a bereavement, have been changed.  It would be very unusual and, in fact, quite unhealthy if this did not provoke some degree of anxiety and upset, or anger in some instances.  It has been discovered that many families have bonded more when cocooned together in close proximity but some have found that very difficult.  Covid has had an amplifying effect, therefore.</p><p> Some of  conversations with international colleagues have been fascinating.  Some of our US colleagues have teams who specialise in dealing with major adverse events, such as weather events or terrorist events.  They have described not only the important need for additional investment but also the question of how it should be used.  They have said that in the two years after Hurricane Katrina, for example, additional expenditure on just three conditions - anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress - was $13 billion.  That was the same as the amount needed to fix the levees that had flooded during the event.</p><p> It is important to remember that we need a series of tiered responses.  Most communities will rally together and respond well.  We have seen a huge upswing in volunteering and neighbourliness, and we have also seen a huge community bond.  Many have never experienced it except in the past couple of months.  That has been a real positive for us.  We have demonstrated what we can achieve when Irish people pull together, with good leadership, support and information.  People have used a range of techniques, particularly technology, to reach out.</p><p> Deputy O'Dowd mentioned older persons.  Sometimes they are referred to as people who need care but our older persons are elders and they are very wise individuals.  They have considerable life experience and want to contribute it.  While they were cocooned away, we were at a loss for that expertise and wisdom, in addition to their gravity of experience, which is really useful at a time of crisis and difficulty.</p><p> We know loneliness is very impactful on a person's physical and mental health.  It is said that loneliness is the equivalent of smoking 19 or 20 cigarettes per day.  If one does not have a connection or a relationship, it is very difficult to mobilise, motivate oneself, self-regulate and share one's concerns.  This is why we have been able to use various services through our volunteers and mental health associations right across the country.  We have provided over 30 Zoom licences, for example, just to reach out so older people do not feel so isolated and can make an active contribution.  That is what they wish to do.</p><p> Mental health services have adapted and they have demonstrated extraordinary innovation in recent months.  Practices and behaviours that were considered science fiction four months ago are now routine.  That has been remarkable.  We must regain those learnings and advantages but we also need to make sure the capacity of the service is replaced.</p></speech>

I agree with everything Mr. Rogan is saying but I believe there is a cohort - I honestly cannot measure it - of older people living alone who have not been coming out at all.  We need to reach out to them.  They are afraid for their health and do not have family supports.  They are becoming increasingly isolated and there is an increasing number of issues in this regard.  I welcomed everything Mr. Rogan said.  Perhaps other speakers may take up these points with him.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses have proposals on what we should be doing?  Could they prioritise where we need to spend more money urgently and immediately?  I am aware the list could be endless.  Could the witnesses prioritise the key needs so we can present them in a report, if necessary?</p></speech>

I thank them for their attendance today.  We have all received calls from people in distress and in need of mental health services.  I note that approximately 90% of the mental health services are provided through GP care or primary care teams.  The remainder are provided by the community mental health teams.  What has been the volume of the increase since the outbreak of Covid-19 in Ireland, in particular since mid-March?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.38" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Rogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#F00400"><p>We have seen that the profile of need has changed owing to an increase in urgency.  Voluntary agencies such as mine and other organisations running helplines and support lines have seen an increase in the intensity and duration of calls.</p><p>People are often very distressed and people sometimes find it difficult to step over that threshold to seek help.  This is something they might not have done before and they have often been relieved and surprised to realise the level of support that is there.  Agencies would always say that no problem is too small.  If it is a problem for someone and it is impacting on his or her quality of life, relationships, ability to go forward or view of the future, he or she should definitely reach out for help.  Most people gain these supports in the context of their families, communities and social relationships but as the Deputy mentioned, about 90% of all mental health issues present to primary care in the first instance and that is about 30% of all GP activity.  That was abated somewhat with telephone visits, etc., during the early stages of the lockdown and that was a real challenge for people in terms of gaining access and beginning such a conversation.</p><p> Huge progress has been made in the area of mental health in recent years.  Recovery is a real prospect and it is important that people step forward and avail of the services and do not shy away or stay back for fear of Covid-19 as we have seen in other parts of the health system.  The pathways have been cleared and are easily navigated but there are some additional delays because of the requirement for personal protective equipment, PPE, which poses a particular issue in the mental health context.  Engaging with a person who is in distress or experiencing a vulnerable time while wearing a mask is a real limitation.  We have been interacting with some of our international colleagues and some world designers to explore ways to get past that and to have PPE that is appropriate to mental health.</p><p> There has definitely been a different nature of mental healthcare need.  Many of these needs can be resolved through local community engagement with volunteers, NGOs and different organisations that are happy and pleased to help and that sometimes use mental health technologies.  Mental health services are available 24/7 for young people and older people and for the general adult population.  That is the important message we want to send out today.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Rogan have a percentage breakdown of the age and gender of those he has seen in the past 12 months or so or has there been an increase in any particular cohort seeking mental health services?  Mr. Rogan mentioned young people, for example.  One of the common issues we all come across is the dual diagnosis case of those who may have a drug addiction as well as mental health issues.  What is the panel's overall view on how we go forward in treating that?  Is the lack of funding going into mental health services a barrier to that?</p></speech>

When family members came together, they suddenly discovered that their partner, son or daughter was masking a significant mental health need, be that anxiety, depression, an eating disorder, drug or alcohol use or gambling.  These difficulties have then come forward quite pointedly and urgently.  In the last week, the HSE has published its 2019 service update on all population areas and the different age ranges.  We can expect to see a slow burn effect as a result of Covid-19.  People cope in the immediacy of the here and now and having come through that, sometimes when people look back they feel the dislocating effect and the fact that certain routines and supports protected their health, such as outdoor exercise, connection with friends and a range of activities.  When these supports are withdrawn, it is only over a period of time that the real effect of this becomes more apparent.  We can expect to see this emerging more over the course of this year.</p></speech>

On the Deputy's first comment, most of the data we have on the demand on services is in the community and voluntary sector and we have seen that from numerous groups such as my colleagues in Jigsaw.  <i>SpunOut.ie</i>, the youth online information service, has seen an increase of 44%.  MyMind, which provides online and face-to-face mental health services, has seen a tenfold increase.  We are seeing particular challenges in accessing services for particular groups of individuals, such as people who are experiencing eating disorders, for example.</p><p>We need to ensure that those services are adequately resourced and that people have easy access to services.  </p><p> The Deputy commented that primary care should be meeting 90% of the need.  That is accurate but there are issues about lack of capacity, and primary care services need to be appropriately resourced.  We can see that in the long waiting lists for primary care psychology, for example, where more than 8,000 people are waiting for a first appointment.  Approximately one third of those have been waiting for more than a year to be seen for the first time.  While services are already under strain and we are seeing increased demand, the Government needs to match that with appropriate resourcing.</p><p> In terms of particular groups of individuals, the UN and the WHO have identified particular groups of individuals that may be at risk, including young people, those experiencing domestic violence, and front-line healthcare workers so our services need to be prepared to meet that need.  One of the ways we can do that is to immediately establish the implementation group that should be set up to ensure implementation of the new mental health policy, Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Policy for Everyone, to ensure that the particular needs of these groups of individuals are adequately met.</p></speech>

It remains to be seen if it continues to increase.  Of note is that there is an increased level of referral among young adults.  We are a little unusual in Jigsaw in that we work with 12 to 25 year olds so we are seeing an increase in the level of referral from young people around the ages of 18 to 20.  That could be because many of those young people may have been affected by the loss of jobs as they would often be working in sectors that have been particularly affected such as the hospitality industry, retail, etc.</p> <p>  One fact that we know about demand is that even pre-Covid-19 the demand for mental health services for young people far exceeded the capacity within the system.  We can only anticipate that that will be exacerbated post Covid-19 but in some ways we already know that we do not have enough capacity within the system.  That is something we knew in January, February and early March of this year and it remains to be seen to what extent those difficulties and that lack of capacity is exacerbated by Covid-19.</p></speech>

We spoke about primary healthcare services.  I would say they are patchy, to say the least, in certain parts of the country.  My fear is for those who live in areas where they cannot avail of services and also in terms of the strain on GPs across the country.  That could create barriers, unfortunately, for those who are trying to access services.  That is an important element in terms of either funding to assist with that or for the review of services.  I thank Ms Mitchell for her comments on Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Policy for Everyone.  There is certainly a need to see the implementation of that as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I would like to explore online mental health services - the phone line and the Internet aspects.  We have spoken about some of the benefits of that, and there are many benefits to it, but I am concerned about part of it in respect of people who do not have Internet access or phones, which I know was an issue with, say, young people in care or young people who had recently left care who would not have computers or phones to allow them engage in these projects.  The witnesses might talk about some of the pitfalls of working in that kind of remote setting.  We have spoken about some of the cohorts who did better but I refer to cohorts who engaged on a less frequent basis who found it difficult or cohorts who could not engage at all.  They are the demographics or cohorts the witnesses would normally engage with but who disappeared during this time of Covid-19.</p><p>One of the witnesses spoke about communicating with older people via Zoom.  My parents took to it, but other people's parents hated Zoom and would not engage with it.  It is not necessarily a service for everyone.  Can the witnesses talk about the pitfalls and the demographics or cohorts who could not engage with that service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.48" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Rogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#J00200"><p>In recent months, we have seen the rapid adoption of a range of technologies.  As the Deputy says, we have all become very conversant with Zoom, FaceTime, Skype, Microsoft Teams, etc.  These have been very useful tools.  The technology can do certain things that human services cannot easily do with regard to availability, making geography irrelevant, providing a low threshold of access, proactively providing information that people can tailor and dynamic signposting.  In our organisation we have hosted conferences for families.  We have provided training for older people's services and a range of partners across the community and voluntary sector.  The technology can do many things but we must be mindful of its limitations.  Some of those are to do with the individual, who may not be comfortable with these technologies or may not have access to them.  There can be a digital divide.  To ensure the reach of our organisation's messaging we found ourselves buying space in provincial newspapers in areas where we knew broadband coverage was not sufficient for people to access our website.  There is a range of new materials on the website.  In the next ten days, we will be hosting an international conference which was originally due to be in Kilkenny.  Colleagues from all over Europe, perhaps 500 or more, will be tuning in.  The technology confers certain benefits but there are very real limitations.</p> <p>  As has been said, individuals are sometimes cautious of mental health services or reluctant to avail of them.  Sometimes family members are very concerned and ask how they can make sure that their son, daughter or family member is seen.  That simply cannot happen when a person is in great distress, is actively unwell or declines service.  In some cases, we simply cannot reach out.</p> <p>  Good quality mental healthcare is about creating a therapeutic alliance between a skilled professional and the person availing of the service.  We are providing more and more peer-led services through co-production.  Almost half of the staff of our organisation is composed of people who have recovered from significant mental health needs and are now providing educational programmes and a range of different activities through a network of recovery colleges.  There is very little that can substitute for that human contact and presence.  We also know that people sometimes find it more comfortable to avail of services on their own terms and in their own time.   Quite deep psychotherapeutic assistance can be offered online.  However, this presupposes that the person has a private space at home, has access to technology and will not be interrupted.  Moreover, if a person becomes unsafe or unwell, the technology does not allow us to reach out, hold that situation and keep it safe.</p> <p>  We also recognise the benefits of technology with regard to inpatient admissions for young people in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, units.  Many of these patients have not seen their parents since March.  That is a precautionary measure which has kept them safe, but it is a huge sacrifice to ask of young people.  Skype and FaceTime have been a bridge, but it is not quite the same as being in the same room as one's child when he or she is going through a period of distress.  </p> <p>  There are very real limitations.  We are learning more and more about this technology and some of the clever things it can do.  We need to know when we can apply that tool most effectively and when it becomes a barrier to the formation of the therapeutic relationship which is key to quality mental healthcare. </p></speech>

I echo much of what Mr. Rogan said.  One of the key lessons for us in Jigsaw and part of what we have been told by young people during the Covid-19 restrictions is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution.  There is no single way of providing a mental health service which works for everybody or meets everybody's needs.  We have worked hard to provide a suite of offerings to provide access to as many young people as possible.  These include working via telephone, video call and live webchat, asynchronous communication via email and the reintroduction of our face-to-face services.  The most effective approach is to tailor our clinical therapeutic offering to the unique circumstances and preferences of the young person and his or her family.  That is what is most likely to have good outcomes.</p><p>We are trying to have a suite of services that offers choice to young people, that is flexible and adaptable and which can therefore reach as many young people as possible.  The young people who avail of our services are more likely to receive a service which is suitable and effective for them and which provides them with a good outcome.  There can sometimes be a temptation to think that there is a holy grail, that there is one way, and maybe that is online.  We have found that online does not suit everybody in the same way that face to face does not suit everybody.  Having a suite of offerings is the best way to offer a quality mental health service to as many young people as possible.</p></speech>

Mr. Rogan mentioned that in July, Mental Health Ireland allocated &euro;90,000 to local mental health associations to replace lost funding.  I imagine that is not a euro-for-euro reimbursement.  Approximately how much money has been lost due to the inability to fundraise for Mental Health Ireland's associations in recent months?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.52" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Rogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#K00300"><p>Mental health associations are volunteer driven and raise funds in their local communities.  They spend those funds within their communities promoting positive mental health and supporting people with significant health needs.  Right across our network people have discovered they have had to cancel different events, sometimes very low-key events.  It is really important because communities really want to support the activities of local mental health volunteers.  People have been very generous, particularly online, and Mental Health Ireland is very careful to ensure our own fundraising does not impinge on our local volunteer network.  We opened up an application scheme and invited groups to come forward.  Some found they were doing fine and could manage.  We also had a second round of funding.  In July we have allocated more than &euro;90,000 in a series of grants to ensure that services can continue and improve in their adherence to social distancing.  I was on a Zoom call yesterday evening with some colleagues working in the Rathmines area.  A simple device such as adding an awning creates additional outdoor space which means that people who could become very isolated, perhaps living in bedsits etc. in inner city Dublin and in the Rathmines area, can still avail of the service, albeit in a measured and socially distanced way.</p> <p>  Mental Health Ireland's strategy is called empowerment from ideas to action.  We are asking how we can give pragmatic expression to public policy and ensure that people do not in any way feel isolated or left behind.  We have had to reach out to try to bridge that gap to some extent.  It is something we have not done before, but because of the generosity of people donating online, we have been in a position to do that on this occasion.</p> <p>  It is really difficult to quantify the degree of loss on that.  Each association has submitted its accounts and I can return to the Deputy with that detail.</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Rogan will not be able to answer this.  What level of new referrals are for people suffering from anxiety over how the State is responding to the pandemic?  I refer to people who have issues with physical social distancing, people wearing masks, hand hygiene etc.  Are we seeing a big spike in referrals for people who are directly anxious about these issues that are to the fore in this pandemic?</p></speech>

We recognise that some people who use mental health services have sometimes found it difficult to adhere to the social distancing limits.  That has been a challenge and quite a concern for family members who have made contact with us.  Going into lockdown was probably a bit easier.  It was a simple message to stay at home.  Now it is a graded message and people have to adapt to that and take back more personal responsibility.  Sometimes we are inclined to surrender decision-making by saying: "An expert told me to do the following and that is what I will do."  We are now at a point where we are depending much more on the individual along with their family contacts and their local communities, including the business community, to take responsible steps to stay safe and not to allow the virus to return.</p> <p>  Wearing masks can be uncomfortable for some people and can induce a degree of discomfort or anxiety.</p><p>What has been really important has been the sense of sonder.  Sonder is where we appreciate that other people have complex lives and, in a mental health context, that this is not a solo pursuit, that it is a collective, pooled exercise and that when we care for each other, which we signal by wearing a mask in a public space or on public transport, it is a courtesy to others and it is reflected back.  That bond has been really powerful and has been quite protective and supportive of people's mental health over these past weeks.  We need to retain that as we go into the next stages.  There are many supports for people who are concerned about anxiety and lots of good information on websites, which can provide practical solutions on how to overcome any sense of fear that people have.  Paul also has some references on this.</p></speech>

Many young people are experiencing a significant amount of disruption to their routines and to their relationships.  Their expectations of what their lives would have been like this year are very different, whether in the context of school, college or sitting the leaving certificate.  That sense of uncertainty and disruption to routine is difficult.  There is also the concern regarding family members who might be ill or elderly.  All of these things contribute to a sense of anxiety.  The restrictions relating to Covid-19, while necessary and required, impact on people's mental health and may make it harder for some to use the day-to-day mechanisms that they would use to manage and support their own mental health.  If these mechanisms are disrupted, it can make it difficult to be resilient in the face of the challenges we are all facing at this time.</p></speech>

Given that Covid-19 has such a major impact on young people right across the board and from a very young age, it strikes me that one has to ask who is actually providing supports for children under 12 years of age.  It is probably an issue to raise later with the HSE, and I will pursue that.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that the crisis has a huge impact on those young people in their teens and early 20s.  The crisis has given rise to all kinds of questions about their future, restrictions with regard to meeting their friends have been imposed and they are subject to the same uncertainty and fear that we are all experiencing.  In view of the fact that before the advent of Covid-19 there were long waiting lists for all mental health services for young people, one must wonder how we will cope as we come out of this pandemic.  Has consideration been given to providing schools and college programmes as a way of reaching a wider cohort of young people?</p></speech>

This work is done under the auspices of One Good School, which looks to support the whole school as an entity in itself.  We provide training for young people around peer education and support for classes, and we also provide training for teachers and parents.  What we have noticed in the three months of the Covid period is that 7,500 of the online e-learning courses we offer were downloaded.  Almost 5,000 of those courses have been completed by teachers.  This shows a significant need to get the support for teachers and schools in supporting young people.</p> <p>  As we move back to school in September, we are looking at the transition back into the school setting, managing anxiety, reconnecting with the classroom, minding one's mental health and self-care for teachers.  Jigsaw, operating very closely with the HSE, is very conscious of working on the broad psychosocial model.  This takes the view that mental health supports are not just provided on an individual basis, they are also provided on a community and societal basis.  The supports we can provide to schools will be very important as we continue to see the impact on young people.</p><p>We know that some young people will be anxious coming back to school, some will be delighted for the experience of something new, and many will be in the middle.  They will be concerned about their exams and what it means for their projected future.  The important thing is normalising that experience and providing as much support as possible.  A lot of positive work has been done linking National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, the Department of Education and Skills, and the health and well-being section of the HSE, which have worked together on this.  Obviously, a huge amount more is to be done.  The new Sharing the Vision policy and the new well-being guidelines from the Department of Education and Skills will help.</p></speech>

My next question is for Mr. Rogan.  What has he come across in terms of substance misuse arising from mental health issues associated with Covid, particularly relating to prescription drugs, alcohol and other drugs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Rogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#M01300"><p>This is a really important point.  An earlier question referred to dual diagnosis.  Often when people are in difficulty and they do not recognise a range of different supports that are helpful and constructive in their lives, people are inclined to resort to old familiars.  Especially in the Irish context, alcohol is a huge issue.  We have seen Central Statistics Office, CSO, data on this.  Even though pubs were closed, consumption of alcohol in the home, often at dangerous levels, has been a feature.  It is something we need to be very mindful of.  We are also seeing people moving towards prescription drugs.  We spoke earlier about the importance of primary care, but it is important it has a whole range of tools and not just a prescription pad.  We know, for example, that 10% of the Irish population are on antidepressants.</p></speech>

I am asking what is being found in the context of Covid apart from the general problems we have.  Have the problems been exacerbated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.73" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Rogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#M01500"><p>I think they have been exacerbated.  It is having an amplifying effect so that people are inclined to use and overuse their traditional coping mechanism.  Every one of us has experience of this over recent months, of being overwhelmed and having to take time or space out to try to reset our normal levels of equilibrium.  Unfortunately, many people are inclined to use prescription drugs, street drugs or alcohol to excess to achieve that.  We do not yet have a full measure on that but the CSO data on alcohol, which is probably best tracked, and some of the recent drug seizures, something the Garda has been very successful in, suggest an escalating demand on that too.</p></speech>

Some research has been carried out by Maynooth University and Trinity College Dublin in collaboration with universities in the UK, and Mental Health Reform has carried out consultations with its member organisations.  However, what is essential is a firm and solid commitment from the Government to measure and monitor the impact of Covid-19 on mental health across the population and particular groups of individuals, whether that is people from ethnic minority groups, people experiencing dual diagnosis, or members of the homeless community.  That is essential if we are really to understand the impact and plan accordingly.</p></speech>

They were very insightful on what has happened during the past four months in the public health emergency.  There is a juxtaposition between the amazing outpouring of solidarity and support, with people coming together across society, which might not normally happen, and self-isolation and the isolation of the public health emergency.</p><p>It has taken a significant toll on many people and is almost unquantifiable in terms of its extent.  The unintended consequences that will arise as a result will probably be with us for a long time.</p><p> The fault lines in the public services that have not met the needs or demands of the populace through the past 12 months have become clear in the past four months.  There has been much reference to pent-up economic demand, but there will be significant pent-up demand for mental health services.  Can that demand be met through the resources currently available to mental health services?</p><p> The submission of the Mental Health Commission states that 114 staffed community residences are unregulated.  Why are they unregulated?  Alarm bells ring when one sees the word "unregulated".  Who is regulating those services?  Such regulation is of particular importance currently, in what is, for most people, an extremely challenging time.</p><p> My first and substantial question was whether mental health services can meet the demand that will inevitably arise as a result of the current public health emergency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.77" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joseph Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#N00200"><p>On the Deputy's question regarding whether demand can be met, it will be a struggle to meet it.  It was a struggle before Covid and it will continue to be a struggle now.  Reference has been made to the importance of further investment in mental health in the context of the overall health budget.  That would be very welcome.  It is very important that we look at the mental health budget in the context of a system of care, taking account of the areas of prevention and early intervention, on which Jigsaw is focused, as well as longer-term and tertiary care.  It is about having appropriate targets and supports at each of the levels.</p> <p>  Ireland has embraced the idea of prevention and early intervention in the context of Covid-19 and people understand those concepts very well.  It is important to promote the concept of early intervention in the area of mental health.  My colleagues present mentioned the importance of identifying and understanding the mental health problems that will arise due to Covid as well as getting the important supports for those in place as soon as possible.  The level of investment needs to be considered not just in the context of traditional mental health services and the CAMHS and adult mental health service teams, but looking at wider supports and the broader psychosocial model of mental health.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.78" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Rogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#N00300"><p>It is particularly important that we recognise that mental health services are a component of services provided to meet the needs of the entire population and that the profile of needs can vary.  For example, CAMHS is designed to cater for 2% of the population who have an extreme level of need.  The question is what comes before that.  There is an increasing movement in the mental health space towards promoting positive mental health.  A public health model is beginning to emerge in which consideration is given to urban planning and how and where people live their lives.  Many lessons have been learned from the pandemic.  We have seen an extraordinary community bond and solidarity.  It has also shone a spotlight on the need to address certain dependencies with regard to terms and conditions of employment, particularly in the context of precarious work.  We are at a reset moment.  Before we repack the boot of the car, we must be sure that we are packing things that we really want in our communities.  These are significant decisions that we have an opportunity to reflect on and revisit.</p> <p>  On how we invest in our mental health service, it is very important when it comes to, for example, promoting positive mental health that we do this in an evidence-based way.  We have worked with Professor Margaret Barry of NUI Galway who is a world expert in this area and developed a new level 9 programme that will produce 25 graduates this year.  Taking an evidence-based approach means that we are much better informed regarding what works, what is effective and what is acceptable to communities.  It allows us to create strategies and life approaches that people can use to protect their mental health, that of their family members and that of those in their community.</p><p>The Deputy also mentioned unregulated residential settings.  This is not quite something of a legacy from our past but one must remember that in 1950 Ireland held the world record for psychiatric hospitalisation.  Almost 1% of the Irish population lived in what were then large mental hospitals.  As people moved back to their communities, and were received well back there, often with the support of volunteers and staff members, large numbers of community houses were established.  These were often quite congregated settings which were sometimes not ideally or purpose-built.  Often convents, old nursing homes, or small hotels were taken on for this function.  We can still see the last embers of that.             Unfortunately, as we saw in the tragedy in the Maryborough Centre in Portlaoise where eight people who lived there passed away as a result of Covid-19, this has had a hugely traumatic effect on their families and for the staff members who have made valiant efforts to protect that group.  The physical infrastructure did not lend itself to that.  It is very difficult for a person to live a dignified independent life where they do not have their own accommodation or space and where they are sometimes even sharing bedrooms with an unrelated adult.  We can do better in 2020.  We have made big progress but we need to finish that task to ensure that everybody has good quality accommodation, can live in their own space and make their own decisions.  That whole message around recovery and stepping back into a full life within the community is absolutely critical to what we do across the mental health sector.</p></speech>

During the past four months face-to-face counselling has ceased for the thousands of adults and children who are supported by the mental health services in Ireland.  Experts are warning that our social healthcare should be prepared for a tsunami of need which will emerge in the aftermath of this crisis.  Along with the many thousands of people who are currently attending mental health services, we are being told that there is a new at-risk group emerging from this unprecedented crisis.  These include children, young people, adults and old people whose lives have been disrupted by economic and social upheaval.  The distress suffered by this group may already be evident while others will suffer from delayed trauma.  Given that mental health services are already stretched to the limit and that extensive waiting lists exist due to a shortage of qualified clinicians, what do our witnesses know of any plans that are in place, if any, to deal with this emerging crisis in mental health services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Rogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#O00400"><p>That point is very well made and it is very important where we put this resource.  We need to frontload it and to be very careful because for the whole population we have had this extraordinarily unique experience.  It has been a time of uncertainty and is a space that we have never been in before.  We have all also been learning our way across this path.  We need to frontload this to keep people well and in community, in their routines and in employment.  We know that unemployment is perhaps one of the most dangerous occupations to have.  In Ireland we have seen this in very recent memory, where Irish people remember the very corrosive effects that unemployment and recession have had and the losses and tragedy associated with that.  We know what not to do.</p> <p>  A whole series of measures are very important across quality of life, people&rsquo;s health and that people have access to services that are informal and easily accessible, be that in the community and voluntary sector, in primary care, or indeed in mental health services.  These need to be properly resourced and to be in a position to respond to people in a very constructive and creative way with a series of choices that are comfortable to the individual.  With Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Policy for Everyone, we have a very strong outline on how we can do this.  It is about outcomes and what our objectives are.  As a community, what is it that we wish to see so that everybody can live a full life and people can come in from the margins?  We have seen people who have rejoined our country in recent years and who have come back from overseas.  We have migrants joining us, we have had members of the Travelling community and we have had people living in precarious situations in homelessness.  We can revisit these things because we know that these are damaging not just to our physical health but also to our mental health.  </p> <p>  It is unedifying for all of us if any of our fellow citizens live like this.  This is like what the Americans used to say, which is that nobody should be left behind.  We need to have systems in place in our educational establishments and in our workplaces that are conducive and supportive to people&rsquo;s mental health, in recognising that people have sometimes been traumatised by this experience, and have been seriously unsettled.  The uncertainty has had a corrosive effect.  </p> <p>  We need to be patient, a little kind, and mindful of people&rsquo;s experiences.  Family members have often struggled over the last number of months trying to do their day job by Zoom together with homeschooling children at the same time.  This has been extraordinarily stressful and there is a recognition of that.</p><p>Employers have been very good at stepping forward and most have been responsible in that space, although not all unfortunately.  We need to be alert to that piece as well.  Across all of our community, we need to mobilise and be extra alert.  We have all been through a tough time and we need support, affirmation and acknowledgement from our colleagues around us and our neighbours, which has been a really powerful learning in all of this.  We could almost consider Covid as something of a dress rehearsal when it comes to addressing some of the huge issues facing our society in terms of the economy, unemployment and climate change.  We have demonstrated what we can do when we pull together and if we can mobilise that attitude again in the coming months, we could be unstoppable.</p></speech>

Certainly, many families get support from a variety of different providers, including the HSE and providers in the disability NGO sector.  Many of these services have had to be wound back and hours reduced.  Even an element like transport to the services has to be adapted in the context of social distancing and the provision of PPE, so there will be an additional cost to how the services are provided.  There will also be time streaming to provide services to people who cannot observe or may not fully understand the limitations, and who find it very difficult in terms of sensory stimuli and so on to engage with a person wearing a mask or other forms of PPE.  There is still a lot more learning in this and it is at the early stages of reopening on a highly prioritised basis, as I understand it.  However, it is not a field I am actively working in.</p></speech>

To make a further point, there seems to be general acknowledgement of the need for further resourcing of mental health services but we also need to get best value from the resources already in place.  We spoke earlier about having multiple tiers of support and service available at a universal level and at a population health level, as well as in primary care and specialist services.  I also believe that what we need is better integration across those different levels of service provision and better integration between the community and voluntary sector and statutory services.  In some communities and localities this worked extremely well but it could be more consistent.  The better the integration between services, the more likely it is that a person who presents to any point of the service system will be facilitated to get to the service they need in a timely fashion.  That is another important matter for us to bear in mind when we think about resourcing in that we need to get the best use of existing resources in addition to the need for further resources.</p></speech>

The reason that practice continues is that there is a flaw in current mental health legislation that allows the non-regulation of those residences.  Mental Health Reform has been campaigning for years for the urgent reform of Ireland's mental health legislation to ensure it is updated in full so that, if and when people go into hospital for mental health care and treatment, their rights are adequately protected.  However, reform of that legislation will also address that existing flaw and extend the powers of the Mental Health Commission so it can regulate those community residences across the country.</p><p>As my colleague mentioned, there are concerns about the practices in some of those residences that make their regulation even more imperative.  These practices have been well reported by the commission.</p></speech>

There is a real challenge for services to come forward into a more modern format.  It is wholly inappropriate.  The housing needs of people who can live in the community are predominantly the responsibility of the local authorities, and their health needs are the responsibility of the HSE.  It has not always transpired that way.  Often the health service has continued to provide both a home and care.  Sometimes the people affected have been a hidden people, and sometimes their voice has not been heard.  Our organisation works with people with lived experience, some of whom live in residential settings, to make sure their needs are fully articulated according to their preferred choices.  It is important that we do not speak on behalf of them.  In fact, all our work is done in co-production, which means programmes, projects and policies proceed only when people use services and when family members are actively consulted.  That is where we take our-----</p></speech>

He said in his submission to the committee, which we took as read, that we need to ensure easy access to mental health services and supports across the continuum of care, including primary, community, acute and specialist services, as well as supporting individuals with existing mental health difficulties.  Obviously, I would want to see that and we support that, but we have to base that on what the Mental Health Commission itself said in its report and on its experience of some of the acute settings.  The CEO of the organisation said the fundamental human rights of residents are being overlooked and that many mental health residents are still being admitted to outdated and unclean premises.  That is not a very good start if we are seeking to make sure there is a continuum of care across all the settings, including acute settings.</p></speech>

The quality of care for people at all stages in the mental health services, be it in acute, community-based or residential services, has to be of the highest standard.  A Vision for Change set out a programme whereby older mental health facilities would be sold and the proceeds reinvested.  That was 2006.  It involved almost &euro;1 billion in new investment, but unfortunately the recession that followed did not make that possible.  Many new resources were put into acute inpatient residential settings.  Regarding inpatient settings for children, for example, the number of beds was quadrupled.  The residential programs for people who often spent many years in institutional settings and who were taking the step forward into the community, however-----</p></speech>

If the premises are not suitable, there is something fundamentally wrong.  The Mental Health Commission refers to no meaningful care plan for some patients in 31 centres throughout the State.  One would imagine that one of the very first things put in place would be a care plan for the individual.  If that is absent, we are not even getting the basics right.  Is that a fair statement?</p></speech>

There is little point in being admitted to hospital unless it is a purposeful event.  It is a question of what the admission is about, what the care plan is, what the person's contribution is and what the staff contribution is.  This is a statutory requirement.  Therefore, all service users in acute settings must have a care plan.  The people in the community need to have a purposeful pathway as to how they are going to regain their independence and recover and be authors of their own care plan in collaboration with healthcare staff.  Where that is not happening, there is a serious failing on the part of the services.</p></speech>

One of them found it was not clean and there were overflowing bins and stains in some toilets.  Patients reported sleeping on the floor in the unit.  According to the Mental Health Commission, this year's report "once again demonstrates that the needs and wants of mental health service users are not being prioritised".  I wish the position was better but when the commission is reporting that patients are being treated like second-class citizens, their human rights are being violated, there is no individual plan for many of the patients in centres and that in some centres patients with psychiatric needs and acute mental health difficulties are sleeping on the floor, that does not paint a rosy picture of mental health services.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>

These are facilities that are open to the public to see.  We are not talking about second-class citizens.  We are talking about Irish citizens who have needs and vulnerabilities and often have issues with their sense of personal dignity.  For them to go into a setting that is not clean or adequately maintained is simply not good enough.  The Mental Health Commission not only inspects but also licenses approved centres and it has a responsibility to make sure these standards are adhered to and held to the highest level.  With regard to the unit in Waterford, every unit has a licence for a number of beds and it cannot go beyond that number.  It is then a question of mobilising additional resources, either in the private sector or in surrounding services, when there are additional pressures.  These are fundamental issues and it is extraordinarily difficult to promote a person's dignity and independence in a setting that is not up to standard.</p></speech>

One of the problems I am coming across is that of young people aged over 18 who have challenges, either depression or mental health problems, and are distancing themselves from their parents.  The parents, who want to give support, find it frustrating that they are being excluded.  Is there a need to provide support for parents in such circumstances?  I have encountered a large number of such cases in recent months.  It is challenging for parents to try to deal with this issue.</p></speech>

It can be particularly difficult for parents when their young adult children are experiencing difficulties and they are seeking to support them.  We have to provide support to those parents and one of the measures Jigsaw took during the Covid-19 restrictions was to introduce a freephone service.  Young people contacted us in other ways but it was interesting that the freephone service was primarily used by parents who were seeking advice, guidance and information about their children who they were concerned about.  In some cases, these were adult children.</p> <p>  A balance needs to be struck between respecting the autonomy and independence of young people who are over 18 and providing them with avenues to access supports that are suitable for them.  To that end, Jigsaw has tried to introduce low threshold entry points into service support, such as live webtext and email contact, which might make it easier for those over 18 who are not necessarily being facilitated by a parent to come to a service.  They can take that initial step themselves.  They do not need to have a referral from another professional.  They can choose to access a service and explore it to see if it might meet their needs.  We must be cognisant that the needs of a young person aged between 18 and 25 might be slightly different from those of the general adult population.</p></speech>

In the case I found, the parents found themselves locked out.  They could not get any information.  They wanted to give supports but found they were hitting a blank wall in that regard.  Should we have a more constructive mechanism in place to assist in that situation?</p></speech>

Any service working with young people will try to engage with parents, friends and the support system around the young person.  If a young person is over 18 and they decide that they do not want that, that is a difficult situation.</p></speech>

Paragraph 2.5 states that many of the participants in a survey advised that they were no longer accessing treatment and were less likely to seek help from a GP, community mental health service, charity or voluntary organisation.  In that survey, were people asked the reasons they would no longer engage with any of the services?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it did not go into detail as to the reasons they would not engage, but what is important is that that finding indicates pent-up demand for mental health services in Ireland.  He will see from that report that the findings in terms of percentages are quite high in that approximately 40% indicated that they would need fewer community health services, even if needed, and approximately 70%, which is a huge percentage, indicated that they would not use emergency departments for a mental health need.  That indicates the pent-up demand for mental health services and demonstrates the need for our services to be ready for a surge or increased demand across the continuum.  When we talk about mental health services and supports, we are not just talking about acute or specialist services.  We are talking about a continuum of supports for mental health promotion right through to the professional element.</p></speech>

They are all the lessons we need to draw on from this time if and when we experience a second wave.</p></speech>

We said earlier that approximately 90% of support is provided by GPs.  Is there not a pressure point with GPs in that one aspect of dealing with mental health is giving time to the individual but one of the problems we have is that GPs are under great pressure because of the volume of work they are doing?  What additional supports do the witnesses believe we should be providing now to GPs to ensure they can come on board and give that time to the person who requires it?</p></speech>

The Deputy makes a very important point.  As we know, primary care can meet a substantial demand of mental health need but it has to be adequately resourced.  The first point to make is that GPs are one professional but there is an entire cohort of primary care professionals that can be used and adequately resourced to ensure they can provide mental health supports.</p><p>Earlier in the discussion I mentioned the fact that primary care psychology is usually under-resourced and there are significant waiting lists.  Ensuring that there are a range of talking therapies for both children and adults at primary care level is one very practical way of enhancing capacity at the primary care level.  Other primary care professionals, such as occupational therapists and social workers, can provide support.</p></speech>

A GP running his or her practice knows that there are supports, but they are difficult to follow through on from his or her point of view.  Should there be more co-ordination between GPs and the backup support services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.119" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Rogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#T00300"><p>It is of critical importance to understand the role of primary care.  As the Deputy has pointed out very well, a GP's practice can be a very busy place at the best of times, even without Covid-19.  It has been suggested that a GP visit can take seven minutes.  That is composed of two minutes of meeting, greeting and seating, two minutes of formal diagnosis, two minutes of prescribing treatment and a minute in which to ask the patient to move forward.  That time constraint should be reduced somewhat with the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and better access to primary care.</p> <p>  GPs have been very creative and responsive.  Their viewpoint is really important because they do not just see patients at one moment in time.  A GP sees a patient in the context of his or her family and knows the individual over a period of time.  He or she can recognise if things are different.  On average, about three GP visits by either an individual or a family member can elapse before the difficult topic is raised and a patient expresses concern about his or her mood, anxiety, drinking patterns etc.  Mental Health Ireland works with the Irish College of General Practitioners, and Professor Tom O'Dowd to understand the tools and skills of GPs.  They play a really important role in early recognition and sometimes in watchful waiting.  They have an array of options.  As Ms Mitchell has mentioned, this includes access to psychology, the counselling in primary care service and other initiatives.  They are not limited to their prescription pads.</p> <p>  People are sometimes reluctant to avail of mental health services.  That can arise from historical stigma or a sense of hopelessness.  Sometimes it comes from a fear of losing control or a sense that the service will somehow take over a patient's life.  We need a much better understanding of this.  People are increasingly availing of peer-led services such as recovery colleges, where people can equip themselves with new understandings of mental health and manage their own care in a much more effective way.  People who have used the service often bring a unique insight that we as professionals do not have through our training.  They also carry a great sense of hope.  While acknowledging that things are difficult and a patient's story will not necessarily be the same as their own, they can point to things that were helpful and unhelpful in their own lives.  Those are really powerful messages for a person who is feeling deflated, frightened about the future, alienated or disconnected.  This is about having an array of options that are acceptable to the patient.</p> <p>  When we are supporting a person with his or her mental health or promoting positive mental health, we approach things on three levels.  We aim to strengthen the individual, strengthen the community and reduce barriers.  Covid-19 has become an additional barrier that we must find creative ways to address.  We have seen some really strong examples of that in recent months.  Services that routinely go the extra mile have now gone the extra kilometre.  That does not just apply to front-line services.  Support teams and managers working the system have had to move heaven and earth to ensure that people can access quality services in a timely way.  Waiting lists are not really helpful when a person is in acute distress or considering self-harm.  That situation must be addressed immediately.  GPs are at the front line of that in many instances.</p></speech>

Many people have stated that mental health comprises 7% of health spending, which falls short of the 12% minimum called for by the WHO.  I would like to commend the witnesses for their work, advocacy and service provision.  Web-based services are limited by geography, Internet access and privacy, so face-to-face care is often necessary.  We all fear that people suffering from adverse childhood experiences and older people who find themselves in bad situations will have had much worse experiences when cut off from school, work or other means of escape.</p><p>In the long term they will require more services.</p><p> My first question is on dual diagnosis, addictions particularly drugs and alcohol and the crossover with mental health.  Very often these people fall between services.  That happens at the best of times and it is obviously possibly worse at the moment.  They become a disaster for themselves, their family and the State services, particularly the Garda.  What are Mr. Rogan's views on the protocols, resources and possibly legislation required to ensure that the no-wrong-door approach to access to services is put into operation?</p></speech>

We need to build services that are person centric without structural factors in terms of who is funding this programme.  It is about how we respond to the person in the complexity of their lives at that moment.  People often resort to alcohol, and prescribed and street drugs to respond to the great stress they are feeling, sometimes, as the Deputy mentioned, related to adverse childhood events, ACEs, as they are known.  There is the whole trauma-informed piece.  They can descend into a period of chaos for themselves and their family members who are reaching out and trying to support them and at the same time limit the damage.</p> <p>  The no-wrong-door approach is particularly important.  People should be received at point of presentation and the engagement should continue on - what our American colleagues refer to as a warm handover - meaning that they do not leave the service until they have been successfully integrated into one that is more appropriate to their needs.  There are degrees of shared care.  It seems bizarre to say to a young person with psychosis, "If you just stop smoking the weed and then come back to us, we'll talk about schizophrenia and how we are going to treat that."  That is not a realistic model and it is not one that we are seeing.</p> <p>  There are also opportunities.  For example, in the prison population where people with addiction issues are well over-represented, it presents an opportunity - a period of stillness of calmness - to address a range of both mental health and addiction issues.  All prisoners are assessed on arrival and about 7% are found to have a psychosis, which is about twice the international norm.  About 80% of these people who had availed of mental health services in the community sometimes had fallen out of the service, declined service or lost the service.  We need to understand these pathways and design services built around the individual as they are rather than as we would wish them to be.</p> <p>  There has been quite a complex history with alcohol.  I am reluctant to criticise policy.  Even in the previous policy, A Vision for Change, the word "alcohol" appeared about three times.  It looks more like a mental health policy for Saudi Arabia rather than one for Ireland.  We need to be much more honest, own these situations and respond accordingly.  GPs are often left asking where the treatment portal is for a person who is now ready to revisit their alcohol use.  Does that happen in an acute hospital or a specialist detox programme?  At one point in the past, half of psychiatric admissions related to alcohol.  That is no longer the case since the late 1980s.  The question is: who has stepped into that void?  It is not always obvious who best does that.</p></speech>

These people can display behaviours dangerous to themselves and others.  Sometimes only the garda&iacute; can take action when a crime occurs.

Referrals end up going between services without any clear line of responsibility and any clear service offering support to that person.</p> <p>  I spoke earlier about service integration, which is often key in these situations.  Mental health services and services generally are often presented with unique and complex situations which require some making sense of and understanding.  If services can do this in a collaborative way and come together to discuss these things, they can decide which service or combination of services is the best fit for the difficulties that individual is experiencing.</p><p>Greater levels of communication and collaborative decision-making ensure that nobody is left without a service or to be bounced, in the context of referrals, as some people experience.  As Martin Rogan stated earlier, it also allows for shared care where different services come together to offer a suite of supports that might meet different needs in a person's life or within a family.</p></speech>

Where and how can persons in direct provision or migrant workers who are undocumented seek mental health support in Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Rogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#V00300"><p>The model of mental health care in Ireland operates on a catchment area or sectoral basis.  A person should first present to his or her GP who will then guide the person towards services.  Mental Health Ireland has worked with migrant communities in a variety of settings.  Sometimes people come in difficult circumstances and with a traumatic history, such as that relating to conflict situations, abuse or human trafficking.  These are very difficult circumstances.  Where a person lives largely determines which mental health service will engage with him or her and how it progresses.  This has its limitations, especially for people with unstable addresses or for those who are homeless.  They can find themselves shuttling from place to place.  This comes back to the earlier reference on points of presentation where the service needs to embrace the individual, stabilise his or her situation and then see where are the four pathways for the person to move forward.</p> <p>  The outbreaks that were seen in meat plants are sometimes about close proximity working.  It is also about people living in very limited and poor housing conditions, feeling unsupported, and sometimes there are language issues where the person does not fully know what services are available.  These are elemental questions about equity, respecting people's work and minimum wages, and they simply must be addressed.  If we know that the living wage is &euro;2 north of the minimum wage it means that this staff member is contributing &euro;2 to the employer and to the State for his or her labour.  This does not respond to human dignity and it does not promote positive mental health.  We need to revisit these issues, which are difficult topics for all of us.  When we go to the supermarket we want cheap cuts of meat.  The question is: "Who is contributing to the cost of that?"  We need to be honest and respectful to take a human rights approach and a human dignity approach by asking if the person is being fully respected and fully rewarded for the work and skills at all stages of a product lifecycle.  We have certainly learned a lot on that in the last months.</p> <p>  There is an opportunity for us, as an island, to pull together and work alongside each other to properly respect people who come to our country and make a huge contribution to our economy.  This would promote mental health.  If these people run into difficulties, local GP services may have a mental health model incorporated, and the local mental health services will engage with the person also.  There can be linguistic and cultural issues.  The HSE has invested in providing interpretation services and so on.  It is, however, not ideal for a person to avail of a mental health service through a different language, which can be a challenge.</p></speech>

There were some startling revelations at this committee that were subsequently disputed.  The unions that primarily represent healthcare workers will come back before the committee.  I note from a World Health Organization report that 47% of healthcare workers in Canada reported a need for psychological support, in the People's Republic of China 50% of healthcare workers reported high rates of depression, 45% reported anxiety and 34% reported insomnia.  Have the witnesses seen a prevalence of healthcare workers seeking mental health supports recently?</p></speech>

They know that it is really difficult, time becomes elastic in the middle, but in three or four days the dust, sometimes literally, will have settled and people can get back to their lives again.  It can be really difficult during that three or four day period but people know it has a terminus - it comes to an end.  One of the challenges with Covid is that we do not know if we are midway through it or only, say, 10% of the way into it.  We do not know where we are on the Covid time bar and that makes it particularly difficult.  Healthcare staff have the added concern that they are working very intimately with people, using PPE and all the protocols and professional skill sets but they always have a concern that they will bring the virus home to their family and undermine their household health and that of vulnerable people they support.  The HSE has introduced models whereby staff can stay in hotels and so on to avoid doing this.</p><p> Another phenomenon to which we need to be alert, which was also described on the recent tele-call with international colleagues, is one known as moral injury.  This is when a person in a leadership role takes a decision based on the information he or she has at that moment, and that is absolutely correct based on that, but new information comes into the frame days later and the matter takes on a different complexion.  For people who others look to for expertise, wisdom and experience in a given area, that can have a corrosive effect on their ability to lead and make decisions in the future.  We need to be very mindful of that.  People have been exposed to difficult and graphic circumstances and fast-moving and overwhelming situations.  Working in closed spaces with PPE is very difficult over long shifts.  The provision of employee assistance programmes-----</p></speech>

The supports young people have been getting from sports and community organisations are about trying to nurture and support that.  During Covid, we have continued to look to support those online as much as possible and we have had some opportunities to do that.  As restrictions continue to be relaxed, it is important that those organisations are coming on board and continue to support young people to interact more with the community.

Pharma has an important role to play in some instances, specifically where there is a proper diagnosis, the person is very comfortable and other programmes are also offered, for example, psychotherapeutic approaches or even social prescribing, green prescribing and exercise programmes.  These programmes are very important.  It is also important we work with the individual not only solo but in the context of his or her family or chosen supports, such as friends and family.  Ireland has a particularly high use of pharmaceuticals in mental health.  Sometimes this is in the absence of other options.  Availing of the wrong tool because it is the most available or useful one at one's disposal does not make it the correct one.  Mental Health Ireland does not have a viewpoint on particular types of medication.  We do not prescribe certain treatments or anything like that.  That is a matter for the service user and his or her prescriber.  However, it is really important that there is a range of options and not just a prescription pad used in isolation. </p></speech>

There have been more than 1,700 deaths from Covid-19.  Eight of those who have died were under the age of 65 and did not have an underlying condition.  Of course, each of the 1,700 deaths is a tragedy.  That said, it is possible that we have lost a sense of perspective, given that there have been three times as many deaths from cancer in the same period.  Typically, there are 3,100 diagnoses of breast cancer in any given year, 2,680 diagnoses of bowel cancer, 1,161 diagnoses of gynaecological cancer and 3,300 diagnoses of prostate cancer.  The screening programmes for those conditions are currently in abeyance.  Some reporting in the media gives the impression that the only thing of which one might die is Covid-19.  Some sectors are just short of calling for lynchings at airports of people who come to Ireland.  Do we need more perspective?  Is a lack of perspective contributing to distress and mental health problems?</p></speech>

In general, the Irish media have been very responsible and an important tool in communicating updates to ensure we are all in sync and in step with the various phases of reopening, as well in terms of supporting individuals.  They have been quite sensitive in the context of human dynamics with regard to family and other interactions.  We need to be mindful that some people may spend their whole day on social media or a screen of some description, which can give a very distorted world view.</p> <p>  As the Chairman noted, other medical conditions continue to occur in the background.  As Covid is new and contagious, it is an immediate concern and risk.  People are mindful that they do not wish to be a vector or agent that will compromise a family member or loved one.  In general, media reporting on the issue has been responsible.  There has been active denial in certain other countries and that, unfortunately, has been reflected in the R number and the number of cases.  In general, the media in Ireland have been responsible and tried to give a balanced viewpoint.  As the Chairman noted, there are many other conditions, including mental health issues, that can be life-limiting and seriously impact on the quality and duration of people's lives.  It is important that Covid-19 is seen in context.  It has had a profound shifting effect on all our routines and usual practices, and that is something on which the media have a responsibility to report.  They must do so in a respectful and responsible way.</p></speech>

That is not where young people are at.  They are more active on social media and on their phones.  We recently held a discussion in collaboration with young people and run by Jigsaw and the HSE.  Many of the young people involved stated that information on Covid was not accessible to them.  They were of the opinion that information was not being provided in understandable language or on a platform that they can access.  That may be a source of much anxiety.  Young people may not have certainty with regard to guidelines being up to date with the stages and phases.  They are seeking more accessible, youth-focused and youth-targeted resources and information such that they can be informed.  Many young people in care or with disabilities, for example, do not have an adult or other person whom they can ask these questions.  They are responsible for understanding the message but it is difficult for them to do so if it is not focused on them or meeting them where they are at.</p><p>If it is through the newspapers or on the news that is not where young people are.  If we focus on that and on delivering the information to young people in a way that is accessible to them, that will definitely help anxiety and help them manage and keep up to date and plan, which will help to reduce the distress of the experience.</p></speech>

We believe that there is a great amount of material going out on social media but it may not be delivered in a way that is reaching people where they are at.  Perhaps it is not the right tone, message or connection that is made.  It is very important to get that feedback.</p> <p>  In returning to an earlier point we have discussed with the Department of Education and Skills, the parents counciI and the unions the issue of going back to school in September.  No matter what one&rsquo;s stage is, there is an uncertainty there for young people, as much for the period spent out of school as for lingering anxiety about Covid-19 or the risk of transmission, etc.  What interaction has there been with the Department of Education and Skills or others about the provision to meet the psycho-social needs of children going back to school, anticipating increased anxiety, regressed behaviour, or any other symptoms?  What has been the engagement for the provision of support for teachers who are often trying to meet the psychosocial needs in the classroom setting?  I asked about the colleges of education providing, for example, web seminars, play therapy and additional types of therapy to help support teachers to support children as they come back.  Is there additional psycho-educational information for parents to enable them to support their children through any disrupted period as they go back to school?</p></speech>

We have noticed that has continued across the summer.  We are working with schools but we are particularly working with the Educational Support Centres in Ireland, ESCI, and developing webinars for teachers to support them in the transition to the return to school and supporting pupils in the school.  It is also about creating an environment where we have a conversation about returning to school, where it is not just about focusing on exams but also about focusing on the young people and their experience from early March, before St Patrick&rsquo;s Day, not having that support from their peers or teachers.  It is about looking at that as a transition rather than thinking about how we get right back into the curriculum.  One of the things we will have consultation about with teachers and with schools at the moment is the timing of supports and how we manage that.</p> <p>  Social distancing is a big issue.  We are looking now to see how much support we can continue to put online for teachers.  That is something that has really been picked up.  Again, as has been echoed this morning, it is about the collaboration and the networks, particularly between ESCI, the Department, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and others.  A great amount of work is happening there which need to be more co-ordinated to ensure that schools do not feel overwhelmed.  It is also important that they know where the right and valuable support is.</p></speech>

It is one of the real lessons in the context of learning from this.  In terms of our own experience in Jigsaw, we have really been influenced by young people in terms of how much they have embraced and used technology such as TikTok and Instagram and we have used it to provide good, adequate and supportive messages for young people.  It is an important and valuable time and not a time to be wasted.</p></speech>

Obviously, it is in the bigger cities but, outside of those, how did centres come to be located in certain areas?</p></speech>

In the very beginning, approximately 14 years ago, it was through consultations with local communities, particularly where there was a high degree of mental health concerns, particularly in respect of suicide, and that was when we were funded from a more philanthropic base.  We have worked closely with the Department of Health and, in particular, the HSE in recent years in looking at the spread of services throughout the country and at where we would best be able to use the resources.</p> <p>  The difficulty is that we know there is a need for support in many different places.  What we are now looking at is how we can expand and develop existing Jigsaw services.  For example, the service in Offaly has expanded into Laois and we are looking to see if we can develop further services.  What we are looking at right now, especially as a result of Covid, is the idea that national coverage would mean both online and offline support.  What we have moved into is providing phone support and online support, which can provide a greater level of support for more people.  The issue overall is how we get a balance between face-to-face and online support, and it is really about looking at resources.</p> <p>  One of the bigger issues is that we do not have three or five years of planned funding and we are always looking at it on a year-to-year basis.  If we had that plan of structured funding, we would be able to work with communities and really support them to see where Jigsaw fits within a system of care.  At times in the past, people have wanted us to develop a Jigsaw service and we have been very careful and clear that we are providing a service on the prevention and early intervention side.  The reality is there needs to be a lot of other supports in communities for all of us to work successfully together.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee with my colleagues Dr. Susan Finnerty, Inspector of Mental Health Services, and Ms Rosemary Smyth, director of standards and quality assurance.</p> <p>  The Mental Health Commission is the regulator for mental health services in Ireland.  It is an independent statutory body.  Its mandate is to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services.  Under the 2001 Act, the statutory scope of mental health regulation for us is limited to inpatient services.  Therefore, we have quite a limited scope in terms of the full mental health service.  We perform a critical function in vindicating the rights of people who are put into mental health units against their will or in an involuntary way.</p><p>Over the course of the period of Covid-19, we monitored 181 residential mental health services, comprising 67 regulated inpatient centres and the rest were community hostels.  The written submission of the Mental Health Commission sets out the number of concerns identified as part of our role in monitoring the progression and impact of Covid-19.  We found that staff on the ground, people in the unit, the clinical staff and the management pulled together well.  We could not say it was a success because people died but I have to say that the mental health services and the professionalism of staff protected many people.  I want to emphasise that.</p><p> We found that the national governance was one to three weeks behind the services themselves.  That is fair enough in that the services knew what was happening in the here and now.  We found issues with facilities with shared accommodation and a limited ability to isolate and there was a lack of public health guidance, specifically for mental health settings.  We found delays and inconsistencies in testing in the early phase of lockdown.  We have to be frank that people were caught on the hop.  From what we could see, resources were taken out of mental healthcare provision and diverted into other parts of the system, based on the thinking at that time.  There were also delays and inconsistencies in testing, as well as inconsistency in the continuity of services.  Community-based services were also suspended.  Those were the key issues for us.</p><p> To come back to the main point, we have been giving evidence to two Ministers for Health, the HSE and basically anyone who would listen about our mental health services for the past ten to 15 years.  It is clearly documented and transparent and it is in the public domain.  Covid-19 has shown us that we need to address this issue, we need to put money into infrastructure to make sure buildings are fit for purpose for people, we need to put money into making sure our services are well staffed and we need to set about building a proper community mental health service in Ireland.</p></speech>

We appreciate the opportunity to come before the committee this morning.</p> <p>  The committee will have received our statement.  Our role is to provide services across the Twenty-six Counties, including community, day, acute and long-term care.  Covid-19 has had a significant impact on all of our services, as it has had on all health services.  We have learned that we have a resilient and committed staff and we have adapted well, given the circumstances.  The lessons we have learned have been taken on board and we see the challenges the Mental Health Commission and the regulator have outlined to us, which we would share.  It is something we need to plan for in the future.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  My understanding is that the National Forensic Mental Health Service had no patient positive case of Covid-19.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Why did that happen?  What steps were taken at the different stages to ensure that was so?  That is a congregated and closed setting, as are other settings we have looked at so what was different about the National Forensic Mental Health Service?</p></speech>

We probably learned from what was going on in the rest of the country but there was clarity from the word go about what we needed to do in terms of people coming in.  Having to restrict visits was very difficult for patients and for everybody concerned but it was right thing to do and we had to do it.  We also looked at the way we managed our staff and ensured that we looked at managing contractors, etc., who were coming in.  We learned from all of those aspects.  It was similar to what was happening in many of our other centres across the country.  There were times when I will not say that we were lucky but when we worked hard to be lucky.</p></speech>

In terms of the plan, we are awaiting the hand-over from the builder.  Our understanding is that will be towards the end of September.  There will then be a period of commissioning and training, which is built into the transition process.  We would hope that we are on track for the end of the year.</p></speech>

Could I ask the witnesses from the commission, in terms of mental health services and training, how they will deal with the training records of the therapeutic management of violence, for example, where it is difficult because of distancing?  I do not believe that is happening nationally.  They might make an observation in respect of this matter.  Is there any possibility of making allowances for people, when their records are reviewed, in the context of their, for example, being unable to complete their training where that was the case?</p></speech>

Violence, restraining people or secluding people is not therapeutic in any way, irrespective of what people call it.  It is not good for people.</p></speech>

We have taken into consideration the training records of any training that relies on point-to-point contact between individuals.  That would include CPR, manual handling, and prevention and management of aggression and violence.  In our inspection plan for going back out to do inspections, which we did this week, we have built in an allowance for that and how we intend to address it.  I will ask Dr. Finnerty to address that.</p></speech>

We will be looking very carefully at services where training is difficult for them to do in light of Covid-19.  We have found over the years that it is extremely difficult for the services to release staff to do training, even in terms of mandatory training.  Matters have improved over the years but we are still not at 100% and, obviously, this year we will certainly not be at 100%.  We will take into account, as Ms Smyth said, the fact that people cannot do face-to-face contact and do training in a group setting.</p></speech>

A couple of thousand tribunals happen each year.  We continued with those tribunals.  It was the previous Government that changed the Mental Health Act to enable us to have the tribunals in order to vindicate people's rights.  We are worried about one issue.  It is about ensuring that people do not take that for granted and that they know their rights.</p><p>There is now a bigger onus on the clinical teams to make sure that people who are detained know their rights.  We must not forget about people's human rights while keeping them safe.  That seems to be going relatively well.  This is scrutinised quite rigorously by an independent group composed of a barrister, a consultant psychiatrist and a layperson whom we recruit independently.</p></speech>

They have obviously been difficult.  What impact has Covid-19 had on visits, and what is the thinking on allowing them to recommence?  I would like to address this question to both the Mental Health Commission and the HSE.</p></speech>

Social distancing, staff wearing masks or being unable to come into approved centres and the suspension of visits have made for a really isolating experience for some people within the mental health services.  As the restrictions are lifted, people will be able to meet and communicate with their relatives and families, but it has had an impact.  The same is true for all the measures and restrictions that have been put in place because of Covid-19.</p></speech>

We have tried to use technology to assist with this.  Some of our organisations, such as the Irish Advocacy Network, have placed iPads in the approved centres to enable contact with patients.  That has worked very well and we think it has a lot of potential.  Parental visits are a key element of the therapeutic programme in child and adolescent units.  We have looked at using our own transportation.  Parents can come in by car.  We have looked at a wide variety of ways to ensure a connection between the service user and his or her family, notwithstanding the need to ensure that public health guidelines are followed at all times.</p></speech>

As soon as there were restrictions with regard to visiting we were very keen to put in place a mechanism by which young people could keep in regular contact with their parents using technology such as Skype.  Clearly that does not replace actual physical visits.  At the same time we had to be mindful of the restrictions the units needed to impose to limit the spread of Covid-19 and other public health considerations.  In recent weeks the inpatient units have been able to reintroduce visits by family members and parents on a limited basis.  That has been rolled out in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, inpatient units throughout the country.</p></speech>

That will vary.  For some young people it is shorter and for others, depending on the reason for their admission, it can be much longer.  In the Linn Dara inpatient unit we have now moved to facilitating visits twice weekly.  Again, that takes restrictions to minimise the risk of Covid-19 into account.</p><p>As we open up visiting, it is also important to manage the risk of introducing Covid into the inpatient setting.  It is a balance between managing that risk and at the same time facilitating very important contact young people have with their family.</p></speech>

I want to focus on the access to mental health services.  As we know, even long before the Covid pandemic, it was problematic to access those services, particularly after hours.  How are child and adolescent mental health services expected to resume?  What challenges will Covid present in delivering those services?  Can we expect to see further waiting times or a reduction in service delivery?</p></speech>

This week the HSE published a report that shows significant issues with waiting.  Our mental health system is not fit for purpose and is out of date.  We need to invest in it and we need to invest in the community.  A child who gets into a unit is very lucky.  In the services we regulate, the children's services and the private services tend to be of a relatively good calibre.  Until we invest properly in our community services and stop making excuses that we have some sort of a service, what we need for our children will not improve to the degree it should be in this day and age.</p></speech>

As Mr. Ryan has alluded to, there has been some move to use videoconferencing techniques to enable people to have therapy sessions, but there would be no group work or skills-based programmes in the hospital or approved centre.</p> <p>  Access to community services would also be quite limited at times for the same reasons - that people are unable to attend their occupational therapist, social worker, psychologist or other therapist because of the Covid pandemic.  Access to non-medical, non-psychiatric treatment has been limited and very inconsistent, with widespread variation throughout the country as to where services are able or unable to provide therapeutic programmes.</p></speech>

The secondary care mental health service is being provided through our community mental health teams, our day programmes, our acute inpatient units, our long-stay units and our community residences.  They have been affected in a variety of ways.  For example, at the moment we are operating at approximately 91% of our pre-Covid capacity on our acute units.  We are most challenged in our day programmes and therapeutic programmes, which require much more significant face-to-face contact between patients and clinicians.  From that perspective we need to look at creative ways in which we manage that.  One of the platforms we use for engagement between clinicians and patients, Attend Anywhere, has proven very helpful and useful.</p> <p>  I ask Dr. Doody to outline the point of view from CAMHS.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding, obviously, the implications of Covid on service delivery, the inpatient services are running at about 85% of the number of admissions this time last year.</p><p>It is important to remember that the total number of admissions to the HSE-funded units last year increased 50% on the previous year.  The increased capacity has meant a greater number of admissions.  It has also allowed services to respond more quickly to admissions of children when inpatient treatment is required and has resulted in a reduction in children being admitted to adult facilities.</p><p> In the inpatient setting, while there are obviously restrictions around service delivery, all the young people have access to full multidisciplinary inputs.  In community services, there has been a shift away from face-to-face consultation to greater use of technology such as telephone calls, Skype calls and similar technologies offering a video link.  This has proved very effective and useful in some instances.  It does not, however, totally supplant face-to-face interactions.  At this point, services are looking at how to increase capacity to deliver more services in a face-to-face context, taking into account considerations around Covid-19.  This involves looking at facilities and conducting risk assessments to ensure there is a process in place.  There was a fall-off in demand for community services and the number of referrals received.  However, services are expecting the numbers to increase significantly when young people start to return to school in the autumn.  We usually find that referrals to mental health services reduce during school holidays.  This is not a school holiday as we have experienced and known school holidays until now.  Young people remain under a significant degree of stress and one would expect there to be a pent-up demand for services.  It is important, therefore, that services plan for the expected increase in referrals after the summer.</p></speech>

Effectively, the numbers of referrals are dropping but cases with more severe or acute need are still being referred.  Although the number of referrals dropped, referrals continued and young people continued to be seen, even during the early phase of Covid-19.  However, it was young people with a more severe presentation who were being referred and seen.</p></speech>

I speak from the perspective of the specialist mental health services.  Work needs to be done in education for parents and teachers to inform them so they are more aware of the mental health issues young people will experience because of what we have gone through.</p><p>For specialist mental health services, it is about how we ramp up capacity to see the increased numbers of young people who will be referred.  That means looking within buildings and facilities, how we will ramp up capacity, particularly with face-to-face consultations, and how to do that taking into account public health considerations and restrictions because of Covid.  Then there is examining programmes and how we might facilitate the use of technology.  There has been quite a leap forward in the usefulness and use of technology.  In future, we will see a balance between face to face and online and the use of technology to support young people who are referred to specialist mental health services.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. John Farrelly from the Mental Health Commission for his very candid and upfront appraisal of what is going on in mental health service by saying that it is not fit for purpose and is out of date.  I agree 100%.  We can have no half measures with mental health provision, especially as the Covid pandemic has only increased pressures on already under-resourced mental health services which were already there.  Does the HSE agree with Mr. Farrelly's appraisal?</p></speech>

Our role is to ensure that the resources and services which we provide are appropriate to the needs of the population that we serve.  Looking at recent years, our budget has increased and there has been an increase in service.  This year we will open a new unit in Sligo.  We have refurbished units in Limerick and Tralee, and there are new units in Cork and Drogheda.  The national forensic service will be completed by the end of the year.  There has been quite significant investment in the infrastructure.  That most certainly is not to say that there is not a need for more.  I fully agree that there is always a need for more resources in mental health, but working within the resources that we have and trying to make the maximum use of them, as well as of the staff we have, who are highly trained and committed, as we saw in recent months.  Our role is to make the very best use of the resources that we have in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  We look forward to Sharing the Vision, the new national policy, which builds on the very successful A Vision for Change from 2006, to drive that investment into the future.</p></speech>

Are those problems ongoing or has Mr. Ryan seen light at the end of that tunnel?</p></speech>

Part of the reason is that our staff are very highly trained and marketable across the world.  We have seen that over recent years.  In psychiatric nursing, we have increased the number of places in our third level colleges in the past four years.  This year we will see the first group of additional nurses coming out in September, although they are already on units because of Covid.  Next year, there will be a further tranche of additional nurses on top of those who would be traditionally trained through third level institutions.  From the HSE's perspective, we invested in that because we saw the need and logic for those nurses.  Similarly, with consultants, we have increased the number of basic specialist training, BST, and higher specialist training, HST, places in 2020 so that we might have a better pipeline of staff coming through in the next few years.  Staffing by allied health professionals, AHPs, can be a challenge in some areas, particularly around psychology.  This is something we are working on continuously.  To answer the Deputy's question directly, it is an ongoing issue but one on which we are committed because we want to try to ensure that we have the proper staff in place for our service users.</p></speech>

My question relates to dual diagnosis.</p><p>I did not see any mention of it in the report published today.  I have worked in several addiction centres across Dublin in a professional capacity.  All present know that drink and drugs give people the ability to self-medicate and calm the anxiety in their world for a certain amount of time, until it stops working.  It becomes a learned response.  Will new or additional addiction and mental health services be provided in order that they can work together instead of working apart?  That is one of the biggest challenges.  If the mental health service solely focuses on mental health issues and addiction services solely focus on addiction, people will fall through the cracks of those services.  Will an approach be taken whereby the services will be more aligned and more resources will be allocated, especially to community addiction services?</p></speech>

I worked as a drug task force co-ordinator in the early 2000s and I understand entirely the point being made by the Deputy, particularly with regard to alcohol and substance misuse and their impact on mental health.  I fully understand his perspective.</p></speech>

The way we are currently delivering services is such mental health services look after patients whose primary diagnosis is of mental health difficulties, even if the patient attends in respect of addiction issues.  If the patient's primary issue is addiction, he or she is looked after by the addiction services and we provide support.  The Deputy is correct that the services are not working together.  We are currently looking at a clinical programme or service improvement whereby the two services can work together.  I have started working on it and hope that a programme will be announced very soon.  It is in the programme for Government and is clearly mentioned in the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.  The integration of services is one of the key elements on which we are trying to work.</p></speech>

I was a board member of the board of a local drugs task force at that time.  The budgets of such task forces have probably not increased since 2000.  That is one of the problems they are facing.  A drugs task force may wish to provide, for example, some sort of mental health service or dual diagnosis service, but if that is not specified in its service level agreement with the HSE, it is restricted from implementing its wishes  They are trying to fight with one hand tied behind their back.  As a result of budget constraints, when something new comes in, something else must go out.</p> <p>  A report from the child care law reporting project, which mainly relates to children being taken into care, came to my attention yesterday.  It involved a heartbreaking case of a girl who was admitted to a psychiatric unit as a result of a serious eating disorder.  Due to Covid-19 restrictions, her parents were not permitted to have face-to-face contact with her during her stay in the inpatient unit.  Access was only possible using Skype.  In court, her father agreed that his daughter was getting the right care in the right place and needed to be there, but he also emphasised how stressful the lack of face-to-face contact was in the context of the family relationship and for him as a father supporting his daughter during her stay.  What protocols are being put in place to allow the resumption of face-to-face contact in order that families in such situations can at least see each other during these very difficult and challenging times?</p></speech>

The inpatient or CAMHS units have all reinstituted visiting.  Obviously, visiting is permitted mindful of Covid and necessary precautions being in place.  It takes place twice per week and is being reviewed on an ongoing basis.  As soon as we could reinstate visiting by parents, that was done.</p></speech>

Would that increase from 7% to 12% adequately resource mental health services across the State or would more be needed?</p></speech>

One of the things we want to look at is our tiered level of care, and some of the contributions earlier from Jigsaw, Mental Health Ireland and Mental Health Reform spoke to that.  We have a very strong relationship with our NGO partners, and part of that is about ensuring that where the HSE can fund external organisations to deliver, particularly on primary care and universal supports and in particular where young people are concerned but also for the entire population, in a way that is much more flexible, we have been trying to do that to try to reduce potential waiting times.  We are also seeking to use technology.  We now have service agreements with a number of organisations to deliver services on our behalf.  Covid has made that even more urgent than it was previously, although it has also made it more possible.</p> <p>  We would welcome additional funding.  If the Deputy looks back at A Vision for Change, although it was not possible during the recession, since 2012, significant additional resources have been made available.  We would hope that in the implementation of Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Policy for Everyone, which is really the key element, additional resources would be made available.</p></speech>

Dr. Niazi said that if there is a primary diagnosis of mental health, the psychiatric services would deal with it, and if there is a primary diagnosis of addiction, the addiction services would deal with it.  My personal experience of working with and supporting people trying to access these services is that both services claim the primary issue is for the other service, which is what leads to people falling between the cracks and points to the problem of these services not working together.  It fundamentally illustrates Mr. Farrelly&rsquo;s point that the mental health services are not fit for purpose.  I thank Deputy Ward for raising this very important issue.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on Dr. Finnerty's point around the inconsistency throughout the country in community services.  Will she talk more about that, especially focusing on areas that have done it well?  What can we learn from them?  What can other services that have not done it well learn from the services that have done it well?  What has contributed to the success of those services amidst the inconsistency? </p></speech>

There is no uniform staffing and no uniform provision of service throughout the country.  Covid has probably highlighted this in some sense in that, given the provision of therapeutic services by a small number of allied health professionals, when they were unable to deal with people during the Covid crisis, this set it up in sharp relief that there are not enough services or enough resources in community services.</p> <p>  The difficulty is that if there are not enough resources in the community services, then people will naturally gravitate towards the admission units, which leads to a difficulty on discharge because there is very little follow-up.  Therefore, the problem of lack of access to community services is not just part of Covid, but Covid has made it worse.</p><p>Some areas are particularly poorly staffed with allied health professionals and consultant psychiatrists.  This can be for a number of reasons, including difficulties with the retention and recruitment of staff and with staff not working wanting to work in isolated areas.  It is multifactorial.  Where there has been a history or tradition of intensive provision of service, the funding will stay.  It is more difficult for areas where there has not been a very high level of provision of inpatient services.  I refer to when the old asylums were open.  It is difficult for the affected areas to get the funding to match that of other areas.  There is a wide variation in funding and staffing resources across the country.</p></speech>

Were there any challenges?  Was there a sufficient number of tribunal members to be able to deliver?  Were there any legislative challenges, including in terms of meeting remotely?  Is there anything we should be considering in case we face delivery challenges in the future?

Working with the Department and tribunal staff, our staff, led by my head of legal affairs, did good work.</p> <p>  On the lessons learned, the biggest worry concerned people going into centres.  Many of our panel members tend to be older and there were worries about them going in because they might have  secondary conditions.  It actually worked very well.  We have to analyse it even more.  The little worry we have concerns making sure patients' rights are absolutely vindicated in terms of a solicitor representing them.  Maybe we need to consider this.

I want to start off by asking some questions about children who have been very severely affected by the restrictions arising from Covid.  I refer to the fear, being closed in, the loss of contact with friends, and the loss of involvement in school activities, in particular.  These have had a pretty severe impact on children in the early stages of development.  We heard earlier about the services Jigsaw is providing for young people at second level.  What services are in place or what specific programmes are proposed for primary school children?  We know significant issues will arise.  Presumably, given the long waiting lists for all children's mental health services, it would make sense to deliver school-based programmes and public health messages.  What is proposed for that age cohort?</p> <p>  We are all very familiar with the terribly inadequate services for preschool children with potential mental health difficulties.  An example comprises the early intervention teams.  We probably have all heard from constituents whose children were on waiting lists for so long that they reached the age of five before the HSE could provide a service to them.  They might have been waiting for services for three or four years and aged out.  Specifically, what do the witnesses intend to do to address the issues affecting that cohort and primary school children?</p></speech>

It must be remembered that we are a secondary care mental health service so we work with our primary care and health and well-being colleagues, as well as maintaining contact with the school system.  This is something we will need to take on board but our focus is on stepping back up both our primary and secondary care services for the overall younger age group.  However, I take on board the point the Deputy has made.</p></speech>

Before Covid-19, the HSE's services were not coping and there is a clear need for additional services arising from Covid-19.  It is disappointing that we are at a point where we hope children will be back at school in September but no work has been done on developing new school-based services to meet that need.  I respectfully suggest the HSE needs to get on with that job.</p> <p>  I also want to add to the points that have been made on dual diagnosis.  It never made any sense to separate addiction and mental health problems.  That is a structural issue for the HSE, which should be resolved.  Given the level of mental healthcare need emerging as a result of Covid-19 and what we know about the additional substance abuse and misuse with alcohol, prescription drugs and illicit drugs, surely now more than ever there is a strong case for combining those two services and for stopping the practice of making that false distinction?</p></speech>

We work with the Department of Education and Skills, which is the most important thing we can do to protect children's mental health, because it has to be done in an appropriate manner and the schools are a key element of that.  Dr. Niazi has responded to the Deputy's point on dual diagnosis earlier but we take on board the fact that there is a need to do more.</p></speech>

The first relates to the submission by the Mental Health Commission.  Section 2 refers to mental health services and regulation.  Could a spokesperson for the commission define what is meant by the term "unregulated" here?  The submission states a further 10% of mental health services are delivered within specialist mental health services, including a 24-hour nursing staff community residency, which are unregulated.  Will the witnesses define the term "unregulated"?</p></speech>

They are the inpatient centres that are registered, and we have powers around that.  Regarding all other mental health services, the inspector has the power to visit but we do not have powers to make them how they should be.  For example, some of the hostels or community houses that people are in are not fit for purpose.  That came across in the Covid-19 pandemic.  For example, someone could be sharing a room with three other people he or she does not know.  They would not be family members.  No one else in society, apart perhaps from members of very big families, does that.  There is that element.</p> <p>  The other aspect is the primary care services.  If an individual or his or her child is unwell, he or she visits the GP or accident and emergency department.  The idea is that people can go to secondary services before going to the final 1% of services.  The idea, as Mr. Ryan said, is tiered services and that people are seen as early as possible in their communities.  For example, if we take Clondalkin, people in that area will not go to Tallaght Hospital.  The services are in Rowlagh, Neilstown or Palmerstown and people's needs are met in those services or in their home.  We do not regulate any of that.  In a way, this is unfair on the acute units because the very strong light we have shining on them means there is great transparency and all the issues are visible.  That is caused by not having any scrutiny of the services in the community, which are not regulated.</p></speech>

I am very interested in vulnerable people.  I do not mean to be paternalistic but I mean the people who become unwell, may not have supports in society and fall through the cracks.  As far as I am concerned as a public servant, my job is to make sure that those people are protected.  They number in the thousands, approximately 1% of the total.  The reason the services are not regulated is that Government policy is that they are not regulated.</p></speech>

I spoke in the previous session about the highs and lows of the public health emergency.  The highs were the coming together of people and the solidarity and support they showed one another.  One cannot buy the bonding that took place over the past four months.  However, there were also huge lows for the many people who had to self-isolate and were unable to be part of that gathering.  We are social animals and the loss of contact is incalculable.  What has been the lasting effect of the past four months on the national psyche but also on individuals in the population in terms of depression, anxiety and so forth?</p></speech>

We have seen research on what happened in previous traumatic situations.  Covid-19, considering that it will be with us for a considerable period of time, poses a greater challenge.  I am a member of the International Initiative for Mental Health Leadership, IIMHL.  Our international colleagues have done a good deal of work on the medium-term effects.  The concern, as the Deputy said, is that initially there is a buzz about people coming together and then there is a flatter period.  One of the things we need to ensure is that from the point of view of primary care and universal support - I spoke earlier about our tiered level supports - we do not say that everybody who is feeling down has a mental illness.</p><p>That is not the case.  We need to preserve our secondary and tertiary care services for those who need them most.<br/><br/>From the point of view of primary care, we have attempted to use technology to deliver additional counselling services and sessions online.  This has been done through platforms like SilverCloud Health, MyMind, <i>spunout.ie</i>, <i>turn2me.ie </i>and any number of other organisations that we have funded.  This is about giving people the tools to deal with an issue which we hope will be finite but which we now recognise will be with us for a while.  We want to ensure two things, namely, we want to provide upfront services while making sure that the services required for those with a longer-term mental illness are not adversely affected.</p></speech>

The former CEO of Mental Health Reform, Dr. Shari McDaid, has advised successive Ministers of State with responsibility for mental health, senior civil servants and senior HSE executives on solutions to improve the mental health service.  She has recommended the organisation of a cross-governmental cross-society task force to develop the country's mental health recovery plan, with a commitment that the plan would be published within six months.  The groundwork for such a plan has been laid in the review of the national mental health policy, A Vision for Change.  The review of the latter was completed at the end of 2019 and the refreshed version is awaiting publication.  It should be published immediately in order to provide the framework for planning the services that will prevent people from developing severe mental health difficulties and help them to recover their mental health and well-being after the pandemic.  Dr. McDaid is asking the Government to commit to increasing protected funding to implement the mental health recovery plan.  Before the pandemic occurred, she also recommended rapidly scaling up and implementing the use of digital technology in mental healthcare at primary and secondary levels.  The HSE had been working on piloting online mental health services for several years.  A major effort must now be made to scale up these initiatives in order to increase the reach and capacity of services so that anyone who needs an intervention by a mental health professional can get it quickly.</p> <p>  Dr. McDaid states that we must embed trauma-informed approaches across public services.  She notes that common sense tells us that many people of all ages, from young children to those in their later years, will have experienced personal trauma during the pandemic.  In a sense, we all have.  For those children whose families have struggled to cope with the isolation and who face sudden economic hardship, the threat of losing their homes, domestic abuse, bereavement or separation from a loved one who is dying, the personal trauma must be quite profound.  Every teacher, school staff member, garda, health professional, social welfare officer, housing officer and provider of social care needs to know how to respond appropriately to their service users so as not to retraumatise them.</p> <p>  What plans are in place for the implementation of Dr. McDaid's recommendations in order to streamline the mental health service for the new challenges it faces?</p></speech>

It is Government policy.  I understand that it is mentioned in the programme for Government.  As a provider, the HSE will work very closely with the Department and Health, from which the policy document originates, in order for it to be implemented.  Similar to A Vision for Change, which was launched in 2006, it is a ten-year document.  The next stage will be an implementation plan.  Dr. McDaid was involved in the writing of the refresh document.</p> <p>  The HSE welcomes the policy document.  A Vision for Change provided a very helpful roadmap for the development of services.  It also enabled us to secure additional funding.  We expect that an implementation plan will soon be put in place with the support of the Government and the Department of Health.  We hope to be involved in that.</p></speech>

To follow up from the Deputy's previous question, we monitored all the mental health services by phone throughout the period that we were not allowed into the service.  We had in excess of 2,500 calls during that period.  We were in contact with services weekly if not more often.  We have developed very good relationships with services on that basis.</p> <p>  We monitored all the services for suspected and confirmed cases.  I am pleased to note that this week was the first week in which we have no cases to report within mental health services.  Overall, 28 services had positive cases, 19 in inpatient approved centres and eight in community residences.  A total of 47 services had positive results for staff members, 32 in inpatient services and 15 in community residences.  This is what the services have advised us, and we are validating those data with services to ensure their accuracy.  That is the status of the numbers as of this week.</p></speech>

That is not mentioning medium  and low-support beds.  I do not have the detail for single occupancy.  The majority of our new units, particularly on the approved centre sites, are single or double occupancy rooms.  We have tried to eliminate multi-occupancy.

There is also the matter of altering treatment plans for those already engaged with the service being altered.  I return to the point made by Mr. Farrelly at the beginning, which I agree with as do many other Deputies, that our current community mental health services are not fit for purpose.  We have spoken about returning to some level of service that resembles normality even though, for example, there will not be any new primary school service.  Has the HSE examined the expected increase in demand for acute mental health services?  An answer has not been fleshed out here.  Inevitably, there will be a further reduction in service for those in real need.   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.283" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#VV00200"><p>It is not feasible for services to deliver the type of service that was delivered pre-Covid.  Services must look at how they will deliver the maximum amount of service to the maximum number of young people who require the service at specialist mental health service level.  The majority of children and adolescents accessing specialist mental health services access community mental health services.  Numbers of referrals annually to community services are approximately 12,000.  The first challenge is how we maintain that level of activity being mindful of the restrictions about being able to deliver the service with regard to public health considerations and the need to minimise the risk of the spread of Covid.  We must look at a new service which is both delivering a service face-to-face but also remote access using technologies, and a more blended approach.  At the same time, we must also scale up services in anticipation of an increased demand.  We know, as Mr. Ryan said earlier, from international research and current surveys of young people with mental health difficulties that the Covid pandemic has had a negative impact on their mental health and that we need to be mindful of that.  As we live in a time of increased uncertainty, we would expect increased levels of anxiety disorders and other mental health disorders.  We need to look across the spectrum, from how people are supported in their mental health across services from community to primary care to specialist mental health services.</p></speech>

My question is for Dr. Niazi.  I appreciate his assurance that he will bring forward reports.  The programme for Government does talk about the protocols and the legislation.  I had the great pleasure of attending the launch of the Finglas Addiction Support Team report on dual diagnosis which was researched with Dublin City University.  No doubt Dr. Niazi is familiar with the report.  It is a very thorough body of research.  It made four key recommendations including changes to the Mental Health Act, that no door is not an option, the idea of a clinical programme around dual diagnosis and changes in training and education for those engaged in both parts so that they are seen as two sides of the one coin.  There might be an opportunity to discuss this with Dr. Niazi in further detail when the joint committees are established.</p></speech>

The report goes on to cite critical risks in several areas, including premises, therapeutic programmes, services and staffing, as well as a lack of individual plans for patients in these settings.  I wish to talk Mr. Ryan through some of the figures in the report because they are quite stark.  The figures are broken down for each hospital and acute centre.  The centres are licensed and have conditions attaching to them, as Mr. Ryan is aware.  I refer to the psychiatric unit in Waterford.  Its compliance rate was 77% in 2017, 73% in 2018 and 67% in 2019.  That is going in the wrong direction.  The same is true in several other areas.  I will move to the compliance figures broken down by area.  The compliance figure for premises was 31% and that for individual care plans was 52%.  It was 57% in 2018.  Compliance with rules on electroconvulsive therapy was 45%, down from 58%.  The level of compliance with rules on seclusion was 21%, down from 33%.  Compliance with regard to the admission of children was 7%, down from 11%.</p> <p>  How can Mr. Ryan, as one of the people with responsibility for this area, stand over situations in which the independent regulator is stating that residents are being treated as second-class citizens, that their fundamental human rights are being breached and that many of the residents are being treated in places where there are compliance issues in the context of cleanliness, a lack of individual care plans and other difficulties?  How can he, as a person who is responsible for making sure that those actions are delivered, stand over the report to which I refer and the figures it contains?</p></speech>

We are working on that response, as we speak, and our report will go into all the areas the Deputy has raised and about which we have been aware.  That is the best way I can answer the question in the short time available as the Deputy raised many issues.  I assure him that I will provide that documentation.  It will go to the commission in the first instance, as a response from the HSE.</p></speech>

Mr. Ryan will be aware that in my constituency a number of reports were published specifically about the department of psychiatry in University Hospital Waterford.  The position does not seem to be improving.  I have given an example where the figures are going in the wrong direction.  The reports point out that there are staffing problems.  The report on Waterford unit found that the unit was not clean, bins were overflowing in some toilets, there were cigarette butts and stains in toilets and patients were on floors.  This does not paint a very good picture of some of these centres and how patients are being treated.</p> <p>  To come back to the fundamental point, notwithstanding whether we have Covid-19, if the regulator says that some people patients are being treated as second-class citizens, it is a damning statement to make.  I am sure it was not made lightly.</p></speech>

Mr. Farrelly points out in his report that overall compliance is going in the wrong direction, as the breakdown of the figures shows.  Why were conditions attached to the unit in Waterford removed given that overall compliance was going in the wrong direction?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.312" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#XX00900"><p>The conditions, in the first instance, are supposed to be specific to solve a particular risk.  Waterford is a very good example of how things can go wrong in a system.  If one tracks back over 20 years, with the closures of the different hospitals and the lack of community services, what one gets is people going into this place which is overcrowded and operating above capacity.  The clinicians are afraid that if the person is outside, he or she will come to harm.  There is a systemic issue, as well as a governance issue in the HSE, which we are raising with the HSE.  There is a board in the HSE and mental health needs to be brought up the agenda.  The old Government policy was that there was a national director for mental health.  That person was taken out contrary to Government policy.  Improving governance in community services is definitely an issue.  We have done a large amount of work with community healthcare organisation area 5 in the past six or seven months.  The decision for us was that this was really not good and something needs to stop.  At the same time, we do not want to leave the families and residents in the lurch.</p></speech>

If things are improving in Waterford, that is fine but the Mental Health Commission's report shows that compliance overall is going in the opposite direction.  Page 24 of the report refers to the enforcement model.  The commission has the option to remove a unit or service from its register.  Has it ever done that?</p></speech>

I do not think it would be in anyone's interest to close the unit in Waterford.  However, I definitely think it is improving.</p><p> One of the models we use is transparency.  People get forgotten about.  The idea of transparency and having people like committee members being able to read the report wakes people up to the reality of how we are treating people.  To me, that is the best weapon.</p></speech>

I am just asking the question.  It is one of the powers the Mental Health Commission has.  If things got so bad in some of them that it warranted closure, I am wondering why those powers were not used.</p> <p>  The main point I am making is that if Waterford is an example, it is not a great example because the services have not improved to my satisfaction.  I would imagine that what Mr. Farrelly is saying is that it is a carrot-and-stick approach to some degree, and that he wants the HSE to solve the problems that he addresses.  My point is that in regard to premises, staffing and cleanliness, time and again we are seeing problems and lack of individual care plans, and these are not being addressed.  That is a fundamental problem for me, given the vulnerable people we are dealing with.</p></speech>

It is a fundamental problem for me in terms of the response we get back.  However, it is about the governance, the board, the CEOs, the people who sit at the executive committee and the politicians.  We have to own this.  With regard to the 50% figure for the care plans, I trained in England 30 years ago and that was just a given, whereas in Ireland, we nearly have to force people to do things.  We are not going to get people to come into our service if people cannot even do a basic care plan properly.  That is what it is all about - basic human rights and working with the person.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy.  I can assure him that we in the commission have a new strategy which started last year.  Our tolerance levels are now gone, and the Deputy will have seen our first prosecution in Kilkenny.</p> <p>  I would add that it is not just Waterford but also Wexford and all of that area, including Kilkenny, where a lot of work is needed, particularly in regard to community services, if we are not going to have the right number of acute beds.</p></speech>

I call Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and welcome the improvements in the Crosslanes facility in Drogheda.  There are still issues about people who may be in drug treatment but who cannot get care because of the drug they are dependent on, although that is a separate issue.  As I understand the OECD statistics, one in five of our citizens has mental health issues and we have the lowest bed capacity in Europe, with 34 beds per 100,000 compared with a European average of 69.  That adds to the point made by Deputy Cullinane.  If a person has severe mental health problems, they will live on average 20 years less than their peers of the same age, so it is a huge issue.  Mr. Farrelly is right to be concerned, as we all are.  We support what he is saying.  The system is not fit for purpose and Covid is allowing us to contribute to the debate on this.  I agree that we should put it top of our priority list.  As politicians from the Government and Opposition sides, and I am a Government supporter, we need to get this right.</p> <p>  There is a very significant readmission rate and something like 64% of patients who have been in care or treatment go back in.  Do we need to have different responses in terms of appropriate recovery and step-down facilities?  Will the witnesses comment on whether we have inadequate or any step-down facilities for people who have been in treatment, who should go back to the community but who need a period of care outside the acute setting?</p></speech>

As a precursor, as the Deputy is aware, the refresh of A Vision for Change, Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Policy for Everyone, envisages a review of acute bed capacity in the country.  That is welcome and timely, and the HSE will absolutely be involved in that.  I hope it will address over time the issues raised by Deputy Cullinane.</p><p>There were 20,000 people in psychiatric hospitals in 1960 and now there are approximately 1,039 beds.  Therefore, we have moved much of our care to the community but we must be cognisant that the pendulum may swing too far at times.</p></speech>

That is obviously for us to address.  What about my question on step-down facilities?</p></speech>

A review of acute services has already started.  I believe there is a meeting today in this regard.</p> <p>  We have an opportunity now.  We have Sharing of Vision and the programme for Government so we can plan for step-down services for the next ten years and see how it should be done.  I welcome Mr. Farrelly's recommendation on taking a unified approach to deal with all this.</p> <p>  In previous years, even when the Government allocated funding for mental health services, there were times when we were unable to use them.  Much of our funding is for manpower.  Even if services had funding, they might not have been usable because consultants or nursing staff were not available.  As Mr. Ryan says, there should now be a unified approach.  We are working with the HSE's national doctors training and planning division and the training college to determine how many consultants we need to train for the next ten years?  Similarly, our nursing colleges are considering what numbers will be required over the next ten years, how many beds we will need, how many units that are single occupancy units that-----</p></speech>

We had the acute units and we had the day centres.  We are now trying to open up day hospitals to achieve a stepping down from acute admission facilities.  We want most of our day centres to be community resource facilities whereas the day hospitals will have a very targeted approach to admissions.  Instead of having patients proceed straight to admission with nothing in the middle, we are trying to introduce the day hospital model as a multidisciplinary model to address the gap.  That is the answer.  We are trying to move to day centres to step down from acute admissions.</p></speech>

I can talk to the witnesses about that later.</p> <p>  There are over 30,000 people in nursing homes and an average of 70% of these have dementia.  Given the significant relationship between dementia and psychiatric co-morbidity - if that is the right phrase to use - and considering that thousands of people living in nursing homes have lost contact with their relatives and communities in a significant way, what interaction do the psychiatric services have with nursing homes generally as a result of Covid?  Is there any formal relationship?  How do the services react?  What proposals do the witnesses have in this respect?</p></speech>

All our acute units continued to function.  All the psychiatry for later life teams continued to function.  They had a different way of providing services.  We made the best use of technology.  Whether it was by telephone, BlueEye or Attend Anywhere, or even Zoom, we tried to maintain contact.  Face-to-face contact was limited because of the public health guidance.  I have never heard of any services being withdrawn although the way services were provided to nursing homes changed.  That is the best evidence I can give.</p> <p>  Regarding our model of care, there is a discussion taking place on allocating resources for those in nursing homes and for liaison services in acute hospitals.  More than 70% of beds in acute hospitals are filled with patients over 65 years of age.</p><p>That is an area which is highlighted in the model of care in our psychiatry of later life service, and again we are looking at how we can improve that in our ten-year programme.</p></speech>

Is there any network in place?</p></speech>

If 70% of these 30,000 residents have some psychiatric problems or issues, what should the HSE be doing or can the HSE come back to us with a model or proposal for this?

It was interesting and I thank them for providing the report in advance.</p> <p>  I represent D&uacute;n Laoghaire in the D&aacute;il and one of the big issues I have had over the years has been the staffing resource for community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 6.  It has been difficult to retain and recruit staff in various departments, but I want to look specifically at CAMHS and how the children and adolescent sector is resourced.  Will the HSE comment on the overall recruitment process?  I do not want to be too parochial but will the HSE comment on how the level of staffing for mental health services has been filled so far?</p></speech>

Different parts of the country will have different recruitment challenges, and the south Dublin area has previously been challenging for us from the perspective of recruiting, particularly for allied health professionals, AHPs.  That can be down to many issues such as economic issues etc.  Looking at our A Vision for Change numbers, throughout the country we are at about 65% of what was set out in 2006 and we have more than 70 teams in place.  The recruitment challenges have been most strenuous in specialist areas and CAMHS is one of those.  Dr. Doody might comment more specifically on that because he is involved in running a unit on a day-to-day basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-07-14a.337" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020071400002#AAA00800"><p>There are particular challenges in south Dublin in recruiting and retaining staff, and those may be issues that are not necessarily linked with the services themselves but more with people's personal circumstances.  That is one issue, but overall one has to be mindful that services need to be grown in a sustainable way or else skilled people will just move from one service to another.  It is important that services are only grown at a sustainable level.  There needs to be a proper plan for growing services in a way that AHPs in particular and other specialists who are required to staff multidisciplinary specialist teams are trained.  The issue of physical infrastructure also has to be looked at.  There is quite a significant timeline with regard to bringing inpatient services on stream from design to building and roll-out.</p><p> The Deputy must remember that with child and adolescent mental health services, the A Vision for Change document in 2006 made a significant change in that it recommended that the age range for such services be extended to 18.  We were looking at services which up to then had been resourced for those under the age of 16.  Effectively, a significant additional investment needed to be made.  Over the past number of years there has been a significant increase in the number of teams and of staff on those teams.  Some of that growth has been limited by the availability of skilled professionals but one needs to be mindful that there has been significant population growth also.  Even though it may appear that there is investment and that new teams have been developed, one also needs to take into account that there has been significant population growth over that period of approximately-----</p></speech>

I appeal to the director and to the staff from the HSE in particular to keep that focus on south Dublin.  I have been aware of the challenges for many years but I ask them to redouble the efforts to retain and recruit staff for the CHO and the wider field.</p> <p>  In the earlier session, I raised the issue of dual diagnosis.  A problem that arises time and again is in terms of people who have an addiction but who also have mental health issues.  Could the witnesses comment on that?  Primary healthcare services are patchy, to say the least, across the country.  Some areas have a functioning primary healthcare service and a centre but others do not, and that presents challenges.</p> <p>  Finally, to the witnesses from the Mental Health Commission, it is stated on page 17 of the report we received in advance of this meeting that the commission was reporting on a weekly basis to the Department of Health.  If a second wave of Covid-19 were to hit or just in general the coming weeks or months, is that likely to continue?</p></speech>

My first question is to Mr. Ryan and it relates to a matter raised earlier by another member on the low level of Covid-19 in the forensic services.  Am I correct in stating that the forensic services are in one building or are there additional services throughout the country?</p></speech>

We also have Usher's Island in the city centre and our prison in-reach staff go into the main prisons across the country.  As a forensic service, we are national but the Central Mental Hospital is within one facility in Dundrum.  As the Deputy is aware, we also opened a nine-bed unit as a response to Covid-19 in the new facility but we have since moved patients on from that.</p></speech>

On what date were visits to the Central Mental Hospital restricted ?  I imagine Usher's Island would have been closed in the early stages and then the visitor restrictions relating to the Central Mental Hospital would have kicked in.  What date was that?</p></speech>

It has a massive high wall around it and double gates at the front.  It is very hard for anyone or anything to get into or out of it.  It is set up similarly to a prison.  I would not want the impression to be given that this is an open facility when clearly it is not.</p> <p>  I wish to discuss the restarting of care.  I apologise if I have missed this because I have been dipping in and out of the committee.  Is there a plan for catching up on services that have been missed or providing for people who might require more intensive engagement or therapy?  We have spoken at length about the impact this pandemic will have on the mental health of the population.  That will be even more acute among those who were already users of mental health services.</p></speech>

As the committee will be aware, the HSE produced a document on business continuity.  The care groups have all looked at their own services to determine what they need to bring services back on stream.  That plan is almost complete.  We are trying to determine what we can do safely and whether we can use some of the technology we have learned about in recent months.  We must also take the potential impact of a second wave of Covid-19 into account.</p></speech>

Our 24-hour residences are open, with limitations placed on visits.  The services which were impacted were day centres, day hospitals, group therapies and group activities.  They are gradually starting again, with social distancing and following all the guidelines from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC.</p> <p>  Covid-19 has impacted the mental health of the public, not just mental health service users, and the public requires the help of mental health services.  The HSE has worked very hard to address the psychosocial and mental health needs of the public.  We are targeting carers, families and staff members who were impacted by Covid-19.  A comprehensive national plan is being rolled out to serve the public, staff and carers.</p> <p>  We are recommencing secondary mental health services slowly and gradually, in keeping with the guidelines from the Institute of Public Health and the HPSC.  Our success in controlling the virus will guide us in how we restart.</p></speech>

There were serious recruitment and retention issues before the pandemic.  They were partly caused by recruitment embargoes imposed by the previous three Governments, even though their members give out about them now.  With regard to the need to catch up on services, which the witnesses have not addressed, and the restart of services which were already understaffed, has the HSE identified the need for a specific recruitment campaign?  Does the HSE have a target for the number of staff members that will be necessary in each grade, group and category, and has this target been published?</p></speech>

As part of our business continuity plan, we are determining what we need to bring services back in a safe way.  That will depend on whether the service in question constitutes inpatient services, day programmes or community care.  That number will be determined by our business continuity plan, which is being worked on at present.</p></speech>

I have my own opinions about telemedicine, particularly in the area of mental health.  I have made those views known and I am sure Mr. Ryan is well aware of them.  I would like to draw his attention to some information provided by Samaritans Ireland.  That organisation has described an increase in the number of emails it has received because service users find it difficult to talk on the phone in private during the lockdown.</p><p>This is not an ideal scenario.  However, the measure was a stopgap.  I would hate to think that a stopgap that was not ideal would somehow replace face-to-face services.  It was part of a presentation and the slide indicates that phone calls appear to centre on a need for human contact.  Replacing face-to-face services, even in a socially distanced way, with telemedicine will never be right.  I do not believe that has any place.  Based on when those services were replaced with a telemedicine service, calls to the Samaritans appear to centre on the need for human contact.  How many of the services will be replaced with a telemedicine service?  Does Dr. Niazi believe that would be an adequate replacement for face-to-face services.</p></speech>

When we are sitting with a patient face-to-face, it is not only the words that the patient says; we look at many other things.  We look at the body language, their hygiene and other dimensions of our assessment.  There are patients who even are paranoid who are not well when they on the other end of the phone because they have their own anxiety about the technology.  It was used during the pandemic.  We are not saying that we are replacing it.  Even during that phase of the pandemic, when the use of technology was happening, a doctor, who was concerned about somebody's mental health or felt that the information required from those assessments was not gathered appropriately, asked the patient to present to one of the acute units where separate areas were developed, keeping social distancing and other guidelines in place.</p> <p>  Now that the pandemic is settling a little, those face-to-face assessments have started to increase.  Patient need dictates how much of that can be done by technology.  If a patient is not sleeping and asks for a sleeping tablet, we can address that issue.  However, if we feel a patient's assessment requires face-to-face detailed assessment, he or she is invited to attend one of our units.  We are looking at the layout of all our outpatient areas and our sector headquarters and what needs to be done to make them safe.  I totally accept that we are not replacing technology, but that is another tool in our arsenal and it is available if we need to use it.</p></speech>

As part of the return-to-business protocol that has been published, that needs to be worked out on an individual area basis.

Each of the areas are looking at their own premises and services to establish how they can meet the twin approach of return to some degree of normality-----</p></speech>

From an ICT perspective this posed significant challenges.  There have been significant developments over recent months, probably greater than we would ever have deemed feasible.  The issue was raised about voices, which has certainly been a difficulty over the most recent period.  We hope that it will no longer be a difficulty because our investment in those devices will help meet the demand.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly referred to face-to-face communication.  We are trying to have a blended approach so those who need face-to-face support can have that access and we can try to ensure we maintain a level of service where we use technology to the best advantage.  As the Deputy has outlined, that coverage throughout the country can sometimes be patchy.  We are working on this daily.</p></speech>

We inputted into the structure with regard to the vulnerable person.  There was a fair bit of feeding in from professionals who understand mental health.  Now the context is about getting ready again when we know we have a service, which I really want to reiterate.  I would not want that to get lost.  I appreciate that the mental health of the nation and individuals is important, but within this there are highly vulnerable people with mental illness who really need to get the services.  For me, these are the people on whom I want the HSE to concentrate in building the service for people with mental illness.</p></speech>

Mr. Farrelly has been very clear with that message and I thank him very much.  I also thank the other representatives from the Mental Health Commission, Ms Rosemary Smyth and Dr. Susan Finnerty.  I thank Mr. Jim Ryan, Dr. Brendan Doody and Dr. Amir Niazi from the HSE.</p> <p>  I will suspend the committee until later this afternoon, when it will meet in private session.</p></speech>
