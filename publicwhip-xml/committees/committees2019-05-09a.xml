He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.</p> <p>  The minutes of the meeting of 18 April have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  No matters arise that will not come up under correspondence.</p> <p>   We will proceed to correspondence.  There are three categories.</p><p>Category A is correspondence relating to the briefing document and opening statements.  Nos. 2149A and 2150A from the Office of the Garda Commissioner, dated 3 May and 7 May 2019, are the briefing document and opening statement for today's meeting.  Is it agreed to note and publish these?  Agreed.</p><p> Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers, follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and other items for publishing.</p><p> No. 2121B is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills.  It is dated 16 April 2019 and provides information on the arrangements for the internal audit for education and training boards, ETBs, and the steps taken by the Department to resolve any issue.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; provides an update on the internal audit arrangements of the City of Dublin ETB and the ETB internal audit unit.  We note this and will publish it.  We know there have been difficulties and we are pleased the Department is starting to give this matter greater priority, attention and resources.  We will take this into consideration as part of our periodic report.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; advises there is an increased budget, as I have mentioned, and that the Department is jointly commissioning a wider review of internal audit in the sector to ascertain the longer-term support required to deliver an ongoing and appropriate internal audit function.  We have mentioned this.  One unit is based in Cavan and there are difficulties recruiting people to travel throughout the country.  The Department is examining this issue, which we welcome, but we will consider this as part of our periodic report because, as I have stated, we have not been happy with the internal audit function in the ETB sector and it is good that it is now being addressed.</p><p> No. 2122B is from Mr. John McCarthy, the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It provides a detailed response requested by the committee to a number of matters raised at our meeting with him on 28 February 2019.  We will note and publish this.  Any member who wants to comment on it is welcome to do so.  We will take the contents into consideration when finalising our report on housing issues.  A lot of information has to be incorporated in the report.</p><p> Deputies Catherine Murphy and Cassells wish to speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#B00200"><p>I was going to make exactly that point.  There is some information that would be useful for the report.  In recent weeks, an issue with regard to the cost of turnkey as opposed to direct build was revealed and we should include it.  It is something that was raised here and we got an undertaking that the categories would be published separately.  On average, it costs about one third more to buy turnkey as opposed to a direct build.  Given the scale of the housing crisis, direct build would certainly be a big part of the solution.</p> <p>  How do we intend to go about publishing the report?  It was to be a dual report on the national broadband plan and the work we have done on housing.  We have had hearings on both.  I realise an announcement was made.  We had a meeting scheduled yesterday to look at the draft report but a majority of the committee decided not to go ahead with it.  What way will we proceed?  There is a valuable contribution to be made in the work we have done on broadband, particularly on the forerunner to the national broadband plan, which was the metropolitan area networks.  The draft report is a start but there are significant gaps that we need to address.  We will have to meet and go through the gaps.  Is it intended to publish the housing report separately?  Is it intended to have a dual report?  What will we decide to do?  What is the plan of action?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#B00300"><p>For the public record, we had a private meeting scheduled for yesterday to discuss documents produced by the secretariat as a result of the various meetings we have held in recent months.  One of these documents is on broadband and the metropolitan area networks and the other is on housing.  The timescale would have been quite tight with regard to discussing it yesterday and finalising it today - after our meeting with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - with a view to getting absolute clearance for publication next week.</p> <p>  I always took the view that we could not publish it within 48 hours of the local and European elections.  It was always going to be a tight squeeze to get it out eight days in advance of the elections, which is the middle of next week.  When the Government announced its intention to appoint a preferred bidder for the national broadband plan, and we can now see there is a highly charged political debate between the Government and the Opposition, I felt that for the Committee of Public Accounts to wade in to discuss and finalise a report on broadband might be perceived as the committee wading into a current political controversy.  I took the view that I do not want the committee to be accused of this.  We might not have had agreement in any event because different views are held by Government members and Opposition members.  I felt the most prudent thing to do was to hold it over.  We will certainly complete our work but I felt that in the politically charged debate during these days I did not want to involve the committee at this time.  We will certainly complete our work as soon as is practical.  As Chairman I felt it was better not to proceed.  The secretariat phoned around and two thirds of the committee agreed to postpone.  We will come back to it.</p> <p>  I also felt that a lot of the information that came out on Tuesday may have been relevant to incorporate in our report, which we would not have been able to sign off within 24 or 48 hours of the documentation becoming available.  I felt the prudent thing to do was to let the political side of it get out of the way and then the Committee of Public Accounts would do its work, as it always does, outside of the current political controversy.</p> <p>  I acknowledge publicly that Deputy Catherine Murphy was keen that the meeting should have proceeded as scheduled and I accept this.  The majority took the opposite view.  I accept that a significant part of the work prepared by the secretariat was on the metropolitan area networks but because it was connected to broadband in the same report I felt we could not go into it in this political climate.  The idea was, subject to agreement of the committee, that we would publish two reports simultaneously on the same day.</p></speech>

To publish a report next week we would have to have absolute sign-off today and that time is very tight.  As Chairman, I would not recommend publishing a report of the Committee of Public Accounts on housing and broadband in the week of the elections.  It was a tight and ambitious timescale.</p></speech>

I just felt it was prudent for the committee to maintain its political independence at this time and not wade into the debate.</p></speech>

It highlights the frustration because there is as much in the follow-up note that could spark a fresh debate as there was in the original debate.  In fact, there is even more than in the original documentation.  I appreciate the Chairman has said a report will be issued but there is as much that would feed into a fresh debate, in particular the graphs on the local property tax take feeding into housing.  It is a point that-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#B01200"><p>I am referring to a chart on the local property tax take of local authorities.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I have consistently made the point on the contribution towards other housing aspects.  My county is mentioned with regard to the failure of the mortgage to rent scheme.  Traveller accommodation is also mentioned.  There is a plethora of issues that could be examined.</p> <p>  At our meeting with the Secretary General, I raised points in respect of the local property tax take.  The Taoiseach has made a particular pledge that all property tax will be retained locally so that local authorities running a surplus will no longer have to contribute to the equalisation fund.  When I asked the Secretary General about this he had no idea how it would be achieved.</p><p>In that respect, we are talking about a serious amount of money.  It is a serious matter for the holder of the most prominent office in the country to say that and it is an issue that has not been addressed.  Political promises have since been made in local election manifestos that all councils under Fine Gael will cut local property tax.  When we examine the documents that have been brought forward, we see the strain certain Departments and councils are operating under and their failure to achieve what they should be achieving.  I am telling members of the committee that the documents raise even more questions.  One could have a fresh debate on them.  I look forward to using them in the compilation of the committee's report.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#C00300"><p>I will cover the two issues.  On the housing report, I do not think we should be too precious about the timing of elections because our report was not planned in that way.  Having said that, the timing is coincidental; we are not ready to publish it.  Will we have one more sitting to clear the report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#C00400"><p>We have had no discussion on it.  We have not even had a preliminary discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#C00500"><p>We need a timeline for when we will discuss it.  Most likely the discussion will take place after the local elections simply because we have not done any work on it.</p> <p>  On the broadband report, for a number of reasons it was correct not to proceed with the meeting yesterday.  Obviously, we have the letter from Mr. Robert Watt, that is, the memo that was published yesterday.  Given that we now have that letter, how do we intend to deal with it in the context of our broadband report which essentially is unfinished business?  I know that it will deal with a lot of other issues also.  We have a number of options, including that we proceed with our report as is and deal with the letter separately or we deal with it and the questions it raises as part of an ongoing process and perhaps incorporate our examination of Mr. Watt's concerns into the report.  I am looking for the guidance of the Chairman on the best way to proceed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#C00600"><p>My view is we had Mr. Watt before the committee a number of weeks ago to talk about capital projects.  We listed all of the projects, starting with the national children's hospital and on through ten major projects.  We had a discussion with Mr. Watt on the national broadband plan.  A member of the committee - perhaps it was the Deputy - asked him whether he thought it should go ahead.  He said it was more than his job was worth to answer that question in public.  Clearly, he has now indicated publicly.  As a result of the discussion we had on capital projects, we are writing to him for an unredacted version of all correspondence because we have previously discussed the particular matter.  I think the Committee of Public Accounts will today formally request an unredacted version.  When we receive it, we can decide on the next step to be taken.  Obviously, there is information he did not want to share on the day and there might now be an opportunity to have a full discussion on that information now that it has been published in the meantime.  That is what I suggest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#C00700"><p>Let me add one point to what the Chairman said because it is very rare for memos and reports of these types to be published.  It is good that there is robust engagement between that Department and others.  Then there is the response of the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which is a welcome development.  The Comptroller and Auditor General had, in fact, called for that type of reporting and such issues to be published in advance of major projects being completed because the Government decides based on all of the information it has received what is the best course of action.  This is the first time I have seen a letter that is so stark in its critique of a project which at that point had not been signed off on.  As this is new, how do we as a committee examine it?  It is a political decision that was made at Cabinet level, but at the same time fundamental questions were raised about value for money.  Value for money is exactly what we consider which normally involves a look-back.  Obviously, the Comptroller and Auditor General also engages in a look-back, but now that the issue is live and given that the letter was so stark and Mr. Watt was so clear in his concerns about the project, we need to look at it in a way we have not done before.  We have not seen such a robust letter from a Secretary General before.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#C00800"><p>I concur with Deputy Cullinane's views.  It is good to see this happen and nice to know that not everybody sings from the one hymn sheet.  It is also good to see one line Department challenging another.  That is useful and it is good that this information has been published.  The correspondence is very important and if there is further correspondence from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment that was not issued, we will want to see it as it will help to inform our consideration.</p> <p>  In case people ask why is the committee which normally looks back looking for a contract, the reason is that significant expenditure has been incurred on this project in recent years.  Therefore, the national broadband plan, the cost of tendering, the cost of consultants, the cost benefit analysis, the first draft of the plan and the revised draft when the European Union forced the Government to remove the 300,000 houses Eir stated it would cover have had implications in terms of further expenditure.  We are looking at the expenditure that has been incurred to date and want to see whether what has been done to date will result in the achievement of value for money.  Obviously, that will have implications for future expenditure.  We are absolutely acting within our remit in looking at all expenditure incurred in previous years lest anybody doubts why we are doing so.</p></speech>

That would have been wrong.  I think the Chairman is doing himself an injustice in that regard.  It would have been the wrong precedent to set.  The meeting was scheduled to take place yesterday and I agreed that it should be deferred for two reasons, the other being - it is also important - that we did not have enough information and that information was coming out.  I also felt we would not be able to complete the reports yesterday as they were unfinished.  There are many aspects involved, particularly the national broadband plan, at which we need to look.  The wrong message would have been sent.</p></speech>

Quite the contrary, it is the very day we should go ahead with it.  We need more information.  Broadband provision is an extremely serious matter.  In fairness to Deputy Catherine Murphy who asked for it to be placed on the agenda, we learned an enormous amount which is not reflected in the report which is a working document that needs to be changed.</p></speech>

Clearly, the meeting was not cancelled for political reasons but because of the volume of information that had come out in the previous 24 hours.  To enable us to produce a report, I thought we needed to assess the information that had only became available before we would sign off on it.  The Deputy is correct.  The meeting was not cancelled for political reasons-----</p></speech>

The aspects related to the metropolitan area networks, MANs, are very important because they give some insight into the cost of broadband provision.  The Analysys Mason report was very helpful from that point of view in terms of the lack of transparency.  There is a range of issues that are really important in informing how one should proceed in the future.  That involves a look-back.  In competing the report there will obviously be a debate.  There will be a debate over a considerable period of time on the contract.  On the Committee of Public Accounts being helpful, the meeting with the Secretary General should predate publication of the report.  We are likely to have something additional to be included in the report which will be both important and useful.</p><p>I think we might revisit the capital projects because the Secretary General does refer to the national children's hospital and there are some insights in the documentation that has been published that may well be helpful in terms of other advices that might have been given in that regard, or perhaps other contracts.</p></speech>

Roads are more predictable, and local authorities, which very often lead the development of roads, have fine-tuned the work on those.</p> <p>  Regarding the point that Deputy Cassells made about the local property tax, the more complicated one makes something, the more one gets away with it.  Local government funding is just so confusing.  The Government in the last general election talked about not introducing any new taxes.  No new income taxes were introduced, but there are things in this that really should be a cause of concern.  I do not think that when local property tax was introduced there was an expectation that it would fund housing or roads.  It was not sold as such.  The point has been made that it is a local property tax, is wholly retained in one particular area and is not a replacement for subvention for projects that comes from central Government.  We now have a Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  We were told that the purpose of that committee was that if the Opposition makes demands for things to be done, and Deputy Cassell's party has been criticised by Fine Gael quite heavily on this, the committee would have a responsibility to look at them to see if they are possible.  Why do we not ask the Committee on Budgetary Oversight to have a look at what the cost would be of making this a wholly local property tax, as opposed to a replacement for the grants that come from various Departments?  That would be a valuable and ongoing piece of work for that committee.  I know we are supposed to leave our politics outside the door when we come in here, but we in the Social Democrats did our own budget, as other parties do, in advance of the budget being announced.  We included in our budget an amount for the cost of precisely such a proposal.  However, it is only when one goes looking at this that one realises how costly it is, so we should do that.  We should ask the Committee on Budgetary Oversight to look specifically at the local property tax.  If it were to be made wholly local and were not to have an equalisation fund, what would that cost be?  We should look at the self-fund aspect, which is about councils funding roads and housing, which was not what the public expected of local property tax.  We could ask the committee to look at that aspect and ask them what the dynamic would be if it were taken out.</p></speech>

This topic frustrates me.  We should spend a month on it because we deal with it maybe once a year.  The Comptroller and Auditor General  in his report always refers to the myriad funding going into local government, but the matter comes in and out of here in half a day.  We should spend a whole month on it because it has the biggest impact on local people's lives bar none.  That self-funding aspect for housing and roads was a huge sleight of hand that the ordinary person would not have understood in the context of aspects of local government that were previously funded through a central fund from the Custom House.  Counties such as Meath, Kildare and Dublin were now having to fund this themselves out of people's local property tax, as opposed to the funding coming from a central fund.  That was a huge issue, and the impact is of course that there is less money to spend on some other aspect of local services.  People ask where their local property tax is going, but suddenly these moneys are being used to fund what had previously been funded through a central Government fund.  That is the sleight of hand.  These are the kinds of things that need to come out into the public domain in order that people can understand the significance of what is being done in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the impact it is having on local services.  It is a question of how one squares the circle of promising people there will be no increase in their property tax, that the Government is actually going to reduce it, and that counties such as Dublin and Meath can retain all their property tax but the Government will somehow find the money to fund services in Leitrim and Longford as well.  It is voodoo mathematics.</p></speech>

We are happy to note that and put it on the record.  When we get a report back from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding our periodic report, we will reconfirm the matter at that stage and discuss it again.  I am delighted to see every line we write is scrutinised so closely.  I am impressed.  It is good.  We will come back to this as part of our assessment of the response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  There are three items related to our inquiries regarding the ongoing review of matters in Waterford Institute of Technology.  No. 2125B, from Mr. William Beausang of the Department of Education and Skills, gives an update requested by the committee on the next steps regarding the independent review of the spin-out and sale of companies from telecommunications software systems group at Waterford IT, which was not completed for legal reasons relating to the remit of the Higher Education Authority.  The Department is prepared to examine issues by the contributors to the HEA report if contributors give their permission to forward their information to the Department.  In parallel, the Department is continuing to examine matters in the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry in Waterford IT and has raised a number of questions about WIT's governing body.  Mr. Beausang advises that the Department will keep the committee updated when there are further developments.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2140B - as I said, there are three items related to this topic - is from Ms Stephanie Goode of the Department of Education and Skills, confirming that the Department has received responses mentioned in the last item from the governing body of Waterford Institute of Technology to the questions posed by the Department.  Ms Goode advises that the responses are currently under active consideration by officials in the Department.  It is agreed that we will note and publish this.</p> <p>  Also related to this matter is No. 2136B from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, regarding the authority's draft report on WIT regarding the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry.  The HEA previously advised the committee that it was unable to complete the review as it did not have the legal powers to do so.  Separately, the HEA did not agree to release the draft report to the Right to Know group following an FOI request.  Mr. O'Toole advises that this decision was partially overturned by the Information Commissioner on appeal.  That is good.  Somebody was doing their job.  The Information Commissioner determined that chapters 1 to 4 of the draft report should be released.  Mr. O'Toole enclosed a copy of this document for the information of the committee.  He does draw our attention to possible legal difficulties if the Right to Know group or others, such as this committee, publish this item.</p><p>I propose that we publish Mr. O'Toole's letter but that we do not publish the related document at this time.  We might get agreement to that.  There is a lot there.</p></speech>

I welcome that Mr. Beausang's letter responds to the concerns in our letter.  We ended up in a situation where we had the draft report, which was redacted with all the conclusions left out.  Essentially, all we got was the context, the terms of reference and so on.  We did not get any of the conclusions or recommendations that would have formed part of that report.  Mr. Beausang's letter indicates that the Department may follow through with some form of examination of this issue themselves.  Mr. Beausang sets out the powers that the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister have.  My reading of what Mr. Beausang has said is that the Department has not concluded yet and that it has not settled on what the course of action will be, but that it will make some recommendation to the Minister, which may be to appoint under the Act a special investigator to investigate the claims.</p> <p>  There is a bit of a worry, however, in the reference going back to the whistleblowers and those people who came forward and made protected disclosures, which is fair enough.  The Department indicates that the advice is to go through the normal procedures in Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, to make protected disclosures.  I believe that the horse has bolted pretty much on that.  I have no difficulty with this being set out as an option, but the people involved have already made protected disclosures to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and we have to protect the integrity of the process.  There would be a concern if people came forward, made protected disclosures to a State body and then were told to go back to the institute.  This, however, is set out as an option.  The correspondence states also that the individuals can resubmit their disclosures to the Department, which would in turn inform whether or not the Department advises the Minister to appoint a special investigator.  It seems that an awful lot of responsibility is being put back onto the whistleblowers and onto those people who made disclosures.  I assume these are all busy people and are concerned that they were left hanging.  The committee will be aware that some of them have been in contact with me.  They may decide that they will not follow through on this.  We do not know.  It is a little bit unsettling that the correspondence seems to be putting a lot of onus on what the whistleblowers and those who made disclosures should do rather than on the Department following through.  I suggest that this committee recommends to the Department that it proceeds with appointing an investigator.  We wanted a report.  The issue of concern for us was that the HEA did a report that was outside the scope of its powers.  That is acknowledged.  The Attorney General has acknowledged this.  The Department, however, has set out that it has the power under the Act.  None of this has ever examined the details of the private company and what it did.  It was at all times the activities of the institute and the interactions between the institute and the private company.  This is what Mr. McCloone had looked at, what the Comptroller and Auditor General had looked at and what this committee looked at in our hearings on the matter.  I would suggest that we strongly recommend that the Department does this.  I am aware the Department is awaiting responses from WIT but that is in response to-----</p></speech>

In Dr. Love's view, Mr. McCloone had established facts but the problem was the HEA could not publish the report because it was outside its scope and powers.  The facts have not changed and some mechanism is needed to ensure those facts are put on the public record.  At this point, appointing an investigator is probably the only way to do that.</p></speech>

We all say that whistleblowers are valuable and important, which I completely accept.  They have to see, however, that there is follow through and that it does not fall back on them.  We cannot be in a situation where they do something and then ask "What was the point?".  I believe the same is probably felt in Limerick.  I understand it is a separate issue but there is the whole area of the HEA and its powers, to which we have drawn attention.  Was the Department of Education and Skills to come back to the committee on that aspect or have I a flawed memory of that?</p></speech>

On Deputy Cullinane's suggestion, I would say that we have so much going on here even if we go through the whole process the only possible good outcome at the end is that the Department or the Minister appoints an inspector, so why not do it now?  We can go around in circles.  They have come to the conclusion that the HEA did not have the authority to commission the report.  As the Deputy said, the people who made the disclosures are swinging in the wind, and at some stage somebody hopes that either this will go away or that the Minister will appoint somebody to investigate.  Will the committee recommend this to the Department?</p></speech>

This benefits everybody.  It will benefit the research institutes, the governing body, the president of the institute and all those people who came forward.  I stress again that 50 people engaged in that report but different opinions were expressed as part of that engagement.  There were different views on what was happening within the institute so for everybody's benefit, it would be good to get the facts out there in order that this matter is not left hanging.  I would strongly recommend that we push the Department on this appointment.</p></speech>

The HEA commissioned a report into the Waterford Institute of Technology.  The report was completed but there was an issue because at the end of the day it transpired that the HEA may not have had the legal authority to commission that particular investigation.  The authority to carry out such an investigation is only vested in the Minister and the Department.  In the meantime, all those who contributed to the report and who had given information, which is out there, are swinging in the wind because they have no recourse as a result of everything they said.  They are still employed in the organisation.  The Department has confirmed that the only people who absolutely have the power to commission the investigation are the Minister and the Department.  Can we agree that the committee should write to the Department at this point asking it to move to appoint an investigator under the relevant section of the legislation?  We can have the technical matter clarified around the relevant section under which the inspector can be appointed.  Is it an inspector or investigator?</p></speech>

Agreed.  I remind members that earlier we had said that the committee would not publish that report, which was received, in case it prejudices anything or in case we attach parliamentary privilege to a particular document.  That attached correspondence will not be published.</p> <p>  No. 2128B from Mr. Martin O'Brien, the chief executive of the Louth Meath Education and Training Board, ETB, provides an update on the invoice redirection fraud, which we had been monitoring.  Mr. O'Brien advises that the ETB&rsquo;s insurers, Irish Public Bodies, are covering the loss in full and that no loss is therefore incurred by the ETB.  I put it to the committee that ultimately the ETB would receive its funding from the local authorities.  All the funds paid out by the ETBs in such cases come from premiums paid to Irish Public Bodies, which is fully funded by the Irish taxpayer.  It is coming out through that bank account rather than the Louth Meath ETB.  I wanted to make the point that Irish Public Bodies is not a private insurance company coughing up.  It is a mutual company.  Mr. O'Brien has asked for the committee's patience until the matter is brought to a conclusion.  We will note and publish this correspondence in the meantime.</p> <p>  No. 2129B from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, provides follow-up information requested in relation to the metropolitan area networks and the national broadband plan.  The committee has discussed this and will incorporate all this information into our report as soon as possible when we come back to dealing with our report on broadband, which also specifically deals with the metropolitan area networks.</p><p>Is it agreed that we will note and publish this correspondence?  Agreed.</p><p> No. 2130B is correspondence from the director-general of RT&Eacute;, Ms Dee Forbes, providing an update regarding the review of the 157 contracts highlighted as at high or medium risk of having attributes akin to employment.  This was a recommendation in the Eversheds Sutherland report.  Ms Forbes expects the review to be completed in the second half of this year and advises that RT&Eacute; has developed a revised policy guideline regarding the engagement of contractors.  The director-general gives an undertaking to keep the committee updated on the matter.  Is it agreed to note and publish the correspondence?</p></speech>

The Eversheds Sutherland report states that there may be issues of bogus self-employment and that RT&Eacute; must engage with the individuals involved.  It is only last week that the process of meeting some of those staff members began, which is frustrating for the people involved.  There are issues still to be resolved in this matter.  We had several Secretaries General discuss those issues with us at the committee.  As I recall, it was the Secretary General at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment who acknowledged that the practice of bogus self-employment is illegal.  There are also taxation issues that have not been addressed.  The facts surrounding this issue must be established in a public way.  RT&Eacute; management is meeting the staff and making arrangements to put them on the appropriate contracts.  However, if it is the case that RT&Eacute; was intentionally putting people on contracts in such a way as to engage in the process of bogus self-employment, that is very serious for the organisation.</p> <p>  Given that we commenced this process, we must follow through on it.  I propose that we go back to RT&Eacute; management to establish whether or not it accepts there were people on bogus self-employment contracts and, second, whether there are taxation issues arising from that and, if so, whether RT&Eacute; has been in contact with Revenue or intends to make such contact.  I would like an assurance that there will be full disclosure following all the meetings with the individuals concerned as to whether or not such practices were happening in RT&Eacute; and to what extent.  It is an ongoing issue in several sectors and a growing problem.  If illegal practice did take place, we must respond to that and any taxation issues must be dealt with.  None of that is established in the letter.</p></speech>

She has indicated that the original timeline of the end of June for completion of the review will not be met until the second half of the year.  I agree that the issues Deputy Cullinane has raised should be incorporated into the review.  There is no point in doing a review without dealing with those issues.  That is all we can suggest.</p></speech>

If that was the case, it was an illegal practice and, second, there are taxation and Revenue issues.  We should be alerting RT&Eacute; to its responsibilities, as outlined by the Secretary General at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, that there may be both legal and taxation issues.  We need to know whether the director-general is aware of them and what she is doing to address them.</p></speech>

As indicated in the diagram, which can be now brought on screen, almost two thirds of the expenditure was related to payment of salaries, wages and allowances, which totalled &euro;1.076 billion in 2017.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na spent &euro;327 million on pension and gratuity payments to retired garda&iacute;.</p> <p>  Apart from standard administration costs, expenditure was incurred on operational inputs, including transport, communications and other operational equipment, and building, maintenance and servicing of stations and other buildings.  Unlike other large Votes, the account does not analyse spending in terms of output programmes such as traffic policing, fraud investigation or other specialist functions.</p> <p>  At the end of 2017, approximately 16,200 whole-time equivalent staff were employed, of which just under 14,000 were garda&iacute; or trainees, and 2,200 were civilian employees with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p> The Vote for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is one of the few Votes that routinely receives a Supplementary Estimate towards the end of the year.  A Supplementary Estimate of a little over &euro;44 million was voted for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2017.  At the end of the year, the amount remaining unspent was &euro;14.2 million.  Of this, &euro;8.9 million in unspent capital funding was carried over to 2018, with the remaining &euro;5.3 million liable for surrender.</p><p> The statement of the Accounting Officer on internal financial control discloses non-competitive procurement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of &euro;28.5 million worth of goods and services in 2017, included a significant level of procurement that was not compliant with public procurement rules.  This is a recurrent issue in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The statement on internal financial control also discloses significant financial and other risks faced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as the steps taken to address those risks.</p><p> Chapter 7 examined the systems in place to manage overtime spending in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In 2017, overtime payments totalled &euro;132 million or 12% of the overall Garda pay bill.  This level of spending was up to three times the level of spending on overtime in other police forces and three and a half times the overtime cost of &euro;38 million incurred by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2014.  In addition, actual expenditure exceeded the Estimate provision for overtime in each of the five years to 2017.  Excess spending on overtime was the main reason for the Supplementary Estimate in 2017.</p><p> Our review found that the management practices in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to control the overtime budget were ineffective.  We concluded that the data recording and collation systems in use were deficient.  While they record the basic information needed to authorise and support the correctness of the overtime payments, they failed to provide the basis for the analysis required to effectively deploy staff resources, monitor use and identify potential economies and efficiencies.  We also found that, while some measures had been introduced to curb overtime costs in the first half of 2018, there was no detailed plan for how the overtime bill could be substantially reduced and sustained.  When the report was being finalised, the Accounting Officer stated in response to this finding that several initiatives were currently being piloted that had the potential to achieve better control of overtime use.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee in this regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Drew Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#J00300"><p>I take my statutory function of Accounting Officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seriously.  I am strongly focused on ensuring that the public money invested in us is spent efficiently, effectively and appropriately.  As an organisation with a &euro;1.7 billion annual budget, it is vital that we collectively demonstrate that we are providing value for money.  For me, that means maximising our policing impact for the benefit of the public within the budget given to us by Government.  It is also critical that we spend public money in line with accounting and governance best practice.</p> <p>  I am strongly of the view that our budget is our budget.  Since I became Commissioner in September of last year I have continually stressed to managers at all levels of the organisation the need for us to stay within our budget.  This can best be seen in the reduction in discretionary and administrative overtime spend in last three months of 2018, a move which achieved substantial savings for the Exchequer.  The savings achieved by these measures have carried forward into 2019 as the actual spend for the first quarter of &euro;21.7 million is some &euro;6 million less than the corresponding quarter in 2018.  While we are largely on target for overtime spend, it requires constant monitoring and vigilance to ensure there is no slippage.  I met senior managers last week to stress this point to them again.  Even yesterday, I discussed budget matters with the Association of Garda Superintendents and Inspectors at length.  While these controls have had an impact on the delivery of policing, overtime is still available, especially for specific policing and security operations around organised crime and violent dissident republicans.</p> <p>  The introduction of mandatory 15 minute parading time is a significant proportion of the Garda overtime budget and is a fixed cost that I have no influence over at the moment.  For example, in 2019 approximately &euro;22 million of our overtime budget of &euro;95 million will be spent on the 15 minute parading time.  This effectively means that our real operational budget is only &euro;73 million.  There is also overtime associated with Garda members securing and attending courts, securing prisoners and escorting people from the country.  Again, these are regarded as non-discretionary activities.</p> <p>  In any event, for the proportion under our control we must ensure we stay within budget.  This means making hard choices and decisions.  For the 2017 accounts, and specifically the significant overspend on overtime in that year, there are several factors that contributed to this, such as the aforementioned mandatory 15 minute parading time as well as the major 24-7 policing resources required to protect lives and communities as a result of the outbreak of the vicious and ongoing gangland feuds.</p> <p>  I fully accept the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the effect that the 2017 overspend on overtime is not sustainable and demonstrated the need for stronger controls and governance as well as the requirement for modem systems to monitor same.  In addition to the controls we have already put in place we will address these issues through a number of additional measures.  The introduction of a roster and duty management system, which is being piloted in a Dublin division and will start rolling out across the organisation later this year, will improve our ability to plan, control and manage the deployment of personnel and consequently the expenditure on overtime.  This should result in savings in overtime through more effective and efficient resource allocation.  The full roll-out of this programme will not occur until the end of 2020.  Our new divisional policing model, which is currently being piloted in four divisions, includes a greater investment in Garda staff with financial expertise who can provide local management with better information and data on their overtime and other expenditure.  Our workforce plan will advance workforce modernisation and see us deploy our personnel where they are needed most, again leading to operational efficiencies.</p> <p>  Information and communications technology initiatives such as our investigation management system, which has started to roll-out, and our mobility project, which this year will enable approximately 2,000 garda&iacute; to access Garda systems remotely, will reduce the time garda&iacute; have to spend on paperwork and focus their times on policing activity.  The mobility project, in particular, can allow network connection to systems and, therefore, decrease the time spend in stations.  We have also committed in our 2019 policing plan to establishing a framework to provide for multi-annual budgeting and delegated sanctions.  Again, this will make it easier for local management to plan resource deployment based on the budgets available to them.</p> <p>  We have been provided with a large amount of taxpayers' money.  All of us in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have a duty to ensure this is spent wisely for the benefit of the public.  We are a public service and our spending should be focused on the public good in keeping people safe.</p></speech>

You made a timely reappearance.  I welcome all the witnesses.</p> <p>  I will start of by focusing on overtime and then will put some questions at the end with regard to the appropriation side of things.</p> <p>  There seems to have been a serious spike in overtime in 2017 by comparison with 2014.  Obviously, that was the year there was a pay deal for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was understandable.  However, the 2014 figure increased by three times in three years.  I understand 100% the position on the fixed costs of the Garda in respect of parading.  Will the Commissioner explain what that is?  Many people do not understand why that is necessary for every garda.  There are other fixed costs, which we understand the need for as well.  We often deal with accounts from different organisations, but to have a trebling in the space of three years in highly unusual.</p><p>Is there something specific to 2017 regarding the management of the agreed pay deal?  There was controversy at the time, references to blue flu and so forth.  Is there something specific that caused this?</p></speech>

In some ways, that is a fixed cost.  It will cost us around &euro;22 million this year.  As the number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na grows, that cost will continue to increase if the agreement on the 15 minutes stays in place.  That was a considerable cost in that year.  In addition, a rent allowance was built into salary in that year and also became pensionable.  That was added to the hourly rate so actual overtime became more expensive, in and of itself.  A one-time allowance became pay and that increased the hourly rate.  Those two factors contributed and also, as I said in my opening remarks, a vicious drugs feud which required an extraordinary response from the organisation was ongoing that year .  I will now ask Mr. Twomey to outline some of the operational impacts of that during the year in question.</p></speech>

At that particular time, the unit was based in each of the Garda regions outside of the DMR but, in response to the feud, we had to temporarily transfer people up from the country and into the city while we engaged in a process of recruiting, training and establishing a unit in the DMR.  That has since been established and there is now a permanent armed support unit in the DMR.  The feud was an emerging issue at that time and we took the decision to respond immediately.  That meant redeploying resources into the DMR on a temporary basis and this led to increased operational demand.  In addition, we had only begun the process of backfilling our national units and there was a shortage of staff in particular areas.  We had to supplement those staff because they were the ones who were actually investigating these serious crimes.  We also put additional resources into our drugs and organised crime bureau in the form of a special crime task force.  This also resulted in the need to temporarily transfer people from other areas.  They were the main operational issues that contributed to the spike in that year.</p></speech>

We all remember what was happening in the context of the drug-related feud at the time.  There was a request made to the Department of Justice and Equality for an additional &euro;44.2 million.  There was a great deal going on at that time and serious issues had arisen.  There is not one member of this committee who does not have friends or know people who are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the main, they are great, hardworking people and there were serious concerns around pay and conditions at that time.  Those issues were dealt with and that is not the point I am making.  We had an issue that was building from 2014 to 2017 and the overtime bill trebled in 2017.  In fairness, the Garda Commissioner has made comments on overtime in the past six months and has referred to the need to manage the budget.  The committee obviously respects that but the process by which we manage operational areas that are demand-led is important.  There are issues arising in Drogheda at the moment and Brexit has the potential to give rise to increases in demand.  This committee looks at expenditure retrospectively but we also look at processes.  How do we ensure that there will not be elasticity <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Department, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na submitting repeated requests for additional funding based on demand requirements?  Can we actually do that?  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na cannot predict what is going to happen next and neither can I.  How do we ensure that there are processes in place to ensure that additional expenditure is justifiable?  Overtime is necessary but there must be processes in place to prove that.</p><p>The information pack provided to us today shows that one garda earned &euro;76,000  in overtime.  Obviously, that is extraordinary and we understand that.  Once we know that the processes are in place to allow for elasticity, with the Department seeking supplementary budgets and so on, that is the key issue.  To see a trebling in three years is alarming although I respect what Mr. Twomey said by way of explanation.  There are issues arising in Drogheda at the moment but how do we ensure that there are processes in place to justify additional spending?</p></speech>

We are a growing organisation.  The budget is growing, as is the size of the organisation.  In overall numbers, our previous high point was in 2009.  When one adds Garda staff to the number of members of the force, we are now in excess of that high point.  We are as large as we have ever been and more expansion is planned.  It is for me to direct the priorities in terms of how we spend our money.  A lot of the overtime budget seems to get caught up in practices over which we have no discretion and that takes money away from the operational drive that I want from the overtime.  The 15-minute briefing time payment drains money from the overtime budget and effectively leaves us with between &euro;72 million and &euro;73 million for overtime.  That is considerably less flexibility than we had in 2017 in respect of budgets.</p> <p>  A lot of the documentation compares us with other jurisdictions but with respect, in other jurisdictions the police services no longer take on some of the duties which still fall very squarely on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and take up our overtime budget.  I refer to things like garda&iacute; escorting prisoners to and from courts, a practice which has been largely eradicated in other jurisdictions.  We are facing enormous pressures in terms of serious criminality and are having to supplement our policing effort to prevent serious crime.  At the moment, we obviously have a very difficult issue in terms of ongoing, vicious drug feuds.  In that context, it is up to me and members of my senior team to review how we are spending our money and determine whether it could be better spent.  We need to decide if things could be done differently or in a way which would not actually cost as much or consume as much overtime.  That is not just about things that we think we could divest ourselves of responsibility for but also the manner in which we take on other operations and adopting a different profile in respect of those.  There is a hierarchy of priorities in terms of how we spend our money.  We have to focus on serious criminality, particularly where lives are in danger and there is serious risk of harm.</p> <p>  The deputy Garda commissioner is engaged in a project at the moment involving a deep analysis of where our overtime budget is going.  In some divisions-----</p></speech>

I refer to last September because that is when I arrived.  July and August were good months in terms of the expenditure and bringing it under control.  We have managed on our rosters from September onwards to hit &euro;6.5 million to &euro;6.7 million, which gives us an outturn of approximately &euro;90 million.  That is our target.

In effect, members are detailed on it, and it is used when they come on and off duty.  It records their overtime and allowances, and it should manage their pay.  It will take quite a bit of paper out of the system and give us a daily view on where the expenditure is at any one time.  It will also indicate where money is being spent.  It will provide a good deal more information than we have at this moment.</p></speech>

That comes jumping out of this analysis.  We would highly recommend them.  Just dropping the hammer on a budget in a system that is so demand led seems to be a real issue.</p> <p>  There are a couple of other related points.  Having looked through this, I believe no public representative could fail to justify overtime that is necessary to protect people.  It is demand led.  We cannot sit here and say otherwise.  On the other side of the fence, we would say, "Lads, why are ye not doing something about all this?"  This is about the process of accountability.  I refer to the management information system Mr. Harris mentioned.  Divestment, civilianisation of certain components, and IT also jump out very much.  There seems to be a great deficiency in IT.  This is a message to go back to the Department.  We have seen this previously.  Capital investment in IT will result in multiple efficiencies and savings down the road and result in greater outcomes.  Take, for instance, the normal Garda sergeant or inspector affected by this.  At the end of a long day, he or she has to go back to a station in many cases to input data or do paperwork.  This is crazy in 2019.  I am trying to help the organisation here.  We all know garda&iacute;.  A garda doing a long shift, including community activities, might be late for training the lads because he or she has to go back to the station to do this, that and the other.  Surely in a couple of years, we will have to have a system whereby there will be handheld devices through which information can be dropped into the system.  They would have to be secure.</p> <p>  I come from an IT background.  Is there a plan?  First, the garda&iacute; have lives to live.  Second, bearing in mind the demand-led aspect in relation to what we just spoke about and the fact that hours change, there has to be some degree of certainty.  Circumstances are not being helped by the way garda&iacute; must do their duties at the end or beginning of a day or the way the handover between sergeants is carried out.  Is there a plan in place in this regard?  The need for a plan is glaringly obvious.</p></speech>

This year, 2,000 handheld devices or smartphones will be issued.  They will allow fast retrieval of information from our systems.  This will develop further in terms of being able to input information to resolve calls on the PULSE systems.  We want to get to a point where members are allowed to stay on the ground.  In this regard, we must consider our Garda information service.  We want a member of Garda staff to be able to take details from a member who phones in and do inputting as well.</p></speech>

Garda&iacute;, particularly those engaged in uniformed, high-visibility duties, should all have connectivity across the network.  That will be secure connectivity into the systems.  They will have the ability to ring in on an official phone and provide information.  In effect, we need the service centres to be able to take those calls.  It will keep garda&iacute; out on the ground as opposed to requiring them to come back to the station to fill out forms.  This is a laborious process.</p> <p>  I look to other initiatives we have.  We have the investigation management system.  The roll-out in this regard has started.  It will also take until the end of 2020.  In the next two years, the garda&iacute; on the ground will see good investment to make their lives easier and work more efficient in terms of connectivity and their ability to input data once instead of filling out several forms, etc.</p></speech>

When it is dealt with, I will move on to a couple of questions on appropriation.  The questions jump around a little.</p><p>Garda sergeants and inspectors are covered.  What was the position <i>pro rata </i>in 2017, in particular?  At higher ranks, there were serious scheduled workloads because of the year that was in it.  <i>Pro rata</i>, how was this dealt with as regards remuneration for the additional workload for the individuals concerned?

It was a very simple question.  To refresh, multi-annual budgets, IT and civilianisation are critical to the issues we just spoke about.</p> <p>  Let me deal with a few other issues.  In the appropriation accounts, there are capital commitments issues concerning Galway and Kevin Street.  There seems to be a pattern as regards what happened in respect of both.  Could that be explained?  What has been learned?  Could the Commissioner state whether there are learnings from this regarding other stations the Garda might wish to open in the future?  The nature of policing is such that it will go a bit half-circular again as regards the need for community policing.  Are there any learnings from those two specific projects?  Mr. Nugent will probably answer that question.</p></speech>

It is hard to walk away from that.  I would always say that we would have an engagement with OPW about this because it has a lot of that expertise in the delivery of such big projects.</p> <p>  There is probably another part for us around the maintenance and smaller works within the estate as opposed to those big capital rebuild-type projects.

Concentrating in effect just on probationer garda&iacute; coming out of Templemore does have an operational impact because they need to be mentored.  They need a lot of supervision and support in their first six months, then for the next two years and in subsequent years as well.  It takes time.  I felt we were reaching a point of saturation and so easing back to 600 this year, which is still a considerable number, but concentrating on the displacement of experienced garda&iacute; from tasks that Garda staff can take on, was the priority for this year.  In effect it was also required to meet the Government targets for the make-up of the organisation.</p></speech>

I wish to emphasise that they have to be solutions that will work for the community.  Social contracts have been made with the people there regarding facilities.  Given the kinds of facilities in the Garda College, there needs to be goodwill towards the community.  There needs to be some give and take with where the training college is.

We have deliberately not gone into that in order to resolve the other issues, to be respectful exactly as the Deputy has said.  I hear what he is saying on engagement with the community.  We wanted to deal with the other issues first and at that point in time we will have a respectful peace, making sure that the interests of the State are protected while, at the same time, making sure that social contract with Templemore is not completely ignored.</p></speech>

It was very hard not to keep there.</p> <p>  This is my final question.  When I was Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government a number of years ago, I carried out a pilot programme to provide funding for CCTV infrastructure in a number of locations.</p><p>It took a long time for that to be done.  I am a strong supporter of such measures, particularly in the case of high-powered vehicles travelling on motorways.  The media highlighted the need for such infrastructure in Littleton, County Tipperary, which was experiencing particular difficulties due to its location.  CCTV cameras were also installed in Birdhill and Burgess.  There have always been issues in respect of data management.  The public does not understand why it takes so long.  I encourage the Commissioner to work with local authorities.  There should be some give and take regarding data management because what it would give to the Garda and the peace of mind it would give to communities is worth vastly more than the time it has taken to resolve the matter.  I am not apportioning blame, there are probably issues on both sides.  We need to ensure that there is a process in place, that we stick to it and that it is used throughout the country.</p></speech>

We would like there to be more CCTV in some very difficult areas.  We look forward to making submissions regarding legislation to enable further use of static CCTV - particularly that which allows for automatic number plate recognition - and using it to prevent and detect crime.  There is a lot of other technology that can be brought to bear.  Average speed cameras that record a vehicle's speed over a distance rather than at one point would be an effective response in the context of road safety, particularly on major roads - other than motorways - that are blighted by serious road traffic collisions.</p></speech>

There is a significant amount of which to be proud in the context of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Many members are currently canvassing on doorsteps.  I have seen at first hand the significant work being done in community policing in order to gain the trust of communities and work with them, especially in my town of Mullingar.  All members agree that we need more bodies on the ground.  It is amazing to see the great work that is being done.  It shows the spirit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Last week, I encountered a very sick child on my travels.  A community officer, Garda Blake, was calling to see him on his way home from his shift because the boy is fascinated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That brings home the significant work being done in fostering communities and community spirit.  Community garda&iacute; cannot be supported enough in the good work they do.  I wish the Commissioner well in his role and I wish all his team continued success.</p> <p>  On the number of drivers who have been disqualified on foot of court orders or through the Courts Service compared with the number of licences that have been surrendered, does the Commissioner have confidence in how the process is working?  Is it operating as prescribed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Drew Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#N00500"><p>My understanding is that it is not working as we would wish.  The majority of disqualified drivers are retaining their licences and that is not good.  It is a road safety issue.  In effect, people are evading the justice meted out to them.  We need systems to deal with this issue.  One such system is the active mobility project to which I referred.  If a driver produces his or her licence to a garda who has this device and the garda takes a picture of it, the device will immediately tell the garda whether the driver is allowed on the road or is disqualified.  Part of the solution is the application of modern technology and the transmission of information onto our PULSE system in order to ensure that it is up to date such that members on the ground can have access to accurate information and be able to follow through on enforcement.</p></speech>

That is alarming.  The response to a parliamentary question I tabled indicates that only 6% of disqualified drivers surrendered their licences over the eight-year period from 2011.  The rate was 7% in 2012 and 9% in 2013.  During the eight-year period in question, only 11% of 83,000 disqualified drivers surrendered their licences, which implies that the remainder are still driving on our roads.  Some 7% of fatal accidents are caused by disqualified drivers and, over the period, a number of fatalities have occurred.  What is the process under which a person who commits a crime and goes to court or is otherwise disqualified from driving is allowed to retain his or her licence?</p></speech>

Several prosecutions were taken in this regard and certain difficulties and challenges arose.  Work has been done in the past couple of years to streamline and improve the process.  We are hopeful and confident that we will see improvements in this area.  The most important aspect from our perspective is that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who encounter these people at the side of the road have access to the relevant information at that time in order to enable them to take the appropriate action.  The Commissioner has outlined how that issue will be addressed.</p></speech>

Do our guests agree that the situation has reached crisis point?  If 89% of disqualified drivers are still driving and carrying their licences, that is a crisis for the administration of justice.</p></speech>

This matter needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  There are two processes to deal with it.  The first is ensuring that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the side of the road have access to the appropriate information at that time.  In all of these issues, there are processes that take time to implement.  We outlined earlier how that matter is being addressed through the issuing of 2,000 mobile phones this year.</p></speech>

We previously reported to the committee that we took several prosecutions in respect of that issue.  As part of that process, we identified some of the areas that have since been addressed in terms of process and by the provision of an offence code by the Director of Public Prosecutions to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  All of those issues have been addressed.  The process of a licence being surrendered to the licensing authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na then being notified, or it being brought to court and surrendered there, is very complicated.</p></speech>

The number has hovered between 6% and 19%.  It seems to have decreased again because the figure for 2018 was 13%.  Even if we allow for an appeals process whereby someone wins an appeal and is taken off the disqualified list, the figures are still very high.  They are drastic in the context of what they say about the administration of justice through our Road Traffic Acts and how they are enforced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda must be hugely concerned.</p></speech>

Our assistant commissioner for roads policing, Mr. David Sheahan, is putting together specific action points on this.  I ask that we be permitted to write to the committee to explain the position further.  Part of it is about public information and another part relates to further enforcement.  We mentioned mobile devices, smartphones and their scanning ability, and this year we are concentrating them on roads policing.  Road policing members who are most likely to encounter individuals breaking the road traffic laws will be those with the appropriate equipment.  We are aiming at having 2,000 by the end of the year.  This means that dozens of them are going out every week.  This will make a difference in terms of enforcement.  Mr. Sheahan has other thoughts about what we should do, particularly in the context of how we might present these matters in court.  I ask that we be permitted to come back with more detail.  We regard this as an area of concern and people are flouting and abusing the criminal process.</p></speech>

There is the main Garda tax number and entity that is the Sportsfield Company has its own tax number.  The main issue in the context of tax compliance related to the operation of the restaurant and associated facilities within the college and not by Sportsfield.  The main Garda tax number applied in this regard.  As stated, we are very close, I hope, to finalising the issue.

I accept that there are not many companies that supply certain services the Garda procures.  However, there were 128 contracts in play in 2017.  There seems to be a significant increase in the number of contracts and they were worth  &euro;28,478,271.</p></speech>

This will take out half of the spend.  The major areas of difficulty we continue to have are in the provision of towing services, where there have been legal challenges in the past which have delayed us putting in place procurement although we still have a requirement to deliver services, and medical services where, in parts of the country, there are GPs who do not want to enter any contractual arrangement with us.  Unfortunately, we will continue with reasonably large numbers of contracts.  Our job is to try to reduce the monetary value of these contracts to the greatest extent possible.  As stated, I believe the IT issues will be resolved this year so I do not see it as being an issue in 2019.  This will take &euro;11 million or &euro;12 million from the figure referenced by the Deputy.</p></speech>

We work a five-unit, five-shift system that allows for overlaps.  Part of this is so briefing and debriefing can take place during a normal tour of duty and there is no requirement for overtime.  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland requires us to look at rosters and at some of the allowance and pay issues.  Once this area of work is opened up we can look at what we have in terms of these residual issues.  The roster itself is pretty inflexible and costs money.  I require a roster that is operationally effective and gives us greater numbers.  At times, it might create demand but it should also have some flexibility, within reasonable parameters, for management to direct members.</p></speech>

The &euro;22 million drain on our overtime is not sustainable and we want to move quickly on it.  We also want to move quickly on having a further look at the rosters that apply in the organisation and address them.  This will address some of our overtime issues.  I can ask for a roster that delivers operationally against the demands we have from the public for our services.</p></speech>

A few years ago, I compiled information because I wanted to get an overview of the spread of the force because I felt my area was not doing particularly well.  The replies to many parliamentary questions showed that areas that had grown in population are at the low end of the ratio of police to population, with Meath being the worst since the previous census of population and Kildare is next.  The areas we tend to see are Wexford, Laois, Offaly and areas with substantial population growth over a period of time where the resources do not keep pace.  Is there any evidence the overtime budget in these areas is higher than it is in areas with a better ratio of garda&iacute; to population?</p></speech>

Sometimes population growth does not mean that demand will increase in proportion with it.  Populations can be quite settled and law abiding.  It does not necessarily flow that we need to provide resources.  </p><p> The Deputy raised a point about overtime.  Much of it is concentrated in critical areas.  Inevitably, it has meant a greater concentration in the city, but we have had to readdress it because of the feuds in counties Meath and Louth.</p></speech>

If the ratio of population to garda&iacute; was the same around the country as it is in, say, County Meath and County Kildare, there could be 4,500 fewer.  I say that with tongue in cheek, but that is the magnitude of the disparity.  It is a very low ratio.  The last Commissioner acknowledged that that was the case and gave an assurance that it would be rectified following the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore for recruitment and that there would be a higher proportion of garda&iacute; allocated to areas with that profile.  There must be a balance struck with experience, as I appreciate.</p></speech>

If there is a dependence on overtime to fill a need, it is a more expensive and reactive solution.

Until now, the distribution has been pretty even.  We built up numbers in the northern region, the Border region, more than in other areas.  In the future we will see a concentration on the northern region, plus the Dublin metropolitan region, because numbers in these regions have fallen behind.  At the same time, ours is an expanding organisation; therefore, there should be more garda&iacute; everywhere.</p> <p>  We are going through process of the civilianisation and modernisation of our workforce which will see the displacement of a further 500 garda&iacute;.  The actual increase in the size of the operational footprint this year is in the order of 800 members, which is significant.  We  should see the impact of this everywhere.  We are more than happy to provide Garda staff in County Meath and other areas and displace Garda members from roles within stations into operational duties, where possible.</p> <p>  The importance of visibility has been made clear to me on a number of occasions because people want to see garda&iacute;.  As we build our new divisional policing model, an important and central aspect of it will be community policing, of which a local connection and visibility are important parts.</p></speech>

The aim is to grow the force to 15,000 members by 2021.  There are retirements, as well as the intake, to take into account.  It is easy to see the intake, but from the outside it is not as easy to evaluate the level of retirements.  Is the 15,000 figure achievable?  Is the overtime bill likely to go down if the numbers come up?</p></speech>

Logic suggests the overtime bill should come down, but practice has shown that members create overtime because they detect offences and go to court.  We have briefing time built in, something about which we have talked.  Inevitably, operational members create overtime.  It is the frictional overtime needed to operate as a business.  I need to look at where else we can cut overtime, where people can be redeployed and how we can change our operational profile.  That is a task for me in how I prioritise expenditure.</p> <p>  I have just been provided with figures for Kildare.  There has been an increase of 63 members between 2010 and 2019.</p></speech>

I have the figures for nearly every year.  It is much appreciated that we end up with additional garda&iacute;.  I do not want to be overly parochial, but Kildare is significantly behind other areas with similar populations.  County Meath lags even further behind and the numbers are moving backwards as the population is growing.  It is noticed and appreciated when additional garda&iacute; are provided because we appreciate how stretched the organisation is.</p> <p>  I will move on to something in the appropriation account because our time is limited.  Can the Commissioner take us through how the voluntary disclosure to the Revenue Commissions occurred and the extent of it?</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Harris and wish him well in his role.  Unfortunately, we have had a high turnover of Garda Commissioners and Ministers for Justice and Equality, and much of that was down to cultural and organisational issues we had in an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as I am sure Mr. Harris is aware.  We are hoping the changes that were promised are being delivered, and some of my questions will be in that vein.</p> <p>  I want to start by picking up on the last point Mr. Harris raised in relation to ICT and the investment over the last five years.  Mr. Harris said he wants a far more efficient process and that there may be an over-reliance on paperwork at times.  Broadband is a big topical issue, as I am sure Mr. Harris is aware, and as late as 2017, 111 out of the 563 operational Garda stations did not have access to broadband.  Has that improved, and do the witnesses have an up-to-date figure on how many, at this point in time, do not have access to broadband?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.256" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joseph Nugent" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#Q00700"><p>I believe the figure is something in the order of 50 at this point.  We are talking here primarily about stations that have very short opening hours, so first getting broadband into those stations, and second leaving equipment of a secure nature resident in them has been a challenge.  We have worked with our colleagues in the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer to bring out different solutions and we have put something new in place which will allow us to move faster in addressing those issues.  The Commissioner talked about the mobility project, which for a garda is about having a phone with the power of a very fast PC and being able to dock that in a station using a keyboard, mouse, and screen as if he or she were working on a PC.  It has proved very successful in the pilot we have up and running and we expect to have another 20 or so of those dealt with very shortly.</p></speech>

That would be warmly welcomed by this committee because it is our core function, but I imagine he would also put the same emphasis on his responsibility in relation to transparency, good governance and accountability.  In that vein, GSOC raised concerns in relation to its authority yesterday or the day before.  I am assuming that Mr. Harris understands why GSOC was established in the first instance and what its role is.  It is independent.  It said it was unable to ensure there was proper oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In fact, it said it was impossible for a number of reasons.  One reason was that it finds out about issues from the media, and not directly from the appropriate channels, and the other was that the supposed lines of communication and reporting within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself was problematic.  Given that Mr. Harris takes his responsibility seriously, I assume he is concerned that that is GSOC's impression and view of its ability to do its job independently.  Can Mr. Harris respond to that?</p></speech>

Collectively, we need to pool our resources to make sure we are rooting out wrongdoing, inappropriate behaviour, criminality.  There is a way of working through this, and I do not think in any shape or form we are at opposite ends of the argument about this.</p></speech>

Mr. Harris might have a different perspective, but GSOC is the independent body and it took a lot for it to come out and say in the very clear, stark terms it did that proper oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is impossible because of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself.  I am assuming that would be concerning to Mr. Harris and if he does not agree with it, that he would want to establish why it has that view of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

As Commissioner, I too have a heavy responsibility for the conduct and behaviour of the organisation, up to and including criminality that members may engage in.  I have a duty and responsibility to root that out as well, and I want to work with the oversight and investigations body, which is GSOC, in doing that.  There is no argument on my part.  I know that we have informed GSOC of major investigations that we are engaged in, and it has written to us about streamlining other processes and we can do that in the form of a regular case conference about serious matters that are progressing.  All these things are achievable within the present legislative framework, because it is just a matter of sharing information.</p></speech>

Yesterday, Mr. Harris made reference to the setting up of an anti-corruption unit, which on the face of it looks like the Garda investigating the Garda.  Did Mr. Harris have any engagement with GSOC in relation to the establishment of that unit?  Has he formally met with GSOC and sought its views, and if so, what were its views in relation to the powers and responsibilities that unit would have?</p><p>As we have seen from the Morris tribunal report and other stories of cultural difficulties within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, independent oversight is the most valuable tool we have.  Is the anti-corruption unit a case of garda&iacute; investigating garda&iacute;?</p></speech>

I have a responsibility.  I am proactively asking the organisation what is going on, or if people have issues with individuals with whom they work.  It involves drug testing where there is a suspicion surrounding individuals and in the case of persons in high risk positions such as those who carry firearms or are in charge of high speed pursuit vehicles.  These are common practices in other police services and we want to introduce them as a way of ensuring there is integrity within the organisation.

Consulting GSOC was something the Garda should have done before establishing the unit.  The serious issues GSOC has raised in recent days add to my belief.</p> <p>  I spoke to the Chairman about a particular case in advance of the meeting.  I do not want to name an individual, even though it is a case that was in the public domain and before the courts before being dropped.  A young woman, a civilian who worked in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, was arrested in connection with an alleged fraud related to sick leave.

The investigation was well founded and reported to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which examined the matter and found the case fit for prosecution.  It went through an investigative process and an external examination by the prosecution authority which found the facts to be sufficient to state there was a criminal case to be answered.</p></speech>

Michael Clifford covered the story in the the <i>Irish Examiner</i>and wrote that disturbing questions arose in the case.  The individual in question had made a complaint of bullying within Store Street Garda station and, within three weeks of making the complaint, was arrested because of her sick leave.  Notwithstanding what Mr. Harris said about how the case was investigated, the charges were dropped in court.  As the case fell apart, it raises questions.  A lot of people would ask how an individual could be arrested before going through normal HR processes.  It is all the more peculiar that the individual in question had made a complaint of bullying.  The garda&iacute; who arrested her were known to her, which is not in line with international practice.  Is the Commissioner of a mind to personally examine the elements of the case that are in the public domain?</p></speech>

My three years in the D&aacute;il have been bookended by two reports.  It began with the O'Higgins report, which I read in detail, and the Charleton report.  There have been serious issues with accountability.  These accounts are being considered within this background.  There are significant financial risks.</p> <p>  My first question relates to the audit process.  We are aware that the internal process prior to this was not really allowed to do its functions, certainly in respect of Templemore and issues emerged.  As the Accounting Officer, can Mr. Harris tell the committee that the internal audit function and the audit committee is functioning, is meeting regularly and that everything is in order?</p></speech>

At this point we do not know it that has happened but Mr. Harris will come back to the committee on that.</p> <p>  On page 21 there is reference to Garda masts, which is an income receipt that has jumped significantly.  Presumably it is an income for the Garda, but what is it? It has gone from &euro;523,000 to &euro;1.5 million.  Someone might come back to me with that clarification and I will continue on if the committee does not mind.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the Galway station, in which I would have a particular interest, and the Kevin Street Garda station, where we have a very new and welcome Garda station.  I will not go in a parochial direction on this but there were significant changes and significant costs.  As with the national children's hospital and lots of other projects, why was this not foreseen?  Page 15 informs us that amendments were made to the original design that required structural works and in addition, there were other design changes to meet requirements of the Garda and so on.  Could somebody come back with a note on this? Was there a competitive procurement process in the beginning?  What happened after that and what was the cost increase?  I am thinking of the children's hospital situation where a price was given and then changed.  It appears that some issues can arise in a project but it depends on what the changes are, why they were not foreseen and why elements were not included in the original design.  A passing comment on this is that I have no idea why the Galway station came out so close to the road.  I could not let this pass without making a comment on it.  There is absolutely no room for a bus route.  It is a terrible pinch point.  That is just a practical matter.</p> <p>  The witnesses will come back to the committee with two notes on my points.</p></speech>

I will follow up with the Office of Public Works about the other matter.</p> <p>  Going back to reputation and the lovely word "learnings" - a word I detest because I do not know what it means - I want to discuss fixed penalty charges and the breath tests.  It is in the Garda report as a significant risk to reputation and a significant risk financially.  Where are we with that?  The notes tell us that so many cases were taken.  On page 5 there is the reference to fixed charge notices.  There was an examination of the summonses and 146,865 cases were found to have committed offences and this was incorrect.  Before I move on to the update on appeals, will the witnesses remind us again what was incorrect about the summonses?</p></speech>

Some of them did not make it to court, in some cases the summons was not served and some cases were still pending and before the courts at that time.  There was a variety of responses accounting for those.  What we know is that 14,000 were concluded in the courts.

I think 2,200 have been done to date.  We have issued letters to all those people and a number of them have been returned unserved because people have moved from those addresses.

What we have found is that, in many cases where we have written to people, we have got no response.  We then have to go to the next step, which is a personal call to these people.  Where others come back unserved, we have another process.  It is quite time-consuming.  We are talking about large numbers.  I mentioned that 4,843 letters were returned by An Post as unserved.  They were all then sent out to local district officers to begin that individual process.  In other cases, there was a considerable number of people who did not respond at all to the letter they got as to whether they wanted to appeal or not.  Separate to that again, we have brought the 2,200 through the courts and we have another 2,000 scheduled to go through the courts.</p></speech>

However, there has to be an end to it and there has to be an update.  What is it costing in terms of manpower and womanpower and in terms of the cost of the legal eagles?  Let us have an update on that.</p> <p>  On the breath tests and the hugely significant discrepancy, which I will not go back over as that is a matter of record, where are we in that regard?  What improvements have been made?  Has the Garda reconciled its data with the data recorded on the machines?</p></speech>

We have made the necessary changes to ensure that does not happen again.  We have far tighter record control around our systems and how we record breath tests.  This is all part of ongoing examination of all records to improve the accuracy of data.

Is that a policy for the future or is it something at which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is looking?  What kind of costs would be involved?  We see reports about it in the newspapers.  Body cameras are used by other police forces, particularly those in England.  The Garda Representative Association would be very anxious that this would come on stream for many reasons, including those relating to safety, proof and witnesses.

We need legislation to do that.  That legislation is being worked through and is one of the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  When we look to purchase equipment, one of the issues for us that we will be issuing smartphones, which have a video facility.  Rather than buy another camera, we may use the existing mobile phones we have issued.  Regarding the costs, we must decide what way we are going to go with these but we have some time in that the legislation must be passed as well.  If we are doing an out-run of 10,000-odd smartphones on which people can record video, that may be an alternative rather than buying a bespoke camera.  I want that examined.  Up to-----</p></speech>

This can be not only some form of confrontation but, more importantly, it can also be a first report of domestic abuse and a serious sexual assault.  In addition, in contentious situations, it can provide GSOC with an independent eyewitness to the whole event.  It has been very useful in vindicating police officers in other jurisdictions regarding the manner in which they have behaved.  I know the Garda Representative Association is attracted to it for that reason.  It has been spoken about formally by neighbouring associations.  It does ease the pressure on individual members whenever they are complained about because they know that a record of the event exists.  Beyond that, there are very strong protection reasons.  It can make a real difference in policing sensitive areas.</p></speech>

I am speaking in particular about Kilkenny because two motorways go through Kilkenny and Carlow and there are many robberies that I would call fly-by-night robberies.  They come from Dublin or Limerick.  It is obvious they have some knowledge.  They come off the motorways and it takes 20 to 30 minutes.  They have done it in Urlingford and north Kilkenny several times.  They go on to the motorway and are back before the garda&iacute; even know they are back in Dublin or some big city where they can hide.  I have asked the Minister for Justice and Equality several times about CCTV.  What is the Commissioner's opinion on using CCTV on junctions off motorways?  Will it be provided in the future?</p></speech>

There is a need to have the correct software and for an office that can analyse the data.  It is not always possible to know the plate number.  All that might be known is a description of the vehicle, such as the car being a black Ford Focus.  The system needs to be able to look for a black Ford Focus moving on the motorway at the time.</p></speech>

Such technology would, however, make a significant contribution to crime prevention and detection.  There is a pattern of crime gangs obtaining vehicles and not moving them for some months.  They reappear some time later.  The ANPR system can be programmed to identify those patterns also; therefore, it has significant benefits.  It has to be targeted at where we think the most benefits will be reaped in crime prevention and detection.</p></speech>

It allows for oversight and is a framework a garda can use in conducting his or her investigation against specific crime types.  It will also allow us more information on who is offending and where the offences are happening.  That will be good in our analytical work.  We can also see and inspect problems such as car insurance fraud and set-up accidents.  The Garda investigation management system will be a national system once it is fully rolled out.  It will identify people who are very unlucky in their driving and have 20 accidents a year.  It will also identify cars which are very unlucky and involved in a dozen accidents a year.

The budget constraints stem from my responsibility, as Accounting Office, to stay within the figure of &euro;1.76 billion.  That is the way that I cut up the pie.

We have all read about the complaints from GSOC in the stories which have appeared in the newspapers this week.  What is the relationship like?  Is it good?  Is there good interaction?  The ombudsman is supposed to look at what is happening in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but the reports in the newspapers did not sound good.  They made for very bad reading.</p></speech>

For my part, and that of my senior team, we very much want to work hand-in-hand with GSOC.  None of us wants to see any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engaged in any form of wrongdoing.  We want to see public complaints properly investigated and brought to conclusion as expeditiously as possible.  We are determined to ensure that those who engage in criminality, inappropriate associations, the use of drugs and so on are proactively investigated and combatted.

There is wrongdoing in every force and walk of life that needs to be weeded out.

Many of the investigations that are taken forward are successful and they are brought to a proper conclusion in terms of bringing matters before the courts.  That work continues.   I know that GSOC has been informed of that work and work that is ongoing as well.</p></speech>

My first question follows on from Deputy Aylward's remarks in regard to deployment.  I read much of the Commissioner's commentary regarding his plans to redeploy individuals from desk duties to front-line positions.  What percentage of garda&iacute; have been and are yet to be redeployed?</p></speech>

The upper limit which has been set for me is 4,000.  When we reach a strength of 15,000 garda, 4,000 staff and 2,000 garda reserves, we will need to take stock and recalibrate because there may be more that can be done.  My responsibility in terms of budget is to maximise the policing impact such that when we reach a strength of 15,000 garda plus 4,000 staff that proportion may have to change further.</p></speech>

On appropriations-in-aid, Garda College receipts, the issues of the Sportsfield, shops, boat clubs and so on were the subject of previous discussions but there are a few outstanding issues on which I would like clarification.  There were European funds in a bank account, which I understand were for training purposes.  If I am not mistaken, these funds may not have been appropriately accounted for at the time of our review approximately two years ago.  I welcome that the recommendations following on from that review were taken on board and are being worked through.  Is the Commissioner, as Accounting Officer, satisfied that the aforementioned funds have been accounted for appropriately?  I appreciate the Commissioner does not represent OPW but to the best of his knowledge, what is the reason for the delay in the transfer of lands from Sportsfield to OPW?</p> <p>  In regard to the internal audit, I am not an accountant but during the six years I was a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and during my time as a member of this committee, I have observed a lot of indecision and uncertainty around this area.  I get the distinct impression that the resources provided at that time to internal audit by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was not sufficient to meet the task at hand, primarily because it was such a mountain to climb.</p><p>In his role as the new Garda Commissioner since last year, is Mr. Harris satisfied that internal audit and the oversight function within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is sufficiently robust to ensure the issues highlighted to this committee and others over recent years will not reoccur?  Perhaps we will start with the two questions I asked of Mr. Nugent regarding the European funds.</p></speech>

I have taken a particular interest in internal audit.  It is essential to me in carrying out my responsibilities as Accounting Officer.  I would like a greater emphasis on thematic work.  We are working through what that might look like.  We pick an area of policing business and look at the risks in that area and how they are being addressed.  We are not just dealing with financial matters, but with operational risks.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a policing body and policing is a risk business.  Identify those risks and dealing with them is a very important part of risk management and internal audit.  The two things are on the same continuum.  There is more to be done and more I would like to see done but, as I have said, I have made sure that the committee knows it has my full support.

It is intended to roll out the new system to every other Garda division.  It serves two primary functions and relates to the effective deployment of our resources.  It allows us have full line of sight on our existing resources at any one time but is also a very important planning tool.  There are many events coming up and there are many peaks and troughs in demand.  This system gives us the ability to plan more efficiently and effectively for those.</p></speech>

I was going to ask whether existing vehicles would be retrofitted but the Commissioner has answered that question in referencing the reduction in cost relating to new vehicles coming in.  To touch upon the CCTV element of what Deputy Aylward referred to in respect of motorways and general streetscapes, would ANPR technology which is not vehicle-mounted be cost-effective or beneficial to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Can it be retrofitted to existing traffic cameras across the road network?  Does the Commissioner believe it would be beneficial to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in carrying out its duties?</p></speech>

It requires a camera to be connected to the appropriate software.  If we look at the amount of gangland violence that involves people driving backwards and forwards when perpetrating serious crime, it is clear that the technology would be useful.  It would also be significant with regard to the considerable effort we put into the prevention and detection of burglary through Operation Thor.  It can be of great assistance in any circumstances in which criminals are using vehicles.  It does not always have to involve a permanent fixture.  Temporary cameras can be put in place from which information can be drawn via the 4G network.  There are many things we can do but the legal position is a little unclear.  We must be very careful that any ANPR camera does not inadvertently take images of drivers or passengers.</p></speech>

Diversification of the force is a very important part of the Commissioner's new role.  I do not refer to gender alone, but also to race and background.  My constituency is in Dublin metropolitan region north for Garda purposes.  A few years back 105 nations were represented in my local authority area.  Is that something about which the Commissioner thinks in the recruitment process?  Is diversity in this area something he actively seeks to achieve?</p></speech>

That has been illustrated in part by the uniform changes we have introduced in respect of hijab and the turban.</p><p>That is illustrative of how welcoming we want to be to the diversification of the organisation.  It is important to us because our society is becoming increasingly diverse.  It is critical for us to reflect that diversity in order to continue to enjoy the level of community support and confidence we enjoy at present.  This can be done in a number of ways.  This relates to sworn officers and all other Garda staff, including the members of the Garda Reserve.</p></speech>

Why did the Commissioner not transfer into a Garda vehicle?  Were there firearms on board the PSNI vehicle?  I presume this was a close protection vehicle and, therefore, it is likely that there were firearms on board.  Is that par for the course in the interaction we have with the PSNI?  I ask the Commissioner to clarify these matters for me.</p></speech>

Like other police services, we have ongoing responsibility for the protection of individuals who visit Ireland.  Sometimes that involves personnel being authorised to carry firearms within the State.  That has been reported on in recent weeks as well.  There is variety in my own movements and my own security.  That requires personnel from both organisations to cross the Border at times.  I would say that, habitually, it is more a case of personnel crossing into the North.</p></speech>

According to the second briefing note that was provided to the committee, it is proposed to allocate just &euro;11.5 million for 2019.  The 2018 provisional outturn was &euro;23.5 million, but the budget for this year is just &euro;11.5 million.  That is a significant decrease in the training and development budget.

I am not just talking about members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; I am also talking about teachers and nurses, etc.  Everybody who deals with the public, including Deputies and Senators, should have such training.  I know the HSE runs these courses free of charge.  There is not even an expense on it.  Obviously, there is an issue around how we train so many people.  I would appreciate it if we could get some figures.</p> <p>  The other area of interest to me is the drug units.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na probably deals with drugs in two separate ways.  First, it deals operationally with the major players in the drugs trade.  Second, many addicts come into contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, unfortunately, and they may have drugs on them for personal use.  Most drugs convictions fall into that category.  In recent years, there have been more and more fatalities from heroin overdoses.</p><p>I wonder if the rank and file who would be the type of people who deal with addicts daily have any training in the provision of Narcan or Naloxone, if they came across someone who had overdosed?</p></speech>

We would be reliant on the medical services.  While our people are trained in some basic first aid, they are not trained in anything more specific.  Some of our firearms units and national units would have some further enhanced training but as a general rule the principle is that when we come across a medical condition we engage the services of the HSE as they are the professionals in that particular area.  While we have some basic core understanding, we rely on the professionals.</p></speech>

Although I do not have figures for the numbers of people who may or may not have been saved, in my area in Cork there are pharmacies which provide the service.  They have trained pharmacists, particularly those who distribute the methadone programme.  Occasionally someone may take the methadone inside the pharmacy and then overdose outside the door and the pharmacists have that training.  At least members of the force who are on the beat would have some level of training in this.  The more people who are trained in it and the more people who can distribute Narcan benefits addicts if garda&iacute; come across an overdose.</p></speech>

Our people are always conscious of what the people they encounter face.  There is an important demarcation between the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing and that of the health services.  It is a balance that we must be very conscious of and careful about.  We can consider it further but there are professionals in this area and it is very specific.  We must be careful of extending the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into this area.</p></speech>

In some areas we have upwards of 25 people and in others we have 12.  We start off with a base unit of 12 people.  Depending on demand being greater than that, we have double that.  It depends on a case by case basis.

In community policing, is the number of community garda&iacute; increasing, decreasing or is it demand-led?  In areas such as my own they work really well.

We have provided increased resources in those specific areas.  As the organisation is growing, a core principle is that we have a community policing ethos.  In certain cases where the demand is such that we need people in that role specifically and full time, then that is provided.  However, in other areas where it is possible to provide a full range of services that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provide, that is done in a slightly different way.  Where people are deployed depends on the environment but the intention is that there will be community garda&iacute; throughout the entire country.  Community policing is a core ethos of the organisation.  The Deputy referred to working in partnership with people and having developed and built that relationship to provide the opportunity for our people to engage with local communities in a problem-solving type approach.  It is not just about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is about a partnership with other agencies and people.</p></speech>

Sometimes we kind of forget that.  I am sure that garda&iacute; face the same stresses and pressures as any other member of the public.  How big are mental health issues within the force?  Obviously, if a garda goes through a very traumatic experience, I am sure that there are counselling services in place to help deal with that but, in terms of general mental health, are counsellors provided if a member just wants to speak to somebody if they are feeling depressed?</p></speech>

Part of our work this year in delivering the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland will be to further examine our well-being strategy for all our employees, both Garda staff and members to ensure that it is a healthy place to work.  Additional resources will be made available to the chief medical officer in relation to the staff he has available to him.</p> <p>  We very much recognise the stresses and strains and the toll that can take on people both professionally and personally, and also on their families.  We want to be in a position to offer as much support as we can.  Prevention is better than cure when it comes to providing early support to individuals.  </p></speech>

To echo what the Commissioner and the Deputy said, the 24-7 counselling service is a confidential service provided by an outside party.

It is not a huge number.  Given the weekend that is in it and the Darkness into Light events that are taking place around the country, it is timely to tell members of the Garda that the service is available.  It provides opportunities to have counselling delivered directly to them without engagement with the organisation.  We encourage all our members and staff to use the service.</p></speech>

Obviously there are certain professions or vocations such as the Garda where people might be uneasy about speaking about these issues internally because, regardless of whether we like it, there is still a stigma attached to mental health and I am sure the stigma within the Garda is no different.</p></speech>

It is one of the questions I omitted but it is probably the most important in the context of the budget.  I am Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, which has oversight of Oberstown.  One of the main consumers of overtime is the transfer of children on remand or in detention to courts.  When they are in detention it involves An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and when they are on remand it involves Oberstown staff.  There has to be a better way of doing that.</p></speech>

I wished to highlight it in this forum because of a conversation I had in the past with Mr. Patrick Bergin, the director of Oberstown, in consultation with Inspector Twomey in Balbriggan.  Perhaps that can be examined because it is important.  If there is a better way of doing it we should investigate it and implement it.</p></speech>

Page 25 refers to compensation and legal costs.  During the year in question the compensation awards were &euro;9.8 million and the legal costs associated with that were almost two thirds of that figure at &euro;6 million.  There is a heading included that refers to civilian claims by members of the public arising from actions of garda&iacute; in the performance of their duties.  There are 196 cases.  The compensation award was &euro;1.8 million but the legal costs were &euro;2.66 million.  The committee encounters this all the time.  There is the State Claims Agency and the legal costs associated with compensation payments.  We like to keep the figure as low as possible but this is amazing.  Is there a reason that the legal costs are higher than the compensation?  Who is winning here?  The legal profession was the principal winner in that case.  If you do not have the specifics about that, you can send-----</p></speech>

I do not know but there might be a reason for it.  On the face of it, however, that is an isolated case that looks very bad.  Ultimately, there is over 60% on top of the compensation awards that goes on legal costs.  It is very high in comparison to other-----</p></speech>

It is consultancy but it is related to the delivery of product.  It reflected a slowdown in making other capital payments.  Within the flexibility provided to us, this was one area where we could make some provision and some payments.  For example, if there was a slowdown in building capital costs which were going to occur early in 2018, this was dealt with within the allocation that is available to us for savings.</p></speech>

The Garda is making a payment to an ICT company, probably one of the biggest companies in the world, that does not really need it.  How do we know that we got delivery of the &euro;6 million worth of product when it is prepaid?  The witnesses may say there was a schedule of payments but this committee is getting very concerned about prepayments and advance payments across the public service relating to ICT projects.</p><p>It is not because the companies need it for cashflow purposes.  It is probably historical.  There is no good reason for such a level.  We have seen previously in the committee that other State organisations have made pre-payments but the product was not delivered, the company went out of existence, and the pre-payment was gone.  There is a risk in making pre-payments.  I might ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment because he is nodding in agreement.</p></speech>

It is typically part of the pricing model for ICT services.  It is generally factored in and taken into account.  It should be reflected in a lower price overall, where the working capital and money are effectively provided in advance.</p></speech>

It is an issue that has cropped up in several meetings and it is not specific to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  The next issue might require legislative change, which might be the answer.  In one's local District Court, one will see 20 garda&iacute;.  Is it not possible for the station sergeant to give the evidence on behalf of all the station's garda&iacute;, instead of 20 garda&iacute; lining up?  On the topic of the District Court, I have stated in the committee on previous occasions that some of the best value for money in any section of any State organisation is the amount paid to inspectors who present cases in District Courts throughout the country.  The inspectors receive a small allowance for the extra work.  In the course of a day, there might be 50 or 100 cases, with ten solicitors coming and going, and one inspector is able to handle every case.  I say this as a tribute to them.  If that service had to be provided by the matching legal service of the defence, it would cost millions of euro.  It is a tremendously efficient system, which, I am sure, is good training for inspectors to understand the legal system.  Can anything be done to use the Garda's manpower in order that garda&iacute; do not have to sit in court?  I refer to speeding fines and offences, for example.</p></speech>

I wish only to clarify the issue.</p> <p>  People often find the following matter curious.  The Garda received an income of &euro;83,000, effectively as commission for collecting insurance premiums on behalf of insurance companies.  Is that car insurance or something else?  Why is the Garda collecting insurance premiums for insurance companies?  It appears in the accounts every year but I just do not understand why the Garda collects money for insurance companies.  What was the total sum collected, and what was the commission for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

The figure jumps out at me.  Perhaps somebody was charged with not paying insurance and handed the money to the Garda to pay over.  It appears in the accounts every year but it is unusual.  It is listed under income received by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda might revert to us with a note in that regard.</p> <p>  Does the Garda provide escorts for the movement of cash between banks?  There was a time when the Garda was paid a great deal of money, although perhaps it does not do it anymore.  Who carries out that task now?  Is it the Garda?</p></speech>

We have sourced an approach and, through bulk buying, will be able to reduce significantly the costs associated with the provision of those kennels.  Everyone will be pleased to hear we will be able to roll out additional kennels to dog handlers this year.  That is all in hand and being sorted.  With the assistance of the OPW and following some work we did ourselves, we have resolved the matter.</p></speech>

As this is my first appearance before the committee, I feel it is respectful to members to take a few moments to introduce myself.  Last September, I moved to Ireland from Manchester and I am privileged to have taken up the role as CEO of Ulster Bank.  I have worked in financial services for almost 39 years in a variety of roles, including in retail, corporate, operations and risk management.  In my previous post, at the Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, I was managing director of NatWest and RBS personal banking, where I was responsible for leading the team for the day-to-day banking needs of approximately 15 million customers throughout the UK.</p> <p>  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Paul Stanley, chief financial officer and deputy CEO, and Mr. Ciaran Coyle, managing director of personal banking.  In the invitation letter, the committee expressed an interest in Brexit preparedness and the accountability framework for the banking sector, which I will cover in my opening statement. </p> <p>  I begin by providing some insights into the progress we are making in Ulster Bank.  Our strategy is to continue to leverage our parent and to build a stronger, safe and sustainable bank, offering high-tech and high-touch solutions to provide effortless everyday banking services that our customers value, and to be there for them for what matters to them.  We believe that a blend of digital and physical banking is the winning combination because our customers tell us that is what they want and value.  To support our strategy, we continue to focus on innovation.  We have expanded our partnership with Dogpatch Labs, a leading co-working space for technology start-ups.  Some of our colleagues are developing their entrepreneurial talent and creativity to deliver innovative solutions for our customers.  We recently co-hosted a fifth annual Hackathon, a weekend which brought together members of the community, including the tech community, to design innovative banking solutions for customers. </p> <p>Underpinning, and fundamental to, our strategy is the continuation of transforming our culture to one where customers are consistently at the heart of everything we do, served and supported by professional colleagues. </p> <p>  Since Ulster Bank&rsquo;s previous appearance before the committee, we have made tangible progress on our priorities.  In respect of lending to support our customers and the economy, a core part of our strategy is to help our personal customers to buy a home and to save money by switching to lower rates.  This aligns with our investment to improve the service and offer market-leading fixed rates.  Last year, we saw a 13% increase in new mortgage lending to &euro;1.13 billion.  That momentum has continued into this year.  We also lent approximately &euro;1.4 billion to our business customers and, with a good start to 2019, we expect that figure to grow this year.  Our Lombard asset finance business saw volumes increase by more than 40%, or almost &euro;200 million of new lending.  We were conscious that 2018 was a particularly challenging year for the agrifood sector and introduced a weather fund to support customers in a year of unprecedented weather events.  We expanded our relationship with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland through its Brexit loan scheme and joined the BGF backers for businesses.  We also intend to participate in the new future growth loan scheme. </p> <p>  We continue to see more customers change the way they bank.  Today, seven out of ten active personal current account customers choose to bank using digital channels and in the first quarter of this year, we have seen a 31% increase in mobile payments and transfers compared with quarter 1 2018.  We are listening to what our customers want from us and innovating to make our customer experience effortlessly everyday and brilliant when it matters.</p><p>In the past year, we have introduced new applications and services such as: ClearSpend, which gives businesses better control of their expenses; Manage my Mortgage for our residential mortgage customers, enabling them to make changes to their mortgage online and from the comfort of their home; and Cora, our new artificial intelligence-driven digital banking assistant to help answer customer queries 24-7 every day of the year.  We have also been adding more features such as FaceID and paperless processes for our everyday banking products, making the digital experience simpler and more secure for customers.</p><p> As I mentioned, our strategy is both high-tech and high-touch.  We have invested in our physical presence, expanded our mortgage broker panel and increased the number of mobile mortgage managers across the country, offering flexible meeting times and locations, chosen by our customers.  We have five mobile banks, a community protection adviser and our team of community bankers.  We are continuously improving our branch network and 41 branches have seen investment.  We plan more this year.  New needs arise for our customers and last year we launched Friends Against Scams.  We are committed to playing our part in the fight against fraud so we trained colleagues across the bank.  We are educating customers on how to protect themselves against the horrific practices of scams which, when they happen, can impact consumers and our customers so badly.</p><p> Since our previous appearance before the committee, we have made progress on reducing our non-performing loans, NPLs, which stand at just over 10% of the total, but there is more to do.  Our regulators have set out capital requirements for NPLs and those requirements mean that over the coming years we will need to increase the capital we hold up to a point where we will have to hold enough capital for the full amount of the non-performing loan.  That capital is then tied up and we cannot use it to support loan growth which would contribute to the Irish economy.  To be clear, our priority is to work with our customers to put in place long-term sustainable arrangements so that as many customers as possible can remain in their home and paying off their mortgage.  We have invested in additional resources to ensure that every customer has every opportunity to engage with us to enter into a long-term solution.  We have found that when customers have worked with us, a solution can be found for four out of five, meaning they can remain in their homes.</p><p> We have also made significant progress on our customer remediation programmes to put right our wrongs of the past and learn from our mistakes.  We completed a thorough process to identify all impacted tracker mortgage customers and we do not anticipate any new or additional impacted upon groups of tracker customers to emerge at this point.  We have made redress and compensation payments to all tracker mortgage examination customers for whom we have contact details.  The thorough review identified other issues relating to errors on the accounts of business and mortgage customers that we will have resolved by the middle of this year and end of this year respectively.  Let me take the opportunity now, as this is my first time in front of the committee, to sincerely apologise for our past mistakes and the impact they had on our customers.</p><p> Turning to Brexit, the subject is top of mind for many customers, although many of our business customers tell us also that shortages of both skilled and unskilled labour is a bigger issue.  Supporting our customers is a top priority and we continue to do this, first, by communicating what we can do to support them to understand the impacts of Brexit and, second, drawing to their attention all the Government and agency supports available, which are excellent.  We see different types of businesses that can adapt and which are adapting.  Many are well-prepared and have sound contingency plans.  There are particular challenges for some customers who export to the UK or who use the UK as a land bridge to the European market.  Where additional resources and guarantees are required in respect of customs and tariffs, for example, we are ready to support our customers.</p><p> We continue to monitor the impact of the UK decision to leave the European Union on the bank and our customers and have been preparing for a number of scenarios, including a no-deal position, as part of our contingency planning as a stand-alone bank and as part of RBS.  There has been no material impact noted to date; however we are conscious of the potential for future impacts on the bank, our customers and our operations.  A bank-wide Brexit response programme has been mobilised to assess those impacts and to develop contingencies under a number of Brexit scenarios to ensure that we can continue to serve our customers well.  Regardless of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, our aim is to support customers with the same level of service and range of products as we do today and to help them address any related challenges.</p><p> The committee also asked me to address the topic of the accountability framework.  I welcome the introduction of the senior executive accountability regime and I know from my experience in the UK how such a regime can make a difference to promoting stronger accountability, ethics and culture in financial services.  Increased accountability will be better for our customers and for society as a whole and while a senior executive accountability regime alone will not transform culture within the banking industry, it will help.</p><p> I will finish on the topic of culture.  Much has been said about banking culture at this committee and at other fora in recent times.  We in Ulster Bank have learned many lessons.  We got things wrong and we are fixing mistakes from the past and learning from them.  We are absolutely committed to rebuilding trust with our customers and Irish society.  We recognise we have much to do and we are changing.  We are making different decisions today from those we may have made in the past.</p><p> In Ulster Bank we have defined our culture as "the way we do things" and it is consistently living our values to act in the best interests of our customers, colleagues and stakeholders.  Our four core values &ndash; serving customers, working together, doing the right thing and thinking for the long term &ndash; guide our priorities, activities and decision making.  We have strengthened our risk and control environment to reduce the possibility of errors occurring.  We are building a customer-focused culture where colleagues are encouraged to help customers be financially fitter and to speak up if and when see things that might look wrong or if they have any concerns.  Tone from the top is something I and my leadership team are conscious of every day.  This is one of the reasons I have personally committed to completing the Institute of Bankers professional diploma in leading cultural change and ethical behaviours in financial services and sitting on the Irish Banking Culture Board.</p><p> I am pleased to report we have made progress over the past 12 months across our customer, operational and financial metrics, along with the continued execution of our strategy to transform Ulster Bank.  We are happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I wish her well and every success, although I know she is well settled into her role at this stage.  I welcome her colleagues, Mr. Paul Stanley and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Coyle, and I thank the witnesses for the comprehensive responses to the questionnaire we received in advance of the meeting.  I also thank Ms Howard for her opening statement.</p> <p>  I will start with the matter of NPLs and the work that must be done to reduce non-performing loan ratios.  The opening statement indicates the current NPLs level is just over 10% and it is acknowledged in the replies in section 4 of the questionnaire that the regulators expect banks to reduce the level of NPLs towards the European average and have set out capital requirements that must be adhered to in respect of those loans.  Will Ms Howard outline her understanding as chief executive of where it must go in terms of the NPLs ratio, when it needs to do this and how it intends to get there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.674" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jane Howard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019050900002#D00300"><p>There is not a specific target set by the European Central Bank but it is clear that any bank with NPLs in excess of a 5% level is regarded as having a high number of NPLs.  The banks are expected to have a plan to reduce those towards the European average.  We have seen that European average reduce more recently to between 3% and 3.4%.  That is sound risk management for any bank.  Although we do not have a specific target, we absolutely understand our commitment to reduce our level of NPLs.</p> <p>  As the Deputy notes, we have made progress.  The last time representatives of the bank were before the committee, the level was approximately 17% and it is currently 10.3%.  It is important that I highlight our first priority, which is to help customers with a non-performing loan - a mortgage - to get into a long-term and sustainable solution.</p><p>Accordingly, we have always contacted customers who are in arrears.</p><p> We have also committed additional resources to ensure that we can contact all of our customers who are in a non-performing status so that they can engage with us and we can help as many of them as possible.  We have employed additional resources because the economy is stronger, unemployment is at a lower rate of just under 5%, many of our customers who are in a non-performing status have higher available incomes and house prices have increased significantly.  Against that background, we have found that when customers fully engage with us, which includes completing a standard financial statement, we can offer a long-term solution to four out of five customers that keeps them in their homes.  Sadly, we cannot find a long-term solution for one in five customers who engage with us that keeps them in their homes.  It is almost an impossible situation.  In such circumstances, we work with the customers on an individual basis and examine other options.  These might include mortgage-to-rent or a voluntary surrender.</p><p> Our priority is to help customers, but we need to reduce our number of NPLs.  While there is no target, there is an expectation that we reduce them.  We believe that is right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.676" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019050900002#E00200"><p>The bank's current rate in respect of NPLs is 10.3%.  We have heard from a number of other banks that they have attached particular significance to the end of this year.  Has that been communicated to Ulster Bank?  Is there a figure it needs to reach or is there pressure on it to reduce the number of its NPLs significantly by year end?  That would most likely only be achieved by way of a step change reduction through a portfolio sale.  Ulster Bank has already undertaken portfolio sales, but that type of sale is controversial.  While the Central Bank, the Department and bank CEOs always tell this committee that protections travel with the loan and the mortgage contract remains unchanged, we have also heard from the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, and the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, which have outlined a number of specific instances where they felt that customers were disadvantaged when their loans were sold on.  The most significant change is the change in attitude.  While Ulster Bank may make every endeavour to reach a restructuring arrangement with a borrower, the same may not hold true for the fund that purchases the loan because that fund takes a much shorter-term view regarding the loan's return.  Is there an onus on Ulster Bank to reduce its NPL rate further this year?  If so, are further loan portfolio sales on the table and actively under consideration?</p></speech>

We do not have a specific target, but there is an expectation that we will move towards 5%.  We are likely to set that ambition for next year rather than this year.  However, we indicated during our third quarter results last year that we would be expecting to conduct a further sale.  We still expect that, but our first priority is to help all of our customers to find a solution.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.679" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Stanley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019050900002#E00500"><p>I will address that question.  As Ms Howard stated, we took a provision in the third quarter of last year for an estimated size of loan sale, but we are going through a process of engaging with all customers who will engage with us to define what the perimeter of the loan sale will be.  It will principally comprise PDHs because most of our non-performing buy-to-lets are effectively gone at this stage.  The key for us is working with our customers on trying to find out whether, due to the points that Ms Howard has mentioned, there are long-term sustainable solutions for them.  If there are, they will not form part of the perimeter and we will have to adjust appropriately whatever provisions we have taken.</p></speech>

Almost a year ago - in June 2018 - Ulster Bank announced the lowest rate on the market, namely, a two-year fixed rate of 2.3%.  How has that gone for the bank?  Has the bank promoted it sufficiently?  It is a two-year offer, so it is not long term.  At the time, however, it was by some distance the lowest rate on the market.  I believe it still is the lowest even though others are coming closer to it.  I had hoped that it would start something of a price war in mortgages, although our guests might not have welcomed that.  Is Ulster Bank getting a return from it?  Is the bank winning new business on the back of that rate?</p></speech>

We offer a range of rates to all of our new and existing customers.  We have the lowest fixed rate on the market at 2.3%, which fits with our strategy.  We are finding that more than 80% of the new mortgages that we are writing today are on the fixed rate.  Customers tell us that they like the rate and that it gives them certainty of payment.  The latter is important to our customers.  We deliberately went out to compete because we wanted to grow our market share in mortgages.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.686" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019050900002#E01200"><p>Perhaps Mr. Coyle will also inform us of the bank's current market share of new business being written.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.687" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Coyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019050900002#E01300"><p>Yes.  The Deputy is right about the two-year fixed rate.  We also have the lowest four-year fixed rate in the marketplace.  To build on Ms Howard's point, we have seen good momentum in the business.  I will help the committee to understand what we have done.  For nearly a year, we have had an extensive marketing campaign across media - outdoors, radio, cinema, etc.  Judging by our marketing team and market analysis, this has had the exact level of impact that we wanted.  In recent months, we invested in and launched a new online portal to make it easier than ever for customers to switch to the new rate.  If an existing customer is on a variable or fixed rate, he or she can go online from the comfort of home and change to any of our new rates in a matter of minutes, 24 hours per day, when it would previously have taken a couple of weeks.</p> <p>  Regarding performance, when we last appeared before the committee, we mentioned that our natural stock in this market was approximately 14%.  We were slightly behind that figure then.  At the end of the first quarter of this year, though, we had a drawdown market share of over 16% and our approvals were slightly higher than that.  To build on Ms Howard's point, we are hearing from our customers that they like the clarity and certainty regarding what they pay.  Effectively, rates remain important to our customers.  We are making other changes beyond the rates to make the process of coming to us easier and faster.  It is a work in progress, but it is having an impact as well.</p></speech>

Many individuals, including first-time buyers, see an attraction.  I hold the view that they end up paying more in the long run because they are paying a higher interest rate, but it can be difficult for people to weigh up where their best long-term interests lie, and &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 upfront can be attractive if one is buying a home and needs to furnish it.  How does this play out in the market?  Cash-back packages are attractive to individuals on the one hand but the bank believes it is offering better long-term value.  How is it finding people's ability to weigh it up and balance what is in their best interest?</p></speech>

We help make contributions to people's legal fees, because these are practical costs that customers face.  We also help make contributions towards life assurance, which is also important to customers, and we make contributions towards their home insurance.  We see it as a combination of the low rate plus other elements we know matter to our customers.</p> <p>  With regard to the dynamic, it is very dependent on customers' circumstances.  The research we are doing backs up the fact that we are a fixed-rate-led mortgage provider.  That is our strategy and it has been for a period.  It is because feedback indicates that value for money and rates are still the most important things to people.  The certainty of a rate over a period and the transparency it brings are important.  Home buying occurs at a busy time in people&rsquo;s lives.  Therefore, the best approach is being very clear on the rate and the duration of payments.  It also involves giving people the best choices over two years, four years and seven years.  We have rates across that whole period.  So far, we can see the momentum this approach is creating in business.</p></speech>

I am sure Ms Howard is aware that Ulster Bank was pretty slow in getting up to speed and coming to grips with the tracker mortgage issue.  It took a long time to identify the relevant accounts and pay out in redress and compensation.  The message the bank is giving us in the questionnaire is that it is pretty much there, or very close to being there.  I have a question on the overall numbers.  The total paid to date for redress compensation and contributions towards advice is &euro;120 million, give or take.  The bank's overall provision is just under &euro;300 million.  Is the balance the operating cost of running the operation?  Have the witnesses factored in a potential enforcement fine from the Central Bank in respect of the enforcement investigation that is under way?</p></speech>

There have been some more payouts since then.  I have explained before that, out of &euro;297 million, there is roughly a 50:50 split between the costs of the examination from our side and the customer compensation and remediation.  One can take from this that there is still an element of around &euro;20 million or &euro;30 million odd still to paid out from 31 March.  That is a combination of some customers we have got to since that date and the 190 customers who, to date, we have been unable to contact.  We have highlighted that in the response also.</p></speech>

I assume the bank has a requirement to provide for the Central Bank fine.  The witnesses are very clear that, so far, the bank wrongly took &euro;95.54 million from its customers' accounts without their knowledge for many years.  It kept that money from them and has only recently given it back.  We all agree that the bank is going to be fined.  Is it not the case that it has to make provision?

Therefore, there is a mechanism in place.  The levels of compensation are higher than the standard levels of compensation we would normally have across other remediation areas.</p></speech>

I am not talking about the sum of money the bank allocated for independent advice as part of the tracker examination.</p><p>I am talking about people who hired expertise to force the bank to own up in the first instance, who have been involved in this for almost a decade and who have incurred significant costs trying to build a case to convince the bank that it had wrongly, illegally or whatever term we want to use taken their money and withheld it from them.</p></speech>

Why should it not be a matter of principle?  Let me take a section of a letter I have from one of the bank's customers.  It states that with the help of the committee and Padraic Kissane, the writer was reinstated on a tracker mortgage last summer after a battle of almost ten years and that it was life changing for his family.  He states he received redress and compensation and a cheque of a certain amount to cover both, and a sum was taken off his mortgage.  He also states he is working with Mr. Kissane on an appeal.  The letter also states the amount of compensation awarded to the individual dwarfs the amount he has had to spend over the past ten years in preparing a case for the ombudsman, working with various financial advisers and voluntary organisations to try to get the bank to own up to what its CEO, Ms Howard, has just apologised for to the Irish people.  The amount of money he had to spend will not be covered as a point of principle by the bank.  Mr. Stanley is telling me this customer must appeal, perhaps to the ombudsman or through the courts, for the bank to give him what he should never have had to spend in the first place because the reason he spent it was because the bank took his money.</p></speech>

There are many cases like this.  This should be a point of principle.

It should not take me, letters or the bank's customers to tell the bank it should be doing the decent and right thing but it is not doing it.</p></speech>

We have information that Cerberus and Cabot, which is the servicing agent employed by Cerberus, are taking a very strong approach to the bank's previous buy-to-let customers.  They are appointing fixed asset receivers and giving former customers 30 days to clear all of their arrears or they will appoint fixed asset receivers.  The bank has employed two fixed asset receivers.  Deputy Michael McGrath is right, and we are saying this over and over again, that it is not about the protections that travel with the customer and the mortgage, it is the attitude.  The bank has appointed two fixed asset receivers.  The vulture is taking a policy decision to tell customers to clear their arrears within 30 days or it will put in place fixed asset receivers.  Does the bank have anything to say on this?  It has hung out it customers high and dry.  It has fed them to these vultures.</p> <p>  The bank knows fine well these were non-performing loans.  That does not mean they were not being paid, it means the customers were not able to pay the full amount and that they were in arrears.  The idea of any bank telling people to clear their arrears within 30 days or it will take its property is absolute madness.  That is what Ulster Bank has done to almost 2,200 customers who have tenants.  When fixed asset receivers are appointed, those tenants will be evicted.  That is what is happening here.</p> <p>  I have a letter from Cabot to a mortgage holder that states Cabot has noted there are arrears owing on an account mortgage - in the number and amount of X - and to assist the person in clearing these the following payment options are available but the letter then just gives the IBAN and BIC details of the bank.  The letter then states that failure to contact the office on receipt of the letter and clear the arrears in full within 30 calendar days from the date of the letter will leave Cabot no other option but to appoint a receiver over the secured property.</p><p>I can read Ms Howard other letters where former customers of Ulster Bank with multiple properties are in positive equity and are trying to sell the loans, but Cabot is saying "No".  They are willing to sell the properties and pay off the full amount but Cabot is saying it does not care.  It is telling them to clear their arrears within 30 days or it will appoint a fixed asset receiver.</p><p> We are told this is now policy within the vulture funds to which Ulster Bank handed its customer accounts, yet the bank has washed its hands and said it has nothing to do with it any more.  N&aacute;ire - shame on it for what it has done.  We warned it that this was going to happen.  This is what vultures do.  Has Ulster Bank no regard for people who made the bank profitable during good times and who are finding it difficult to make full repayments?  They are looking for a bit of time or support but are definitely not looking for this type of attitude.  In fairness, it is an attitude that Ulster Bank would not show to its customers.</p><p> How many buy-to-let customers does the bank have?  Can Ms Howard imagine her bank writing to customers tomorrow morning to tell them to clear their arrears within 30 days or it will repossess their homes?  People would take their accounts from the bank overnight and they would say they are having nothing to do with that.  However, the bank outsources its dirty work to the vultures and it is about to do it again.  Shame on it.  That is why we need this committee to pass my legislation, which will put in place a statutory responsibility to do what Ulster Bank should do anyway, that is, live up to the standards of the Central Bank, which says it should ask for permission before it sells to a vulture.  I ask Ms Howard for a response on how Ulster Bank has treated its customers. </p></speech>

Let me give a little colour.  As I said earlier, we are absolutely committed to contacting our customers even more, up to 18 times over two months, to see if we can help them to get onto a sustainable solution or another option.  That is very important because we are exploring everything first.  We have contacted nearly 10,500 customers in recent months, 2,500 of whom are in the early stages.  Some 5,000 of those are engaging with us and are co-operating.  I am using the word "co-operating" because that is the CCMA definition.  Of those 5,000, some 4,000 were offered a long-term solution and 1,000 were looking at different options.  We then have nearly 3,000 customers who are not contacting us and not engaging with us.  That worries us because we believe, based on the 5,000, that if people contact and engage, we may be able to help them.</p></speech>

Is it not the case that Ulster Bank sold to these vultures accounts of people who were both paying and engaging with the bank but who could not meet their full repayments, and they are now in the grips of the vultures, which are telling them to pay up within 30 days or they are taking the house and will sell the property with vacant possession, leaving their tenants high and dry?  Is it not the case that they were both paying and engaging but, under Ms Howard's terms, the bank was not able to find a long-term solution so it decided to sell their accounts to the vultures?</p></speech>

I do not in any way think that these are people who are not interested in trying to help.  I think there might be fear of contacting the bank and there are all sorts of reasons.  That is why we are urging people to get in contact with us.  I have met people who are in arrears and people in NPL status.  There is a range of reasons they get into that situation.  At one extreme, there are incredibly sad situations or part crisis, and there may be illness and all sorts of reasons.  We genuinely want to try to help those people.  At the other extreme, when we have contacted people, we found that people have some money and they are able to get completely up-to-date with their arrears and get onto a sustainable solution.  We do not judge anybody at all.  It is all about trying to see what we can do to help them, and we do all of that before we do a sale.</p></speech>

Ms Howard knows the answer to this question because her bank could do it in the morning.  It would not do it because it would be absolutely appalling to do that, but vultures can do it because they do not give a damn.  They are here for a couple of years.  They are not interested in farming loans, student loans or deposits.  They are just interested in making as much money from the sale of the portfolio from Ulster Bank with the haircut it gave them.</p></speech>

Not only were they told to clear their arrears within 30 days or the property would be taken and their tenants left high and try, there was a data breach, which resulted in their names, contact information, financial details and outstanding balances being released.  Ulster Bank put them in this position because it sold them.  We told the bank that if it sold to vultures, they would not care.  They play fast and loose.  Ulster Bank has a responsibility to treat its customers in an appropriate manner.  It gives a write-down to the vulture funds but it will not apply that to its customers.</p></speech>

When it hears about the impact on a three or five year old the bank might consider its position of seeking vacant possession or at least asking the follow-up question of whether the tenants will have a home to go to when it evicts them from the premises so it can increase its profits for its shareholders.</p></speech>

It is much higher than that of the other Irish banks.  The level of capital, our core equity tier 1 ratio as it is referred to, is north of 27% at this point.  Our internal requirements would see the bank at 14% or 15% so, in effect, we hold double the capital we need.  That capital must earn a return or it should go back to the shareholder.  It costs us just physically having that capital sitting on our balance sheet because we must invest it in what are termed "high-quality liquid assets", which earn zero to negative returns.  There is a rationale in us paying back and getting to a more normalised level of capital within the bank, which will help its overall performance.</p></speech>

On the one hand, that money is being given to RBS and, on the other, the bank is trying to get vacant possessions and selling properties to vulture funds, which is causing a great deal of hardship.

I suppose that the whole issue is the moral aspect.  I am aware that the Government allows the banks to do this with deferred assets and so on but when we are in a situation with such homelessness - and considering Deputy Doherty's contribution on the vulture funds and people being given 30 days to pay up or get out - there is a moral obligation on the banks to look at things in the round, to treat Irish citizens a little bit better, and certainly not to contribute to the homeless crisis as it is.</p> <p>  I would like to get further clarification following on from Deputy Doherty's point because I am not clear on one part around people who needed help and assistance in trying to get back the very substantial amounts of money that was robbed from them.  Many people had their lives destroyed because of it.  Those people had to engage whatever supports or services they could, and not just legal services.  Will Ulster Bank Ireland allow for that within the compensation scheme?  I was not clear on that from the response.  What is the bank's policy on that?  </p></speech>

If customers feel that this has not been sufficient for compensation, aside from some exceptional circumstances we would certainly look at that for Deputy Doherty.  It is a reasonably straightforward process and we would help with that process in bringing those additional asks or requirements to the two levels of the appeals panels.  It may not just be about fees.  It could be lots of other issues also.</p></speech>

I will now turn to the bank's charges.  AIB charges too much for the use of ATMs while the Bank of Ireland charges 20 cent per debit card transaction.  Ulster Bank, however, combines the worst of both worlds by charging 35 cent for an ATM withdrawal and 20 cent per debit card transaction.  Why is that? Ulster Bank also charges for contactless payments.  Why are the charges so high?</p></speech>

We are talking here about the current accounts.  Fees and charges are a commercial decision.  The fees we have introduced in some way reflect our strategy.

This is a commercial decision.  When we look at our fees and charges and the way we introduce them, we charge customers based on usage.  I would not say that we charge more.  I would look at it in the round and the full service offering we give, including having the lowest mortgage fixed rate on the market, as referred to earlier.  It is the entirety of the package.  Our customers can choose the preferred way to bank.  It is more expensive in some channels than others but we have a team of people ready to help anybody, in the branches or over the telephone, who would like to look at different ways of doing their banking.  Some 25% of our customers do not pay any fees; this is largely those customers who are over the age of 66 and our students.</p></speech>

It is interesting that we have created a tiered charging model that is aligned to the level of costs we incur.  If somebody chooses to come into a branch to take money out over the counter there is an 80 cent charge.  As Ms Howard has said this reflects the commercial reality of us employing people, premises, security and so on.  An element of the charge is for these overheads, if the customer chooses to do it that way.  We have people in branches up and down the country to support such customers.  The Senator referred to the ATM fee.  If a person wants to take money out through an ATM then it is a lesser charge of 35 cent.  This charge is driven by our costs for cash in transit fees when moving money around the State.  We also must secure the ATMs and the committee will be aware of the challenges with crimes on ATMs recently-----</p></speech>

If someone chooses to use the chip and pin payment, a direct debit or a standing order it is 20 cent.  The Senator also commented on our contactless payment charge, which is 1 cent.  The cost to us of effecting a contactless payment is not materially different from a person paying with chip and pin, but we recognise that in the market more and more people are using contactless payments for transactions under &euro;30.  It is quicker for customers and better for retailers.  We want to encourage that.  We give the contactless charge at a more discounted rate because we can see this is where the market trend is going.  On our overall fees versus those of our competitors, as Ms Howard has said I cannot comment on the cost base of our competitors and what their commercial decisions are.  In the round and given the options and transparency of fees we are satisfied with the blend we have right now.  The fees and charges, as was indicated, remain under review.  Putting this into context there are also the 25% of customers who are either students or those aged over 66 who do not pay fees and some 35% of customers who pay maintenance fees, which leaves us with 46% of people who pay the transactions fees.  This is the way we have been thinking about it.  I hope this is helpful in explaining the way we have approached it.</p></speech>

A tremendous amount of research has been done looking at how much difference it would make if the limit was increased by &euro;10 or if it actually needs to increase from &euro;30 to &euro;60, and what an increase would do to the fraud environment.  There are an awful lot of factors to be taken into account before the card schemes actually decide on the maximum amounts and a change to that.

They enjoy using contactless payments but there are moments in people's lives when they want to have a named person and see someone.  At times, sadly, this can be during bereavements or it can be at nice times when a child is born or when seeking a mortgage.</p><p>Our customers tell us there are certain life events when they want to be able to speak to somebody.  That is why branches are so important for our personal customers.</p></speech>

We are looking at another seven years and whatever advances will be made in banking.  As a rural dweller, I certainly do not trust that broadband will be delivered, even in the next seven years, to the area I come from.  Banking technology will advance all the time but if people do not have the necessary connectivity, that will be a real problem with regard to social exclusion and excluding customers, especially in rural areas.</p></speech>

We have evidence that shows that seven out of ten of our customers are able to use digital services easily.  There are two ways of using it.  If one is carrying out transactions, it is generally in a place where broadband is available.  The broadband issue is a real problem when doing banking from home.  We have branches which have broadband and customers are very welcome to come in and use our premises to do their banking.  We would love to help them.</p></speech>

With regard to the way we are thinking about our branches, if it helps the committee, we have 88 branches, we have mobile banks, community bankers, community protection advisers and mobile mortgage managers.  As Ms Howard said, there are physical and digital services.  The statistics show us that increasing numbers of people choose to engage with the mobile application, Internet banking or contactless cards for transactional activities.  We will continue to invest and we need to invest to secure that, upgrade systems and stay in line with regulatory changes.  New innovators in non-banks are coming into the markets.  We have invested tens of millions of euro in physical spaces in branches in the last couple of years, across a host of measures.  One is to put broadband into all of them.  Of the 88, 86 are done.  The role of the branch and what will happen inside it will invariably continue to change.  It will be less transactional.  The transaction capability will be there but it is more about supporting customers to give them advice, insight or help.</p></speech>

The Senator will recognise areas such as Glenamoy where we never had a presence historically.  We have community bankers going into those areas, in local community centres, meeting elderly people or, indeed, anybody, to help to do a couple of things with them.  It is to try to help them with financial education, to bring them up to speed with how things are changing and how we can help them.  Critically, we help them to protect themselves against fraud and scams, which are a growing issue.  People have a view that frauds and scams are a digital concept.  They are not.  They take all forms.  We are putting our community bankers in the communities, especially focused on rural areas.  We have held 70 events so far this year, across those parts of the country, helping people with that.</p></speech>

The anti-money laundering guidelines need to be revisited.  I think that case will evolve.  I want to ask two more questions.  One relates to deeds of houses.  If somebody has a loan on a house and pays it off in full, then asks at a local branch of an Ulster Bank for his or her deeds back, that person is told that they cannot be found.  The person can ask at the central office, then this can go on for years, and the person has to take a legal case against Ulster Bank.  Where are people's deeds held and can Ulster Bank lose deeds?  People are told at local branches that the deeds have been lost.  Surely people are entitled to get their deeds back without having to engage barristers and solicitors?</p></speech>

I wish Ms Howard well in her new job.  It is important that we have a strong banking sector in the country.  I have two brief questions.  The witnesses said their two-year and four-year fixed rates are the lowest in the country and that they have a new portal that will help to change mortgages from two to four or whatever.  That is welcome.  They also say that they are looking at legal fees, life assurance, life insurance and house insurance, and making contributions to them for customers.  Do the witnesses look at how much property tax would be when a client comes in?  Do the Revenue Commissioners contact the bank about the valuation of a house?  Is there communication between banks and the Revenue Commissioners?  Do they go into any detail about, and make provision for, property tax when the client  takes out the mortgage?  It is quite significant in some cases.</p></speech>

In that, we would look at all outgoings.  We have a team of very experienced mortgage advisers who would be thoughtful about what the costs are going to be when somebody moves into or buys a new home.  To that extent, we would expect property taxes to be included.  We look at people's future outgoings to make sure that people can afford the mortgage they are taking on.  I have not heard that it is a particular issue.</p></speech>

It has been brought to my attention in some cases that where the loans are being sold and where the vulture fund wants to get vacant possession, be it through eviction or the sale of the home, in some cases, it is the bank - Ulster Bank in this case - rather than the vulture fund that serves the eviction papers on the client.  When Ulster Bank sells its portfolio of loans, is it finished with them or does it still hold the papers and the rights to serve papers in this case if they are required to be served for court proceedings or evictions?</p></speech>

We do not have a specific target but the point I made is that it is clear from the regulators that there is an expectation that banks with non-performing loans in excess of 5% are regarded as having too high a percentage of non-performing loans.  Therefore, there is a very clear expectation that we would move towards the European average, which is running below 5%.  It is running at about 3.4%.</p></speech>

That is all I need to know.  My next point concerns Brexit.  Ulster Bank is unique in an Irish setting in that it is one of the four large pillar banks but effectively has a presence in Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  We are looking at Ulster Bank in the Republic of Ireland.  Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland is a separate entity and both are subsidiaries of RBS.  In respect of Ulster Bank customers and the Irish banking landscape, the witnesses noted that Ulster Bank has looked at a number of scenarios, including a no-deal Brexit, as a stand-alone bank.  Can the witnesses elaborate on the implications of what unfolds in the UK for Ulster Bank in the Republic of Ireland?</p></speech>

What we in the Republic of Ireland are concerned about is our customers, who will face different challenges.  Some of our customers export to the UK while others use it as a land bridge.  Depending on what happens with Brexit, and none of us knows what will happen, we need to support those customers.  Some of them will want to change their business model.  Some are capable of doing that while others are not.  Our focus will be on helping our customers in the Republic of Ireland.  The reason I express it that way is because there will be a different set of circumstances in the UK.  Does that explain it?</p></speech>

At the larger end, they are in a unique position where they can afford to, in some examples, set up an additional plant in the UK and mitigate the risk.  At the very small end, they will be impacted by Brexit as, when, and if something happens and impacts the economy in Ireland.  It will impact their ability to do business locally, as a consequence of the economy.  There is also the middle group of customers, which is quite a range, but the biggest issue I hear about is not Brexit <i>per se</i>, but a lack of labour, both skilled and unskilled.  One hears about it whether in the middle of Dublin, Monaghan, or Cavan.  It does not matter where one is, that is one of the main things stopping customers from investing in their business or expanding it, and it worries them more than Brexit.<br/><br/>When one looks at the Brexit scheme, there is a concern about how prepared people are.  We have held road shows, and we have also written to customers about the obvious issues.  If one has been around as long as I have, one remembers things such as customs and excise and how painful that process is, and we need to make sure people have guarantees in place.  When we look at indicators of preparedness, we are looking at things like that.  For example, if someone is moving goods and does not have a guarantee in place, perhaps they do not understand that they will need that for goods to move, and then they would need an overdraft.</p></speech>

Are there aspects of the scheme that the witnesses would like to see changed, or that are not working?  Is it tied into taking on extra staff, or is there a reason the uptake is so low?  We are being told there are serious concerns around Brexit and being Brexit-ready.</p><p>Ms Howard was in the UK prior to coming to Ireland, and I would like to get her perspective in terms of what differences she sees in the Irish and UK landscapes.  Where does she see the differences in exposures on Brexit, and how does she feel we are prepared as a country in terms of business and across spectrums?  She brings an intellectual knowledge of what is happening on the ground in the UK with banking and business over the Irish Sea.</p><p>There are a number of aspects to my question, namely, whether the loan scheme, as structured, is the problem, Ms Howard's perspective on that, because she is looking at it, and a mark review on where she sees Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the UK in terms of the landscape and the Brexit, financial, and banking implications thereof.  I would like to hear her overall perspective as the head of one of the four main banks in Ireland. </p></speech>

Let me take that away and we will follow up on that to see whether we are not hearing it because we have not been asking the right questions or listening well enough.</p> <p>  The financial services in the UK and Ireland, and the impact of Brexit, are quite interesting in that they are very different.  If one is in financial services in London, which is clearly a central hub, the discussion there is about the fact that some of the skills and jobs have to be taken out of the UK and will be in a different part of Europe.  That is the concern one hears in the financial services market in the UK in terms of how it works.  When one comes to Ireland, we see that there are more banks choosing to make their European base in Ireland.  They are not necessarily retail banks, but that creates different challenges here such as competition for people with particular skillsets.  It is quite different in that regard.</p> <p>  When one comes down to customers, however, many things are the same.  If the economy is struggling, whether that is in the UK or here, then the concerns for customers are exactly the same regardless.  When one comes to preparedness, it is interesting because the UK has many schemes, including an RBS scheme directed specifically at supporting customers through Brexit, and they are not being drawn down either.  It is interesting that we have that similarity.  Even though governments, banks, and people are making help available, whether money or expertise and support, it is not being taken up in either Ireland or the UK.  </p></speech>

When she took up her position here, what were the key differences between what she found when working in the UK and when she experienced the banking sector through Ulster Bank here in Ireland?</p></speech>

In terms of differences, I will start off with customers, and that is interesting in that there is not much difference.  When one thinks about customers, what they want, and what they tell us they want, it falls under five broad things.  They want to be able to borrow money from us, save with us, invest with a bank, protect the things that are precious to them, or they want us to help them make sure their banking is done well.  That includes education.  Those five things are no different here than they are in the UK.</p></speech>

For example, there is a lot more competition in the UK market than would typically be found here, in either retail or commercial banks.  There are differences there.</p> <p>  It is a privilege to be here.  We have more than 3,500 colleagues in Ulster Bank, and every day they come into work to do a great job for our customers.  The reality is that we have processes that get in their way of getting it right for customers, and equally, we need to change so that we get it right for customers every time.  The issue of consistency, which is key to culture, is absolutely crucial.</p><p>In terms of people wanting to do the right thing for customers in banking here, that is not much different from the UK.  Would the committee like me to talk a bit about culture?</p></speech>

The question is about the comparison at senior level, so she can tell me that the dynamics are different here and that the processes often get in the way of good staff, but it was not the staff who caused the tracker mortgage issue.  It was something else.  Was it a process that caused it, or was it the culture from board level?  What has caused the complete distrust of the public in the banking sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.956" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jane Howard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019050900002#O00300"><p>I will talk about Ireland specifically and then I will come to the UK, and articulate the differences.  The Irish banks came out at the bottom of the Edelman trust barometer in terms of being least trusted by consumers.  The Irish Banking Culture Board survey on trust also made very sorry reading, and that trust is lower than in the UK, where a banking culture survey was also conducted.  The results here are lower in terms of consumers trusting banks.  Even though Ulster Bank scored well relative to other banks, it is not where we want to be, and we absolutely recognise that we have lot do to win back the trust of customers here in Ireland.</p> <p>  One thing that has been in the UK for a while is the senior management or accountability regime that is being introduced here.  What that did at a senior level was to make peoples' accountabilities and responsibilities very clear.  The current plan is for that to be introduced here in the first quarter of next year at the executive level.  It will also extend to board members, which it does not do in the UK, so we will go further here in Ireland than in the UK.</p> <p>  Culture is everything we do all the way from strategy down to how we serve the customer.  It is the way I behave, and the way the executive team behaves.  It is what we do and what we do not do.  All of that will impact the culture of Ulster Bank, and if we lead and put the customers first in our strategy, decision-making, and making sure we have better services for them, then that is how we will be seen and trusted by the Irish public and Irish customers.  They will decide on whether we do that well or not. </p></speech>

She should be in the D&aacute;il Chamber because she has given a political response.  I ask her to go back to it again.  What differences did she find between the culture here that led us into the crash and the tracker mortgage issue, and where she came from in the UK?</p> <p>  It is clear that customers were robbed by the banks, not just Ulster Bank but others as well.  The banks are just giving their customers' money back to them, and a lot of banks make a big song and dance about doing that, as if it were a good news story.  It is not, because the banks are just returning the money that was stolen from their customers.  The people do not have trust in the banks, and they are waiting for a banker who will give a straight answer to a question.  Did Ms Howard find a rotten culture here that she could describe by comparison to the UK, or is it the same?</p></speech>

As I said, we have more than 3,500 people in Ulster Bank and they are trying their best to help our customers get financially fitter.  It would be wrong for me to sit here and say that it is very different.  The UK may be further ahead, but it has had the payment protection insurance, PPI, issue, and it had that earlier than we had the tracker issue here, so I think it has moved, worked on its culture, and focused on customers earlier than we have.  It did have the same cultural issues, it just happened to be a different product.  Our commitment, and my commitment, is that we are going to take culture very seriously.  We are doing that and that work started before I arrived.  It comes to focusing on one's customers, listening to them, and acting on what they are telling us.</p></speech>

I am very much looking forward to being a part of that, and Mr. Justice John Hedigan has built a board with significant diversity around it.

I am a CEO on the board as a bank representative, and there are also bankers from the other banks at different levels and in different roles.  Mr. Justice Hedigan has also chosen other members of society as well, so he has built a very diverse board of people who represent the customers or those who work in the industry.</p></speech>

I find that to be the strangest thing ever, because regardless of what one's business background is, whether it is big or small, the customer is the key to the success of one's business.  Here, the banks have to fund a board that will lead them to understand that, so they must really have gone off course in the last ten years.</p></speech>

However, the trust was so badly lost that it was felt we needed more than just the banks working individually, and the Irish Banking Culture Board is seen as a way to do that.</p></speech>

According to Ulster Bank's analysis of the sale, 1,500 accounts were sold in 2015; 2,874 were sold in 2016; nothing was apparently sold in 2017; and 3,937 were sold in 2018.  In answer to a question earlier on, it was stated that Ulster Bank has almost &euro;1 billion of loans still to sell if it is to get down to 5%.</p> <p>  How much work does Ulster Bank undertake on any individual loan, particularly on the mortgage end, or even the buy-to-let end?  Those, after all, are homes for some people too.  What analysis is done of the social consequences or the consequences to society arising from these loans being sold on?  Does Ms Howard believe that the bank, until now, has endeavoured to get down to the real issues in each of these loans?  Has the bank made its best effort to ensure that a roof is kept over those peoples' heads?</p> <p>  Does Ms Howard think her bank has done that?</p></speech>

Those are typically the mortgage customers, and we are committed to engaging with them and to trying to help them get on to a solution, which is ideally to remain in their homes.</p><p>In some cases it might be helping with mortgage to rent or assisted surrender so they can go into another home they can afford to be in but we are committed to doing that.

The vulture will just take the whole loan for profit.  It does not give a damn about regulation or anything else.  The manner in which some of the vulture funds' agents are treating the people in this country is shocking and we are told constantly in these Houses and in this committee that the protection follows.  It does not.  They are a ruthless bunch who want nothing out of the Irish economy only profit and they do not care what sort of situation they leave behind, whether it is people in desperation or a devastated society.  They do not care.  What I am saying to Ms Howard is that is quite different from someone coming forward to Ulster Bank Ireland, asking if the bank cares about them and to help them transfer their loans to a charity that is not for profit.  Is it possible that within the change of culture in the banks, that the banks would accept that things went wrong and that there is a need for a change of culture and to signal that the banks would work with the not-for-profit organisations if they came forward?</p></speech>

As Mr. Coyle articulated earlier, we have helped more customers buy a home, we are saving them money when they switch to us and we are keen to do more of that when we have the best rates and we are keen to work to make sure the switching process from one bank to another is easier than it is at the moment.</p><p>Equally, on the business side there are customers who want to borrow and who are expanding.  We are keen to help them also.  We are demonstrating growth in that area and we have a good momentum into this year.</p><p> We are continuing to invest in digital.  There is no doubt that we have some customers who only want to do their banking digitally.  We need to be able to offer a solution that is as good as Revolut or something similar.  We do not think that is enough, however, and we believe it is right to offer a bank that is digital and physical, which is in line with our strategy.

Obviously, they relate to the prudential side.  One of the regulations relates to the need for retaining more capital in respect of non-performing loans and, as we discussed earlier, the averages and the desire to get banks to below 5% of non-performing loans because that percentage is seen as being high.  Undoubtedly, we will continue to see new regulation coming out, particularly as one gets new developments.  It could come out on the conduct side, which would be from the Central Bank, or it could come out from the EU.  As technologies develop and as we see things such as artificial intelligence being used in robotics there will need to be new regulation to ensure that consumers are protected.</p></speech>

It is a criminal offence and an investigation takes place.  When the ATM is within a retail outlet, it can depend on whether it is branded to a certain bank.  In those circumstances, there is potential to share the costs.  I will have to check the position for the Senator.  There would also be non-banks that are in the ATM market.  We have seen in recent weeks where it has happened and where the bank involved is ultimately going to be liable for the costs and must manage the risks around that.  This is one of the reasons we discussed earlier for having to cover some of the costs associated with banking in general but with ATMs in particular.</p></speech>
