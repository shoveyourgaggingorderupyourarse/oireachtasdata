He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.</p> <p>  The minutes of the meeting of 18 April have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  No matters arise that will not come up under correspondence.</p> <p>   We will proceed to correspondence.  There are three categories.</p><p>Category A is correspondence relating to the briefing document and opening statements.  Nos. 2149A and 2150A from the Office of the Garda Commissioner, dated 3 May and 7 May 2019, are the briefing document and opening statement for today's meeting.  Is it agreed to note and publish these?  Agreed.</p><p> Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers, follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and other items for publishing.</p><p> No. 2121B is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills.  It is dated 16 April 2019 and provides information on the arrangements for the internal audit for education and training boards, ETBs, and the steps taken by the Department to resolve any issue.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; provides an update on the internal audit arrangements of the City of Dublin ETB and the ETB internal audit unit.  We note this and will publish it.  We know there have been difficulties and we are pleased the Department is starting to give this matter greater priority, attention and resources.  We will take this into consideration as part of our periodic report.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; advises there is an increased budget, as I have mentioned, and that the Department is jointly commissioning a wider review of internal audit in the sector to ascertain the longer-term support required to deliver an ongoing and appropriate internal audit function.  We have mentioned this.  One unit is based in Cavan and there are difficulties recruiting people to travel throughout the country.  The Department is examining this issue, which we welcome, but we will consider this as part of our periodic report because, as I have stated, we have not been happy with the internal audit function in the ETB sector and it is good that it is now being addressed.</p><p> No. 2122B is from Mr. John McCarthy, the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It provides a detailed response requested by the committee to a number of matters raised at our meeting with him on 28 February 2019.  We will note and publish this.  Any member who wants to comment on it is welcome to do so.  We will take the contents into consideration when finalising our report on housing issues.  A lot of information has to be incorporated in the report.</p><p> Deputies Catherine Murphy and Cassells wish to speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#B00200"><p>I was going to make exactly that point.  There is some information that would be useful for the report.  In recent weeks, an issue with regard to the cost of turnkey as opposed to direct build was revealed and we should include it.  It is something that was raised here and we got an undertaking that the categories would be published separately.  On average, it costs about one third more to buy turnkey as opposed to a direct build.  Given the scale of the housing crisis, direct build would certainly be a big part of the solution.</p> <p>  How do we intend to go about publishing the report?  It was to be a dual report on the national broadband plan and the work we have done on housing.  We have had hearings on both.  I realise an announcement was made.  We had a meeting scheduled yesterday to look at the draft report but a majority of the committee decided not to go ahead with it.  What way will we proceed?  There is a valuable contribution to be made in the work we have done on broadband, particularly on the forerunner to the national broadband plan, which was the metropolitan area networks.  The draft report is a start but there are significant gaps that we need to address.  We will have to meet and go through the gaps.  Is it intended to publish the housing report separately?  Is it intended to have a dual report?  What will we decide to do?  What is the plan of action?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#B00300"><p>For the public record, we had a private meeting scheduled for yesterday to discuss documents produced by the secretariat as a result of the various meetings we have held in recent months.  One of these documents is on broadband and the metropolitan area networks and the other is on housing.  The timescale would have been quite tight with regard to discussing it yesterday and finalising it today - after our meeting with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - with a view to getting absolute clearance for publication next week.</p> <p>  I always took the view that we could not publish it within 48 hours of the local and European elections.  It was always going to be a tight squeeze to get it out eight days in advance of the elections, which is the middle of next week.  When the Government announced its intention to appoint a preferred bidder for the national broadband plan, and we can now see there is a highly charged political debate between the Government and the Opposition, I felt that for the Committee of Public Accounts to wade in to discuss and finalise a report on broadband might be perceived as the committee wading into a current political controversy.  I took the view that I do not want the committee to be accused of this.  We might not have had agreement in any event because different views are held by Government members and Opposition members.  I felt the most prudent thing to do was to hold it over.  We will certainly complete our work but I felt that in the politically charged debate during these days I did not want to involve the committee at this time.  We will certainly complete our work as soon as is practical.  As Chairman I felt it was better not to proceed.  The secretariat phoned around and two thirds of the committee agreed to postpone.  We will come back to it.</p> <p>  I also felt that a lot of the information that came out on Tuesday may have been relevant to incorporate in our report, which we would not have been able to sign off within 24 or 48 hours of the documentation becoming available.  I felt the prudent thing to do was to let the political side of it get out of the way and then the Committee of Public Accounts would do its work, as it always does, outside of the current political controversy.</p> <p>  I acknowledge publicly that Deputy Catherine Murphy was keen that the meeting should have proceeded as scheduled and I accept this.  The majority took the opposite view.  I accept that a significant part of the work prepared by the secretariat was on the metropolitan area networks but because it was connected to broadband in the same report I felt we could not go into it in this political climate.  The idea was, subject to agreement of the committee, that we would publish two reports simultaneously on the same day.</p></speech>

To publish a report next week we would have to have absolute sign-off today and that time is very tight.  As Chairman, I would not recommend publishing a report of the Committee of Public Accounts on housing and broadband in the week of the elections.  It was a tight and ambitious timescale.</p></speech>

I just felt it was prudent for the committee to maintain its political independence at this time and not wade into the debate.</p></speech>

It highlights the frustration because there is as much in the follow-up note that could spark a fresh debate as there was in the original debate.  In fact, there is even more than in the original documentation.  I appreciate the Chairman has said a report will be issued but there is as much that would feed into a fresh debate, in particular the graphs on the local property tax take feeding into housing.  It is a point that-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#B01200"><p>I am referring to a chart on the local property tax take of local authorities.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I have consistently made the point on the contribution towards other housing aspects.  My county is mentioned with regard to the failure of the mortgage to rent scheme.  Traveller accommodation is also mentioned.  There is a plethora of issues that could be examined.</p> <p>  At our meeting with the Secretary General, I raised points in respect of the local property tax take.  The Taoiseach has made a particular pledge that all property tax will be retained locally so that local authorities running a surplus will no longer have to contribute to the equalisation fund.  When I asked the Secretary General about this he had no idea how it would be achieved.</p><p>In that respect, we are talking about a serious amount of money.  It is a serious matter for the holder of the most prominent office in the country to say that and it is an issue that has not been addressed.  Political promises have since been made in local election manifestos that all councils under Fine Gael will cut local property tax.  When we examine the documents that have been brought forward, we see the strain certain Departments and councils are operating under and their failure to achieve what they should be achieving.  I am telling members of the committee that the documents raise even more questions.  One could have a fresh debate on them.  I look forward to using them in the compilation of the committee's report.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#C00300"><p>I will cover the two issues.  On the housing report, I do not think we should be too precious about the timing of elections because our report was not planned in that way.  Having said that, the timing is coincidental; we are not ready to publish it.  Will we have one more sitting to clear the report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#C00400"><p>We have had no discussion on it.  We have not even had a preliminary discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#C00500"><p>We need a timeline for when we will discuss it.  Most likely the discussion will take place after the local elections simply because we have not done any work on it.</p> <p>  On the broadband report, for a number of reasons it was correct not to proceed with the meeting yesterday.  Obviously, we have the letter from Mr. Robert Watt, that is, the memo that was published yesterday.  Given that we now have that letter, how do we intend to deal with it in the context of our broadband report which essentially is unfinished business?  I know that it will deal with a lot of other issues also.  We have a number of options, including that we proceed with our report as is and deal with the letter separately or we deal with it and the questions it raises as part of an ongoing process and perhaps incorporate our examination of Mr. Watt's concerns into the report.  I am looking for the guidance of the Chairman on the best way to proceed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#C00600"><p>My view is we had Mr. Watt before the committee a number of weeks ago to talk about capital projects.  We listed all of the projects, starting with the national children's hospital and on through ten major projects.  We had a discussion with Mr. Watt on the national broadband plan.  A member of the committee - perhaps it was the Deputy - asked him whether he thought it should go ahead.  He said it was more than his job was worth to answer that question in public.  Clearly, he has now indicated publicly.  As a result of the discussion we had on capital projects, we are writing to him for an unredacted version of all correspondence because we have previously discussed the particular matter.  I think the Committee of Public Accounts will today formally request an unredacted version.  When we receive it, we can decide on the next step to be taken.  Obviously, there is information he did not want to share on the day and there might now be an opportunity to have a full discussion on that information now that it has been published in the meantime.  That is what I suggest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#C00700"><p>Let me add one point to what the Chairman said because it is very rare for memos and reports of these types to be published.  It is good that there is robust engagement between that Department and others.  Then there is the response of the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which is a welcome development.  The Comptroller and Auditor General had, in fact, called for that type of reporting and such issues to be published in advance of major projects being completed because the Government decides based on all of the information it has received what is the best course of action.  This is the first time I have seen a letter that is so stark in its critique of a project which at that point had not been signed off on.  As this is new, how do we as a committee examine it?  It is a political decision that was made at Cabinet level, but at the same time fundamental questions were raised about value for money.  Value for money is exactly what we consider which normally involves a look-back.  Obviously, the Comptroller and Auditor General also engages in a look-back, but now that the issue is live and given that the letter was so stark and Mr. Watt was so clear in his concerns about the project, we need to look at it in a way we have not done before.  We have not seen such a robust letter from a Secretary General before.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#C00800"><p>I concur with Deputy Cullinane's views.  It is good to see this happen and nice to know that not everybody sings from the one hymn sheet.  It is also good to see one line Department challenging another.  That is useful and it is good that this information has been published.  The correspondence is very important and if there is further correspondence from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment that was not issued, we will want to see it as it will help to inform our consideration.</p> <p>  In case people ask why is the committee which normally looks back looking for a contract, the reason is that significant expenditure has been incurred on this project in recent years.  Therefore, the national broadband plan, the cost of tendering, the cost of consultants, the cost benefit analysis, the first draft of the plan and the revised draft when the European Union forced the Government to remove the 300,000 houses Eir stated it would cover have had implications in terms of further expenditure.  We are looking at the expenditure that has been incurred to date and want to see whether what has been done to date will result in the achievement of value for money.  Obviously, that will have implications for future expenditure.  We are absolutely acting within our remit in looking at all expenditure incurred in previous years lest anybody doubts why we are doing so.</p></speech>

That would have been wrong.  I think the Chairman is doing himself an injustice in that regard.  It would have been the wrong precedent to set.  The meeting was scheduled to take place yesterday and I agreed that it should be deferred for two reasons, the other being - it is also important - that we did not have enough information and that information was coming out.  I also felt we would not be able to complete the reports yesterday as they were unfinished.  There are many aspects involved, particularly the national broadband plan, at which we need to look.  The wrong message would have been sent.</p></speech>

Quite the contrary, it is the very day we should go ahead with it.  We need more information.  Broadband provision is an extremely serious matter.  In fairness to Deputy Catherine Murphy who asked for it to be placed on the agenda, we learned an enormous amount which is not reflected in the report which is a working document that needs to be changed.</p></speech>

Clearly, the meeting was not cancelled for political reasons but because of the volume of information that had come out in the previous 24 hours.  To enable us to produce a report, I thought we needed to assess the information that had only became available before we would sign off on it.  The Deputy is correct.  The meeting was not cancelled for political reasons-----</p></speech>

The aspects related to the metropolitan area networks, MANs, are very important because they give some insight into the cost of broadband provision.  The Analysys Mason report was very helpful from that point of view in terms of the lack of transparency.  There is a range of issues that are really important in informing how one should proceed in the future.  That involves a look-back.  In competing the report there will obviously be a debate.  There will be a debate over a considerable period of time on the contract.  On the Committee of Public Accounts being helpful, the meeting with the Secretary General should predate publication of the report.  We are likely to have something additional to be included in the report which will be both important and useful.</p><p>I think we might revisit the capital projects because the Secretary General does refer to the national children's hospital and there are some insights in the documentation that has been published that may well be helpful in terms of other advices that might have been given in that regard, or perhaps other contracts.</p></speech>

Roads are more predictable, and local authorities, which very often lead the development of roads, have fine-tuned the work on those.</p> <p>  Regarding the point that Deputy Cassells made about the local property tax, the more complicated one makes something, the more one gets away with it.  Local government funding is just so confusing.  The Government in the last general election talked about not introducing any new taxes.  No new income taxes were introduced, but there are things in this that really should be a cause of concern.  I do not think that when local property tax was introduced there was an expectation that it would fund housing or roads.  It was not sold as such.  The point has been made that it is a local property tax, is wholly retained in one particular area and is not a replacement for subvention for projects that comes from central Government.  We now have a Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  We were told that the purpose of that committee was that if the Opposition makes demands for things to be done, and Deputy Cassell's party has been criticised by Fine Gael quite heavily on this, the committee would have a responsibility to look at them to see if they are possible.  Why do we not ask the Committee on Budgetary Oversight to have a look at what the cost would be of making this a wholly local property tax, as opposed to a replacement for the grants that come from various Departments?  That would be a valuable and ongoing piece of work for that committee.  I know we are supposed to leave our politics outside the door when we come in here, but we in the Social Democrats did our own budget, as other parties do, in advance of the budget being announced.  We included in our budget an amount for the cost of precisely such a proposal.  However, it is only when one goes looking at this that one realises how costly it is, so we should do that.  We should ask the Committee on Budgetary Oversight to look specifically at the local property tax.  If it were to be made wholly local and were not to have an equalisation fund, what would that cost be?  We should look at the self-fund aspect, which is about councils funding roads and housing, which was not what the public expected of local property tax.  We could ask the committee to look at that aspect and ask them what the dynamic would be if it were taken out.</p></speech>

This topic frustrates me.  We should spend a month on it because we deal with it maybe once a year.  The Comptroller and Auditor General  in his report always refers to the myriad funding going into local government, but the matter comes in and out of here in half a day.  We should spend a whole month on it because it has the biggest impact on local people's lives bar none.  That self-funding aspect for housing and roads was a huge sleight of hand that the ordinary person would not have understood in the context of aspects of local government that were previously funded through a central fund from the Custom House.  Counties such as Meath, Kildare and Dublin were now having to fund this themselves out of people's local property tax, as opposed to the funding coming from a central fund.  That was a huge issue, and the impact is of course that there is less money to spend on some other aspect of local services.  People ask where their local property tax is going, but suddenly these moneys are being used to fund what had previously been funded through a central Government fund.  That is the sleight of hand.  These are the kinds of things that need to come out into the public domain in order that people can understand the significance of what is being done in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the impact it is having on local services.  It is a question of how one squares the circle of promising people there will be no increase in their property tax, that the Government is actually going to reduce it, and that counties such as Dublin and Meath can retain all their property tax but the Government will somehow find the money to fund services in Leitrim and Longford as well.  It is voodoo mathematics.</p></speech>

We are happy to note that and put it on the record.  When we get a report back from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding our periodic report, we will reconfirm the matter at that stage and discuss it again.  I am delighted to see every line we write is scrutinised so closely.  I am impressed.  It is good.  We will come back to this as part of our assessment of the response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  There are three items related to our inquiries regarding the ongoing review of matters in Waterford Institute of Technology.  No. 2125B, from Mr. William Beausang of the Department of Education and Skills, gives an update requested by the committee on the next steps regarding the independent review of the spin-out and sale of companies from telecommunications software systems group at Waterford IT, which was not completed for legal reasons relating to the remit of the Higher Education Authority.  The Department is prepared to examine issues by the contributors to the HEA report if contributors give their permission to forward their information to the Department.  In parallel, the Department is continuing to examine matters in the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry in Waterford IT and has raised a number of questions about WIT's governing body.  Mr. Beausang advises that the Department will keep the committee updated when there are further developments.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2140B - as I said, there are three items related to this topic - is from Ms Stephanie Goode of the Department of Education and Skills, confirming that the Department has received responses mentioned in the last item from the governing body of Waterford Institute of Technology to the questions posed by the Department.  Ms Goode advises that the responses are currently under active consideration by officials in the Department.  It is agreed that we will note and publish this.</p> <p>  Also related to this matter is No. 2136B from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, regarding the authority's draft report on WIT regarding the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry.  The HEA previously advised the committee that it was unable to complete the review as it did not have the legal powers to do so.  Separately, the HEA did not agree to release the draft report to the Right to Know group following an FOI request.  Mr. O'Toole advises that this decision was partially overturned by the Information Commissioner on appeal.  That is good.  Somebody was doing their job.  The Information Commissioner determined that chapters 1 to 4 of the draft report should be released.  Mr. O'Toole enclosed a copy of this document for the information of the committee.  He does draw our attention to possible legal difficulties if the Right to Know group or others, such as this committee, publish this item.</p><p>I propose that we publish Mr. O'Toole's letter but that we do not publish the related document at this time.  We might get agreement to that.  There is a lot there.</p></speech>

I welcome that Mr. Beausang's letter responds to the concerns in our letter.  We ended up in a situation where we had the draft report, which was redacted with all the conclusions left out.  Essentially, all we got was the context, the terms of reference and so on.  We did not get any of the conclusions or recommendations that would have formed part of that report.  Mr. Beausang's letter indicates that the Department may follow through with some form of examination of this issue themselves.  Mr. Beausang sets out the powers that the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister have.  My reading of what Mr. Beausang has said is that the Department has not concluded yet and that it has not settled on what the course of action will be, but that it will make some recommendation to the Minister, which may be to appoint under the Act a special investigator to investigate the claims.</p> <p>  There is a bit of a worry, however, in the reference going back to the whistleblowers and those people who came forward and made protected disclosures, which is fair enough.  The Department indicates that the advice is to go through the normal procedures in Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, to make protected disclosures.  I believe that the horse has bolted pretty much on that.  I have no difficulty with this being set out as an option, but the people involved have already made protected disclosures to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and we have to protect the integrity of the process.  There would be a concern if people came forward, made protected disclosures to a State body and then were told to go back to the institute.  This, however, is set out as an option.  The correspondence states also that the individuals can resubmit their disclosures to the Department, which would in turn inform whether or not the Department advises the Minister to appoint a special investigator.  It seems that an awful lot of responsibility is being put back onto the whistleblowers and onto those people who made disclosures.  I assume these are all busy people and are concerned that they were left hanging.  The committee will be aware that some of them have been in contact with me.  They may decide that they will not follow through on this.  We do not know.  It is a little bit unsettling that the correspondence seems to be putting a lot of onus on what the whistleblowers and those who made disclosures should do rather than on the Department following through.  I suggest that this committee recommends to the Department that it proceeds with appointing an investigator.  We wanted a report.  The issue of concern for us was that the HEA did a report that was outside the scope of its powers.  That is acknowledged.  The Attorney General has acknowledged this.  The Department, however, has set out that it has the power under the Act.  None of this has ever examined the details of the private company and what it did.  It was at all times the activities of the institute and the interactions between the institute and the private company.  This is what Mr. McCloone had looked at, what the Comptroller and Auditor General had looked at and what this committee looked at in our hearings on the matter.  I would suggest that we strongly recommend that the Department does this.  I am aware the Department is awaiting responses from WIT but that is in response to-----</p></speech>

In Dr. Love's view, Mr. McCloone had established facts but the problem was the HEA could not publish the report because it was outside its scope and powers.  The facts have not changed and some mechanism is needed to ensure those facts are put on the public record.  At this point, appointing an investigator is probably the only way to do that.</p></speech>

We all say that whistleblowers are valuable and important, which I completely accept.  They have to see, however, that there is follow through and that it does not fall back on them.  We cannot be in a situation where they do something and then ask "What was the point?".  I believe the same is probably felt in Limerick.  I understand it is a separate issue but there is the whole area of the HEA and its powers, to which we have drawn attention.  Was the Department of Education and Skills to come back to the committee on that aspect or have I a flawed memory of that?</p></speech>

On Deputy Cullinane's suggestion, I would say that we have so much going on here even if we go through the whole process the only possible good outcome at the end is that the Department or the Minister appoints an inspector, so why not do it now?  We can go around in circles.  They have come to the conclusion that the HEA did not have the authority to commission the report.  As the Deputy said, the people who made the disclosures are swinging in the wind, and at some stage somebody hopes that either this will go away or that the Minister will appoint somebody to investigate.  Will the committee recommend this to the Department?</p></speech>

This benefits everybody.  It will benefit the research institutes, the governing body, the president of the institute and all those people who came forward.  I stress again that 50 people engaged in that report but different opinions were expressed as part of that engagement.  There were different views on what was happening within the institute so for everybody's benefit, it would be good to get the facts out there in order that this matter is not left hanging.  I would strongly recommend that we push the Department on this appointment.</p></speech>

The HEA commissioned a report into the Waterford Institute of Technology.  The report was completed but there was an issue because at the end of the day it transpired that the HEA may not have had the legal authority to commission that particular investigation.  The authority to carry out such an investigation is only vested in the Minister and the Department.  In the meantime, all those who contributed to the report and who had given information, which is out there, are swinging in the wind because they have no recourse as a result of everything they said.  They are still employed in the organisation.  The Department has confirmed that the only people who absolutely have the power to commission the investigation are the Minister and the Department.  Can we agree that the committee should write to the Department at this point asking it to move to appoint an investigator under the relevant section of the legislation?  We can have the technical matter clarified around the relevant section under which the inspector can be appointed.  Is it an inspector or investigator?</p></speech>

Agreed.  I remind members that earlier we had said that the committee would not publish that report, which was received, in case it prejudices anything or in case we attach parliamentary privilege to a particular document.  That attached correspondence will not be published.</p> <p>  No. 2128B from Mr. Martin O'Brien, the chief executive of the Louth Meath Education and Training Board, ETB, provides an update on the invoice redirection fraud, which we had been monitoring.  Mr. O'Brien advises that the ETB&rsquo;s insurers, Irish Public Bodies, are covering the loss in full and that no loss is therefore incurred by the ETB.  I put it to the committee that ultimately the ETB would receive its funding from the local authorities.  All the funds paid out by the ETBs in such cases come from premiums paid to Irish Public Bodies, which is fully funded by the Irish taxpayer.  It is coming out through that bank account rather than the Louth Meath ETB.  I wanted to make the point that Irish Public Bodies is not a private insurance company coughing up.  It is a mutual company.  Mr. O'Brien has asked for the committee's patience until the matter is brought to a conclusion.  We will note and publish this correspondence in the meantime.</p> <p>  No. 2129B from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, provides follow-up information requested in relation to the metropolitan area networks and the national broadband plan.  The committee has discussed this and will incorporate all this information into our report as soon as possible when we come back to dealing with our report on broadband, which also specifically deals with the metropolitan area networks.</p><p>Is it agreed that we will note and publish this correspondence?  Agreed.</p><p> No. 2130B is correspondence from the director-general of RT&Eacute;, Ms Dee Forbes, providing an update regarding the review of the 157 contracts highlighted as at high or medium risk of having attributes akin to employment.  This was a recommendation in the Eversheds Sutherland report.  Ms Forbes expects the review to be completed in the second half of this year and advises that RT&Eacute; has developed a revised policy guideline regarding the engagement of contractors.  The director-general gives an undertaking to keep the committee updated on the matter.  Is it agreed to note and publish the correspondence?</p></speech>

The Eversheds Sutherland report states that there may be issues of bogus self-employment and that RT&Eacute; must engage with the individuals involved.  It is only last week that the process of meeting some of those staff members began, which is frustrating for the people involved.  There are issues still to be resolved in this matter.  We had several Secretaries General discuss those issues with us at the committee.  As I recall, it was the Secretary General at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment who acknowledged that the practice of bogus self-employment is illegal.  There are also taxation issues that have not been addressed.  The facts surrounding this issue must be established in a public way.  RT&Eacute; management is meeting the staff and making arrangements to put them on the appropriate contracts.  However, if it is the case that RT&Eacute; was intentionally putting people on contracts in such a way as to engage in the process of bogus self-employment, that is very serious for the organisation.</p> <p>  Given that we commenced this process, we must follow through on it.  I propose that we go back to RT&Eacute; management to establish whether or not it accepts there were people on bogus self-employment contracts and, second, whether there are taxation issues arising from that and, if so, whether RT&Eacute; has been in contact with Revenue or intends to make such contact.  I would like an assurance that there will be full disclosure following all the meetings with the individuals concerned as to whether or not such practices were happening in RT&Eacute; and to what extent.  It is an ongoing issue in several sectors and a growing problem.  If illegal practice did take place, we must respond to that and any taxation issues must be dealt with.  None of that is established in the letter.</p></speech>

She has indicated that the original timeline of the end of June for completion of the review will not be met until the second half of the year.  I agree that the issues Deputy Cullinane has raised should be incorporated into the review.  There is no point in doing a review without dealing with those issues.  That is all we can suggest.</p></speech>

If that was the case, it was an illegal practice and, second, there are taxation and Revenue issues.  We should be alerting RT&Eacute; to its responsibilities, as outlined by the Secretary General at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, that there may be both legal and taxation issues.  We need to know whether the director-general is aware of them and what she is doing to address them.</p></speech>

As indicated in the diagram, which can be now brought on screen, almost two thirds of the expenditure was related to payment of salaries, wages and allowances, which totalled &euro;1.076 billion in 2017.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na spent &euro;327 million on pension and gratuity payments to retired garda&iacute;.</p> <p>  Apart from standard administration costs, expenditure was incurred on operational inputs, including transport, communications and other operational equipment, and building, maintenance and servicing of stations and other buildings.  Unlike other large Votes, the account does not analyse spending in terms of output programmes such as traffic policing, fraud investigation or other specialist functions.</p> <p>  At the end of 2017, approximately 16,200 whole-time equivalent staff were employed, of which just under 14,000 were garda&iacute; or trainees, and 2,200 were civilian employees with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p> The Vote for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is one of the few Votes that routinely receives a Supplementary Estimate towards the end of the year.  A Supplementary Estimate of a little over &euro;44 million was voted for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2017.  At the end of the year, the amount remaining unspent was &euro;14.2 million.  Of this, &euro;8.9 million in unspent capital funding was carried over to 2018, with the remaining &euro;5.3 million liable for surrender.</p><p> The statement of the Accounting Officer on internal financial control discloses non-competitive procurement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of &euro;28.5 million worth of goods and services in 2017, included a significant level of procurement that was not compliant with public procurement rules.  This is a recurrent issue in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The statement on internal financial control also discloses significant financial and other risks faced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as the steps taken to address those risks.</p><p> Chapter 7 examined the systems in place to manage overtime spending in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In 2017, overtime payments totalled &euro;132 million or 12% of the overall Garda pay bill.  This level of spending was up to three times the level of spending on overtime in other police forces and three and a half times the overtime cost of &euro;38 million incurred by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2014.  In addition, actual expenditure exceeded the Estimate provision for overtime in each of the five years to 2017.  Excess spending on overtime was the main reason for the Supplementary Estimate in 2017.</p><p> Our review found that the management practices in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to control the overtime budget were ineffective.  We concluded that the data recording and collation systems in use were deficient.  While they record the basic information needed to authorise and support the correctness of the overtime payments, they failed to provide the basis for the analysis required to effectively deploy staff resources, monitor use and identify potential economies and efficiencies.  We also found that, while some measures had been introduced to curb overtime costs in the first half of 2018, there was no detailed plan for how the overtime bill could be substantially reduced and sustained.  When the report was being finalised, the Accounting Officer stated in response to this finding that several initiatives were currently being piloted that had the potential to achieve better control of overtime use.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee in this regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Drew Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#J00300"><p>I take my statutory function of Accounting Officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seriously.  I am strongly focused on ensuring that the public money invested in us is spent efficiently, effectively and appropriately.  As an organisation with a &euro;1.7 billion annual budget, it is vital that we collectively demonstrate that we are providing value for money.  For me, that means maximising our policing impact for the benefit of the public within the budget given to us by Government.  It is also critical that we spend public money in line with accounting and governance best practice.</p> <p>  I am strongly of the view that our budget is our budget.  Since I became Commissioner in September of last year I have continually stressed to managers at all levels of the organisation the need for us to stay within our budget.  This can best be seen in the reduction in discretionary and administrative overtime spend in last three months of 2018, a move which achieved substantial savings for the Exchequer.  The savings achieved by these measures have carried forward into 2019 as the actual spend for the first quarter of &euro;21.7 million is some &euro;6 million less than the corresponding quarter in 2018.  While we are largely on target for overtime spend, it requires constant monitoring and vigilance to ensure there is no slippage.  I met senior managers last week to stress this point to them again.  Even yesterday, I discussed budget matters with the Association of Garda Superintendents and Inspectors at length.  While these controls have had an impact on the delivery of policing, overtime is still available, especially for specific policing and security operations around organised crime and violent dissident republicans.</p> <p>  The introduction of mandatory 15 minute parading time is a significant proportion of the Garda overtime budget and is a fixed cost that I have no influence over at the moment.  For example, in 2019 approximately &euro;22 million of our overtime budget of &euro;95 million will be spent on the 15 minute parading time.  This effectively means that our real operational budget is only &euro;73 million.  There is also overtime associated with Garda members securing and attending courts, securing prisoners and escorting people from the country.  Again, these are regarded as non-discretionary activities.</p> <p>  In any event, for the proportion under our control we must ensure we stay within budget.  This means making hard choices and decisions.  For the 2017 accounts, and specifically the significant overspend on overtime in that year, there are several factors that contributed to this, such as the aforementioned mandatory 15 minute parading time as well as the major 24-7 policing resources required to protect lives and communities as a result of the outbreak of the vicious and ongoing gangland feuds.</p> <p>  I fully accept the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the effect that the 2017 overspend on overtime is not sustainable and demonstrated the need for stronger controls and governance as well as the requirement for modem systems to monitor same.  In addition to the controls we have already put in place we will address these issues through a number of additional measures.  The introduction of a roster and duty management system, which is being piloted in a Dublin division and will start rolling out across the organisation later this year, will improve our ability to plan, control and manage the deployment of personnel and consequently the expenditure on overtime.  This should result in savings in overtime through more effective and efficient resource allocation.  The full roll-out of this programme will not occur until the end of 2020.  Our new divisional policing model, which is currently being piloted in four divisions, includes a greater investment in Garda staff with financial expertise who can provide local management with better information and data on their overtime and other expenditure.  Our workforce plan will advance workforce modernisation and see us deploy our personnel where they are needed most, again leading to operational efficiencies.</p> <p>  Information and communications technology initiatives such as our investigation management system, which has started to roll-out, and our mobility project, which this year will enable approximately 2,000 garda&iacute; to access Garda systems remotely, will reduce the time garda&iacute; have to spend on paperwork and focus their times on policing activity.  The mobility project, in particular, can allow network connection to systems and, therefore, decrease the time spend in stations.  We have also committed in our 2019 policing plan to establishing a framework to provide for multi-annual budgeting and delegated sanctions.  Again, this will make it easier for local management to plan resource deployment based on the budgets available to them.</p> <p>  We have been provided with a large amount of taxpayers' money.  All of us in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have a duty to ensure this is spent wisely for the benefit of the public.  We are a public service and our spending should be focused on the public good in keeping people safe.</p></speech>

You made a timely reappearance.  I welcome all the witnesses.</p> <p>  I will start of by focusing on overtime and then will put some questions at the end with regard to the appropriation side of things.</p> <p>  There seems to have been a serious spike in overtime in 2017 by comparison with 2014.  Obviously, that was the year there was a pay deal for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was understandable.  However, the 2014 figure increased by three times in three years.  I understand 100% the position on the fixed costs of the Garda in respect of parading.  Will the Commissioner explain what that is?  Many people do not understand why that is necessary for every garda.  There are other fixed costs, which we understand the need for as well.  We often deal with accounts from different organisations, but to have a trebling in the space of three years in highly unusual.</p><p>Is there something specific to 2017 regarding the management of the agreed pay deal?  There was controversy at the time, references to blue flu and so forth.  Is there something specific that caused this?</p></speech>

In some ways, that is a fixed cost.  It will cost us around &euro;22 million this year.  As the number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na grows, that cost will continue to increase if the agreement on the 15 minutes stays in place.  That was a considerable cost in that year.  In addition, a rent allowance was built into salary in that year and also became pensionable.  That was added to the hourly rate so actual overtime became more expensive, in and of itself.  A one-time allowance became pay and that increased the hourly rate.  Those two factors contributed and also, as I said in my opening remarks, a vicious drugs feud which required an extraordinary response from the organisation was ongoing that year .  I will now ask Mr. Twomey to outline some of the operational impacts of that during the year in question.</p></speech>

At that particular time, the unit was based in each of the Garda regions outside of the DMR but, in response to the feud, we had to temporarily transfer people up from the country and into the city while we engaged in a process of recruiting, training and establishing a unit in the DMR.  That has since been established and there is now a permanent armed support unit in the DMR.  The feud was an emerging issue at that time and we took the decision to respond immediately.  That meant redeploying resources into the DMR on a temporary basis and this led to increased operational demand.  In addition, we had only begun the process of backfilling our national units and there was a shortage of staff in particular areas.  We had to supplement those staff because they were the ones who were actually investigating these serious crimes.  We also put additional resources into our drugs and organised crime bureau in the form of a special crime task force.  This also resulted in the need to temporarily transfer people from other areas.  They were the main operational issues that contributed to the spike in that year.</p></speech>

We all remember what was happening in the context of the drug-related feud at the time.  There was a request made to the Department of Justice and Equality for an additional &euro;44.2 million.  There was a great deal going on at that time and serious issues had arisen.  There is not one member of this committee who does not have friends or know people who are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the main, they are great, hardworking people and there were serious concerns around pay and conditions at that time.  Those issues were dealt with and that is not the point I am making.  We had an issue that was building from 2014 to 2017 and the overtime bill trebled in 2017.  In fairness, the Garda Commissioner has made comments on overtime in the past six months and has referred to the need to manage the budget.  The committee obviously respects that but the process by which we manage operational areas that are demand-led is important.  There are issues arising in Drogheda at the moment and Brexit has the potential to give rise to increases in demand.  This committee looks at expenditure retrospectively but we also look at processes.  How do we ensure that there will not be elasticity <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Department, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na submitting repeated requests for additional funding based on demand requirements?  Can we actually do that?  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na cannot predict what is going to happen next and neither can I.  How do we ensure that there are processes in place to ensure that additional expenditure is justifiable?  Overtime is necessary but there must be processes in place to prove that.</p><p>The information pack provided to us today shows that one garda earned &euro;76,000  in overtime.  Obviously, that is extraordinary and we understand that.  Once we know that the processes are in place to allow for elasticity, with the Department seeking supplementary budgets and so on, that is the key issue.  To see a trebling in three years is alarming although I respect what Mr. Twomey said by way of explanation.  There are issues arising in Drogheda at the moment but how do we ensure that there are processes in place to justify additional spending?</p></speech>

We are a growing organisation.  The budget is growing, as is the size of the organisation.  In overall numbers, our previous high point was in 2009.  When one adds Garda staff to the number of members of the force, we are now in excess of that high point.  We are as large as we have ever been and more expansion is planned.  It is for me to direct the priorities in terms of how we spend our money.  A lot of the overtime budget seems to get caught up in practices over which we have no discretion and that takes money away from the operational drive that I want from the overtime.  The 15-minute briefing time payment drains money from the overtime budget and effectively leaves us with between &euro;72 million and &euro;73 million for overtime.  That is considerably less flexibility than we had in 2017 in respect of budgets.</p> <p>  A lot of the documentation compares us with other jurisdictions but with respect, in other jurisdictions the police services no longer take on some of the duties which still fall very squarely on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and take up our overtime budget.  I refer to things like garda&iacute; escorting prisoners to and from courts, a practice which has been largely eradicated in other jurisdictions.  We are facing enormous pressures in terms of serious criminality and are having to supplement our policing effort to prevent serious crime.  At the moment, we obviously have a very difficult issue in terms of ongoing, vicious drug feuds.  In that context, it is up to me and members of my senior team to review how we are spending our money and determine whether it could be better spent.  We need to decide if things could be done differently or in a way which would not actually cost as much or consume as much overtime.  That is not just about things that we think we could divest ourselves of responsibility for but also the manner in which we take on other operations and adopting a different profile in respect of those.  There is a hierarchy of priorities in terms of how we spend our money.  We have to focus on serious criminality, particularly where lives are in danger and there is serious risk of harm.</p> <p>  The deputy Garda commissioner is engaged in a project at the moment involving a deep analysis of where our overtime budget is going.  In some divisions-----</p></speech>

I refer to last September because that is when I arrived.  July and August were good months in terms of the expenditure and bringing it under control.  We have managed on our rosters from September onwards to hit &euro;6.5 million to &euro;6.7 million, which gives us an outturn of approximately &euro;90 million.  That is our target.

In effect, members are detailed on it, and it is used when they come on and off duty.  It records their overtime and allowances, and it should manage their pay.  It will take quite a bit of paper out of the system and give us a daily view on where the expenditure is at any one time.  It will also indicate where money is being spent.  It will provide a good deal more information than we have at this moment.</p></speech>

That comes jumping out of this analysis.  We would highly recommend them.  Just dropping the hammer on a budget in a system that is so demand led seems to be a real issue.</p> <p>  There are a couple of other related points.  Having looked through this, I believe no public representative could fail to justify overtime that is necessary to protect people.  It is demand led.  We cannot sit here and say otherwise.  On the other side of the fence, we would say, "Lads, why are ye not doing something about all this?"  This is about the process of accountability.  I refer to the management information system Mr. Harris mentioned.  Divestment, civilianisation of certain components, and IT also jump out very much.  There seems to be a great deficiency in IT.  This is a message to go back to the Department.  We have seen this previously.  Capital investment in IT will result in multiple efficiencies and savings down the road and result in greater outcomes.  Take, for instance, the normal Garda sergeant or inspector affected by this.  At the end of a long day, he or she has to go back to a station in many cases to input data or do paperwork.  This is crazy in 2019.  I am trying to help the organisation here.  We all know garda&iacute;.  A garda doing a long shift, including community activities, might be late for training the lads because he or she has to go back to the station to do this, that and the other.  Surely in a couple of years, we will have to have a system whereby there will be handheld devices through which information can be dropped into the system.  They would have to be secure.</p> <p>  I come from an IT background.  Is there a plan?  First, the garda&iacute; have lives to live.  Second, bearing in mind the demand-led aspect in relation to what we just spoke about and the fact that hours change, there has to be some degree of certainty.  Circumstances are not being helped by the way garda&iacute; must do their duties at the end or beginning of a day or the way the handover between sergeants is carried out.  Is there a plan in place in this regard?  The need for a plan is glaringly obvious.</p></speech>

This year, 2,000 handheld devices or smartphones will be issued.  They will allow fast retrieval of information from our systems.  This will develop further in terms of being able to input information to resolve calls on the PULSE systems.  We want to get to a point where members are allowed to stay on the ground.  In this regard, we must consider our Garda information service.  We want a member of Garda staff to be able to take details from a member who phones in and do inputting as well.</p></speech>

Garda&iacute;, particularly those engaged in uniformed, high-visibility duties, should all have connectivity across the network.  That will be secure connectivity into the systems.  They will have the ability to ring in on an official phone and provide information.  In effect, we need the service centres to be able to take those calls.  It will keep garda&iacute; out on the ground as opposed to requiring them to come back to the station to fill out forms.  This is a laborious process.</p> <p>  I look to other initiatives we have.  We have the investigation management system.  The roll-out in this regard has started.  It will also take until the end of 2020.  In the next two years, the garda&iacute; on the ground will see good investment to make their lives easier and work more efficient in terms of connectivity and their ability to input data once instead of filling out several forms, etc.</p></speech>

When it is dealt with, I will move on to a couple of questions on appropriation.  The questions jump around a little.</p><p>Garda sergeants and inspectors are covered.  What was the position <i>pro rata </i>in 2017, in particular?  At higher ranks, there were serious scheduled workloads because of the year that was in it.  <i>Pro rata</i>, how was this dealt with as regards remuneration for the additional workload for the individuals concerned?

It was a very simple question.  To refresh, multi-annual budgets, IT and civilianisation are critical to the issues we just spoke about.</p> <p>  Let me deal with a few other issues.  In the appropriation accounts, there are capital commitments issues concerning Galway and Kevin Street.  There seems to be a pattern as regards what happened in respect of both.  Could that be explained?  What has been learned?  Could the Commissioner state whether there are learnings from this regarding other stations the Garda might wish to open in the future?  The nature of policing is such that it will go a bit half-circular again as regards the need for community policing.  Are there any learnings from those two specific projects?  Mr. Nugent will probably answer that question.</p></speech>

It is hard to walk away from that.  I would always say that we would have an engagement with OPW about this because it has a lot of that expertise in the delivery of such big projects.</p> <p>  There is probably another part for us around the maintenance and smaller works within the estate as opposed to those big capital rebuild-type projects.

Concentrating in effect just on probationer garda&iacute; coming out of Templemore does have an operational impact because they need to be mentored.  They need a lot of supervision and support in their first six months, then for the next two years and in subsequent years as well.  It takes time.  I felt we were reaching a point of saturation and so easing back to 600 this year, which is still a considerable number, but concentrating on the displacement of experienced garda&iacute; from tasks that Garda staff can take on, was the priority for this year.  In effect it was also required to meet the Government targets for the make-up of the organisation.</p></speech>

I wish to emphasise that they have to be solutions that will work for the community.  Social contracts have been made with the people there regarding facilities.  Given the kinds of facilities in the Garda College, there needs to be goodwill towards the community.  There needs to be some give and take with where the training college is.

We have deliberately not gone into that in order to resolve the other issues, to be respectful exactly as the Deputy has said.  I hear what he is saying on engagement with the community.  We wanted to deal with the other issues first and at that point in time we will have a respectful peace, making sure that the interests of the State are protected while, at the same time, making sure that social contract with Templemore is not completely ignored.</p></speech>

It was very hard not to keep there.</p> <p>  This is my final question.  When I was Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government a number of years ago, I carried out a pilot programme to provide funding for CCTV infrastructure in a number of locations.</p><p>It took a long time for that to be done.  I am a strong supporter of such measures, particularly in the case of high-powered vehicles travelling on motorways.  The media highlighted the need for such infrastructure in Littleton, County Tipperary, which was experiencing particular difficulties due to its location.  CCTV cameras were also installed in Birdhill and Burgess.  There have always been issues in respect of data management.  The public does not understand why it takes so long.  I encourage the Commissioner to work with local authorities.  There should be some give and take regarding data management because what it would give to the Garda and the peace of mind it would give to communities is worth vastly more than the time it has taken to resolve the matter.  I am not apportioning blame, there are probably issues on both sides.  We need to ensure that there is a process in place, that we stick to it and that it is used throughout the country.</p></speech>

We would like there to be more CCTV in some very difficult areas.  We look forward to making submissions regarding legislation to enable further use of static CCTV - particularly that which allows for automatic number plate recognition - and using it to prevent and detect crime.  There is a lot of other technology that can be brought to bear.  Average speed cameras that record a vehicle's speed over a distance rather than at one point would be an effective response in the context of road safety, particularly on major roads - other than motorways - that are blighted by serious road traffic collisions.</p></speech>

There is a significant amount of which to be proud in the context of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Many members are currently canvassing on doorsteps.  I have seen at first hand the significant work being done in community policing in order to gain the trust of communities and work with them, especially in my town of Mullingar.  All members agree that we need more bodies on the ground.  It is amazing to see the great work that is being done.  It shows the spirit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Last week, I encountered a very sick child on my travels.  A community officer, Garda Blake, was calling to see him on his way home from his shift because the boy is fascinated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That brings home the significant work being done in fostering communities and community spirit.  Community garda&iacute; cannot be supported enough in the good work they do.  I wish the Commissioner well in his role and I wish all his team continued success.</p> <p>  On the number of drivers who have been disqualified on foot of court orders or through the Courts Service compared with the number of licences that have been surrendered, does the Commissioner have confidence in how the process is working?  Is it operating as prescribed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Drew Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#N00500"><p>My understanding is that it is not working as we would wish.  The majority of disqualified drivers are retaining their licences and that is not good.  It is a road safety issue.  In effect, people are evading the justice meted out to them.  We need systems to deal with this issue.  One such system is the active mobility project to which I referred.  If a driver produces his or her licence to a garda who has this device and the garda takes a picture of it, the device will immediately tell the garda whether the driver is allowed on the road or is disqualified.  Part of the solution is the application of modern technology and the transmission of information onto our PULSE system in order to ensure that it is up to date such that members on the ground can have access to accurate information and be able to follow through on enforcement.</p></speech>

That is alarming.  The response to a parliamentary question I tabled indicates that only 6% of disqualified drivers surrendered their licences over the eight-year period from 2011.  The rate was 7% in 2012 and 9% in 2013.  During the eight-year period in question, only 11% of 83,000 disqualified drivers surrendered their licences, which implies that the remainder are still driving on our roads.  Some 7% of fatal accidents are caused by disqualified drivers and, over the period, a number of fatalities have occurred.  What is the process under which a person who commits a crime and goes to court or is otherwise disqualified from driving is allowed to retain his or her licence?</p></speech>

Several prosecutions were taken in this regard and certain difficulties and challenges arose.  Work has been done in the past couple of years to streamline and improve the process.  We are hopeful and confident that we will see improvements in this area.  The most important aspect from our perspective is that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who encounter these people at the side of the road have access to the relevant information at that time in order to enable them to take the appropriate action.  The Commissioner has outlined how that issue will be addressed.</p></speech>

Do our guests agree that the situation has reached crisis point?  If 89% of disqualified drivers are still driving and carrying their licences, that is a crisis for the administration of justice.</p></speech>

This matter needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  There are two processes to deal with it.  The first is ensuring that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the side of the road have access to the appropriate information at that time.  In all of these issues, there are processes that take time to implement.  We outlined earlier how that matter is being addressed through the issuing of 2,000 mobile phones this year.</p></speech>

We previously reported to the committee that we took several prosecutions in respect of that issue.  As part of that process, we identified some of the areas that have since been addressed in terms of process and by the provision of an offence code by the Director of Public Prosecutions to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  All of those issues have been addressed.  The process of a licence being surrendered to the licensing authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na then being notified, or it being brought to court and surrendered there, is very complicated.</p></speech>

The number has hovered between 6% and 19%.  It seems to have decreased again because the figure for 2018 was 13%.  Even if we allow for an appeals process whereby someone wins an appeal and is taken off the disqualified list, the figures are still very high.  They are drastic in the context of what they say about the administration of justice through our Road Traffic Acts and how they are enforced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda must be hugely concerned.</p></speech>

Our assistant commissioner for roads policing, Mr. David Sheahan, is putting together specific action points on this.  I ask that we be permitted to write to the committee to explain the position further.  Part of it is about public information and another part relates to further enforcement.  We mentioned mobile devices, smartphones and their scanning ability, and this year we are concentrating them on roads policing.  Road policing members who are most likely to encounter individuals breaking the road traffic laws will be those with the appropriate equipment.  We are aiming at having 2,000 by the end of the year.  This means that dozens of them are going out every week.  This will make a difference in terms of enforcement.  Mr. Sheahan has other thoughts about what we should do, particularly in the context of how we might present these matters in court.  I ask that we be permitted to come back with more detail.  We regard this as an area of concern and people are flouting and abusing the criminal process.</p></speech>

There is the main Garda tax number and entity that is the Sportsfield Company has its own tax number.  The main issue in the context of tax compliance related to the operation of the restaurant and associated facilities within the college and not by Sportsfield.  The main Garda tax number applied in this regard.  As stated, we are very close, I hope, to finalising the issue.

I accept that there are not many companies that supply certain services the Garda procures.  However, there were 128 contracts in play in 2017.  There seems to be a significant increase in the number of contracts and they were worth  &euro;28,478,271.</p></speech>

This will take out half of the spend.  The major areas of difficulty we continue to have are in the provision of towing services, where there have been legal challenges in the past which have delayed us putting in place procurement although we still have a requirement to deliver services, and medical services where, in parts of the country, there are GPs who do not want to enter any contractual arrangement with us.  Unfortunately, we will continue with reasonably large numbers of contracts.  Our job is to try to reduce the monetary value of these contracts to the greatest extent possible.  As stated, I believe the IT issues will be resolved this year so I do not see it as being an issue in 2019.  This will take &euro;11 million or &euro;12 million from the figure referenced by the Deputy.</p></speech>

We work a five-unit, five-shift system that allows for overlaps.  Part of this is so briefing and debriefing can take place during a normal tour of duty and there is no requirement for overtime.  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland requires us to look at rosters and at some of the allowance and pay issues.  Once this area of work is opened up we can look at what we have in terms of these residual issues.  The roster itself is pretty inflexible and costs money.  I require a roster that is operationally effective and gives us greater numbers.  At times, it might create demand but it should also have some flexibility, within reasonable parameters, for management to direct members.</p></speech>

The &euro;22 million drain on our overtime is not sustainable and we want to move quickly on it.  We also want to move quickly on having a further look at the rosters that apply in the organisation and address them.  This will address some of our overtime issues.  I can ask for a roster that delivers operationally against the demands we have from the public for our services.</p></speech>

A few years ago, I compiled information because I wanted to get an overview of the spread of the force because I felt my area was not doing particularly well.  The replies to many parliamentary questions showed that areas that had grown in population are at the low end of the ratio of police to population, with Meath being the worst since the previous census of population and Kildare is next.  The areas we tend to see are Wexford, Laois, Offaly and areas with substantial population growth over a period of time where the resources do not keep pace.  Is there any evidence the overtime budget in these areas is higher than it is in areas with a better ratio of garda&iacute; to population?</p></speech>

Sometimes population growth does not mean that demand will increase in proportion with it.  Populations can be quite settled and law abiding.  It does not necessarily flow that we need to provide resources.  </p><p> The Deputy raised a point about overtime.  Much of it is concentrated in critical areas.  Inevitably, it has meant a greater concentration in the city, but we have had to readdress it because of the feuds in counties Meath and Louth.</p></speech>

If the ratio of population to garda&iacute; was the same around the country as it is in, say, County Meath and County Kildare, there could be 4,500 fewer.  I say that with tongue in cheek, but that is the magnitude of the disparity.  It is a very low ratio.  The last Commissioner acknowledged that that was the case and gave an assurance that it would be rectified following the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore for recruitment and that there would be a higher proportion of garda&iacute; allocated to areas with that profile.  There must be a balance struck with experience, as I appreciate.</p></speech>

If there is a dependence on overtime to fill a need, it is a more expensive and reactive solution.

Until now, the distribution has been pretty even.  We built up numbers in the northern region, the Border region, more than in other areas.  In the future we will see a concentration on the northern region, plus the Dublin metropolitan region, because numbers in these regions have fallen behind.  At the same time, ours is an expanding organisation; therefore, there should be more garda&iacute; everywhere.</p> <p>  We are going through process of the civilianisation and modernisation of our workforce which will see the displacement of a further 500 garda&iacute;.  The actual increase in the size of the operational footprint this year is in the order of 800 members, which is significant.  We  should see the impact of this everywhere.  We are more than happy to provide Garda staff in County Meath and other areas and displace Garda members from roles within stations into operational duties, where possible.</p> <p>  The importance of visibility has been made clear to me on a number of occasions because people want to see garda&iacute;.  As we build our new divisional policing model, an important and central aspect of it will be community policing, of which a local connection and visibility are important parts.</p></speech>

The aim is to grow the force to 15,000 members by 2021.  There are retirements, as well as the intake, to take into account.  It is easy to see the intake, but from the outside it is not as easy to evaluate the level of retirements.  Is the 15,000 figure achievable?  Is the overtime bill likely to go down if the numbers come up?</p></speech>

Logic suggests the overtime bill should come down, but practice has shown that members create overtime because they detect offences and go to court.  We have briefing time built in, something about which we have talked.  Inevitably, operational members create overtime.  It is the frictional overtime needed to operate as a business.  I need to look at where else we can cut overtime, where people can be redeployed and how we can change our operational profile.  That is a task for me in how I prioritise expenditure.</p> <p>  I have just been provided with figures for Kildare.  There has been an increase of 63 members between 2010 and 2019.</p></speech>

I have the figures for nearly every year.  It is much appreciated that we end up with additional garda&iacute;.  I do not want to be overly parochial, but Kildare is significantly behind other areas with similar populations.  County Meath lags even further behind and the numbers are moving backwards as the population is growing.  It is noticed and appreciated when additional garda&iacute; are provided because we appreciate how stretched the organisation is.</p> <p>  I will move on to something in the appropriation account because our time is limited.  Can the Commissioner take us through how the voluntary disclosure to the Revenue Commissions occurred and the extent of it?</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Harris and wish him well in his role.  Unfortunately, we have had a high turnover of Garda Commissioners and Ministers for Justice and Equality, and much of that was down to cultural and organisational issues we had in an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as I am sure Mr. Harris is aware.  We are hoping the changes that were promised are being delivered, and some of my questions will be in that vein.</p> <p>  I want to start by picking up on the last point Mr. Harris raised in relation to ICT and the investment over the last five years.  Mr. Harris said he wants a far more efficient process and that there may be an over-reliance on paperwork at times.  Broadband is a big topical issue, as I am sure Mr. Harris is aware, and as late as 2017, 111 out of the 563 operational Garda stations did not have access to broadband.  Has that improved, and do the witnesses have an up-to-date figure on how many, at this point in time, do not have access to broadband?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.256" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joseph Nugent" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019050900002#Q00700"><p>I believe the figure is something in the order of 50 at this point.  We are talking here primarily about stations that have very short opening hours, so first getting broadband into those stations, and second leaving equipment of a secure nature resident in them has been a challenge.  We have worked with our colleagues in the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer to bring out different solutions and we have put something new in place which will allow us to move faster in addressing those issues.  The Commissioner talked about the mobility project, which for a garda is about having a phone with the power of a very fast PC and being able to dock that in a station using a keyboard, mouse, and screen as if he or she were working on a PC.  It has proved very successful in the pilot we have up and running and we expect to have another 20 or so of those dealt with very shortly.</p></speech>

That would be warmly welcomed by this committee because it is our core function, but I imagine he would also put the same emphasis on his responsibility in relation to transparency, good governance and accountability.  In that vein, GSOC raised concerns in relation to its authority yesterday or the day before.  I am assuming that Mr. Harris understands why GSOC was established in the first instance and what its role is.  It is independent.  It said it was unable to ensure there was proper oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In fact, it said it was impossible for a number of reasons.  One reason was that it finds out about issues from the media, and not directly from the appropriate channels, and the other was that the supposed lines of communication and reporting within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself was problematic.  Given that Mr. Harris takes his responsibility seriously, I assume he is concerned that that is GSOC's impression and view of its ability to do its job independently.  Can Mr. Harris respond to that?</p></speech>

Collectively, we need to pool our resources to make sure we are rooting out wrongdoing, inappropriate behaviour, criminality.  There is a way of working through this, and I do not think in any shape or form we are at opposite ends of the argument about this.</p></speech>

Mr. Harris might have a different perspective, but GSOC is the independent body and it took a lot for it to come out and say in the very clear, stark terms it did that proper oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is impossible because of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself.  I am assuming that would be concerning to Mr. Harris and if he does not agree with it, that he would want to establish why it has that view of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

As Commissioner, I too have a heavy responsibility for the conduct and behaviour of the organisation, up to and including criminality that members may engage in.  I have a duty and responsibility to root that out as well, and I want to work with the oversight and investigations body, which is GSOC, in doing that.  There is no argument on my part.  I know that we have informed GSOC of major investigations that we are engaged in, and it has written to us about streamlining other processes and we can do that in the form of a regular case conference about serious matters that are progressing.  All these things are achievable within the present legislative framework, because it is just a matter of sharing information.</p></speech>

Yesterday, Mr. Harris made reference to the setting up of an anti-corruption unit, which on the face of it looks like the Garda investigating the Garda.  Did Mr. Harris have any engagement with GSOC in relation to the establishment of that unit?  Has he formally met with GSOC and sought its views, and if so, what were its views in relation to the powers and responsibilities that unit would have?</p><p>As we have seen from the Morris tribunal report and other stories of cultural difficulties within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, independent oversight is the most valuable tool we have.  Is the anti-corruption unit a case of garda&iacute; investigating garda&iacute;?</p></speech>

I have a responsibility.  I am proactively asking the organisation what is going on, or if people have issues with individuals with whom they work.  It involves drug testing where there is a suspicion surrounding individuals and in the case of persons in high risk positions such as those who carry firearms or are in charge of high speed pursuit vehicles.  These are common practices in other police services and we want to introduce them as a way of ensuring there is integrity within the organisation.

Consulting GSOC was something the Garda should have done before establishing the unit.  The serious issues GSOC has raised in recent days add to my belief.</p> <p>  I spoke to the Chairman about a particular case in advance of the meeting.  I do not want to name an individual, even though it is a case that was in the public domain and before the courts before being dropped.  A young woman, a civilian who worked in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, was arrested in connection with an alleged fraud related to sick leave.

The investigation was well founded and reported to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which examined the matter and found the case fit for prosecution.  It went through an investigative process and an external examination by the prosecution authority which found the facts to be sufficient to state there was a criminal case to be answered.</p></speech>

Michael Clifford covered the story in the the <i>Irish Examiner</i>and wrote that disturbing questions arose in the case.  The individual in question had made a complaint of bullying within Store Street Garda station and, within three weeks of making the complaint, was arrested because of her sick leave.  Notwithstanding what Mr. Harris said about how the case was investigated, the charges were dropped in court.  As the case fell apart, it raises questions.  A lot of people would ask how an individual could be arrested before going through normal HR processes.  It is all the more peculiar that the individual in question had made a complaint of bullying.  The garda&iacute; who arrested her were known to her, which is not in line with international practice.  Is the Commissioner of a mind to personally examine the elements of the case that are in the public domain?</p></speech>

My three years in the D&aacute;il have been bookended by two reports.  It began with the O'Higgins report, which I read in detail, and the Charleton report.  There have been serious issues with accountability.  These accounts are being considered within this background.  There are significant financial risks.</p> <p>  My first question relates to the audit process.  We are aware that the internal process prior to this was not really allowed to do its functions, certainly in respect of Templemore and issues emerged.  As the Accounting Officer, can Mr. Harris tell the committee that the internal audit function and the audit committee is functioning, is meeting regularly and that everything is in order?</p></speech>

At this point we do not know it that has happened but Mr. Harris will come back to the committee on that.</p> <p>  On page 21 there is reference to Garda masts, which is an income receipt that has jumped significantly.  Presumably it is an income for the Garda, but what is it? It has gone from &euro;523,000 to &euro;1.5 million.  Someone might come back to me with that clarification and I will continue on if the committee does not mind.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the Galway station, in which I would have a particular interest, and the Kevin Street Garda station, where we have a very new and welcome Garda station.  I will not go in a parochial direction on this but there were significant changes and significant costs.  As with the national children's hospital and lots of other projects, why was this not foreseen?  Page 15 informs us that amendments were made to the original design that required structural works and in addition, there were other design changes to meet requirements of the Garda and so on.  Could somebody come back with a note on this? Was there a competitive procurement process in the beginning?  What happened after that and what was the cost increase?  I am thinking of the children's hospital situation where a price was given and then changed.  It appears that some issues can arise in a project but it depends on what the changes are, why they were not foreseen and why elements were not included in the original design.  A passing comment on this is that I have no idea why the Galway station came out so close to the road.  I could not let this pass without making a comment on it.  There is absolutely no room for a bus route.  It is a terrible pinch point.  That is just a practical matter.</p> <p>  The witnesses will come back to the committee with two notes on my points.</p></speech>

I will follow up with the Office of Public Works about the other matter.</p> <p>  Going back to reputation and the lovely word "learnings" - a word I detest because I do not know what it means - I want to discuss fixed penalty charges and the breath tests.  It is in the Garda report as a significant risk to reputation and a significant risk financially.  Where are we with that?  The notes tell us that so many cases were taken.  On page 5 there is the reference to fixed charge notices.  There was an examination of the summonses and 146,865 cases were found to have committed offences and this was incorrect.  Before I move on to the update on appeals, will the witnesses remind us again what was incorrect about the summonses?</p></speech>

Some of them did not make it to court, in some cases the summons was not served and some cases were still pending and before the courts at that time.  There was a variety of responses accounting for those.  What we know is that 14,000 were concluded in the courts.

I think 2,200 have been done to date.  We have issued letters to all those people and a number of them have been returned unserved because people have moved from those addresses.

What we have found is that, in many cases where we have written to people, we have got no response.  We then have to go to the next step, which is a personal call to these people.  Where others come back unserved, we have another process.  It is quite time-consuming.  We are talking about large numbers.  I mentioned that 4,843 letters were returned by An Post as unserved.  They were all then sent out to local district officers to begin that individual process.  In other cases, there was a considerable number of people who did not respond at all to the letter they got as to whether they wanted to appeal or not.  Separate to that again, we have brought the 2,200 through the courts and we have another 2,000 scheduled to go through the courts.</p></speech>

However, there has to be an end to it and there has to be an update.  What is it costing in terms of manpower and womanpower and in terms of the cost of the legal eagles?  Let us have an update on that.</p> <p>  On the breath tests and the hugely significant discrepancy, which I will not go back over as that is a matter of record, where are we in that regard?  What improvements have been made?  Has the Garda reconciled its data with the data recorded on the machines?</p></speech>

We have made the necessary changes to ensure that does not happen again.  We have far tighter record control around our systems and how we record breath tests.  This is all part of ongoing examination of all records to improve the accuracy of data.

Is that a policy for the future or is it something at which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is looking?  What kind of costs would be involved?  We see reports about it in the newspapers.  Body cameras are used by other police forces, particularly those in England.  The Garda Representative Association would be very anxious that this would come on stream for many reasons, including those relating to safety, proof and witnesses.

We need legislation to do that.  That legislation is being worked through and is one of the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  When we look to purchase equipment, one of the issues for us that we will be issuing smartphones, which have a video facility.  Rather than buy another camera, we may use the existing mobile phones we have issued.  Regarding the costs, we must decide what way we are going to go with these but we have some time in that the legislation must be passed as well.  If we are doing an out-run of 10,000-odd smartphones on which people can record video, that may be an alternative rather than buying a bespoke camera.  I want that examined.  Up to-----</p></speech>

This can be not only some form of confrontation but, more importantly, it can also be a first report of domestic abuse and a serious sexual assault.  In addition, in contentious situations, it can provide GSOC with an independent eyewitness to the whole event.  It has been very useful in vindicating police officers in other jurisdictions regarding the manner in which they have behaved.  I know the Garda Representative Association is attracted to it for that reason.  It has been spoken about formally by neighbouring associations.  It does ease the pressure on individual members whenever they are complained about because they know that a record of the event exists.  Beyond that, there are very strong protection reasons.  It can make a real difference in policing sensitive areas.</p></speech>

I am speaking in particular about Kilkenny because two motorways go through Kilkenny and Carlow and there are many robberies that I would call fly-by-night robberies.  They come from Dublin or Limerick.  It is obvious they have some knowledge.  They come off the motorways and it takes 20 to 30 minutes.  They have done it in Urlingford and north Kilkenny several times.  They go on to the motorway and are back before the garda&iacute; even know they are back in Dublin or some big city where they can hide.  I have asked the Minister for Justice and Equality several times about CCTV.  What is the Commissioner's opinion on using CCTV on junctions off motorways?  Will it be provided in the future?</p></speech>

There is a need to have the correct software and for an office that can analyse the data.  It is not always possible to know the plate number.  All that might be known is a description of the vehicle, such as the car being a black Ford Focus.  The system needs to be able to look for a black Ford Focus moving on the motorway at the time.</p></speech>

Such technology would, however, make a significant contribution to crime prevention and detection.  There is a pattern of crime gangs obtaining vehicles and not moving them for some months.  They reappear some time later.  The ANPR system can be programmed to identify those patterns also; therefore, it has significant benefits.  It has to be targeted at where we think the most benefits will be reaped in crime prevention and detection.</p></speech>

It allows for oversight and is a framework a garda can use in conducting his or her investigation against specific crime types.  It will also allow us more information on who is offending and where the offences are happening.  That will be good in our analytical work.  We can also see and inspect problems such as car insurance fraud and set-up accidents.  The Garda investigation management system will be a national system once it is fully rolled out.  It will identify people who are very unlucky in their driving and have 20 accidents a year.  It will also identify cars which are very unlucky and involved in a dozen accidents a year.

The budget constraints stem from my responsibility, as Accounting Office, to stay within the figure of &euro;1.76 billion.  That is the way that I cut up the pie.

We have all read about the complaints from GSOC in the stories which have appeared in the newspapers this week.  What is the relationship like?  Is it good?  Is there good interaction?  The ombudsman is supposed to look at what is happening in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but the reports in the newspapers did not sound good.  They made for very bad reading.</p></speech>

For my part, and that of my senior team, we very much want to work hand-in-hand with GSOC.  None of us wants to see any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engaged in any form of wrongdoing.  We want to see public complaints properly investigated and brought to conclusion as expeditiously as possible.  We are determined to ensure that those who engage in criminality, inappropriate associations, the use of drugs and so on are proactively investigated and combatted.

There is wrongdoing in every force and walk of life that needs to be weeded out.

Many of the investigations that are taken forward are successful and they are brought to a proper conclusion in terms of bringing matters before the courts.  That work continues.   I know that GSOC has been informed of that work and work that is ongoing as well.</p></speech>

My first question follows on from Deputy Aylward's remarks in regard to deployment.  I read much of the Commissioner's commentary regarding his plans to redeploy individuals from desk duties to front-line positions.  What percentage of garda&iacute; have been and are yet to be redeployed?</p></speech>

The upper limit which has been set for me is 4,000.  When we reach a strength of 15,000 garda, 4,000 staff and 2,000 garda reserves, we will need to take stock and recalibrate because there may be more that can be done.  My responsibility in terms of budget is to maximise the policing impact such that when we reach a strength of 15,000 garda plus 4,000 staff that proportion may have to change further.</p></speech>

On appropriations-in-aid, Garda College receipts, the issues of the Sportsfield, shops, boat clubs and so on were the subject of previous discussions but there are a few outstanding issues on which I would like clarification.  There were European funds in a bank account, which I understand were for training purposes.  If I am not mistaken, these funds may not have been appropriately accounted for at the time of our review approximately two years ago.  I welcome that the recommendations following on from that review were taken on board and are being worked through.  Is the Commissioner, as Accounting Officer, satisfied that the aforementioned funds have been accounted for appropriately?  I appreciate the Commissioner does not represent OPW but to the best of his knowledge, what is the reason for the delay in the transfer of lands from Sportsfield to OPW?</p> <p>  In regard to the internal audit, I am not an accountant but during the six years I was a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and during my time as a member of this committee, I have observed a lot of indecision and uncertainty around this area.  I get the distinct impression that the resources provided at that time to internal audit by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was not sufficient to meet the task at hand, primarily because it was such a mountain to climb.</p><p>In his role as the new Garda Commissioner since last year, is Mr. Harris satisfied that internal audit and the oversight function within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is sufficiently robust to ensure the issues highlighted to this committee and others over recent years will not reoccur?  Perhaps we will start with the two questions I asked of Mr. Nugent regarding the European funds.</p></speech>

I have taken a particular interest in internal audit.  It is essential to me in carrying out my responsibilities as Accounting Officer.  I would like a greater emphasis on thematic work.  We are working through what that might look like.  We pick an area of policing business and look at the risks in that area and how they are being addressed.  We are not just dealing with financial matters, but with operational risks.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a policing body and policing is a risk business.  Identify those risks and dealing with them is a very important part of risk management and internal audit.  The two things are on the same continuum.  There is more to be done and more I would like to see done but, as I have said, I have made sure that the committee knows it has my full support.

It is intended to roll out the new system to every other Garda division.  It serves two primary functions and relates to the effective deployment of our resources.  It allows us have full line of sight on our existing resources at any one time but is also a very important planning tool.  There are many events coming up and there are many peaks and troughs in demand.  This system gives us the ability to plan more efficiently and effectively for those.</p></speech>

I was going to ask whether existing vehicles would be retrofitted but the Commissioner has answered that question in referencing the reduction in cost relating to new vehicles coming in.  To touch upon the CCTV element of what Deputy Aylward referred to in respect of motorways and general streetscapes, would ANPR technology which is not vehicle-mounted be cost-effective or beneficial to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Can it be retrofitted to existing traffic cameras across the road network?  Does the Commissioner believe it would be beneficial to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in carrying out its duties?</p></speech>

It requires a camera to be connected to the appropriate software.  If we look at the amount of gangland violence that involves people driving backwards and forwards when perpetrating serious crime, it is clear that the technology would be useful.  It would also be significant with regard to the considerable effort we put into the prevention and detection of burglary through Operation Thor.  It can be of great assistance in any circumstances in which criminals are using vehicles.  It does not always have to involve a permanent fixture.  Temporary cameras can be put in place from which information can be drawn via the 4G network.  There are many things we can do but the legal position is a little unclear.  We must be very careful that any ANPR camera does not inadvertently take images of drivers or passengers.</p></speech>

Diversification of the force is a very important part of the Commissioner's new role.  I do not refer to gender alone, but also to race and background.  My constituency is in Dublin metropolitan region north for Garda purposes.  A few years back 105 nations were represented in my local authority area.  Is that something about which the Commissioner thinks in the recruitment process?  Is diversity in this area something he actively seeks to achieve?</p></speech>

That has been illustrated in part by the uniform changes we have introduced in respect of hijab and the turban.</p><p>That is illustrative of how welcoming we want to be to the diversification of the organisation.  It is important to us because our society is becoming increasingly diverse.  It is critical for us to reflect that diversity in order to continue to enjoy the level of community support and confidence we enjoy at present.  This can be done in a number of ways.  This relates to sworn officers and all other Garda staff, including the members of the Garda Reserve.</p></speech>

Why did the Commissioner not transfer into a Garda vehicle?  Were there firearms on board the PSNI vehicle?  I presume this was a close protection vehicle and, therefore, it is likely that there were firearms on board.  Is that par for the course in the interaction we have with the PSNI?  I ask the Commissioner to clarify these matters for me.</p></speech>

Like other police services, we have ongoing responsibility for the protection of individuals who visit Ireland.  Sometimes that involves personnel being authorised to carry firearms within the State.  That has been reported on in recent weeks as well.  There is variety in my own movements and my own security.  That requires personnel from both organisations to cross the Border at times.  I would say that, habitually, it is more a case of personnel crossing into the North.</p></speech>

According to the second briefing note that was provided to the committee, it is proposed to allocate just &euro;11.5 million for 2019.  The 2018 provisional outturn was &euro;23.5 million, but the budget for this year is just &euro;11.5 million.  That is a significant decrease in the training and development budget.

I am not just talking about members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; I am also talking about teachers and nurses, etc.  Everybody who deals with the public, including Deputies and Senators, should have such training.  I know the HSE runs these courses free of charge.  There is not even an expense on it.  Obviously, there is an issue around how we train so many people.  I would appreciate it if we could get some figures.</p> <p>  The other area of interest to me is the drug units.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na probably deals with drugs in two separate ways.  First, it deals operationally with the major players in the drugs trade.  Second, many addicts come into contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, unfortunately, and they may have drugs on them for personal use.  Most drugs convictions fall into that category.  In recent years, there have been more and more fatalities from heroin overdoses.</p><p>I wonder if the rank and file who would be the type of people who deal with addicts daily have any training in the provision of Narcan or Naloxone, if they came across someone who had overdosed?</p></speech>

We would be reliant on the medical services.  While our people are trained in some basic first aid, they are not trained in anything more specific.  Some of our firearms units and national units would have some further enhanced training but as a general rule the principle is that when we come across a medical condition we engage the services of the HSE as they are the professionals in that particular area.  While we have some basic core understanding, we rely on the professionals.</p></speech>

Although I do not have figures for the numbers of people who may or may not have been saved, in my area in Cork there are pharmacies which provide the service.  They have trained pharmacists, particularly those who distribute the methadone programme.  Occasionally someone may take the methadone inside the pharmacy and then overdose outside the door and the pharmacists have that training.  At least members of the force who are on the beat would have some level of training in this.  The more people who are trained in it and the more people who can distribute Narcan benefits addicts if garda&iacute; come across an overdose.</p></speech>

Our people are always conscious of what the people they encounter face.  There is an important demarcation between the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing and that of the health services.  It is a balance that we must be very conscious of and careful about.  We can consider it further but there are professionals in this area and it is very specific.  We must be careful of extending the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into this area.</p></speech>

In some areas we have upwards of 25 people and in others we have 12.  We start off with a base unit of 12 people.  Depending on demand being greater than that, we have double that.  It depends on a case by case basis.

In community policing, is the number of community garda&iacute; increasing, decreasing or is it demand-led?  In areas such as my own they work really well.

We have provided increased resources in those specific areas.  As the organisation is growing, a core principle is that we have a community policing ethos.  In certain cases where the demand is such that we need people in that role specifically and full time, then that is provided.  However, in other areas where it is possible to provide a full range of services that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provide, that is done in a slightly different way.  Where people are deployed depends on the environment but the intention is that there will be community garda&iacute; throughout the entire country.  Community policing is a core ethos of the organisation.  The Deputy referred to working in partnership with people and having developed and built that relationship to provide the opportunity for our people to engage with local communities in a problem-solving type approach.  It is not just about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is about a partnership with other agencies and people.</p></speech>

Sometimes we kind of forget that.  I am sure that garda&iacute; face the same stresses and pressures as any other member of the public.  How big are mental health issues within the force?  Obviously, if a garda goes through a very traumatic experience, I am sure that there are counselling services in place to help deal with that but, in terms of general mental health, are counsellors provided if a member just wants to speak to somebody if they are feeling depressed?</p></speech>

Part of our work this year in delivering the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland will be to further examine our well-being strategy for all our employees, both Garda staff and members to ensure that it is a healthy place to work.  Additional resources will be made available to the chief medical officer in relation to the staff he has available to him.</p> <p>  We very much recognise the stresses and strains and the toll that can take on people both professionally and personally, and also on their families.  We want to be in a position to offer as much support as we can.  Prevention is better than cure when it comes to providing early support to individuals.  </p></speech>

To echo what the Commissioner and the Deputy said, the 24-7 counselling service is a confidential service provided by an outside party.

It is not a huge number.  Given the weekend that is in it and the Darkness into Light events that are taking place around the country, it is timely to tell members of the Garda that the service is available.  It provides opportunities to have counselling delivered directly to them without engagement with the organisation.  We encourage all our members and staff to use the service.</p></speech>

Obviously there are certain professions or vocations such as the Garda where people might be uneasy about speaking about these issues internally because, regardless of whether we like it, there is still a stigma attached to mental health and I am sure the stigma within the Garda is no different.</p></speech>

It is one of the questions I omitted but it is probably the most important in the context of the budget.  I am Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, which has oversight of Oberstown.  One of the main consumers of overtime is the transfer of children on remand or in detention to courts.  When they are in detention it involves An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and when they are on remand it involves Oberstown staff.  There has to be a better way of doing that.</p></speech>

I wished to highlight it in this forum because of a conversation I had in the past with Mr. Patrick Bergin, the director of Oberstown, in consultation with Inspector Twomey in Balbriggan.  Perhaps that can be examined because it is important.  If there is a better way of doing it we should investigate it and implement it.</p></speech>

Page 25 refers to compensation and legal costs.  During the year in question the compensation awards were &euro;9.8 million and the legal costs associated with that were almost two thirds of that figure at &euro;6 million.  There is a heading included that refers to civilian claims by members of the public arising from actions of garda&iacute; in the performance of their duties.  There are 196 cases.  The compensation award was &euro;1.8 million but the legal costs were &euro;2.66 million.  The committee encounters this all the time.  There is the State Claims Agency and the legal costs associated with compensation payments.  We like to keep the figure as low as possible but this is amazing.  Is there a reason that the legal costs are higher than the compensation?  Who is winning here?  The legal profession was the principal winner in that case.  If you do not have the specifics about that, you can send-----</p></speech>

I do not know but there might be a reason for it.  On the face of it, however, that is an isolated case that looks very bad.  Ultimately, there is over 60% on top of the compensation awards that goes on legal costs.  It is very high in comparison to other-----</p></speech>

It is consultancy but it is related to the delivery of product.  It reflected a slowdown in making other capital payments.  Within the flexibility provided to us, this was one area where we could make some provision and some payments.  For example, if there was a slowdown in building capital costs which were going to occur early in 2018, this was dealt with within the allocation that is available to us for savings.</p></speech>

The Garda is making a payment to an ICT company, probably one of the biggest companies in the world, that does not really need it.  How do we know that we got delivery of the &euro;6 million worth of product when it is prepaid?  The witnesses may say there was a schedule of payments but this committee is getting very concerned about prepayments and advance payments across the public service relating to ICT projects.</p><p>It is not because the companies need it for cashflow purposes.  It is probably historical.  There is no good reason for such a level.  We have seen previously in the committee that other State organisations have made pre-payments but the product was not delivered, the company went out of existence, and the pre-payment was gone.  There is a risk in making pre-payments.  I might ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment because he is nodding in agreement.</p></speech>

It is typically part of the pricing model for ICT services.  It is generally factored in and taken into account.  It should be reflected in a lower price overall, where the working capital and money are effectively provided in advance.</p></speech>

It is an issue that has cropped up in several meetings and it is not specific to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  The next issue might require legislative change, which might be the answer.  In one's local District Court, one will see 20 garda&iacute;.  Is it not possible for the station sergeant to give the evidence on behalf of all the station's garda&iacute;, instead of 20 garda&iacute; lining up?  On the topic of the District Court, I have stated in the committee on previous occasions that some of the best value for money in any section of any State organisation is the amount paid to inspectors who present cases in District Courts throughout the country.  The inspectors receive a small allowance for the extra work.  In the course of a day, there might be 50 or 100 cases, with ten solicitors coming and going, and one inspector is able to handle every case.  I say this as a tribute to them.  If that service had to be provided by the matching legal service of the defence, it would cost millions of euro.  It is a tremendously efficient system, which, I am sure, is good training for inspectors to understand the legal system.  Can anything be done to use the Garda's manpower in order that garda&iacute; do not have to sit in court?  I refer to speeding fines and offences, for example.</p></speech>

I wish only to clarify the issue.</p> <p>  People often find the following matter curious.  The Garda received an income of &euro;83,000, effectively as commission for collecting insurance premiums on behalf of insurance companies.  Is that car insurance or something else?  Why is the Garda collecting insurance premiums for insurance companies?  It appears in the accounts every year but I just do not understand why the Garda collects money for insurance companies.  What was the total sum collected, and what was the commission for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

The figure jumps out at me.  Perhaps somebody was charged with not paying insurance and handed the money to the Garda to pay over.  It appears in the accounts every year but it is unusual.  It is listed under income received by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda might revert to us with a note in that regard.</p> <p>  Does the Garda provide escorts for the movement of cash between banks?  There was a time when the Garda was paid a great deal of money, although perhaps it does not do it anymore.  Who carries out that task now?  Is it the Garda?</p></speech>

Before we start, I remind members and witnesses to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off.  This is important as they cause serious problems for the broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.</p> <p>  I am delighted that today we have engagement on Europe Day.  We have a presentation by the students on the challenges facing the European Union and we are all very much looking forward to that.</p> <p>  I welcome all the witnesses to this special meeting of the joint committees on Europe Day.</p><p>On this day in 1950 Robert Schuman outlined his vision for Europe of peace and co-operation between nations.  That was nearly 70 years ago, but it laid the foundations for the European Union we know today.  It is a strong partnership of nations that are working together to achieve the common goals of peace and prosperity.  Ireland joined the European Economic Community, EEC, now the European Union, in 1973 and has been a proud participant in European institutions for more than 45 years.  Citizens of Ireland tend to be very positive about our EU membership.  The results of a recent poll carried out by Red C Research and Marketing for the European Movement of Ireland showed that 93% of Irish people supported remaining in the European Union.  This shows the success of the European project and the benefits the European Union has brought to the country.<br/><br/>For Ireland, membership of international rules-based organisations is the best way to build relationships and alliances and for countries to support each other.  Europe Day is a great opportunity for us all to reflect on where we are and what we have achieved.  Importantly, it is also an opportunity to discuss the challenges ahead for all of us and how we can work together to find solutions to them.  In the context of Brexit and all of the implications that stem from it, it is more important than ever before for politicians, of all political allegiances and none, to work together and show a united front when it comes to doing our job and ensuring a good team effort across the political divide.  I sincerely believe it is terribly important for us to do so.  <br/><br/>Elections to the European Parliament will be held across the European Union in a few weeks' time.  The results of the same poll to which I referred showed that younger cohorts who were the most positive towards the European Union and many of its policies and who certainly had views on the issues at stake were also the least likely group to vote on 24 May.  It is important that we find ways to engage with each other and hear from experts emerging in their fields.  It is especially important that we hear the views of young people on the issues that will affect the future of the European Union.  I am passionate about this issue.  When I look at young people, I see them as the future.  In the years to come they will be the politicians and employers.  Every one of us is on a wheel and our time in our different roles comes and then finishes.  It will then be the turn of the young people who are before me.  When I go into schools, national and secondary, all I think of is that they are the future.  They are the ones who will be running the country, the Europe Union and the world in the years ahead.  I am very conscious of this, as we all should be.  <br/><br/>I do not think we have ever held a meeting of five joint committees before.  Today's event shows a new approach and how important it is that we take a cross-sectoral approach to such broad issues.  I welcome our guests, the students and young people from Queens University Belfast, QUB; Ulster University, UU; Teagasc; University College Dublin, UCD; Dublin City University, DCU; National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG; National University of Ireland, Maynooth, NUIM; and our neighbours in University College Cork, UCC.  <br/><br/>The meeting will be divided into four sessions and the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the relevant committee will chair its session.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. <br/><br/>I ask the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Deering, to lead us in the discussion on the reform of the Common Agriculture Policy.</p></speech>

In this session we will deal with the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which has served the country well in recent years.  In our discussion we are going to hear about where it is going to go in the months and years ahead.  The discussion will include the environmental and budgetary aspects of the CAP.  Budgets are very important, as nothing can be done without them.  We will also hear about reform, subsidiarity and flexibility.  We would like to hear about all of these elements.  Whenever there is a discussion about the CAP, we hear about the need to make it more simplified.  "Simplification" is a big word, but the CAP always seems to come out more bureaucratic.  We are looking forward to the discussion on the next CAP taking place and being concluded in the next year or so to finally have a more simplified programme.  I am delighted that we are joined by Mr. Daniel Bakker from Queens University Belfast, Dr. Sin&eacute;ad Furey and Dr. Lynsey Hollywood from Ulster University, Dr. Sin&eacute;ad McCarthy from Teagasc and Ms Si&uacute;n M&aacute;ire Riordan from University College Cork.

I will speak about the CAP for a few minutes.  </p> <p>  In June 2018 the European Commission put forward its legislative proposals for the future of the CAP post 2020.  Previous reforms of the CAP had been driven by political and economic change.  It is important, therefore, for all concerned to look at the political challenges facing the European Union and what the future of the CAP might look like.</p> <p>  The European Union is facing the challenges of UK withdrawal, the rise of a Eurosceptic tide across member states, global market instability, particularly in agricultural prices, and greater pressure to respond and adapt to climate change.  The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union is crucial because it has contributed significantly to a forecasted reduction in the CAP budget for the period 2021 to 2027.  The cut proposed is 5%, but it will be around 12% in real terms.  As the CAP is one of the cornerstones of European integration, it is important that the Commission&rsquo;s proposals be considered and scrutinised.</p> <p>  The proposed legislation retains the current two pillar structure of direct payments and rural development but allows much greater flexibility for member states to choose where their allocation of funds will go.  The Commission&rsquo;s rationale is to streamline the CAP and increase overall efficiency.  Member states will be better able to target their interventions to suit their specific contexts.  The proposals also have revised greening architecture for pillar 1 payments and put strong emphasis on the CAP&rsquo;s commitment to environmental sustainability.</p> <p>  Member states will be responsible for drawing up strategic plans which will then be approved by the Commission to ensure they stay within the CAP&rsquo;s overall objectives.  Some see this as a step in the right direction, but others, including some member states, have raised concerns as strategic plans might place a further administrative burden on national governments.  Many agricultural stakeholders have criticised the idea as it could potentially lead to an undermining of the Single Market and compromise a level playing field for farmers.  Some fear the proposals amount to a renationalisation of agriculture and will increase bureaucracy and market distortions, resulting from differences in implementation across the European Union.  Affording member states too much flexibility has also been criticised by environmentalists.  As well as criticising the continuation of "perverse subsidies", environmentalists argue that flexibility with no real incentives to have ambitious targets could lead to declining environmental standards across the European Union.  The proposed "enhanced conditionality" clause in the new legislative proposals has been viewed as more greenwashing of the CAP, without sufficient accountability mechanisms to ensure adherence to environmental regulations.</p> <p>  It is important to stress that the proposals are in their very early stages.</p><p>As we saw with the previous CAP reform in 2013, nothing is likely to be passed until the EU budget is agreed.  There will be a new European Parliament and perhaps a new European Commissioner by the time the legislation enters into force, but as the proposal stands, there are several steps that could be taken to ensure a successful CAP.</p><p> There could be greater promotion of dialogue between environmentalist organisations and agricultural stakeholders.  At least since the 1992 reform of CAP, we have seen the struggle to merge agricultural production with environmental protection, which, unfortunately, sometimes leads to conflicting and contradictory interests.  Helping to promote common ground at EU and national levels could result in a more coherent policy.  The approval process for strategic plans needs to be transparent and as strong as possible, as this is essentially the only mechanism for ensuring that national priorities do not conflict with EU-wide objectives.  Maintaining the common aspect of the CAP is essential.  Furthermore, the proposals allow for only the Commission to approve strategic plans, but to improve accountability, that process could be based formally on widespread consultation and should involve input from the co-legislators and various stakeholders.  What happens if there is an impasse between national priorities and CAP objectives should be spelled out by the Commission.  As the Commission views the next CAP as a move towards evidence-based policy, which prioritises results over compliance, it is important the quality of data sources are to an appropriate standard and that national Governments have the technical capacity to construct and defend a strategic plan.  This might involve greater investment in technical assistance and upgrading of skills, which will be difficult if the current budget predictions are accurate.</p><p> The period for the next CAP is one of learning for the European Union as it experiments with this new delivery model.  It is important for all concerned that there is an awareness of the challenges facing the upcoming reform, which will be shaped by competing interests among stakeholders within a potentially reduced budget.  It is important to stress the crucial role of dialogue and consultation to ensure an efficient and coherent CAP.</p></speech>

I will present a joint perspective on behalf of myself and my colleague from Ulster University business school, Dr. Lynsey Hollywood.  We very much welcome the opportunity to discuss our perspective on the future and ongoing reform of the CAP.  It is entirely appropriate that such a collaborative and open approach is used because it is in this capacity as stakeholders that farmers and wider stakeholders have an important opinion in this area.</p> <p>  Our presentation will focus on four main priorities we believe that any ongoing CAP reform should include.  The first is to address the volatility or instability of our agricultural markets because we consider primary food production a special case.  The exceptionalism of food means that a political and social importance is attached to it, and it is entirely appropriate to give meaningful support to farmers in recognition of their contribution to this important primary production.  It is also important to consider the issue of cross-compliance, but without subsidising or supporting any lack of competitiveness or inefficiencies within agriculture.  It is also entirely appropriate that the support is directed towards farmers in less favourable farming areas.  Any income support or resilience payment should not be allowed to become a surrogate for income support, nor a means of indefinitely maintaining uneconomical farming units.  There should continue to be a focus on the full decoupling of primary production from income support, without any regression to coupling food production with any kind of payment.  This will allow any agrifood industry ultimately to become more responsive, which is an important future direction to be consumer orientated and market led.</p> <p>  The lack of collaboration in the farming community and, more widely, agrifood is an issue.  Government intervention could usefully foster greater collaboration, although that will need careful consideration through, for example, appropriate incentivisation.  A better understanding of market requirements would enable farmers to move from a production mentality to a more marketing mindset.  Any support could usefully be focused on support for know-how of marketing aspects.  Identifying that market need or niche in the market and how to differentiate one's product offering would help create diversification, support farmers in that mentality and allow us to look towards a strong, value-added market with strong export potential.  In the light of agricultural exceptionalism, some mechanism needs to be in place to ensure a secure, sustainable, healthy environment, and to prevent instability of the agricultural market, erratic food prices and market distortion.  It is important that any solution does not serve to increase food prices for the end consumer.</p> <p>  That brings me to the second priority, namely, food security, which covers the continuity of supply, health and food poverty.  The security of supply is especially important in the context of Europe and globally, given the increasing population and the need to feed more people and produce more food for more people.  The world's population is predicted to be 9 billion by 2050.  It would be appropriate for any ongoing and future reform of the CAP or agricultural framework to consider health, simply because of the relationship between food choice, nutrition and health.  These policies should usefully complement one another.  We need our industry to encourage production of food consistent with guidelines for healthy eating and for population nutrition.  That leaves us a space in food innovation to ensure we meet that market nee, although it cannot be at the expense of the twin objectives of productivity alongside environmental sustainability.  As for unnecessary costs being accrued to the consumer, paradoxically, those consumers who stand to benefit most from a healthy diet are those who can least afford it.  Consumers, therefore, must not be disadvantaged by a two-tier pricing policy or as a consequence of their reality.  They must be able to access, afford and avail of healthy food.</p> <p>  Our third priority is ensuring that food and farming are public goods, which we hinted at earlier in the context of environmental production.  We need to consider and continue the emphasis on the active management of land, which should be rewarded in a way that respects cross-compliance.  Farming is more than its principal purpose of primary production and, therefore, any payment schedule made to farmers must be conditional upon food safety, food quality, environmental and animal welfare, and occupational health and safety standards.  We need to consider the pivotal role that farming can play in preserving and enhancing the rural and natural environments, the importance of which we should not diminish.  Our farming counterparts are the custodians of our natural environment and it is important to respect the amenity value of the countryside.  Any future agricultural framework and policy should aim to preserve and enhance the amenity and recreational value of our land, and to reward landowners for conducting that public good on society's behalf.</p> <p>  Our final priority is the maintenance of the rural population and rural development.  Agriculture requires generational renewal of active farmers.  As we hinted at in the context of incentivisation, one might expect us, from a university perspective, to suggest that continuing professional development, short courses and educational attainment in this regard are also important.  Universities and the higher education sector have a role to play in providing access to increasing professional educational attainment in this area, and in allowing farmers to have that marketing mindset and the export potential to be exploited.  We welcome a multi-actor approach to science and innovation, involving support agencies and research institutions.</p> <p>  In conclusions, further reform of the CAP is to be welcomed.  We recommend that policy makers continue to pursue aggressively the decoupling of food production from payments to exploit that truly market-orientated, consumer-led approach and to allow for complementary agrifood and health policies in a way that is mutually supportive of people, the planet and profit.</p></speech>

I will comment on the sustainability of the Irish diet from the point of view of carbon footprint, its implications for policy, including policy from the point of view of the end user and the end of the food supply chain, and accounting for consumer food behaviour.  The contribution of food consumption towards climate change has received increasing attention in recent years, especially recently with the launch of the EAT-Lancet report.  In its present form, food consumption is responsible for as much as 30% of EU greenhouse gas emissions, GHGs.  Therefore, we need to look at food choices and food behaviour and see how we can alter them to influence health and the environment.</p> <p>  Are there any food choice behaviours that are sustainable as a diet and nutritionally acceptable?  Can the two areas meet?  The UN Food and Agriculture Organization defines sustainable diets as those "with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations.  Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy". </p> <p>The "economically fair" aspect of this is very important as the agriculture industry is the largest indigenous industry in Ireland.  GHGs associated with food production are measured in carbon equivalents to produce a carbon footprint for the food we consume.  In general, plant-based foods are low in GHG emissions, whereas foods from animal sources are higher, especially those from ruminant animals.  The European Commission has found that Ireland has one of the lowest carbon footprints of animal products in Europe because of the system we use to produce meat.  Foods from animal sources provide many essential nutrients necessary for good health and, therefore, are an important part of a healthy diet.  Certain nutrients can only be found in meat products and are not available in plant products.  Environmental and human health issues should be considered together to ensure socially and nutritionally optimal outcomes for both.</p> <p>  Research is ongoing in Teagasc, in conjunction with University College Cork, to examine the carbon footprint of the Irish diet and food consumption behaviours which result in a more or less sustainable and health diet.  The aim is to determine the quantity of GHG emissions associated with food consumption patterns in Irish adults and to determine what patterns of food consumption are associated with sustainability and health.  We use the best publicly available data to do the national adult nutrition survey funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine through its fair funding measure.  Each food consumed was converted into carbon equivalents and measured the carbon produced by consuming these foods, instead of looking at nutrients as is traditionally done.  It is no surprise that meat, in particular ruminant meat, made the highest contribution to carbon in the Irish diet as a result of the high conversion factor associated with meat and dairy, while plant sourced foods had the lowest CO2 in the diet.</p> <p>  It is important to eat a varied diet and not just one particular food group.  Consumers who followed a cultural pattern traditional to the Irish diet, with high meat, fruit and vegetable consumption, had the lowest CO2 footprint of all consumers, showing that meat plays a very important role in health and a sustainable diet.  We also found that food consumption and energy intake beyond our nutritional requirements contributed to the public health epidemic of obesity, as well as food waste.  Promoting a healthier diet and lifestyle, which reduces food consumption, also helps from an environmental perspective.  The findings from this research support the notion that any policy measures should be evidence based and should consider the prevailing cultural food consumption patterns of a population.  CAP reform, and any associated food policy instruments developed for sustainability reasons, should be holistic in nature and take other parameters such as health and nutrition into consideration, rather than concentrating on one food group.  It should reward more sustainable production and meet our consumer demands. </p></speech>

I welcome their engagement with younger citizens.  I am a second year European studies student in University College Cork.<br/><br/>As a young person growing up in rural Ireland, I have seen the importance of the agricultural industry and the difference the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, makes in Ireland.  One of the leading incentives behind Ireland&rsquo;s decision to apply for European Union membership was the opportunity of gaining support from the CAP.  When the CAP was introduced under the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the objectives were to improve and stabilise the incomes of those engaged in the farm sector, largely through market support mechanisms but with some activities oriented towards improving farming productivity and structural adjustments within the farm sector.  As the EU now discusses the future of the CAP post 2020, it is important to recall how beneficial this policy is and has been for Ireland.<br/><br/>One of the aspects of the CAP that has had the greatest impact on the lives of farmers across the EU has been the payment schemes.  Farmers are given money for maintaining their land and young farmers are given payments to encourage them to start farming.  They are given grants or loans to help start up and farmers can receive the green direct payments for reaching environment objectives.  The objective of the CAP is to give farmers and other agricultural workers a decent standard of living.  While the CAP is not always fairly divided among all recipients, it has still improved the income for thousands of farmers across Ireland and the EU.  The CAP&rsquo;s direct payment schemes help protect farmers from the uncertainty of the market.  At the moment, the CAP has a small farmers' scheme which is aimed at supporting smaller farmers in Europe.  However, this only operates in 15 EU countries and<i></i>Ireland is not among them.  This is unfortunate because if this policy was introduced in Ireland, it would aid many more in the agricultural industry.  Many Irish farmers are small farmers and the CAP currently does not have a big an impact on their lives.<br/><br/>The CAP encourages green, sustainable farming.  Part of the direct payment is given to farmers who strive for greener, more environment friendly agricultural production.  In theory, this should help Ireland improve its carbon footprint and reach its climate change objectives.  Farmers gain more by diversifying their crop and meeting environmental goals.  This is important for farmers as it gives them the opportunity to receive more from the CAP schemes while also encouraging them to be more environmentally conscious.  The CAP may be more known for its payments to farmers but it is also very focused on rural development and sustainability.  The CAP has helped many local, rural regions around Ireland.  Between 2007 and 2013, &euro;4.3 billion of funding was given to help agricultural production that would benefit rural areas.<br/><br/>The CAP also helps non-agricultural activities, such as small-scale manufacturing and food processing.  Such activities encourage businesses to set up in rural areas, focusing on the development of the local food sector.  This is important as it brings employment to rural regions and allows small, rural, agricultural communities to prosper and to use their large agricultural sector to develop compatible businesses.  When rural areas are developed, this development attracts more people to the area, offers more employment and can increase tourism.  The increase in employment is especially important as many farmers who operate small farms must get jobs outside the farm to supplement their household income.  This is made easier when the region around them is more developed, giving them a greater opportunity to find employment.  The development of these areas is vital to encourage people to stay and continue, or even start, farming in these rural areas.  The continuance of CAP ensures the development of Irish rural areas and gives further aid to the agricultural workers here.<br/><br/>The Agriculture and Fisheries Council will meet next week and I will follow its discussions about the future of the CAP post 2020 very closely.  At the most recent meeting in April, I was stuck by the emphasis by the Romanian Presidency on the environmental ambition of the CAP.  I agree that this is a major feature of CAP reform.  It will be advantageous not only to EU farmers but to every single EU citizen.  As a young citizen, I value sustainable development and want a green future for Ireland.  I know that Ministers have been discussing climate, biodiversity and water quality, to name just a few issues.  I hope to see a future in which we can enjoy sustainable food security and see an improvement in the environmental issues that exist today.</p></speech>

The CAP and CAP reform are a key part of our body of work at committee level and we have already made a number of submissions to Europe.</p><p>We attended several Council meetings around Europe, including in Croatia and Romania in recent months.  Members of the committee made a presentation at the European Parliament's agriculture committee approximately a year ago.  It is a priority matter for the committee and a significant issue for agriculture in Ireland, as all present are aware.  It is important that we keep engaging with this process.  Agriculture is our largest indigenous industry but it does not get its fair share of media coverage when it needs it.  It is great to have this opportunity to discuss the matter.  I am joined by some members of the committee and I would like to have engagement with them and the witnesses over the next ten or 15 minutes.  We will take a couple of questions together if that is acceptable to the witnesses.</p></speech>

Has research been conducted on what will happen in the advent of Brexit for the farmers in Northern Ireland in terms of their current income?  That question is for Mr. Bakker and Dr. Furey.  Does Dr. McCarthy know whether Teagasc has conducted research on our capacity to sustainably provide sufficient plant-based food for this country and some for export, in addition to a certain amount of meat production and land being used to plant forestry, in the case of increased demand for a plant-based diet?</p></speech>

Dr. Furey mentioned that we should move away from coupling and towards decoupling.  How can the vulnerable sectors be supported to ensure a sustainable future for them?  On suckler beef farmers, who are a key part of the industry in the west of Ireland, if that industry goes into decline, large parts of that region may be depopulated, which would have a significantly negative effect on rural Ireland.  How could the next CAP protect the vulnerable sectors of the agriculture industry?</p></speech>

We have a very busy schedule today and there is a significant amount of work relating to this meeting.  It is a momentous day and it is great to be able to record our participation in the European Union and celebrate Europe Day.</p> <p>  Agriculture accounts for a large part of our portfolio and work.  There has been a significant shift in recent years to larger dairy and crop farmers.  Similarly, larger dry stock farmers seem to be more prevalent.  The days of the part-time farmer who may have a second job and tend 40 acres or 50 acres may be numbered.  From the perspective of Dr. McCarthy and Teagasc, in ten or 15 years, will part-time farming be a thing of the past?  While canvassing for the local and European elections, as all politicians have been doing, I noted the number of unoccupied smaller farm holdings which are being subsumed by larger farmholders.  Does Dr. McCarthy anticipate a massive change in our model of farming?  That seems to have happened in recent years.</p></speech>

From which countries are these products coming?  The products at which I have looked are not produced in Ireland.  I am specifically referring to plant-based protein foods for human consumption.  Is there a desire or ability to grow them in Ireland?  I know there are issues around soya beans in that regard.  I understand that many types of beans come from the tropics and are more suited to such climates, which obviously means there is a carbon footprint involved in bringing them here.  In many parts of the tropics, people do not have enough food or their diet is not as good as it should be.  I direct my questions particularly at Dr. McCarthy.</p></speech>

Parliamentary questions to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine are being heard in the D&aacute;il and the spokespersons of the main parties are tied up there.  I offer their apologies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.693" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sin&eacute;ad McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019050900002#E00900"><p>I will roll two responses into one.  On the issue of from where plant-based foods are coming and whether there is a way to combine animal and plant-based production in Ireland, certain climates and agricultural environments lend themselves better to certain types of food production.  For example, producing meat and dairy in Ireland is very suited to our climate as we get a lot of rain and do not solely rely on the water supply for agriculture.  Many of our animals are grass fed for more than 300 days per year and when they are kept in during the winter months they are fed from silage.  Very little animal feed is given to them.</p> <p>  On beef production, meat and dairy very efficiently convert food such as grass that humans cannot consume to protein which they can.  If we were to change that production type to more plant-based production, it might not be as successful because the land that we currently use for producing meat and dairy is not necessarily suitable for plant production.  There is also an issue in terms of the amount of carbon that is kept as a sink in the ground or soil and which would be released if the land was ploughed to plant alternative food sources.</p> <p>  My answer to Deputy Corcoran-Kennedy's question is yes and no.  There is a possibility to produce both but we need to be careful regarding the land we choose to use differently.  It would not necessarily result in a lower carbon footprint.  Some research indicates that as a result of the higher inputs of fertiliser and so on that are required to produce plant-based crops, there may be, at best, a 10% to 12% reduction in carbon footprint.  It is not a direct swap of one for the other as there are other challenges in changing farming practices and the resultant dietary CO2.</p> <p>  Many plant-based proteins such as beans and legumes are imported and have many associated food miles.  It is not always possible to recommend a plant-based diet to certain vulnerable groups in the community.  For example, older adults naturally consume less food but need a higher protein intake.  The best source of protein for older consumers to maintain muscle mass and prevent falls and frailty is animal protein.  They would need to eat four to five times the amount of lentils or beans to get the same amount of protein and it would not be possible for them to eat that much food.  There is a role for both plant and animal protein in diet and it is about getting the balance right in terms of achieving concordant measures of health and sustainability.  One must not focus solely on the carbon footprint of the diet without taking account of the nutrition and health outcomes.</p></speech>

Ulster University is not actively involved in farming research but we are most certainly involved in more general research on food poverty and food insecurity.  If it satisfies members, I will speak more generally on that point.  It is anticipated that Brexit will create an additional cost of &pound;25 per week on the average household's food bill.  For citizens who are already squeezed, impoverished or vulnerable, this will create an additional burden and we are worried about that.  Ulster University is very active in the food poverty research agenda.  We are developing an at-risk of food poverty index that will consider low income and rurality in identifying where such consumers are located to enable more targeted interventions.</p> <p>  More specifically, there area also concerns regarding rural dwellers and agricultural smallholders.  Given that the average age of smallholders in Northern Ireland and Great Britain is approximately 60 years, we are concerned about generational renewal and the need for young farmers.  It was for this reason that we addressed the point of diversification and the need to add value.  We will be actively involved in the food innovation effort to try to complement agriculture, food availability and health.  We need to be concerned about the departure of farmers from farming because it has become unprofitable.</p> <p>  There is an opportunity to educate and engage with consumers on the more general point of the importance of eating locally and seasonally so that we can celebrate our local and indigenous foods.  We must showcase indigenous produce so that we are not reliant on alternative protein sources from other countries.</p> <p>  We are working with policymakers in Northern Ireland in a collaborative effort on agrifood and food policy generally.  Brexit has caused concerns about food affordability and availability and the possibility that access to a fresh and varied diet may become more problematic for Northern Ireland consumers.</p></speech>

The raw materials may move from the North to the South to be processed, return to the North to be packaged and, finally, be sold in the South.  It is great that the common travel area is secure but much more could be done in terms of regulatory alignment between the market in the North and the South to minimise disruption to goods moving across the Border.  If the Assembly in the North gets up and running, the North-South Ministerial Council would be a good forum to promote more alignment on agrifood and minimise disruption.</p></speech>

As members will probably expect me to say, I believe a joint collaborative effort by university and other research and educational institutions could be useful in providing such an incentivisation.  This would not necessarily have to be economic.  One way forward could be to subsidise educational attainment efforts or repurpose farmers, as it were, to enable them to move into more diverse food processing areas.</p></speech>

When one considers the food supply chain from a carbon footprint perspective, between 80% and 85% of the carbon footprint is generated before the food leaves the farmyard.  It is very important that we put measures in place from a sustainability perspective to reduce the carbon footprint of food as it is being produced and support smaller farmers to produce food more sustainably.  Farming should not be only large-scale and intensive.  CAP could address this by implementing more sustainable practices at farm level.  A great deal of research has been done in Europe.  I am involved in a circular agricultural economics research project in the European Union, which has 20 partners across Europe.  We are looking at more sustainable farming practices and how acceptable they would be to consumers at the end of the food chain.  We need to develop a more circular economy and maintain better sustainability at farm level.  This would help to maintain smaller farms and keep European farmers in the farming industry.</p></speech>

When I was asked to speak about the European common security and defence policy on the occasion of Europe Day the first topic to come to mind was the role of Irish neutrality.  The debate is probably as old as the country itself but has surely not lost its intensity since then.  I finally decided to address the issue because recent developments in the area of European common and security policy make neutrality very topical again.  I draw attention to a couple of developments that place neutrality back on the agenda and demand urgent discussion of its meaning and implications.</p> <p>  The first of these is Brexit.</p><p>The loss of the major Atlanticist power within the European Union has serious consequences for the further development of the European Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP.  Having always tried to prevent or at least slow down integration in this policy field, the United Kingdom has been a kind of natural ally to Ireland in trying to keep security issues out of European integration.  The consequences of this development are already visible.  Not long after the Brexit vote, the President of the EU Commission, the French President and later the German Chancellor were calling for the creation of an EU army.  Although for the time being this is not much more than a blurry vision, it became obvious where integration in the European Common Security and Defence Policy field is heading.<br/><br/>Already in 2018 permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, was launched, marking a huge step in integrating security and defence co-operation towards a military alliance.  Causing a lively discussion in Ireland, its participation was finally backed by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, denying a conflict between Irish neutrality and participation in PESCO.  Of all the other neutral member states of the EU only Malta opted out, choosing to first observe if PESCO and neutrality are compatible.  Especially in Finland and Sweden, former neutral states, a consensus has been reached to the effect that EU membership in general is not logically compatible with the traditional notion of neutrality.  In practice these EU member states have thus given up their neutrality to a large extent.  In Ireland, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a Bill to enshrine Irish neutrality in the Constitution.  After a lively debate, in which European politicians were even called warmongers, the Bill was eventually rejected in the D&aacute;il.<br/><br/>Finally, I draw members' attention to a poll by Red C for the European Movement Ireland, published just last week.  Apart from an overwhelming support for EU membership in general, the poll revealed that a majority of 58% of the Irish people think that Ireland should be part of intensified EU security and defence co-operation and that PESCO does not pose a threat to Irish neutrality.  Approval is even stronger amongst young Irish people.<br/><br/>For me as a German citizen, the whole discussion about neutrality is new.  Despite the <i>tabula rasa </i>after the Second World War, Germany did not have the chance to have its own discussion about this, having to align itself to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, in the face of an expansionist Soviet Union.  While living in Ireland for one year and studying at University College Dublin it is very interesting to follow the public debate about neutrality and discuss it with my Irish and non-Irish fellow students.  This brings insights into this very politicised topic and the fact that Irish neutrality is loaded with different meanings and historical resonances.  Various narratives are contesting the nature of Irish foreign and security policy and its expression in Europe's contemporary security architecture.  While there seems to be a broad consensus that Ireland can and should make a contribution to global peace and security, this is not the case for the question as to which institutional framework should be used to achieve this.<br/><br/>Due to the aforementioned recent developments, however, Ireland seems to be forced to take a decision.  The departure of the major damper of integration in the area of foreign and security policy and the concomitant developments, such as PESCO and discussions of an EU army, make it an urgent topic.  For Ireland's European partners, and therefore also for me in this case, it is essential to know where Ireland is coming from in order to fully understand the significance and the implications of neutrality for Ireland.</p></speech>

I am studying at the School of Law and Government at Dublin City University.  Today I will address four key challenges facing the Common Security and Defence Policy.  The first is related to strategic coherence and internal cohesion.  In the counterfactual scenario in which the EU is not able to manage internal cracks such as the rise of nationalism, so-called <i>souvereignism</i>or major differences in member states' strategic cultures, future risks and challenges to CSDP might be endogenous.  A failure to co-ordinate efforts on the CSDP might draw Europe back to the US.  Some researchers argue it might return the European security landscape to the 1950s.  The EU will thus need to find innovative ways to solve the crises of sovereignty of borders and of defence.  What Europe wants is not easy to operationalise because of increasing polarisation or even fragmentation of European integration.<br/><br/>The CSDP is a domain in which some argue differentiated integration might work better.  This is because states' national strategies are driven by different threat perceptions, strategic environments, capabilities and strategic interests.  My research suggests that differentiated integration in the form of a role-player model in the CSDP could enhance strategic knowledge production and capability development.  Security and defence collaborative regimes such as the CSDP can have an empowering effect on member states.  However, an unintended consequence of the role-player model could be a &quot;Europe <i>&agrave; la carte</i>&quot; in which members would only support the policies in which they see a benefit for their own national interests.<br/><br/>I will now refer to Brexit.  The anticipated withdrawal of the UK from the European Union is forecasted to strain the CSDP budget.  In 2018 the UK accounted for approximately 16% of the CSDP budget.  To compensate for this an increase in member states' investments in security and defence can be expected.  A series of peace and defence co-operation mechanisms were adopted after Brexit.  The major examples are PESCO, the European Defence Fund, EDF, the co-ordinated annual review on defence, CARD, the European peace facility and the European intervention initiative.  For the new instruments to be effective it is important for the EU to manage member states' expectations and ensure they will enable the achievement of strategic objectives.<br/><br/>I will now address the external strategic environment and external sources of instability.  A particular tendency in US leadership and what some have termed a US strategy underpinned by a logic of &quot;retreat&quot; and &quot;systemic competition&quot; with China have pushed the EU to think more seriously about the scenario of US abandonment.  Some researchers argue that strategic autonomy would allow the EU to gain an element of independence from US decision-making and pursue an agenda of international peace and security based on its own normative vision with mediation, diplomacy, trade co-operation, peace missions and global justice at its core.  Some argue that the road to strategic autonomy might lie in a merger between the CSDP and NATO, that is, the Europeanisation of NATO.  Multipolarity and great power competition represent another challenge with implications for the CSDP.  In the future, the EU is expected to aim at having good relationships with all countries and avoid a return to bipolarity.  This is because a bipolar logic might push countries to choose and some of them might choose China for economic reasons.<br/><br/>My last point is related to new security technologies.  Future and emerging technologies such as autonomous robotics and artificial intelligence can have a disruptive and transformative impact in the security and defence domain.  If the EU invests sufficiently in research and development, it might be in a position to harness the benefits of new security technologies.  New funding of transnational and interdisciplinary research, under the European Defence Fund <i>inter alia </i>, will have the potential to address capability shortcomings and technological and industrial weaknesses to a certain extent.  The EU could establish a new area of competence in dual-use technology, that is, technologies which can be attributed to both civilian and military purposes.</p></speech>

On this day it is particularly important to recall why the EU was initially established; to end frequent and bloody wars between neighbours and to unite European countries both economically and politically to secure lasting peace across the Continent.  We can largely say that this has been successful.  At the moment, however, huge challenges are ahead for the EU in the area of common security and defence.  As is true for most of the challenges the EU faces, Brexit crops up in this area.  The greatest challenge is the development of a common policy on security and defence that includes a cohesive development of policies with third countries in future missions, especially the UK once it leaves.  This policy must simultaneously protect the integrity of the European Union and the sovereignty of member states.  It is very important that there is a balance between these three concerns.  The greatest challenge lies in finding this balance.</p> <p>  Different visions of the CSDP proposed by the initial "big three" member states, Germany, the UK and France, have long created space for smaller member states like Ireland to avoid hard choices concerning issues of security and defence.  A more cohesive EU in the post-Brexit future presents significant challenges for all states that have long thrived in the murky waters of strategic ambiguity.</p><p>Indeed, it could be argued that the United Kingdom leaving removes a significant stumbling block for European defence co-operation.  British scepticism has previously allowed others such as Denmark and central European states to avoid hard questions on tensions between formal military non-alignment and the realities of being part of a deeply integrated organisation because NATO has long provided what they have seen to be the primary security provider in the European theatre. </p><p> The UK&rsquo;s absence from future Common Security and Defence Policy debates after Brexit will likely push these states into the limelight in terms of blocking or opting out from security co-operation.  Our greatest challenge is how we deal with this.  While the EU must grapple with the loss of its transatlantic alliance partner, it is imperative that it now attempts to balance a bilateral agreement on Common Security and Defence Policy with the UK that also complements a type of unified EU approach to issues of security and defence, encompassing the considerations of small states, such as Ireland, and big states such as France and Germany.</p><p> That is not to say that the EU has not taken any steps thus far.  If we look at the decision taken by the High Representative, Ms Mogherini, to forge ahead with the publication of the EU&rsquo;s new global strategy in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum in June 2016, it is apparent that some attempts have been made by the EU to push ahead with CSDP.  Although faced with something of an existential crisis, the EU found a response in building a security architecture to reinvigorate EU institutions and to reunite the remaining 27 member states.  This provided a common ground for co-operation without reopening a Pandora&rsquo;s box of institutional reform that would be required to deal with more traditional areas of European co-operation such as market regulation.  </p><p> The Common Security and Defence Policy may not have always been high on Ireland&rsquo;s agenda but the aftermath of the Brexit vote has been particularly challenging for us all.  We now must strongly reconsider our own security and defence policy, in addition to that of our position in the wider EU CSDP.  Brexit has uncovered a number of political and constitutional fault lines, none more serious than its potential impacts on the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government deserves credit for the way in which it has managed the Brexit negotiations to date, particularly in securing support from our European partners concerning Ireland&rsquo;s position on the Border.  However, what price will we pay for this in future negotiations on matters such as common security and defence?  </p><p> The reduced room for manoeuvre on common security and defence for small states, such as ourselves, in an EU that will be more dominated by France and Germany than before, must be taken into account.  In a Franco-German EU, the space for constructive ambiguity is likely to be greatly reduced.  Ireland&rsquo;s hesitancy and ambivalence on this matter may no longer be sustainable.  Irish attitudes to European security and defence might best be characterised by paraphrasing Winston Churchill, in that Ireland is with common security and defence policy, but not of it.  We are linked, but not compromised.  We are interested and associated, but not absorbed.  It is perhaps time that we do become absorbed in greater co-operation with the EU on issues of common security and defence that extend beyond PESCO, as others here have noted, as we lose the shelter of the UK in future debates.  </p><p> The threats of a no-deal Brexit and the medium to longer-term security threats posed by any kind of withdrawal have yet to be provided for.  Both the Irish State and the EU as a whole faces profound challenges in this regard and are there, as of yet, no signs that neither it nor the EU is prepared to address them. </p></speech>

I compliment all the witnesses who I have heard so far this morning on the quality and depth of their submissions and the knowledge and research that went into them.  They are all to be complimented on the even-handed and balanced way in which  they went about their business.</p><p>I raise a question about the Common Security and Defence Policy.  It is an issue which has been with us for a very long time.  Over time, different emphases occur.  It is important to note that we are a neutral country.  There is nothing incompatible between our neutrality and our membership of the European Union or certain associations in the peacekeeping and defence areas.  In the past, we have excelled in peacekeeping and have shown ourselves to be international leaders in that area.  We have a useful influence and role to play in the European context.  I note modern terrorism has no boundaries and can reach far into neutral countries, peacekeeping countries and so on.  Do the witnesses see a space in which Ireland might be expected to defend itself in such a situation?</p><p>I refer to the question of whether something in this area will be attached to the discussion on Brexit and if a <i>quid pro quo </i>be sought.  I do not think that will be the case.  We are very strong members of the European Union with a strong commitment to its ideals which have existed from the beginning and get stronger over time.  It is not likely that we would be expected to concede one for another in this context.  I think that because the European Union must prevail.  If it does not and it fragments, going in different directions, and if demands are made within itself, of itself, by itself or by single member states, then there is a grave danger that the European Union will cease to be.  If that happens there will be great political, military and economic implications for the entire Continent of Europe and outside.  I do not need to tell our witnesses this; they are experts on this area, but the question arises as to whether we want to go back to where we were.  Some member states refer to the good old days, which presumably was the first half of the 20th century.  My question to young people is whether they want to go back to those much referred to good old days, when almost 70 million people died in the conflict which followed when Europe turned upon itself.  All these things relate to military matters and peace.  We should remember that the EU was the single most important peace agreement that the world has ever known.  For all those years we have been peaceful.  There can come times of turbulence occasionally and in times of economic difficulty, someone is always sought to blame.  I encourage our guests to focus on the alternatives, because they are not good, and they can proceed to work in an equitable manner, to be fair to all people including refugees from outside.  As we know, some of the people of Europe were themselves refugees in the not too-distant past.</p></speech>

This is very timely.  There are debates at the moment relating to plans for an EU army.  It is clear from this morning's contributions that despite the denials from some on the political right that an advanced conversation on this is taking place.  The contributions here have been challenging.  While I acknowledge the poll undertaken by the European Movement, which would be very much in favour of changing our policy, we should recall that a Red C poll last year also showed tremendous support in Ireland for Irish neutrality.  I ask if Irish people would really support what PESCO is doing off the coast of Libya, for example, if they knew.</p><p>If they followed the reports of Sally Hayden, the Irish journalist, she has highlighted EU support, including Irish financial support, for funding death camps in Libya.  That funding was confirmed to me by the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, just a few weeks ago in the Seanad.  These are camps in which people are tortured, raped, mutilated and killed.  This is the reality of PESCO as it operates right now.  One does not have to take my word for it.  Sally Hayden has documented and continues to document it in an effort to bring attention to the realities, unfortunately, of what PESCO is doing.  Do we think the Irish people would support funding of &euro;13 billion in research subsidies for the defence industries of Europe as set out in the next financial plan for Europe?  That is a reality of PESCO.  The final question I ask is as follows.  Surely, the best people to decide our future neutrality are the people of Ireland.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in was right to pursue the Bill.  As democrats, the best way forward in this debate is to support that call for a referendum.  Let us have a full debate on the future of Irish neutrality.  I thank the witnesses for their thoughtful contributions today.</p></speech>

I am delighted to welcome the witnesses and thank them for their contributions.  We are at an important crossroads in Europe.  Certainly, I have concerns about some activities taking place under the flag of and with the financial support of the European Union.  We need to be more awake, engaged and vocal and to scrutinise more deeply legislation that comes before us on PESCO and other situations.  Europe as a project must be preserved.  We must work at that and learn from it.  A recent report I intend to raise on Leaders' Questions today is on the future of farming in Europe.  It states that 1,000 farmers and farm families are leaving farming every week right across the EU.  That is leading to the degeneration, neglect and slippage of rural Ireland at a time when we are talking about rolling broadband out to rural areas.  If we do not maintain sustainable farm families in rural Ireland, North and South, and across Europe, it will lead to more factory farms and large conglomerates buying up land, which is not good.  In my own county of Tipperary, we have an equine company purchasing every square perch of land that becomes available.  It has amassed almost 28,000 acres.  While it provides employment and has great prowess in the equine industry, it is disgraceful that we do not have a land commission or other land agency to monitor and curtail what is happening.  The family farm is the lifeblood of Ireland.  In the two previous recessions to the one we have just come out of, it was agriculture that led us back to growth with, I might add, the support of the EU.  People were always there on family farms and working the land in parishes and communities nationally.  Every euro that goes into agriculture is spent locally.  Farm families support schools, sports clubs, the tourism industry and everything else.  It is therefore timely to have this discussion.  I thank our visitors for attending today.  It is my first time speaking in this new Chamber.  I am delighted.  It is an honour to be here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.721" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019050900002#J00300"><p>I thank all those who have contributed.  The situation around security events is not a stark one.  It is more the case that there are real choices and priorities to address.  It is true that Europe came out of a project of peace.  The wonderful thing about Europe was that after literally thousands of years of conflict, countries which had experienced in some cases hundreds of years of war against each other decided to come together to determine how to live together more peacefully and constructively.  That is absolutely true.  However, while there is an incredible legacy of peace in the European project, being European and being part of the European project means thinking about that constant question of how we live together.  It is about being critically present and asking critical questions, as the witnesses have.  That is part of being pro-European.  It is about caring enough about Europe to care about the decisions it makes.</p> <p>  There are very important decisions being made and there are priorities and concerns.  It was a decision for Ireland to opt into PESCO.  Ireland was not required to opt in, rather it chose to do so.  PESCO moved us further away by involving us, for example, in joint purchases of military equipment.  Ireland has an incredibly strong tradition of peace and neutrality and of leading disarmament.  One of the most moving things I have ever been involved with was the global ban on cluster bombs, which are basically like landmines.  The global ban was negotiated here in Ireland because Ireland was free from some of the military-industrial pressures experienced by other countries and was able to lead the way.  It is not a choice between Ireland and our neutrality and Europe.  It is about Ireland being a voice for peace, neutrality and disarmament within Europe.  That is a key point.  It is a service we provide.  It was Eamon Gilmore, a former Irish parliamentarian, who represented the European Commission in Colombia to negotiate the peace deal.  That is because Ireland's neutrality allowed us to have that strong voice.</p> <p>  We cannot turn a blind eye to militarisation.  It is a disservice to Ireland and Europe if we do.  It was very concerning that, just two weeks ago, the European Parliament voted against having oversight of the &euro;13 billion European Defence Fund.  That is the European Parliament choosing not to scrutinise what that fund is spent on.  Will it be on autonomous weapons?  How does it relate to UN mandates?  We must question constantly.  When we have global challenges for Europe and the world like climate change, which we will discuss later, we must ask whether we should be spending &euro;13 billion on European defence.  I do not think so.  Peace and security are put together.  Peace is work.  We know that from the Good Friday Agreement.  The work of peace is about investment in community building, understanding and social exchange.  If we spent some of that &euro;13 billion to build understanding between communities, not just here in Ireland but across the Balkan states which have come out of an experience of war as recently as the 1990s, that would deliver far more than to ramp up military spending on our borders and invest huge amounts in Frontex.  As was mentioned, it is a real concern to see these immigration control deals whereby we are funding border police and military actions in places like Sudan and Libya.  Those are things we need to look to.  These are very important choices.</p> <p>  It is important to note that the current Commission is an outgoing one.  We will have a new European Commission soon and it needs to hear from the witnesses about their priorities.  Among the priorities the outgoing Juncker Commission has brought to today's European Council meeting on the future of Europe, what it calls "protective Europe" is number one.  That means a European defence union.  We must be very clear that there are high-level people in Europe who want a European army.  However, that is not the same thing as saying Europe wants a European army.  There are also brilliant parliamentarians and passionate Europeans from every member state of the EU 27 who want to work together on peace.  That is the narrative we can push and strengthen.  I would love to hear in response what the witnesses think the work of peace should be.  It is not just about saying we do not want militarisation.  What is the work of peace?  That is the work from Good Friday and the work we have seen across the world.  How does Ireland lead the work of peace within Europe to make Europe a champion on human rights and peace?  It is a real choice.  We cannot do that while also spending &euro;13 billion on a European Defence Fund which we do not scrutinise.  We must all challenge these issues because we want Europe to live up to its brilliant and historic past and to shape a better future.  The following point is very important.  In the initial PESCO agreement, the words "peace" and "peacekeeping" were not even used once.  We need something that is not the PESCO agreement but which is rather a European mandate on peace work.  That should be the centrepiece of Europe's next five-year strategy.  I would love to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that work of peace.</p></speech>

I now invite the witnesses to respond to members' questions.  While I do not wish to cut anybody short I ask the witnesses to be conscious that we are running out of time for this particular session.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.723" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cornelia-Adriana Baciu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019050900002#K00200"><p>I will try to address the many interesting questions posed.  On defending ourselves, territorial defence is mandated to NATO.  One of the issues on the agenda for discussion is to what extent EU member states should start thinking more seriously about gaining an element of strategic autonomy and independence from US decision-making.  Territorial defence, leadership and nuclear weapons are some of the points linked with this debate, but many states have been silent on this particular aspect.  There is also the scenario of the US abandonment, which I addressed in my opening statement.  The United States has withdrawn from several multilateral or bilateral agreements.  The US foreign policy narrative might in the future be linked with developments in the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea.  In the case of US inability to provide security guarantees in Europe, the EU should have a plan B and give serious consideration to the territorial defence aspect.</p> <p>  From a rational choice perspective, into the future, the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, for member states will be, probably, a trade-off between utility and strategic choice.  It is important to emphasise that security is a prerequisite and will remain a prerequisite for the other benefits of EU membership, including economic and political benefits.  It is a precondition of other benefits as well.  The major challenges to CSDP in the future will probably be linked to member states' commitment and the robustness of CSDP institutions.  I mentioned the new strategic instruments that are likely to generate new assets and perhaps increase the value of defence co-operation in Europe.</p> <p>  In regard to Irish neutrality, last year I wrote an article on security, multilateralism and Irish neutrality based on debates in the Irish Parliament from 1998 to 2018, which is available online.  One of my key findings was that the concept of Irish neutrality is multifaceted.  I found different concepts associated with it, including positive neutrality, negative neutrality, total neutrality and so on.  Every time there is a debate in Brussels related to security implications, there are intensive debates in the Irish Parliament on the implications for Irish neutrality.  There is informed decision-making on a case-by-case basis.  Surprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, Irish neutrality was found to be strongly linked with UN peacekeeping and stabilisation missions.  From this we could infer that there is a compatibility between the Irish foreign policy and EU foreign policy narrative.  The EU global strategy has been focused on peace and stabilisation missions in fragile states.  Recent statistics show an increase in the support of Irish people for the CSDP.  One explanation for this might be that the Common Security and Defence Policy works at intergovernmental level and it is likely to remain so into the future.  Security might be an area in which intergovernmental co-operation is more effective.  Sovereignty is not transferred at supranational level.  Any change in this regard will require a change in the EU treaty.</p> <p>  On the value added of PESCO, for Ireland the value added is that the capabilities developed under PESCO remain in the possession of member states.  For Ireland this means that capabilities developed under PESCO can be utilised in UN peacekeeping missions and other missions.  As far as I am aware, Ireland has been active in providing personnel and staff to EU and international civilian and military missions since it joined the European Union in 1973.  As of December 2018, there were approximately 650 Irish personnel deployed to such missions.</p> <p>  On Brexit, much of my research recently has been focused on the implications of Brexit.  I recently co-authored a book with my supervisor, Professor John Doyle from DCU, on this subject.  Brexit will transform relationships between the UK and the EU from multilateral to bilateral.  This will have implications for the European Union evolutionary stable equilibrium.  The EU will need to find a way to address this equilibrium to remain stable over time and to be able to cope with so-called atypical sequences or shocks, of which Brexit could be one.  The literature argues that continual change is the prerequisite to remain relevant and competitive.  The implication or consequence of this would be geopolitical adaptation of the EU.  This will have further implications for future transatlantic relations, the EU global strategy and international security as a collective good.</p> <p>  It was mentioned earlier that peace is work.  Modern peace is based on anticipation, resilience and integration of aspects of daily life.  One could imagine modern peace at the intersection of three epistemological debates, international - liberal values; national - nationalist sometimes as a destructive force; and, everyday life level - daily interactions and power relations between people.  We have to see all three sides as knowledge production sides.  Knowledge is very important for concepts such as peace, order, justice, security and so on.  This is, perhaps, a matter we should further address in our research.</p></speech>

Cultural values were disregarded.  Questions were posed in regard to neutrality, PESCO and peace.</p><p>If we look at the culture of all European states, it comprises the cultures of 28 different states, soon to be 27.  These have very different cultural values.  After 70 years of this project, it is time to introduce new ways of looking at things.  It is not always driven by politics and economics, although we are in a political chamber.  It is very important that we look towards cultures.  I am sure most Irish people would not be impressed to hear that we are supporting PESCO.  Claims were made that money we pay into the European budget for defence goes to camps in Libya and so on.  That is not what we anticipated our tax money would be used for.  There are also cultures within Europe that really promote a strong, hard-line defence policy, which we do not.  We are more focused on peacekeeping and neutrality.  There needs to be a balance in how we look at cultures and cultural values.  Only in that way can we address all of the issues that have been brought up.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be here this morning to chair what is a very important session.  I thank all the witnesses for coming before us for what has been a very informative engagement.  I am Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.  This committee was set up to consider the Citizens' Assembly report.  We published a cross-party report on 16 April, which I believe is the beginning of a new era for policy direction with regard to how the State deals with climate change.  As the witnesses will know, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is working on an all-of-Government action plan with regard to rolling out these policy changes, which will be critical for this and future generations.  I will not delay because I know the clock is ticking and my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, is waiting to step in to chair the next session.</p> <p>  Our first speaker is Mr. P&aacute;draig Flattery from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.  We also have Mr. Axel Leahy from the National University of Ireland, Galway, Ms Louise Fitzgerald from University College Dublin, Mr. Connor McGookin from University College Cork, and Ms Caroline Moran from Dublin City University.</p></speech>

I am a PhD student in the ICARUS climate research unit at the Maynooth University department of geography.  My work is a drop in the ocean of climate change research being undertaken around the world every day, all of which bolsters the consensus that climate change is happening, that it is urgent, and that human activities are responsible.<br/><br/>I have been asked to speak today on the topic of climate action and sustainable development.  When I first read the title of this topic, I immediately thought of speeches made by the young Swedish climate activist, Greta Thunberg, who has helped mobilise a generation against the actions of their governments by holding weekly school strikes.  At her recent speeches to the World Economic Forum and the United Nations she told the delegates, &quot;I want you to panic&quot;.  In the brief time I have I will try to explain the scientific basis behind why she wants people to panic, and how climate action and sustainable development must be embraced to create a sustainable future for the next generations.<br/><br/>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, states that we must keep global warming to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change.  Warming of more than 1.5&deg;C increases the likelihood of climate tipping points being triggered.  These tipping points are thresholds that, if exceeded, can fundamentally alter the state of the climate system.  To provide members with an example, one possible consequence of warming above 1.5&deg;C is the thawing of permafrost in the Arctic, a process which is already under way and which releases vast amounts of methane, which is more than 25 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2</sub>, which will result in significant irreversible warming and is likely to trigger the collapse of other systems, including the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.  This ice sheet is already melting more and more each year.  If temperatures increase and the ice sheet reaches a point where it will melt entirely, we will be committed as a planet to a sea level rise of 6 m.  If we allow this to happen, there will be unimaginable global consequences which pose a genuine existential threat to humanity.<br/><br/>When people hear climate scientists speaking about these changes in the Arctic and Greenland, they wonder how it relates to us here in Ireland, but these sea level changes will be felt on a local as well as a global scale and our coastal cities will be threatened.  If we do not take action to prevent this happening, it will not matter which country did not meet its targets or which national interest was prioritised.  We have already warmed by around 1&deg;C, and will reach 1.5&deg;C warming somewhere between 2030 and 2052, meaning we have a decade to make radical changes to our economy and way of life.<br/><br/>The reality is clear.  As members of the EU we are committed to reducing our emissions by 40% compared with 1990 levels by the year 2030, just 11 years from now.  The EU has set the goal of an 80% to 95% reduction in emissions by 2050.  Current Irish policies are not aligned with our goals.  While the EU as a whole will achieve its 2020 emissions target, Ireland will significantly overshoot ours.  This sets us up to fail at achieving our future targets, and the longer we wait, the more difficult it becomes.  We need to encourage sustainable development and ensure all members of society can reduce their carbon footprints by decarbonising public transportation, energy generation and agriculture to give everyone the opportunity to make the right choices regarding their emissions.  While grants for new electric cars are encouraging, how many people can realistically avail of them? The importance of a holistic approach to adaptation is emphasised by a 2018 statement from the IPCC:</p> <blockquote> 	If poorly designed or implemented, adaptation projects in a range of sectors can increase greenhouse gas emissions and water use, increase gender and social inequality, undermine health conditions, and encroach on natural ecosystems [...] These trade-offs can be reduced by adaptations that include attention to poverty and sustainable development  </blockquote> <p>The joint committee&rsquo;s report on climate change and cross-party action echoes this sentiment in its call for a just transition to a green economy. <br/><br/>We need to safeguard the lives of all our future citizens.  We are the first generation to feel the effects of climate change and the last generation who will be able to do anything about it.  Individuals can and do take action, but the onus is on politicians to find solutions, create dialogue, and work towards our common goal of creating a better world for us all.  Sustainable development is not only possible, it is essential if Ireland is to maintain our green reputation on the world stage.  As shown by the committee&rsquo;s recent report, the transition to a green economy is an opportunity for economic growth and job creation in rural and urban Ireland, and ought to be embraced for the benefits it will bring.  The recommendations of the report are far-reaching and inspiring and must be implemented urgently.  They range from citizen-scale efforts to retrofit homes to renewable energy generation to a national push for offshore wind generation and decarbonisation of our economy.<br/><br/>As a direct result of protests by the Extinction Rebellion group, the UK declared a national climate change emergency just last week.  This was closely followed by Wicklow County Council which announced a climate and biodiversity emergency last week.  This shows us that there is hope, but time is running out.</p></speech>

I know members will fully understand my French accent, so it will not disturb them too much.  Climate change is urging us to take actions and to change our way of life radically.  Such actions and policies will require unprecedented levels of collaborative decision-making between all actors in society, including the public.  Yet, voices of local communities are still, in 2019, facing brick walls.  As European citizens, we need to be given the opportunity to participate actively and to have a real input on decisions that have effects on our daily life.</p> <p>  We know the positive effects that public participation can have.  We know, for instance, that local communities can substantially enhance the quality of decisions with locally grounded and value-based knowledge.  We should not see decisions tailored to reduce our vulnerability to climate change as purely technical.  This is not to say that experts should not contribute - their role is crucial - but common technical approaches to decision-making, such as cost-benefit analyses, cannot be the sole remedy to our problems.  Often, the real value of assets and landscapes can hardly be monetised and summarised into graphics, as they will have a deeper value and a deeper meaning to local communities.  Moreover, we should not forget that local communities are situated at the forefront of climate change, being the first to experience damage from storms, flooding, erosion or biodiversity losses.  Why should they then be kept silent?  Public participation is, after all, a democratic right.</p> <p>  The problem is that today's conventional forms of public participation do not work.  First, uploading a document on a website and then asking people to submit comments or suggestions does not guarantee that these submissions will have any effect on the decision.</p><p>Second, and most important, these forms of engagement do not resonate with most people.  Do Members of the Oireachtas believe that people of my age regularly check the websites of their local authorities?  This is the core of the problem.  There is a gap between our decision makers and the public.  This criticism demands that new mediums of participation need to be established in Ireland.  The Citizens' Assembly is a fantastic example that we can build on, but it cannot be limited to that.  Most decisions that affect our everyday lives take place in our communities at a local level.  Should every local authority have its owns citizens' assembly?  Why not?  There are countless examples of successful forms of active participation.  Citizen panels, citizen juries, citizen advisory committees, participatory budgeting, participatory planning, participatory mapping, e-participation and citizen science are forms of active public participation that have proven to be successful around the world.  Why should we limit those examples as isolated case studies rather than trying to make them the common practice?<br/><br/>The ball is in the court of those who represent us.  As we saw recently with the school strikes for climate, many people, especially those from the younger generation, are willing to engage in climate actions.  Strong and ambitious policies need to be implemented at national level to create nationwide structures for public participation and incite local decision makers to abandon the <i>status quo</i>and find innovative ways of engaging directly with their constituents.  Climate change represents one of the greatest challenges of our century.  We desperately need to reduce our carbon emissions and adapt to present and forthcoming impacts of climate change.  Decisions aiming at driving these societal changes cannot take place behind closed doors.  We need to seize climate change as an opportunity to change profoundly the way our democracy works in Ireland and in Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.733" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Louise Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019050900002#M00200"><p>I am speaking not only as an Irish Research Council-funded scholar based at the UCD school of politics and international relations but also as someone who cannot remember a time when I was not faced with fear, anxiety and a deep sense of sadness about the current ecological and climate breakdown, which is already causing pain for millions of people around the world.  This is why I have dedicated the last four years of my life to researching how we can develop effective and successful policies to deal with our climate and sustainable development challenges.  My presentation is based on cutting-edge research within political science as well as dozens of research interviews I have conducted in Germany in an attempt to understand the factors that have helped to underpin the success of Germany's historic energy transition.  I am looking at the factors that help to create policy that is politically and socially acceptable.  This is really the Holy Grail.  I hope to demonstrate how we can make stringent policy without facing electoral penalties.</p> <p>  I will mention a few insights and factors that have the potential to help us in our work.  The first of them underpins what has been said about the importance of citizen-centred energy and green industrial supports.  The key causal mechanism here is something called coalition building, which is essentially about the development of policy that seeks specifically to build coalitions of support for a green policy that allows policy measures to be ratcheted up over time.  The provision of direct industrial incentives to support the growth of particular green industries, such as renewables, is an effective way to build these new coalitions.  This has been borne out in the case of Germany, where it was a main driver of the energy transition.  The expansion of green industrial supports gave citizens access to the energy grid.  A payment for the energy fed into the grid supported the development of citizen-centred and community-centred renewable energies.  This solidified the societal acceptance of energy transitions, which is a key factor in determining our success as we go forward.</p> <p>  A second insight is that carbon-pricing approaches can face significant barriers to effective implementation.  An understanding of the dynamics of the political landscape is necessary in this context.  Carbon pricing incentivises regulatory losers, those who are going to lose out as a result of certain policies, to organise politically to prevent such policies from being implemented, thereby rendering measures difficult to implement and making them no more than marginally effective in the short and medium term.  It can be costly and time-consuming to tweak proposed instruments in order that they can be implemented in any form.  The EU emissions trading system and its related offset schemes have faced significant challenges.  Research indicates that switching to green industrial supports and focusing on such supports as well as on citizen-centred energy faces fewer political barriers and is more conducive to effective and sustainable policymaking.</p> <p>  Clear action on decarbonisation can have a powerful signalling effect and can create a facilitative framework.  Conversely, any moves to build new fossil fuel infrastructure can have lock-in impacts that undermine and derail sustainability transitions.  It is important to note that natural gas infrastructure projects that are planned within the EU's list of projects of common interest, including the planned Shannon liquified natural gas terminal, categorically impede our ability to decarbonise in a timely manner.  Alternatively, research has started to show that supply side policies, such as bans and moratoriums, have significant economic and political advantages compared with demand side policies.  The political advantages of such an approach include superior potential to mobilise public support, including within fossil fuel industries, as well as low administrative and transactional costs.</p> <p>  The EU can provide a framework for developing effective and just pathways to sustainable development and successful climate action.  Countries as small as Ireland can have a substantial impact within this framework.  Much of the work that is being done now involves the development of new norms of behaviour.  This has a powerful contagion effect.  We have an opportunity to implement a dynamic policy for effective climate action and sustainable development, but the window is closing fast.  Climate and ecological breakdown are hitting us faster than was ever predicted.  On our current path, a safe planet for human life will disappear before today's children reach the age of those we are addressing this morning.</p> <p>  No financial argument makes any sense when faced with these facts, regardless of whether it is hedged in terms of budget speak, bureaucratic processes, profits or vested interests.  The survival of all of us and all of those we care about is directly threatened by climate change.  This is not political.  It is a scientific fact that is based on science, physics and the laws of nature.  All Members of the Oireachtas will face important decisions in the coming weeks and months.  I want them to understand that everything they care about will be touched by climate and ecological breakdown.  They need to think about that and act from a place of love when they are making decisions.  Young people are asking politicians to give them a chance to live a dignified life and to have a safe world in which to live.  We are asking them to let us hope.  This is not about us versus them or young people versus politicians.  That is old thinking.  This is about the shared fate of all of us who are interconnected on this planet.  We are in this together for better or for worse, so let us make it better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.734" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Connor McGookin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019050900002#M00300"><p>I thank the committees for the opportunity to speak.  I have three brief points to make.  I will probably echo much of the frustration we heard in the previous statements.  First, climate change policy must be stepped up ambitiously.  Second, there is growing public appetite for climate action.  We have heard about Greta Thunberg.  Third, local actions must be adequately supported.  This should not just be about high-level ambition.  As Deputies and Senators are probably aware, European leaders are meeting in Romania today to discuss the future of Europe.  At this summit, eight countries and 210 cities are urging national leaders and the European Council to adopt a zero emissions target for 2050.  Last November, a report produced by the European Commission set out a number of pathways for achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  This commitment is essential if we are to avoid the apocalyptic narratives of climate change.  It is up to the EU 27 to lead the way.</p> <p>  I would like to mention one example of how Ireland is failing miserably to meet this responsibility.  Last October, a stark warning in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gave us just 11 years to make a meaningful difference.  Embarrassingly, this was followed by a failure to provide in the budget for an increase in carbon tax.  This reflects the lack of political leadership that has slowed the progress of climate policy across the world.  Thanks to a young Swedish girl, a growing movement throughout Europe is now demanding greater government ambition and moving climate policy onto the agenda.  The recent report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which achieved cross-party consensus, was a significant milestone.  The all-of-Government action plan that is being prepared is another important step in the right direction.  The achievement of political consensus is not the final hurdle, however.  We must build from here to secure social consensus.</p> <p>  While high-level ambition is essential, many of us have a lot to learn if we are to understand what this means at local level.  This is the focus of my own research.  I have explored new approaches to energy system modelling and planning that account for local values and perceptions.  As Mr. Leahy pointed out, there is a need to address some of the flaws in the planning and decision-making processes that can lead to opposition to infrastructural projects like large-scale wind developments and overhead pylons.  In 2015, the White Paper on energy mentioned that there was an "increasing recognition of the value that effective communication and a participative approach between developer, local community and local authority can bring to the development of energy infrastructure".</p><p>This has been echoed in recent policy with repeated references to phrases like "energy citizen" or "community engagement".  I imagine we can all agree this is a welcome narrative and is undoubtedly important for the energy transition.</p><p> However, within communities, several constraints are hindering meaningful progress.  I will list some of the key challenges and opportunities.  These have been compiled from my personal research and that of some of my colleagues.  First, volunteers are required, but depending on them will not be adequate.  As local champions these people are often part of several community groups and are already stretched.  The existing community networks represent a major opportunity but must be engaged in a respectful manner.  Second, I reiterate that core funding is needed.  Regular funding must be made available for the administration and co-ordination of community energy groups if they are to function effectively.  Third, until policy barriers in the form of tariffs, planning, finance and grid access are addressed, it will be unhelpful and perhaps counterproductive to continuously talk up community ownership of energy.  The final point is closest to my heart.  Community energy does not guarantee community acceptance but a more transparent and inclusive decision-making processes can help ease tensions and inspire positive action.</p><p> I will summarise my contribution.  I have noted the need for European leadership in stepping up ambition.  I touched on the noticeable growth in public appetite for meaningful climate action.  National leadership, extensive local engagement and clear benefits for communities are essential in driving the energy transition.</p></speech>

Last September, I began studying in DCU on the climate change masters programme.  I have always been interested in reading up on environmental news and over several years I have become increasingly concerned about climate change and environmental degradation.  Since beginning the course two things have happened.  I have realised how bad the situation is, but also that there is still hope.  It has hit home for me that there needs to be a fundamental change in our society if we are to tackle this problem in the short time there is left to effectively halt the worst of what could happen.<br/><br/>Ireland is rightly seen to be at the back of the pack.  However, the recent report from the Joint Committee on Climate Action is a welcome step in the right direction.  We can learn much from our European counterparts about what has worked and what has not.  We can build on these in an Irish context.<br/><br/>Effectively communicating the challenges and opportunities to citizens is the most important step.  There is a lot of fear and misunderstanding regarding climate change.  Public debate on what must happen to transition to a low-carbon economy is essential.  We need to have open conversations in the media and at the dinner table about how we must change the <i>status quo</i>and the best ways to do this for our local communities and large-scale industries.<br/><br/>I look forward to an all-of-Government action plan, as I believe it will help drive the public debate in a meaningful way to give the general public clear guidance on what is being proposed and how it will affect them personally and society as a whole.<br/><br/>The announcement by Bord na M&oacute;na last October of the loss of more than 400 jobs in the midlands shows the need for extensive planning and programmes to retrain workers or aid in job replacement schemes for those who will be most affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy.  Last October, the Spanish Government and coal miner unions reached a transition deal.  It offered early retirement or retraining for coal miners who are to lose their jobs as the industry is scaled back.  This is an example of good practice that can be repeated in an Irish context.  Some industries will be disproportionately affected, such as agriculture and peat production, while there will be more opportunities for green jobs elsewhere and these must be embraced.  Workers who believe their livelihoods are being threatened need to be engaged in what happens but at a community level there must be a discussion as well.  The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, campaigning on a green new deal platform, won the recent Spanish elections with up to 50% of the vote in some mining towns.  The party had worked with the coal miners unions previously.<br/><br/>Recently, there has been a surge in social activism around climate change, such as the school strikes for climate and the extinction rebellion.  I went to the two events held in Dublin.  As a former teacher, I know how hard it can be to motivate teenagers, but at the school strike, I was moved by the enthusiasm students showed that day.  At the extinction rebellion protest, I was inspired by the diversity of participants who showed up.  These movements show that the public are becoming increasingly aware of climate change, biodiversity loss and the general destruction of the natural world that is occurring at an unprecedented rate.  There has never been a better time to engage the public on the urgency of the crisis facing our planet.  Small-scale actions that individuals can take will not be enough without large-scale actions and policies by governments.  The EU, Ireland included, must lead the way and take bold unmitigated action now, with engaged citizens at the core of this transition.  The release earlier this week of the global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services is another stark reminder that our current system is failing and putting life on earth at risk.  The technology to make the shift is in place.  The financial risk will lessen the sooner we take action.  The public will to act has never been stronger.  It is time to change.</p></speech>

I will go to my colleagues with questions.  The witnesses might note the questions and then whoever wants to come in can answer them.  Is it okay if we proceed that way?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The witnesses have raised some important and key issues that the Joint Committee on Climate Action has been considering during the past seven months.  Ms Fitzgerald mentioned one of our key concerns, which is the price of carbon.  Although it was only a small part of our work, it was a key concern in respect of protecting the most vulnerable.  We considered the need to be politically palatable in bringing people with us and not making the mistakes we have made in other areas in engagement in with the community and bringing people on board.  That is why these conversations are important for us.  We have a body of work to complete and we can see that.  This is only the start.  Community engagement and how we communicate to the citizen are important.  We must protect the most vulnerable and those facing fuel poverty.  Key sectors will find the transition hardest, including the peat industry, the farming community and rural communities.  These are key areas that we have to work on as well.</p> <p>  I am keen to hear of any of the witnesses want to expand on what we can do in respect of the price of carbon.  They will have seen from our report how we are conscious of protecting those affected and the need to have a short, sharp engagement on the issue of the price of carbon and the key sectors that will be affected.  What else needs to be done on the regulatory and policy side?  What is the nature of the regulatory and policy mix needed for that to be a success?  That is one key component.</p> <p>  There was a major emphasis in all the contributions on new mediums of participation.  Mr. Leahy mentioned this and the question of community engagement.  This again is a whole-of-society approach.  The Government has a role to play but we cannot do it all; it has to be within the community as well.  One issue we have faced as elected representatives is that when we want to put in place renewable energy projects there is local opposition.  We talk about communities coming together feeding into the grid, tapping into the grid and selling their own electricity back into the grid.  We need to unlock the planning regulations.  The issues goes beyond acceptance.  If the witnesses have any more insights, I would be grateful to hear them.</p> <p>  I will bring in my colleagues now.  Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy and Senator M&aacute;ire Devine are first.  We will then hear from Deputy Tom Neville.</p></speech>

They will not find any argument from this side in respect of the challenge facing us all nationally and globally in terms of trying to halt global warming.</p> <p>  Mr. McGookin talked about reaching into local communities.  I wonder if he has looked at whether public participation networks are a good starting point.  I attended an event recently in my county of Offaly.  The public participation network there established Green Offaly, which is a great initiative.  Should initiatives like this be happening throughout the country?  It is something the Joint Committee on Climate Action discussed and recommended.</p> <p>  Ms Caroline Moran referred to Bord na M&oacute;na.  I am from Offaly.  A just transition is something that we are anxious to ensure.  Has she been keeping track of the efforts Offaly County Council has made recognising the challenges to the communities involved and the workers?  We need to bring together all the stakeholders to ensure that the workers involved are aware of all the benefits for them in terms of social protection as well as the opportunities for retraining and upskilling.  An event is being planned for the week after next.  It is a job-matching initiative in which local companies will come together with the workers who are taking voluntary redundancy.</p><p>There are many positives.  Other areas could learn from it.  Is Ms Moran keeping track of this?  It is important that we be aware of such efforts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.741" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1388" speakername="Maire Devine" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019050900002#O00200"><p>I thank the witnesses.  I am still a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  We were the black sheep of the committee when we voted against the carbon tax.  The committee has done 90% of its work collaboratively, but we were concerned about the just transition and the tax's imposition on less fortunate people who are struggling.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to expand on another point.  There is an emergency in our public health system because of climate change, and it will be even more harmful for communities tomorrow.  This is about communicating with communities not only about heatwaves, floods, storms and the resultant deaths, but about the day in, day out worldwide epidemic of asthma, respiratory tract infections and diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD.  Many of these have to do with pollution, for example, the quality of the water that we drink.  According to the World Health Organization, WHO, this threat costs many billions of dollars and causes millions of deaths per year.  The WHO believes that will only increase.  Should we declare this an emergency alongside climate change?</p> <p>  We have received representations from the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA.  It made an important statement that has stuck with me, namely, that we must rethink how we feed the world.  In the 1960s and 1970s, we did not have meat with every meal.  We could not afford it, as it was a luxury.  However, it has become so commonplace now that we expect it even though it is responsible for much of the destruction of the environment and our bodies' health.</p> <p>  When one sits down in a canteen, bistro or caf&eacute;, everything is packaged.  When did we stop being communal and sharing sugar bowls and milk jugs?  These simple points seem stupid, but they are down to hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, legislation.  We must revisit it, as it is so clinical and clean that it is damaging us, in that we are not being exposed to stuff and material is being wasted.  It is nonsensical that we all just sit around with sachets that we tear apart, adding to the destruction.  The global scale is larger, but I am interested in this matter.</p></speech>

I sat on the Joint Committee on Climate Action and, hopefully, will sit on a permanent version chaired by the Co-Chairman, Deputy Naughton.</p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses' presentations.  I went on a great journey of discovery during the eight months that I sat on the committee.  My knowledge of the parameters and facets of this issue was minuscule.  The witnesses are preaching to the converted as regards the necessary timelines and actions.</p> <p>  I was struck by the question of consultation and building coalitions raised in one of the presentations.  That is paramount to our success.  If we do not build a coalition and agreement across all parties and sectors of society, there will be a knee-jerk kickback.  Be it political or something else, it will be a "Them" and "Us" response that could set us back ten or 15 years or even a generation.  We do not want that.</p> <p>  Our committee viewed public consultation as paramount.  I was interested to hear about how an industry coalition was built on the ground in Germany, but Ireland needs to go to an even more micro level.  Since we have a smaller population, we are a more integrated society.  For example, managing directors of companies have siblings who are farmers or teachers.  As such, we wanted to propose town hall-type meetings that would involve peer-to-peer and community learning involving people from all sectors of society - young and old, farmers and doctors, unemployed people, those in receipt of disability payments and so on.  They would educate one another from the bottom up or at the same level.  Politicians taking a top-down approach will not work.  Europe and America have kicked back at such an approach.  We must alter our communication style.  That will be paramount in coalition building.  It will require maturity, not only from people, but also from political parties.  The latter must take a step back from the politics and build a coalition of consensus to drive this through.  I would be interested in hearing more about the coalition building that happened in Germany.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.746" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019050900002#O00700"><p>I welcome our guests, who have spoken passionately.  These are issues that we considered in significant depth in writing our report.  Action is needed.  The requirement that we live more sustainably, which we have not been doing for years, is at the heart of this.  It is the fallout of industrialisation and so on.  If people were surveyed, everyone would agree with the targets under the Paris Agreement.  It is only when one starts to drill down into who will take the pain and cost that a problem arises.  That is what we must address if we want to see action.  As Deputy Neville stated, though, there must be a consensus.</p> <p>  Recently, I attended a climate action forum of secondary schools in my county of Mayo that was facilitated by the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, the county council and the latter's climate action officer.  We were sitting around a table and one of the issues debated was that of cost.  In terms of transport, for example, we talked about how, if the pupils' parents had to get electric vehicles, it would cost them money regardless of how large a grant the State provided.  The same would be the case with heating systems.  When I asked them if they believed that would be acceptable, they could not say that it would be.</p> <p>  There is another political reality.  No matter what people say in the abstract about targets and the need to take action, the experience in Canada, Australia, Finland, France and Germany has been that, when politicians take political action, a large number of people do not agree with doing so.  It does not mean that we should balk at trying to do the right thing, as we cannot continue taking from the Earth something that will not be replenished and will cause greenhouse gas emissions.  We are smarter now and have more technology.  We must be smarter and live more smartly.  However, the idea that everyone is in agreement is incorrect.  It is not even that they do not believe that there is climate change.  Rather, they are more concerned with living in the here and now than with taking on additional pressures.  If someone is in receipt of social welfare payments, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, can fund 100% of certain energy efficiency works on his or her house.  If someone is earning a low income and, accordingly, will only receive partial supports, he or she will be under pressure.  These are the people who will be financing their children going to college.  From where will that money come?  The bill will be significant.  That is even evident from our social housing programme, given the additional cost of building houses.  People are revolting against costs.  That does not take from the witnesses' message, but we must refine our discussion to listening to people's concerns.</p> <p>  I have raised an issue previously and, while I do not want to labour the point, it must be borne in mind that when the witnesses refer to the measures that are necessary to tackle climate change, they are asking for more to be done by people living in rural areas.  They are asking rural areas to take wind farms and grid infrastructure.  They are asking for peat-burning power stations to be shut down.  Where I am from, such a station closed a number of years ago.  The area is only a shadow of its former itself economically.</p><p>The issue of community gain is very relevant there.</p><p> There is also the issue of farming and the speaker from Teagasc earlier made a sensible proposition.  We are very well suited to producing protein from dairy and beef.  It does not mean that we continue exactly in the same vein but this is not discussed.  There is now a situation where farmers are saying they have been doing all of this.  The national herd has increased and that is why our greenhouse gases and emissions of methane have increased but farmers are farming more efficiently than ever before.  They are put to the pin of their collars by payments on environmental measures, water quality and biodiversity.  They have an appetite to do more but feel persecuted.  People are disengaging.</p><p> I will say one final thing.  The generation coming after us ask us to look at what we are doing.  The reality is that the parents of the children I was talking to would give their left arms for their children.  Their grandparents would do the same.  The generations that have come before are trying to cope and do their best.  They care and want to be given credit for that.  We have to get realistic solutions which balance idealism with the reality to achieve them and not crush people in the process.  </p><p> We will have a revolution.  It will not be like those revolting in London who are from more middle class backgrounds and have time on their hands.  The ordinary person will revolt which will create another set of problems that will set us back economically.  We cannot take from the advances and lifestyles we enjoy.  We must find technology to match that.</p><p> The last speaker on the environment was positive and hopeful, as I am.  Human beings have great capacity to innovate and, although there will always be issues and problems, there can be business opportunities here.  We see a lot of signals sent out by China and India, major emerging economies, that they have to go to green technology and transport etc.  Ireland has to take these signals if it wants to participate in the global economy.  We must also be clever.   It is not only about misery, it is about opportunities and living in a different way.</p></speech>

I campaigned with Tr&oacute;caire on climate change in 2008 when a group of young activists, who are no longer young, were demanding action.  Even then, climate change was not new and there were huge impacts on many parts of the world and many communities were seeing their futures destroyed.</p><p>It is good that there is momentum now and climate change is centre stage in discussions.  Europe Day is about Europe and the real test will be if Europe will place the sustainable development goals and climate change actions at the centre of the new five-year European strategy.  Will they also be at the centre of the multiannual financial framework, the European budget?  Simply putting climate action front and centre for photos at the moment will not be enough.  </p><p>The European Investment Bank put &euro;11 billion into fossil fuels between 2007 and 2013.  The European climate action fund is proposed to be &euro;5 billion.  I want people to discuss the balance between where we invest and how we can stop taking backward steps.</p><p>One of the speakers mentioned the LNG terminal which is an example of something that was funded by European investment funding.  How do we get that joined up?  It comes down to public participation.  </p><p>I am passionate about new forms of participation and we need them.  I like the idea of town hall meetings, I think they are important, and I also think people should be looking at their local authority's development plans and putting in opinions.  That is important.  It is crucial to ask how we ensure the public discussion does not stay in a silo as a separate discussion on climate, but rather bring climate action into the economic discussion around budgets.  We need to ensure that closed-door economic decisions such as trade agreements and procurement are joined up and informed by climate considerations.  We need not to have any backward steps.  I would like to hear the comments of the speakers on that matter.</p><p>Another consideration is the comparative roles of the public and private sectors which was touched on by some of the speakers.  For example, it might be tempting to support the electric car industry because it has the potential to make profit whereas public transport might not, but public transport might lead us to make much greater progress much more quickly.  There will be things that will cost money and will not necessarily be profitable but, if we do not take the action now, the cost will be borne elsewhere in the world and by those most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>That brings us to the question of carbon pricing.  I am on the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection and am very passionate about just transition.  We must not wait for people to become redundant from sectors that are no longer sustainable but need to talk to them while they are still employed about their plans for the future.  I have been arguing for that in the context of just transition.  We must manage the pragmatic issues around just transition in Ireland and look to climate justice on a global level so we not only address the concerns in Ireland but look to climate justice for other parts of the world.</p><p>The price of carbon is artificially low and needs to be higher.  The price has driven an unsustainable global development model.  Do we make social protection payments?  Fuel poverty payments will get us to a certain level but, as was rightly said, many people on low incomes will not be caught by the fuel supplement.  How do we recognise and ensure that industry is reflecting the price of carbon and does not have artificially deflated prices because of artificially deflated carbon costs while ensuring that individuals are not taking the worst of the impacts?  Those are the key questions.  Perhaps we should look at bans, moratoriums and levies on sectors.</p><p>I will conclude because I want to hear the responses of the speakers.  It comes back to the question of business as usual.  Where do we frontload?  Can we, and should we, balance keeping interests aligned while ensuring that we do not wait for certain climate actions to become profitable?<b></b>We have to frontload it.  All of the speakers had practical thoughts on how we do that.  </p><p>My key questions relate to climate justice, just transition, the public and private spheres and how to ensure this is an economic transformation as well as a social movement.</p></speech>

There is a great deal we can do on climate change in a relatively short time.  We are supposed to achieve certain targets within ten years and it is well within our capacity to achieve them in that time period even though we are late starters.</p> <p>  The first thing we had to do was to convince people of the necessity to change and become less reliant on fossil fuels.  As we do that, we must also become less reliant on the electricity generated from fossil fuels.  Once we have crossed that part of the divide, the rest will follow readily.  There is serious interest in electric cars this year where there was no such interest in the past.</p> <p>  Some of us have, over the past number of years, tried to sell the idea of alternative energy and the renewable energy sector and been publicly criticised and ridiculed for it.  That is part of the battle we must face into.  We must balance our approach, try to ensure that we do not target part of our community, or be seen to do so, in our journey towards achieving the necessary change.  We have the capacity to do that, provided we do it right, and avoid the possibility of postponing forever something we need to start doing now.</p></speech>

The first point made was about carbon tax and we looked at that and what it would mean to raise the weekly allowance in order to offset the extra &euro;10.</p><p>It was something like &euro;4 in the winter and &euro;2 in the summer.  We will revert to the committee as we have some figures on that.  It would not hit the people in fuel poverty.  Much of what comes from our research must account for fuel poverty.</p><p> Climate change is a cross-cutting matter and there were questions as to how to overcome the problems.  There are significant benefits to dealing with climate change, particularly in the rural sector, and I hope dealing with climate change would address many of the problems of rural degradation and help to revive many rural areas.  It would help farmers through diversification of income by generating electricity, growing other crops or being paid for the carbon captured in their forests.  Reforestation would be a major part of achieving carbon neutrality, along with restoring wetlands.</p><p> Public participation networks were a recommendation in the report from the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which is why I left them out of my bullet points.  I certainly agree that we need such town hall meetings and there is an attempt to achieve this with the national dialogue on climate change.  It is important to capacity building in communities to have access to impartial experts who can point to the facts and challenges being faced.  It is about open discussion.  My research in the Dingle peninsula relates to this if the members are interested.</p><p> Somebody mentioned going through the local authority and we thought that if we could follow the example of the UK and Wicklow in declaring a climate emergency, local authorities should have it as a top priority to have a climate change officer who would be able to advise homeowners or community groups.  It is an important element in building capacity, which has been mentioned quite often.  There was mention of the middle class accessing grants.  It is a major problem.  I know in Australia, poorer people were basically subsidising richer people getting solar panels put on their homes.  We must be careful to avoid such things.</p></speech>

As has been mentioned, it is really important that there should be plans in place before peat production is closed so workers can have options in what they do afterwards.  If there is to be a change, those workers need different options and time to think.  At a community level there must be thought on what new industries can be brought in to benefit the entire community.</p> <p>  There was mention of carbon tax and feed-in tariffs for solar photovoltaic equipment, which is really important.  The uptake of solar photovoltaic technology in countries with feed-in tariffs has been huge.  If there is fuel poverty or people have low incomes without supplements, they could get profits from a feed-in tariff rather than just a grant.  Retired people in their homes during the day may use electricity while it is generated and therefore it would cut their costs.  Conversely, if people are at work all day they do not get the benefit of energy that is being produced but they would see a benefit through a feed-in tariff.  They would get the money back.  Such a process could work, especially in rural communities.  We have spoken much about farmers and if they are leaving land spare, there could be large-scale solar photovoltaic installations to generate income as well.  We need to be creative in what we do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.760" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Louise Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019050900002#Q00400"><p>With regard to coalition building, I am speaking to this new dynamic understanding of policy that is coming out of social and political science research and how we can harness the feedback effects of policy and understanding the political landscape.  This goes beyond just public consultation, which is also a good step.  This is also about what policy choices we make and the outcomes and effects they have.  To underline what has already been said, feed-in tariffs, for example, have the effect of building powerful coalitions.  In Germany there were all sorts of actors who became supportive of the policy and really tried to protect it, including people who may not necessarily have been green-minded.  They support it being ratcheted up.</p> <p>  It is really important to note the social dimension.  We have seen the yellow vest movement in France and what happens when we do not have this lens in implementing the decarbonisation policy.  There was mention of a just transition and this should not be about climate action versus farmers or peat workers.  Farmers are on the front line of climate change and they are already experiencing it.  We have seen that with the fodder crisis.  The fossil fuel age is collapsing and one way or another, peat workers will see an impact from climate change policy.  We must achieve this in a just way.</p> <p>  I will speak briefly to carbon pricing.  As I stated, I am drawing on an understanding of policy dynamics.  Carbon pricing should be seen as one of many tools in a policy mix.  One of the issues is the need to build alternatives and allow people to have alternatives through something like a feed-in tariff.  To draw on a German case, there was a delay in trying to implement carbon pricing through the emissions trading system and, essentially, there was neglect of the areas of transport, heating and the idea of a more systemic just transition.  Now the country is facing the consequences, so we would do well to learn from their mistakes and not have this happen with carbon price implementation in Ireland.  Green industrial support, citizen energy, bans and moratoriums can be used.  The paper I quoted was by Mr. Fergus Green and Dr. Richard Denniss from 2017 and it is available online.  They argue that supply-side bans have a host of advantages and gain much support, including from actors like the fossil fuel industry, which we might not expect.</p> <p>  Citizen energy feeds into the transformative elements and resilience in communities and globally.  It builds more community resilience and this enables communities to face climate change issues.  That work comes from people like Mr. Craig Morris.  There is a need to look locally but also globally at what is coming.  People in Mozambique are panicking, for example, and people across the global South already facing the impact of climate change are panicking.  We would do well to respond right now to what we are all facing.</p></speech>

We could speak about this for hours and all the information has almost given me a headache.  There is one point that has been mentioned a few times and it relates to consultation.  It is one type of participation but this cannot just be about consultation.  According to my research, many different authors and academics have stated that typical formal consultation does not work.  Submissions may not be taken into account with a final decision and there is also the question of when consultation happens.  Does it happen when all the options are closed and if so, how efficient can that be?  There is the question of timing in participation.</p> <p>  I can give a brief example.  Last year the national adaptation framework was published in January and it marked the first step in a process of building national adaptation for different sectors and local authorities.  It was put out for consultation in September 2017 and there were 27 or 28 submissions.  It was not a very high number.  The submissions are available online and only four were submitted by private individuals not representing an organisation or State agency.  This demonstrates a problem.  Is the general public just not interested in those policies or is there a lack of communication in advertising those formal consultation processes?  It is something we must be aware of and we probably need to go a step further than just consultation.  It would amount to considerable responsibility for local authorities but this needs to happen at a local level.</p></speech>

There is certainly a need to panic as we are missing our targets for 2020 and we are set up to miss the 2030 targets.  If by 2050 we are to be carbon-neutral or reduce our emissions by 80% or 100%, we are not on track to do it, even if we implement many of the recommendations of the report.</p> <p>  To focus on agriculture, my research was on soils and soil carbon in Ireland, taking into account the effect of extreme weather on those soils.  Our natural grasslands are carbon sinks because they are grazed by cattle and they provide minerals for the soil.  Those soils are carbon sinks in the same way that our untouched peatlands are.  There are 7 million cows in Ireland producing methane.</p><p>I do not understand how we square getting to carbon neutrality by 2050 with retaining that number of cows.  We need also to recognise the benefit the cows have to the soil.  These are complex issues and communicating their complexity is very important, especially if we do not want an "us versus them" strategy coming out.  Farmers are certainly looking after their land to the best of their ability as they want to pass it on to future generations.  Focusing on the complexities of the issue is important but so is recognising the limitations of our current actions.  </p></speech>

I especially welcome the three speakers for this section, Ms Sara Thompson from UCD, Ms Laura Bartley from DCU and Ms Maeve Richardson from UCC.  It has been a very interesting and illuminating morning for the members listening to all of the witnesses' contributions.  I also welcome the presence of an ever-depleting number of my colleagues from the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  Such is the draw on all our time here in the Houses.  I represent two Ulster counties, Cavan and Monaghan, and have been Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality since 2016.</p> <p>  Migration is the final topic of today's session marking Europe Day 2019.  This is a very important topic, especially on this day, for as Europeans we have known the reality of migration, most often forced migration due to war, conflict, famine, disease and escape from poverty across the centuries.  It is beyond dispute that the people of Ireland have known migration and its causes like few others across the Continent.  This generational awareness, experience and knowledge should contribute to our being a truly welcoming people, giving truth to the claim that this is an Ireland of the welcomes.  Sadly, of course, this is not always the case.  </p> <p>  While we have some time issues, there will be no restriction in respect of the three speakers.  If I have to restrict anybody it will be my colleague, Senator Devine.  I call on Ms Thompson to address us.</p></speech>

I will present some facts and numbers and some challenges that the EU is facing in respect of migration.  The 2015 migration crisis became a starting point to a wider debate on migration in the European Union but also on burden sharing and the member states' responsibilities.  The lack of joint action between the member states has shown that in 2015 the EU was unprepared to handle this issue, which resulted in disorderly migration, human trafficking and tragedy.  In respect of the numbers, 2.5 million immigrants entered the EU from non-EU countries in 2017; and 4.4% of people living in the EU on 1 January 2018 were non-EU citizens, which is 22 million people out of a total of 512 million.  The European agency for human rights has pointed out that the number of irregular migrants crossing the borders dropped in 2017, when 200,000 people crossed the EU borders, in comparison to approximately 500,000 in 2016.  The number of deaths at sea has also dropped; however, the emergency remains as the deaths are continuing, mainly in the central Mediterranean.</p> <p>  Also concerning is the fact that migrants arriving within EU borders have been mistreated.  This mistreatment worsened in 2017 with Bulgaria, Hungary and Croatia as the leading countries of migrant mistreatment.  Another issue is the relocation of immigrants and the problem of overcrowding.  This has been critical in numerous locations, especially in Greece, France and Italy.  Providing adequate housing remains a challenge and the lack of co-operation between member states has a significant impact on how immigration is handled in the EU.  The European Council established a temporary relocation scheme with a plan to relocate 160,000 people in need.  This was not accomplished due to lack of co-operation from the member states.  President Antonio Tajani has stated that migration is our biggest challenge and that it is putting at risk the very future of the European Union.  As a result of intense migration within the EU in recent years, EU internal borders have been subject to additional border controls, which is putting the free movement of EU citizens at risk.  There is a need for better co-operation between member states with regard to border management as the migration crisis has put major pressure on the member states' border authorities.  The European institutions responded with a call for strengthening the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, however this remains a work in progress, with a plan of giving the agency a standing corps of 10,000 border guards by 2027, which is a bit far away.  A Eurobarometer survey has reported that 73% of European citizens want the EU to do more on the issue of migration and 58% described EU action on migration as inadequate.  There is a need to do more on the part of both member states and the EU as a whole.  Reaching agreement on migrant issues has been a challenge for the European Union.  It is a sensitive issue and member states have different views and policies on migration, making it difficult to negotiate co-ordinated common positions.  The migration crisis in 2015 showed that the EU was not prepared to handle a humanitarian crisis.  Plans to relocate migrants, strengthen the borders, integrate refugees and much more are still a work in progress.</p> <p>  Member states and their representatives have to become aware of the next upcoming crisis, which is climate displacement.  This crisis is not spoken about or understood by many.  It is not defined or backed by international law.  It is true that civil war and unrest in Syria, Libya and the Middle East are reasons for the migrant crisis but there are deeper reasons for current migration from these places.  These areas are experiencing rainfall patterns, unbearably high temperatures, floods, droughts and all sorts of natural disasters which lead to major changes in farming, fishing and herding, causing migration from these areas to more developed ones.  Reports on climate displacement presented by the EU are often very generalised and do not provide clear solutions to the problem.  Following the 2015 migration crisis, it is clear that member states are not united with regard to burden sharing and this has to be addressed in order to prepare Europe and help those in need.  </p> <p>  I will present a couple of recommendations made by the Mary Robinson Foundation on Climate Justice in its 2016 position paper.  Above EU national level, the rights of climate displaced people have to be respected in the same way as human rights in general.  The burdens in respect of dealing with climate migration have to be addressed together as a Union.  There is a need for engagement with already displaced people but also with those who are vulnerable to climate displacement, in order to protect the rights of people who are at risk of climate displacement.  The most important action the countries can take is to reduce the impact of climate change at all costs.  This will reduce the threats in areas at risk.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.768" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Bartley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019050900002#R00500"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it.  As a younger citizen, I am particularly grateful for this opportunity to engage on such a timely policy issue.  My knowledge is based on my European-funded research at Dublin City University, the University of Glasgow and Charles University, Prague.  My research focuses on migration to Europe, specifically the power of the media and policy makers to shape public opinion.  My current research examines the ways in which migration has been constructed as a threat and questions the dominance of this threat-centric approach.</p> <p>  It is without doubt that international migration and issues surrounding migrants, refugees and asylum seekers can be seen as defining characteristics of the 21st century in an era of globalisation.  In the context of conflict and growing inequalities, the IOM's 2018 report estimates that there are 258 million international migrants globally.  Ireland's strong cultural memory and historic trend to emigration mean that we are acutely aware of the realities of migration and displacement.</p><p>Yet more recently, Ireland has experienced increased inward migration and has become an increasingly diverse society with the 2016 census indicating that the 535,000 non-Irish nationals living in Ireland originate from 200 different nations.  Such figures illustrate the increased diversity and prompt the need to examine political and societal attitudes to immigrants, and explore different ways to support integration and social cohesion within Irish and European society.</p><p> The first challenge I will address relates to the power of language and narrative.  Migration has remained one of the most divisive issues for the public in recent years and this is reflected in the polarised narratives and language which frame discussions.  Past decades have seen a language shift from emigrant and immigrant to the use of the word "migrant" which has effect of de-contextualising the experience of these people by removing their home location and their destination.  There is also selectivity in respect of those to whom we apply these terms which often indicates a hierarchy of worthiness, suggesting that we have "good" versus "bad" migrants.</p><p> The language we use matters.  It has power to reinforce negative stereotypes and racial hierarchies which permeate to every level of society.  As such we must recognise and challenge harmful, polarising language and myths regarding migration.  We must refrain from using terms such as "illegal migrant" in any forum of discussion and instead use "irregular" or "undocumented".  We must commit to increased engagement in order to confront the myths of migration at local, national and EU levels.</p><p> There is a need to engage in difficult discussions regarding migration for policy makers, journalists and activists to maintain credibility.  We must create a space where communication of the perceived and actual challenges of migration is possible, but not in a way which stigmatises or alienates communities.  The creation of action plans and strategies by Government and local authorities, such as the migrant integration strategy or even the UN migration pact convey effective messages which are honest, fair and accessible.</p><p> The second challenge I wish to address is promoting integration in communities.  There is increasing recognition of the inherent potential of diverse society.  There is also an awareness of the difficulties associated with integration policies and programmes.  The dilemma often relates to how to prioritise integration without fuelling unfairness among certain groups that feel left behind.  Research has shown that encounters with the reality of migration foster a more tolerant mindset within host communities, which needs to be looked at further.</p><p> In discussions on the topic of integration, it is often said that the process is a two-way street involving the host community and the newcomer.  However, we need to move away from this binary give-and-take view of integration, as it does not always capture the complex, multifaceted and dynamic process which involves a network of actors and interactions.  As such we must disrupt the preconceptions that contribute to a gap between the expectation and reality of migration.  We must do this through promoting intercultural competency and integration programmes, such as arts and language acquisition, for all members of society.  We must aim to equip all citizens with the education to gain empathy and perspective-taking skills.</p><p> We must view the integration process in the context of the whole of society and facilitate the undoing of notion of "us" versus "them".  We must broaden the view of immigration beyond simply contributing to GDP or market growth.  It is not just about financially benefiting from migration, but about the overall health of our societies over the next generation.  In addition we need to carry out further research into attitudes towards diversity and integration within Irish and European society, such as the recent ERSI study.</p><p> With the immense challenges facing European and Irish society, such as changing demographics, political fragmentation, labour market changes and the pace of political and social changes, we need to have broader perspectives on the challenges we are facing and also an ambitious vision of what our future communities may look like.</p><p> We should not think of integration as an endpoint, but to understand it as an ongoing, inclusive process which provides opportunities and builds resilience in communities to confront the growing range of future challenges, not just in respect of migration.</p><p> I look forward to hearing the committee's views.</p></speech>

I am honoured to be addressing the committee today.  I am a BSc student in University College Cork in the second year of my undergraduate studies.  Appropriately we are speaking on Europe Day about a month before the European Parliament elections.  Given the changes in the political climate, it is now more important than ever to use the ballot box to have our voices heard in Europe.</p> <p>  The Treaty of Rome established the freedom of movement in respect of goods, services, capital and, what seems to be getting most attention lately, the movement of people, as we have seen from our colleagues in the European Union.  Migration has many different definitions and comes in many types, including economic migrants, refugees and ex-pats.  The perception of migration is intriguing as to whether it is harmful or positive, and what are its economic effects and difficulties.  Many people see the advantages of labour gaps being filled and society becoming more diverse.  We also see the negativity that jobs are being take away by members of the migrant community or that there is a social pressure on civic services along with an increase in racism and discrimination.</p> <p>  The cross-national Role of European Mobility and its Impacts in Narratives, Debates and EU Reforms, REMINDER, study shows that more than half of EU citizens regard the freedom of movement as positive for Europe despite an increase in support for far-right parties which has the effect of making mainstream parties take tougher stances on immigration.  European countries tend to view the effects of migrants in two ways - cultural and economic.  More recently we are starting to think about safety and terrorism.  The REMINDER study took place across seven countries in western Europe.  Apart from the UK, most countries showed more than 50% in favour of the freedom of movement.  These viewed most immigrants to western European as beneficial and not an economic or cultural threat.  Africans were viewed as most threatening to the economy while Middle Eastern migrants were considered the most threatening to safety and culture.  This has been as a result of the image of migrants portrayed in our media.</p> <p>  Europeans perceive that migrants from outside Europe make up 16.7% of the EU population.  The reality is that it is about 4.4% as of January 2018.  The representation of migrants in the media has had a profound effect on how we view our migrants.  The media provide both a human face in the form of refugees but also a mild terror attack in the form of big news headlines which terrify us.</p> <p>  Migration is an important topic for us all.  It has been shown to be a top priority for countries in the southern coastal part of Europe, namely in Croatia, Italy and Greece.  It is not so much of an issue in Ireland and is not a voter priority.  This is mainly due to the fact in the late 2010s it is shown that the majority of non-EU migrants arrive by sea.</p> <p>  Our landscape is changing through climate change and we need to become proactive rather than reactive if we are to prepare for another migrant crisis such as we saw in 2015.  We need to make sure that with coming of an EU army we are not creating a fortress Europe but rather creating a Europe that is open to all and not just Europeans.</p></speech>

This is not my area of expertise.  The Seanad has a public consultation committee.  In the autumn I plan on opening a conversation by inviting representatives from the direct provision system, which is a shame and stain on our country.  I would like to invite the three witnesses present to come to talk about migration and how people get to that point of desperation.  We are displaying inhumanity to people who need embracing, care and love, and a shelter from the horrific circumstances they left behind.</p> <p>  The witnesses talked about climate displacement - which could have been appropriate to the previous speakers - the greed of the developed world and our destructive impact on those less fortunate.</p><p>Our objective in having a public consultation in the autumn will be to challenge perceptions in this country and reach out to the 40% of people who feel afraid of and unsure about migration.  It is about getting the media to respond and to counteract some of the hysterical and hateful headlines we have seen.  The witnesses noted that voters in several European countries have elected more delegates from right-wing, fortress Europe parties.  My colleague, Senator Gavan, was in Hungary recently and may speak about what he saw there.  I will be happy to extend an invitation to the witnesses, who have made an excellent contribution to this debate, to attend the public consultation later this year.</p></speech>

We have had very impressive contributions from all the witnesses.  As part of my work as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I have witnessed teenagers the same age as my own children being kept in cages, for more than six months in one case.  That is what is happening in parts of Europe to migrant children.  The witnesses have played their part today in seeking to break the shameful silence around this issue.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on the EU's deal on migration with Turkey, which is deemed a third country of safe origin.  It is no such thing but is, in fact, a dictatorship in which horrendous human rights abuses are taking place.  It suits the EU to do that deal, however, because it keeps people out and there is apparently little interest in how migrants are being treated in Turkey.  It is an appalling human rights situation and the EU is utterly complicit in it.  It is a situation that must be ended.  I thank all the speakers for their contributions.</p></speech>

However, compared with countries like Hungary and Turkey, there are ways in which we can seek to integrate people into our society as much as possible.  We have seen great projects, for example, from Scouting Ireland and the Irish Second-Level Students Union.  However, if we remain silent on what is happening in other countries, what is the point of any such efforts?  We should be taking the lead by saying we will not stand for this.  We are a Europe of peace but there is no point if we are not working to keep the peace between people internally in our member countries.</p></speech>

It is timely, therefore, to have a public consultation on the issue.  I agree that the EU seems to be outsourcing many of our problems with migration to a neighbourhood comprising Libya, Morocco and Turkey.  There needs to be a re-engagement across European society on the values we are meant to uphold, such as strength in diversity.  The actions being taken in the EU at a high political level do not reflect those principles.  Likewise in Ireland, the refugee programme has reached only half its quota.  We need to reflect on our claim to be the island of c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.  A public consultation will be very helpful in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.777" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sara Thompson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019050900002#T00500"><p>On the EU agreement with Turkey, it is a question of whatever is suitable for Europe.  On burden sharing, as long as countries do not take responsibility for that at European level, nothing will change.  As it stands, burden sharing is voluntary.  We must push at European level to make such commitments binding and ensure we take responsibility for the care of migrants.  In the context of climate displacement, we in Europe are the lucky ones who are safe for now, but we must take responsibility for the damage we are doing to the planet and to the people who will be displaced by climate change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.778" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019050900002#T00600"><p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions, the main points of which I will briefly recap.  Ms Thompson clearly linked increased migration with the climate crisis, especially as it affects less developed and impoverished parts of the globe.  Ms Bartley spoke about the importance of language and how "illegal migrant" is an inappropriate and stigmatising term and one we should not use.  I thank her for that strong message.  She spoke, too, about how an "us and them" outlook is blinkered and serves to feed prejudice and racism.  Ms Richardson noted that the free movement of people is one of the key principles of the European Union and, like her colleague, linked migration to the importance of addressing the climate crisis.</p> <p>  In the absence of my Co-Chairman, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, it falls to me to draw the meeting to a close.  The witnesses have distinguished themselves and their respective colleges and organisations.  It is a great pleasure for us as Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to welcome young, focused and enthusiastic voices from across the length and breadth of the island of Ireland.  That has been an important feature of today's discussion.  I especially welcome the fellow voices from Ulster, which makes me feel at home.  Every time I cross the Boyne Valley Bridge, I let out a small cheer that I am heading there again.  I thank colleagues for their part in marking Europe Day so well as we have done.  I hope it will be the first of many years of interesting engagement between ourselves and witnesses like those we have heard from today.</p></speech>

Before we start, I remind members and witnesses to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off.  This is important as they cause serious problems for the broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.</p> <p>  I am delighted that today we have engagement on Europe Day.  We have a presentation by the students on the challenges facing the European Union and we are all very much looking forward to that.</p> <p>  I welcome all the witnesses to this special meeting of the joint committees on Europe Day.</p><p>On this day in 1950 Robert Schuman outlined his vision for Europe of peace and co-operation between nations.  That was nearly 70 years ago, but it laid the foundations for the European Union we know today.  It is a strong partnership of nations that are working together to achieve the common goals of peace and prosperity.  Ireland joined the European Economic Community, EEC, now the European Union, in 1973 and has been a proud participant in European institutions for more than 45 years.  Citizens of Ireland tend to be very positive about our EU membership.  The results of a recent poll carried out by Red C Research and Marketing for the European Movement of Ireland showed that 93% of Irish people supported remaining in the European Union.  This shows the success of the European project and the benefits the European Union has brought to the country.<br/><br/>For Ireland, membership of international rules-based organisations is the best way to build relationships and alliances and for countries to support each other.  Europe Day is a great opportunity for us all to reflect on where we are and what we have achieved.  Importantly, it is also an opportunity to discuss the challenges ahead for all of us and how we can work together to find solutions to them.  In the context of Brexit and all of the implications that stem from it, it is more important than ever before for politicians, of all political allegiances and none, to work together and show a united front when it comes to doing our job and ensuring a good team effort across the political divide.  I sincerely believe it is terribly important for us to do so.  <br/><br/>Elections to the European Parliament will be held across the European Union in a few weeks' time.  The results of the same poll to which I referred showed that younger cohorts who were the most positive towards the European Union and many of its policies and who certainly had views on the issues at stake were also the least likely group to vote on 24 May.  It is important that we find ways to engage with each other and hear from experts emerging in their fields.  It is especially important that we hear the views of young people on the issues that will affect the future of the European Union.  I am passionate about this issue.  When I look at young people, I see them as the future.  In the years to come they will be the politicians and employers.  Every one of us is on a wheel and our time in our different roles comes and then finishes.  It will then be the turn of the young people who are before me.  When I go into schools, national and secondary, all I think of is that they are the future.  They are the ones who will be running the country, the Europe Union and the world in the years ahead.  I am very conscious of this, as we all should be.  <br/><br/>I do not think we have ever held a meeting of five joint committees before.  Today's event shows a new approach and how important it is that we take a cross-sectoral approach to such broad issues.  I welcome our guests, the students and young people from Queens University Belfast, QUB; Ulster University, UU; Teagasc; University College Dublin, UCD; Dublin City University, DCU; National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG; National University of Ireland, Maynooth, NUIM; and our neighbours in University College Cork, UCC.  <br/><br/>The meeting will be divided into four sessions and the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the relevant committee will chair its session.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

In this session we will deal with the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which has served the country well in recent years.  In our discussion we are going to hear about where it is going to go in the months and years ahead.  The discussion will include the environmental and budgetary aspects of the CAP.  Budgets are very important, as nothing can be done without them.  We will also hear about reform, subsidiarity and flexibility.  We would like to hear about all of these elements.  Whenever there is a discussion about the CAP, we hear about the need to make it more simplified.  "Simplification" is a big word, but the CAP always seems to come out more bureaucratic.  We are looking forward to the discussion on the next CAP taking place and being concluded in the next year or so to finally have a more simplified programme.  I am delighted that we are joined by Mr. Daniel Bakker from Queens University Belfast, Dr. Sin&eacute;ad Furey and Dr. Lynsey Hollywood from Ulster University, Dr. Sin&eacute;ad McCarthy from Teagasc and Ms Si&uacute;n M&aacute;ire Riordan from University College Cork.  I welcome them and thank them for attending to discuss this very important issue, on which I look forward to a very good discussion.  I call Mr. Bakker to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I will speak about the CAP for a few minutes.  </p> <p>  In June 2018 the European Commission put forward its legislative proposals for the future of the CAP post 2020.  Previous reforms of the CAP had been driven by political and economic change.  It is important, therefore, for all concerned to look at the political challenges facing the European Union and what the future of the CAP might look like.</p> <p>  The European Union is facing the challenges of UK withdrawal, the rise of a Eurosceptic tide across member states, global market instability, particularly in agricultural prices, and greater pressure to respond and adapt to climate change.  The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union is crucial because it has contributed significantly to a forecasted reduction in the CAP budget for the period 2021 to 2027.  The cut proposed is 5%, but it will be around 12% in real terms.  As the CAP is one of the cornerstones of European integration, it is important that the Commission&rsquo;s proposals be considered and scrutinised.</p> <p>  The proposed legislation retains the current two pillar structure of direct payments and rural development but allows much greater flexibility for member states to choose where their allocation of funds will go.  The Commission&rsquo;s rationale is to streamline the CAP and increase overall efficiency.  Member states will be better able to target their interventions to suit their specific contexts.  The proposals also have revised greening architecture for pillar 1 payments and put strong emphasis on the CAP&rsquo;s commitment to environmental sustainability.</p> <p>  Member states will be responsible for drawing up strategic plans which will then be approved by the Commission to ensure they stay within the CAP&rsquo;s overall objectives.  Some see this as a step in the right direction, but others, including some member states, have raised concerns as strategic plans might place a further administrative burden on national governments.  Many agricultural stakeholders have criticised the idea as it could potentially lead to an undermining of the Single Market and compromise a level playing field for farmers.  Some fear the proposals amount to a renationalisation of agriculture and will increase bureaucracy and market distortions, resulting from differences in implementation across the European Union.  Affording member states too much flexibility has also been criticised by environmentalists.  As well as criticising the continuation of "perverse subsidies", environmentalists argue that flexibility with no real incentives to have ambitious targets could lead to declining environmental standards across the European Union.  The proposed "enhanced conditionality" clause in the new legislative proposals has been viewed as more greenwashing of the CAP, without sufficient accountability mechanisms to ensure adherence to environmental regulations.</p> <p>  It is important to stress that the proposals are in their very early stages.</p><p>As we saw with the previous CAP reform in 2013, nothing is likely to be passed until the EU budget is agreed.  There will be a new European Parliament and perhaps a new European Commissioner by the time the legislation enters into force, but as the proposal stands, there are several steps that could be taken to ensure a successful CAP.</p><p> There could be greater promotion of dialogue between environmentalist organisations and agricultural stakeholders.  At least since the 1992 reform of CAP, we have seen the struggle to merge agricultural production with environmental protection, which, unfortunately, sometimes leads to conflicting and contradictory interests.  Helping to promote common ground at EU and national levels could result in a more coherent policy.  The approval process for strategic plans needs to be transparent and as strong as possible, as this is essentially the only mechanism for ensuring that national priorities do not conflict with EU-wide objectives.  Maintaining the common aspect of the CAP is essential.  Furthermore, the proposals allow for only the Commission to approve strategic plans, but to improve accountability, that process could be based formally on widespread consultation and should involve input from the co-legislators and various stakeholders.  What happens if there is an impasse between national priorities and CAP objectives should be spelled out by the Commission.  As the Commission views the next CAP as a move towards evidence-based policy, which prioritises results over compliance, it is important the quality of data sources are to an appropriate standard and that national Governments have the technical capacity to construct and defend a strategic plan.  This might involve greater investment in technical assistance and upgrading of skills, which will be difficult if the current budget predictions are accurate.</p><p> The period for the next CAP is one of learning for the European Union as it experiments with this new delivery model.  It is important for all concerned that there is an awareness of the challenges facing the upcoming reform, which will be shaped by competing interests among stakeholders within a potentially reduced budget.  It is important to stress the crucial role of dialogue and consultation to ensure an efficient and coherent CAP.</p></speech>

I will present a joint perspective on behalf of myself and my colleague from Ulster University business school, Dr. Lynsey Hollywood.  We very much welcome the opportunity to discuss our perspective on the future and ongoing reform of the CAP.  It is entirely appropriate that such a collaborative and open approach is used because it is in this capacity as stakeholders that farmers and wider stakeholders have an important opinion in this area.</p> <p>  Our presentation will focus on four main priorities we believe that any ongoing CAP reform should include.  The first is to address the volatility or instability of our agricultural markets because we consider primary food production a special case.  The exceptionalism of food means that a political and social importance is attached to it, and it is entirely appropriate to give meaningful support to farmers in recognition of their contribution to this important primary production.  It is also important to consider the issue of cross-compliance, but without subsidising or supporting any lack of competitiveness or inefficiencies within agriculture.  It is also entirely appropriate that the support is directed towards farmers in less favourable farming areas.  Any income support or resilience payment should not be allowed to become a surrogate for income support, nor a means of indefinitely maintaining uneconomical farming units.  There should continue to be a focus on the full decoupling of primary production from income support, without any regression to coupling food production with any kind of payment.  This will allow any agrifood industry ultimately to become more responsive, which is an important future direction to be consumer orientated and market led.</p> <p>  The lack of collaboration in the farming community and, more widely, agrifood is an issue.  Government intervention could usefully foster greater collaboration, although that will need careful consideration through, for example, appropriate incentivisation.  A better understanding of market requirements would enable farmers to move from a production mentality to a more marketing mindset.  Any support could usefully be focused on support for know-how of marketing aspects.  Identifying that market need or niche in the market and how to differentiate one's product offering would help create diversification, support farmers in that mentality and allow us to look towards a strong, value-added market with strong export potential.  In the light of agricultural exceptionalism, some mechanism needs to be in place to ensure a secure, sustainable, healthy environment, and to prevent instability of the agricultural market, erratic food prices and market distortion.  It is important that any solution does not serve to increase food prices for the end consumer.</p> <p>  That brings me to the second priority, namely, food security, which covers the continuity of supply, health and food poverty.  The security of supply is especially important in the context of Europe and globally, given the increasing population and the need to feed more people and produce more food for more people.  The world's population is predicted to be 9 billion by 2050.  It would be appropriate for any ongoing and future reform of the CAP or agricultural framework to consider health, simply because of the relationship between food choice, nutrition and health.  These policies should usefully complement one another.  We need our industry to encourage production of food consistent with guidelines for healthy eating and for population nutrition.  That leaves us a space in food innovation to ensure we meet that market nee, although it cannot be at the expense of the twin objectives of productivity alongside environmental sustainability.  As for unnecessary costs being accrued to the consumer, paradoxically, those consumers who stand to benefit most from a healthy diet are those who can least afford it.  Consumers, therefore, must not be disadvantaged by a two-tier pricing policy or as a consequence of their reality.  They must be able to access, afford and avail of healthy food.</p> <p>  Our third priority is ensuring that food and farming are public goods, which we hinted at earlier in the context of environmental production.  We need to consider and continue the emphasis on the active management of land, which should be rewarded in a way that respects cross-compliance.  Farming is more than its principal purpose of primary production and, therefore, any payment schedule made to farmers must be conditional upon food safety, food quality, environmental and animal welfare, and occupational health and safety standards.  We need to consider the pivotal role that farming can play in preserving and enhancing the rural and natural environments, the importance of which we should not diminish.  Our farming counterparts are the custodians of our natural environment and it is important to respect the amenity value of the countryside.  Any future agricultural framework and policy should aim to preserve and enhance the amenity and recreational value of our land, and to reward landowners for conducting that public good on society's behalf.</p> <p>  Our final priority is the maintenance of the rural population and rural development.  Agriculture requires generational renewal of active farmers.  As we hinted at in the context of incentivisation, one might expect us, from a university perspective, to suggest that continuing professional development, short courses and educational attainment in this regard are also important.  Universities and the higher education sector have a role to play in providing access to increasing professional educational attainment in this area, and in allowing farmers to have that marketing mindset and the export potential to be exploited.  We welcome a multi-actor approach to science and innovation, involving support agencies and research institutions.</p> <p>  In conclusions, further reform of the CAP is to be welcomed.  We recommend that policy makers continue to pursue aggressively the decoupling of food production from payments to exploit that truly market-orientated, consumer-led approach and to allow for complementary agrifood and health policies in a way that is mutually supportive of people, the planet and profit.</p></speech>

I will comment on the sustainability of the Irish diet from the point of view of carbon footprint, its implications for policy, including policy from the point of view of the end user and the end of the food supply chain, and accounting for consumer food behaviour.  The contribution of food consumption towards climate change has received increasing attention in recent years, especially recently with the launch of the EAT-Lancet report.  In its present form, food consumption is responsible for as much as 30% of EU greenhouse gas emissions, GHGs.  Therefore, we need to look at food choices and food behaviour and see how we can alter them to influence health and the environment.</p> <p>  Are there any food choice behaviours that are sustainable as a diet and nutritionally acceptable?  Can the two areas meet?  The UN Food and Agriculture Organization defines sustainable diets as those "with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations.  Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy". </p> <p>The "economically fair" aspect of this is very important as the agriculture industry is the largest indigenous industry in Ireland.  GHGs associated with food production are measured in carbon equivalents to produce a carbon footprint for the food we consume.  In general, plant-based foods are low in GHG emissions, whereas foods from animal sources are higher, especially those from ruminant animals.  The European Commission has found that Ireland has one of the lowest carbon footprints of animal products in Europe because of the system we use to produce meat.  Foods from animal sources provide many essential nutrients necessary for good health and, therefore, are an important part of a healthy diet.  Certain nutrients can only be found in meat products and are not available in plant products.  Environmental and human health issues should be considered together to ensure socially and nutritionally optimal outcomes for both.</p> <p>  Research is ongoing in Teagasc, in conjunction with University College Cork, to examine the carbon footprint of the Irish diet and food consumption behaviours which result in a more or less sustainable and health diet.  The aim is to determine the quantity of GHG emissions associated with food consumption patterns in Irish adults and to determine what patterns of food consumption are associated with sustainability and health.  We use the best publicly available data to do the national adult nutrition survey funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine through its fair funding measure.  Each food consumed was converted into carbon equivalents and measured the carbon produced by consuming these foods, instead of looking at nutrients as is traditionally done.  It is no surprise that meat, in particular ruminant meat, made the highest contribution to carbon in the Irish diet as a result of the high conversion factor associated with meat and dairy, while plant sourced foods had the lowest CO2 in the diet.</p> <p>  It is important to eat a varied diet and not just one particular food group.  Consumers who followed a cultural pattern traditional to the Irish diet, with high meat, fruit and vegetable consumption, had the lowest CO2 footprint of all consumers, showing that meat plays a very important role in health and a sustainable diet.  We also found that food consumption and energy intake beyond our nutritional requirements contributed to the public health epidemic of obesity, as well as food waste.  Promoting a healthier diet and lifestyle, which reduces food consumption, also helps from an environmental perspective.  The findings from this research support the notion that any policy measures should be evidence based and should consider the prevailing cultural food consumption patterns of a population.  CAP reform, and any associated food policy instruments developed for sustainability reasons, should be holistic in nature and take other parameters such as health and nutrition into consideration, rather than concentrating on one food group.  It should reward more sustainable production and meet our consumer demands. </p></speech>

I welcome their engagement with younger citizens.  I am a second year European studies student in University College Cork.<br/><br/>As a young person growing up in rural Ireland, I have seen the importance of the agricultural industry and the difference the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, makes in Ireland.  One of the leading incentives behind Ireland&rsquo;s decision to apply for European Union membership was the opportunity of gaining support from the CAP.  When the CAP was introduced under the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the objectives were to improve and stabilise the incomes of those engaged in the farm sector, largely through market support mechanisms but with some activities oriented towards improving farming productivity and structural adjustments within the farm sector.  As the EU now discusses the future of the CAP post 2020, it is important to recall how beneficial this policy is and has been for Ireland.<br/><br/>One of the aspects of the CAP that has had the greatest impact on the lives of farmers across the EU has been the payment schemes.  Farmers are given money for maintaining their land and young farmers are given payments to encourage them to start farming.  They are given grants or loans to help start up and farmers can receive the green direct payments for reaching environment objectives.  The objective of the CAP is to give farmers and other agricultural workers a decent standard of living.  While the CAP is not always fairly divided among all recipients, it has still improved the income for thousands of farmers across Ireland and the EU.  The CAP&rsquo;s direct payment schemes help protect farmers from the uncertainty of the market.  At the moment, the CAP has a small farmers' scheme which is aimed at supporting smaller farmers in Europe.  However, this only operates in 15 EU countries and<i></i>Ireland is not among them.  This is unfortunate because if this policy was introduced in Ireland, it would aid many more in the agricultural industry.  Many Irish farmers are small farmers and the CAP currently does not have a big an impact on their lives.<br/><br/>The CAP encourages green, sustainable farming.  Part of the direct payment is given to farmers who strive for greener, more environment friendly agricultural production.  In theory, this should help Ireland improve its carbon footprint and reach its climate change objectives.  Farmers gain more by diversifying their crop and meeting environmental goals.  This is important for farmers as it gives them the opportunity to receive more from the CAP schemes while also encouraging them to be more environmentally conscious.  The CAP may be more known for its payments to farmers but it is also very focused on rural development and sustainability.  The CAP has helped many local, rural regions around Ireland.  Between 2007 and 2013, &euro;4.3 billion of funding was given to help agricultural production that would benefit rural areas.<br/><br/>The CAP also helps non-agricultural activities, such as small-scale manufacturing and food processing.  Such activities encourage businesses to set up in rural areas, focusing on the development of the local food sector.  This is important as it brings employment to rural regions and allows small, rural, agricultural communities to prosper and to use their large agricultural sector to develop compatible businesses.  When rural areas are developed, this development attracts more people to the area, offers more employment and can increase tourism.  The increase in employment is especially important as many farmers who operate small farms must get jobs outside the farm to supplement their household income.  This is made easier when the region around them is more developed, giving them a greater opportunity to find employment.  The development of these areas is vital to encourage people to stay and continue, or even start, farming in these rural areas.  The continuance of CAP ensures the development of Irish rural areas and gives further aid to the agricultural workers here.<br/><br/>The Agriculture and Fisheries Council will meet next week and I will follow its discussions about the future of the CAP post 2020 very closely.  At the most recent meeting in April, I was stuck by the emphasis by the Romanian Presidency on the environmental ambition of the CAP.  I agree that this is a major feature of CAP reform.  It will be advantageous not only to EU farmers but to every single EU citizen.  As a young citizen, I value sustainable development and want a green future for Ireland.  I know that Ministers have been discussing climate, biodiversity and water quality, to name just a few issues.  I hope to see a future in which we can enjoy sustainable food security and see an improvement in the environmental issues that exist today.</p></speech>

The CAP and CAP reform are a key part of our body of work at committee level and we have already made a number of submissions to Europe.</p><p>We attended several Council meetings around Europe, including in Croatia and Romania in recent months.  Members of the committee made a presentation at the European Parliament's agriculture committee approximately a year ago.  It is a priority matter for the committee and a significant issue for agriculture in Ireland, as all present are aware.  It is important that we keep engaging with this process.  Agriculture is our largest indigenous industry but it does not get its fair share of media coverage when it needs it.  It is great to have this opportunity to discuss the matter.  I am joined by some members of the committee and I would like to have engagement with them and the witnesses over the next ten or 15 minutes.  We will take a couple of questions together if that is acceptable to the witnesses.</p></speech>

Has research been conducted on what will happen in the advent of Brexit for the farmers in Northern Ireland in terms of their current income?  That question is for Mr. Bakker and Dr. Furey.  Does Dr. McCarthy know whether Teagasc has conducted research on our capacity to sustainably provide sufficient plant-based food for this country and some for export, in addition to a certain amount of meat production and land being used to plant forestry, in the case of increased demand for a plant-based diet?</p></speech>

Dr. Furey mentioned that we should move away from coupling and towards decoupling.  How can the vulnerable sectors be supported to ensure a sustainable future for them?  On suckler beef farmers, who are a key part of the industry in the west of Ireland, if that industry goes into decline, large parts of that region may be depopulated, which would have a significantly negative effect on rural Ireland.  How could the next CAP protect the vulnerable sectors of the agriculture industry?</p></speech>

We have a very busy schedule today and there is a significant amount of work relating to this meeting.  It is a momentous day and it is great to be able to record our participation in the European Union and celebrate Europe Day.</p> <p>  Agriculture accounts for a large part of our portfolio and work.  There has been a significant shift in recent years to larger dairy and crop farmers.  Similarly, larger dry stock farmers seem to be more prevalent.  The days of the part-time farmer who may have a second job and tend 40 acres or 50 acres may be numbered.  From the perspective of Dr. McCarthy and Teagasc, in ten or 15 years, will part-time farming be a thing of the past?  While canvassing for the local and European elections, as all politicians have been doing, I noted the number of unoccupied smaller farm holdings which are being subsumed by larger farmholders.  Does Dr. McCarthy anticipate a massive change in our model of farming?  That seems to have happened in recent years.</p></speech>

From which countries are these products coming?  The products at which I have looked are not produced in Ireland.  I am specifically referring to plant-based protein foods for human consumption.  Is there a desire or ability to grow them in Ireland?  I know there are issues around soya beans in that regard.  I understand that many types of beans come from the tropics and are more suited to such climates, which obviously means there is a carbon footprint involved in bringing them here.  In many parts of the tropics, people do not have enough food or their diet is not as good as it should be.  I direct my questions particularly at Dr. McCarthy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.807" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sin&eacute;ad McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019050900002#E00900"><p>I will roll two responses into one.  On the issue of from where plant-based foods are coming and whether there is a way to combine animal and plant-based production in Ireland, certain climates and agricultural environments lend themselves better to certain types of food production.  For example, producing meat and dairy in Ireland is very suited to our climate as we get a lot of rain and do not solely rely on the water supply for agriculture.  Many of our animals are grass fed for more than 300 days per year and when they are kept in during the winter months they are fed from silage.  Very little animal feed is given to them.</p> <p>  On beef production, meat and dairy very efficiently convert food such as grass that humans cannot consume to protein which they can.  If we were to change that production type to more plant-based production, it might not be as successful because the land that we currently use for producing meat and dairy is not necessarily suitable for plant production.  There is also an issue in terms of the amount of carbon that is kept as a sink in the ground or soil and which would be released if the land was ploughed to plant alternative food sources.</p> <p>  My answer to Deputy Corcoran-Kennedy's question is yes and no.  There is a possibility to produce both but we need to be careful regarding the land we choose to use differently.  It would not necessarily result in a lower carbon footprint.  Some research indicates that as a result of the higher inputs of fertiliser and so on that are required to produce plant-based crops, there may be, at best, a 10% to 12% reduction in carbon footprint.  It is not a direct swap of one for the other as there are other challenges in changing farming practices and the resultant dietary CO2.</p> <p>  Many plant-based proteins such as beans and legumes are imported and have many associated food miles.  It is not always possible to recommend a plant-based diet to certain vulnerable groups in the community.  For example, older adults naturally consume less food but need a higher protein intake.  The best source of protein for older consumers to maintain muscle mass and prevent falls and frailty is animal protein.  They would need to eat four to five times the amount of lentils or beans to get the same amount of protein and it would not be possible for them to eat that much food.  There is a role for both plant and animal protein in diet and it is about getting the balance right in terms of achieving concordant measures of health and sustainability.  One must not focus solely on the carbon footprint of the diet without taking account of the nutrition and health outcomes.</p></speech>

Ulster University is not actively involved in farming research but we are most certainly involved in more general research on food poverty and food insecurity.  If it satisfies members, I will speak more generally on that point.  It is anticipated that Brexit will create an additional cost of &pound;25 per week on the average household's food bill.  For citizens who are already squeezed, impoverished or vulnerable, this will create an additional burden and we are worried about that.  Ulster University is very active in the food poverty research agenda.  We are developing an at-risk of food poverty index that will consider low income and rurality in identifying where such consumers are located to enable more targeted interventions.</p> <p>  More specifically, there area also concerns regarding rural dwellers and agricultural smallholders.  Given that the average age of smallholders in Northern Ireland and Great Britain is approximately 60 years, we are concerned about generational renewal and the need for young farmers.  It was for this reason that we addressed the point of diversification and the need to add value.  We will be actively involved in the food innovation effort to try to complement agriculture, food availability and health.  We need to be concerned about the departure of farmers from farming because it has become unprofitable.</p> <p>  There is an opportunity to educate and engage with consumers on the more general point of the importance of eating locally and seasonally so that we can celebrate our local and indigenous foods.  We must showcase indigenous produce so that we are not reliant on alternative protein sources from other countries.</p> <p>  We are working with policymakers in Northern Ireland in a collaborative effort on agrifood and food policy generally.  Brexit has caused concerns about food affordability and availability and the possibility that access to a fresh and varied diet may become more problematic for Northern Ireland consumers.</p></speech>

The raw materials may move from the North to the South to be processed, return to the North to be packaged and, finally, be sold in the South.  It is great that the common travel area is secure but much more could be done in terms of regulatory alignment between the market in the North and the South to minimise disruption to goods moving across the Border.  If the Assembly in the North gets up and running, the North-South Ministerial Council would be a good forum to promote more alignment on agrifood and minimise disruption.</p></speech>

As members will probably expect me to say, I believe a joint collaborative effort by university and other research and educational institutions could be useful in providing such an incentivisation.  This would not necessarily have to be economic.  One way forward could be to subsidise educational attainment efforts or repurpose farmers, as it were, to enable them to move into more diverse food processing areas.</p></speech>

When one considers the food supply chain from a carbon footprint perspective, between 80% and 85% of the carbon footprint is generated before the food leaves the farmyard.  It is very important that we put measures in place from a sustainability perspective to reduce the carbon footprint of food as it is being produced and support smaller farmers to produce food more sustainably.  Farming should not be only large-scale and intensive.  CAP could address this by implementing more sustainable practices at farm level.  A great deal of research has been done in Europe.  I am involved in a circular agricultural economics research project in the European Union, which has 20 partners across Europe.  We are looking at more sustainable farming practices and how acceptable they would be to consumers at the end of the food chain.  We need to develop a more circular economy and maintain better sustainability at farm level.  This would help to maintain smaller farms and keep European farmers in the farming industry.</p></speech>

When I was asked to speak about the European common security and defence policy on the occasion of Europe Day the first topic to come to mind was the role of Irish neutrality.  The debate is probably as old as the country itself but has surely not lost its intensity since then.  I finally decided to address the issue because recent developments in the area of European common and security policy make neutrality very topical again.  I draw attention to a couple of developments that place neutrality back on the agenda and demand urgent discussion of its meaning and implications.</p> <p>  The first of these is Brexit.</p><p>The loss of the major Atlanticist power within the European Union has serious consequences for the further development of the European Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP.  Having always tried to prevent or at least slow down integration in this policy field, the United Kingdom has been a kind of natural ally to Ireland in trying to keep security issues out of European integration.  The consequences of this development are already visible.  Not long after the Brexit vote, the President of the EU Commission, the French President and later the German Chancellor were calling for the creation of an EU army.  Although for the time being this is not much more than a blurry vision, it became obvious where integration in the European Common Security and Defence Policy field is heading.<br/><br/>Already in 2018 permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, was launched, marking a huge step in integrating security and defence co-operation towards a military alliance.  Causing a lively discussion in Ireland, its participation was finally backed by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, denying a conflict between Irish neutrality and participation in PESCO.  Of all the other neutral member states of the EU only Malta opted out, choosing to first observe if PESCO and neutrality are compatible.  Especially in Finland and Sweden, former neutral states, a consensus has been reached to the effect that EU membership in general is not logically compatible with the traditional notion of neutrality.  In practice these EU member states have thus given up their neutrality to a large extent.  In Ireland, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a Bill to enshrine Irish neutrality in the Constitution.  After a lively debate, in which European politicians were even called warmongers, the Bill was eventually rejected in the D&aacute;il.<br/><br/>Finally, I draw members' attention to a poll by Red C for the European Movement Ireland, published just last week.  Apart from an overwhelming support for EU membership in general, the poll revealed that a majority of 58% of the Irish people think that Ireland should be part of intensified EU security and defence co-operation and that PESCO does not pose a threat to Irish neutrality.  Approval is even stronger amongst young Irish people.<br/><br/>For me as a German citizen, the whole discussion about neutrality is new.  Despite the <i>tabula rasa </i>after the Second World War, Germany did not have the chance to have its own discussion about this, having to align itself to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, in the face of an expansionist Soviet Union.  While living in Ireland for one year and studying at University College Dublin it is very interesting to follow the public debate about neutrality and discuss it with my Irish and non-Irish fellow students.  This brings insights into this very politicised topic and the fact that Irish neutrality is loaded with different meanings and historical resonances.  Various narratives are contesting the nature of Irish foreign and security policy and its expression in Europe's contemporary security architecture.  While there seems to be a broad consensus that Ireland can and should make a contribution to global peace and security, this is not the case for the question as to which institutional framework should be used to achieve this.<br/><br/>Due to the aforementioned recent developments, however, Ireland seems to be forced to take a decision.  The departure of the major damper of integration in the area of foreign and security policy and the concomitant developments, such as PESCO and discussions of an EU army, make it an urgent topic.  For Ireland's European partners, and therefore also for me in this case, it is essential to know where Ireland is coming from in order to fully understand the significance and the implications of neutrality for Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.827" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cornelia-Adriana Baciu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019050900002#G00200"><p>My name is Ms Cornelia-Adriana Baciu.  I am studying at the School of Law and Government at Dublin City University.  Today I will address four key challenges facing the Common Security and Defence Policy.  The first is related to strategic coherence and internal cohesion.  In the counterfactual scenario in which the EU is not able to manage internal cracks such as the rise of nationalism, so-called <i>souvereignism</i>or major differences in member states' strategic cultures, future risks and challenges to CSDP might be endogenous.  A failure to co-ordinate efforts on the CSDP might draw Europe back to the US.  Some researchers argue it might return the European security landscape to the 1950s.  The EU will thus need to find innovative ways to solve the crises of sovereignty of borders and of defence.  What Europe wants is not easy to operationalise because of increasing polarisation or even fragmentation of European integration.<br/><br/>The CSDP is a domain in which some argue differentiated integration might work better.  This is because states' national strategies are driven by different threat perceptions, strategic environments, capabilities and strategic interests.  My research suggests that differentiated integration in the form of a role-player model in the CSDP could enhance strategic knowledge production and capability development.  Security and defence collaborative regimes such as the CSDP can have an empowering effect on member states.  However, an unintended consequence of the role-player model could be a &quot;Europe <i>&agrave; la carte</i>&quot; in which members would only support the policies in which they see a benefit for their own national interests.<br/><br/>I will now refer to Brexit.  The anticipated withdrawal of the UK from the European Union is forecasted to strain the CSDP budget.  In 2018 the UK accounted for approximately 16% of the CSDP budget.  To compensate for this an increase in member states' investments in security and defence can be expected.  A series of peace and defence co-operation mechanisms were adopted after Brexit.  The major examples are PESCO, the European Defence Fund, EDF, the co-ordinated annual review on defence, CARD, the European peace facility and the European intervention initiative.  For the new instruments to be effective it is important for the EU to manage member states' expectations and ensure they will enable the achievement of strategic objectives.<br/><br/>I will now address the external strategic environment and external sources of instability.  A particular tendency in US leadership and what some have termed a US strategy underpinned by a logic of &quot;retreat&quot; and &quot;systemic competition&quot; with China have pushed the EU to think more seriously about the scenario of US abandonment.  Some researchers argue that strategic autonomy would allow the EU to gain an element of independence from US decision-making and pursue an agenda of international peace and security based on its own normative vision with mediation, diplomacy, trade co-operation, peace missions and global justice at its core.  Some argue that the road to strategic autonomy might lie in a merger between the CSDP and NATO, that is, the Europeanisation of NATO.  Multipolarity and great power competition represent another challenge with implications for the CSDP.  In the future, the EU is expected to aim at having good relationships with all countries and avoid a return to bipolarity.  This is because a bipolar logic might push countries to choose and some of them might choose China for economic reasons.<br/><br/>My last point is related to new security technologies.  Future and emerging technologies such as autonomous robotics and artificial intelligence can have a disruptive and transformative impact in the security and defence domain.  If the EU invests sufficiently in research and development, it might be in a position to harness the benefits of new security technologies.  New funding of transnational and interdisciplinary research, under the European Defence Fund <i>inter alia </i>, will have the potential to address capability shortcomings and technological and industrial weaknesses to a certain extent.  The EU could establish a new area of competence in dual-use technology, that is, technologies which can be attributed to both civilian and military purposes.</p></speech>

On this day it is particularly important to recall why the EU was initially established; to end frequent and bloody wars between neighbours and to unite European countries both economically and politically to secure lasting peace across the Continent.  We can largely say that this has been successful.  At the moment, however, huge challenges are ahead for the EU in the area of common security and defence.  As is true for most of the challenges the EU faces, Brexit crops up in this area.  The greatest challenge is the development of a common policy on security and defence that includes a cohesive development of policies with third countries in future missions, especially the UK once it leaves.  This policy must simultaneously protect the integrity of the European Union and the sovereignty of member states.  It is very important that there is a balance between these three concerns.  The greatest challenge lies in finding this balance.</p> <p>  Different visions of the CSDP proposed by the initial "big three" member states, Germany, the UK and France, have long created space for smaller member states like Ireland to avoid hard choices concerning issues of security and defence.  A more cohesive EU in the post-Brexit future presents significant challenges for all states that have long thrived in the murky waters of strategic ambiguity.</p><p>Indeed, it could be argued that the United Kingdom leaving removes a significant stumbling block for European defence co-operation.  British scepticism has previously allowed others such as Denmark and central European states to avoid hard questions on tensions between formal military non-alignment and the realities of being part of a deeply integrated organisation because NATO has long provided what they have seen to be the primary security provider in the European theatre. </p><p> The UK&rsquo;s absence from future Common Security and Defence Policy debates after Brexit will likely push these states into the limelight in terms of blocking or opting out from security co-operation.  Our greatest challenge is how we deal with this.  While the EU must grapple with the loss of its transatlantic alliance partner, it is imperative that it now attempts to balance a bilateral agreement on Common Security and Defence Policy with the UK that also complements a type of unified EU approach to issues of security and defence, encompassing the considerations of small states, such as Ireland, and big states such as France and Germany.</p><p> That is not to say that the EU has not taken any steps thus far.  If we look at the decision taken by the High Representative, Ms Mogherini, to forge ahead with the publication of the EU&rsquo;s new global strategy in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum in June 2016, it is apparent that some attempts have been made by the EU to push ahead with CSDP.  Although faced with something of an existential crisis, the EU found a response in building a security architecture to reinvigorate EU institutions and to reunite the remaining 27 member states.  This provided a common ground for co-operation without reopening a Pandora&rsquo;s box of institutional reform that would be required to deal with more traditional areas of European co-operation such as market regulation.  </p><p> The Common Security and Defence Policy may not have always been high on Ireland&rsquo;s agenda but the aftermath of the Brexit vote has been particularly challenging for us all.  We now must strongly reconsider our own security and defence policy, in addition to that of our position in the wider EU CSDP.  Brexit has uncovered a number of political and constitutional fault lines, none more serious than its potential impacts on the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government deserves credit for the way in which it has managed the Brexit negotiations to date, particularly in securing support from our European partners concerning Ireland&rsquo;s position on the Border.  However, what price will we pay for this in future negotiations on matters such as common security and defence?  </p><p> The reduced room for manoeuvre on common security and defence for small states, such as ourselves, in an EU that will be more dominated by France and Germany than before, must be taken into account.  In a Franco-German EU, the space for constructive ambiguity is likely to be greatly reduced.  Ireland&rsquo;s hesitancy and ambivalence on this matter may no longer be sustainable.  Irish attitudes to European security and defence might best be characterised by paraphrasing Winston Churchill, in that Ireland is with common security and defence policy, but not of it.  We are linked, but not compromised.  We are interested and associated, but not absorbed.  It is perhaps time that we do become absorbed in greater co-operation with the EU on issues of common security and defence that extend beyond PESCO, as others here have noted, as we lose the shelter of the UK in future debates.  </p><p> The threats of a no-deal Brexit and the medium to longer-term security threats posed by any kind of withdrawal have yet to be provided for.  Both the Irish State and the EU as a whole faces profound challenges in this regard and are there, as of yet, no signs that neither it nor the EU is prepared to address them. </p></speech>

I compliment all the witnesses who I have heard so far this morning on the quality and depth of their submissions and the knowledge and research that went into them.  They are all to be complimented on the even-handed and balanced way in which  they went about their business.</p><p>I raise a question about the Common Security and Defence Policy.  It is an issue which has been with us for a very long time.  Over time, different emphases occur.  It is important to note that we are a neutral country.  There is nothing incompatible between our neutrality and our membership of the European Union or certain associations in the peacekeeping and defence areas.  In the past, we have excelled in peacekeeping and have shown ourselves to be international leaders in that area.  We have a useful influence and role to play in the European context.  I note modern terrorism has no boundaries and can reach far into neutral countries, peacekeeping countries and so on.  Do the witnesses see a space in which Ireland might be expected to defend itself in such a situation?</p><p>I refer to the question of whether something in this area will be attached to the discussion on Brexit and if a <i>quid pro quo </i>be sought.  I do not think that will be the case.  We are very strong members of the European Union with a strong commitment to its ideals which have existed from the beginning and get stronger over time.  It is not likely that we would be expected to concede one for another in this context.  I think that because the European Union must prevail.  If it does not and it fragments, going in different directions, and if demands are made within itself, of itself, by itself or by single member states, then there is a grave danger that the European Union will cease to be.  If that happens there will be great political, military and economic implications for the entire Continent of Europe and outside.  I do not need to tell our witnesses this; they are experts on this area, but the question arises as to whether we want to go back to where we were.  Some member states refer to the good old days, which presumably was the first half of the 20th century.  My question to young people is whether they want to go back to those much referred to good old days, when almost 70 million people died in the conflict which followed when Europe turned upon itself.  All these things relate to military matters and peace.  We should remember that the EU was the single most important peace agreement that the world has ever known.  For all those years we have been peaceful.  There can come times of turbulence occasionally and in times of economic difficulty, someone is always sought to blame.  I encourage our guests to focus on the alternatives, because they are not good, and they can proceed to work in an equitable manner, to be fair to all people including refugees from outside.  As we know, some of the people of Europe were themselves refugees in the not too-distant past.</p></speech>

This is very timely.  There are debates at the moment relating to plans for an EU army.  It is clear from this morning's contributions that despite the denials from some on the political right that an advanced conversation on this is taking place.  The contributions here have been challenging.  While I acknowledge the poll undertaken by the European Movement, which would be very much in favour of changing our policy, we should recall that a Red C poll last year also showed tremendous support in Ireland for Irish neutrality.  I ask if Irish people would really support what PESCO is doing off the coast of Libya, for example, if they knew.</p><p>If they followed the reports of Sally Hayden, the Irish journalist, she has highlighted EU support, including Irish financial support, for funding death camps in Libya.  That funding was confirmed to me by the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, just a few weeks ago in the Seanad.  These are camps in which people are tortured, raped, mutilated and killed.  This is the reality of PESCO as it operates right now.  One does not have to take my word for it.  Sally Hayden has documented and continues to document it in an effort to bring attention to the realities, unfortunately, of what PESCO is doing.  Do we think the Irish people would support funding of &euro;13 billion in research subsidies for the defence industries of Europe as set out in the next financial plan for Europe?  That is a reality of PESCO.  The final question I ask is as follows.  Surely, the best people to decide our future neutrality are the people of Ireland.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in was right to pursue the Bill.  As democrats, the best way forward in this debate is to support that call for a referendum.  Let us have a full debate on the future of Irish neutrality.  I thank the witnesses for their thoughtful contributions today.</p></speech>

I am delighted to welcome the witnesses and thank them for their contributions.  We are at an important crossroads in Europe.  Certainly, I have concerns about some activities taking place under the flag of and with the financial support of the European Union.  We need to be more awake, engaged and vocal and to scrutinise more deeply legislation that comes before us on PESCO and other situations.  Europe as a project must be preserved.  We must work at that and learn from it.  A recent report I intend to raise on Leaders' Questions today is on the future of farming in Europe.  It states that 1,000 farmers and farm families are leaving farming every week right across the EU.  That is leading to the degeneration, neglect and slippage of rural Ireland at a time when we are talking about rolling broadband out to rural areas.  If we do not maintain sustainable farm families in rural Ireland, North and South, and across Europe, it will lead to more factory farms and large conglomerates buying up land, which is not good.  In my own county of Tipperary, we have an equine company purchasing every square perch of land that becomes available.  It has amassed almost 28,000 acres.  While it provides employment and has great prowess in the equine industry, it is disgraceful that we do not have a land commission or other land agency to monitor and curtail what is happening.  The family farm is the lifeblood of Ireland.  In the two previous recessions to the one we have just come out of, it was agriculture that led us back to growth with, I might add, the support of the EU.  People were always there on family farms and working the land in parishes and communities nationally.  Every euro that goes into agriculture is spent locally.  Farm families support schools, sports clubs, the tourism industry and everything else.  It is therefore timely to have this discussion.  I thank our visitors for attending today.  It is my first time speaking in this new Chamber.  I am delighted.  It is an honour to be here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.835" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019050900002#J00300"><p>I thank all those who have contributed.  The situation around security events is not a stark one.  It is more the case that there are real choices and priorities to address.  It is true that Europe came out of a project of peace.  The wonderful thing about Europe was that after literally thousands of years of conflict, countries which had experienced in some cases hundreds of years of war against each other decided to come together to determine how to live together more peacefully and constructively.  That is absolutely true.  However, while there is an incredible legacy of peace in the European project, being European and being part of the European project means thinking about that constant question of how we live together.  It is about being critically present and asking critical questions, as the witnesses have.  That is part of being pro-European.  It is about caring enough about Europe to care about the decisions it makes.</p> <p>  There are very important decisions being made and there are priorities and concerns.  It was a decision for Ireland to opt into PESCO.  Ireland was not required to opt in, rather it chose to do so.  PESCO moved us further away by involving us, for example, in joint purchases of military equipment.  Ireland has an incredibly strong tradition of peace and neutrality and of leading disarmament.  One of the most moving things I have ever been involved with was the global ban on cluster bombs, which are basically like landmines.  The global ban was negotiated here in Ireland because Ireland was free from some of the military-industrial pressures experienced by other countries and was able to lead the way.  It is not a choice between Ireland and our neutrality and Europe.  It is about Ireland being a voice for peace, neutrality and disarmament within Europe.  That is a key point.  It is a service we provide.  It was Eamon Gilmore, a former Irish parliamentarian, who represented the European Commission in Colombia to negotiate the peace deal.  That is because Ireland's neutrality allowed us to have that strong voice.</p> <p>  We cannot turn a blind eye to militarisation.  It is a disservice to Ireland and Europe if we do.  It was very concerning that, just two weeks ago, the European Parliament voted against having oversight of the &euro;13 billion European Defence Fund.  That is the European Parliament choosing not to scrutinise what that fund is spent on.  Will it be on autonomous weapons?  How does it relate to UN mandates?  We must question constantly.  When we have global challenges for Europe and the world like climate change, which we will discuss later, we must ask whether we should be spending &euro;13 billion on European defence.  I do not think so.  Peace and security are put together.  Peace is work.  We know that from the Good Friday Agreement.  The work of peace is about investment in community building, understanding and social exchange.  If we spent some of that &euro;13 billion to build understanding between communities, not just here in Ireland but across the Balkan states which have come out of an experience of war as recently as the 1990s, that would deliver far more than to ramp up military spending on our borders and invest huge amounts in Frontex.  As was mentioned, it is a real concern to see these immigration control deals whereby we are funding border police and military actions in places like Sudan and Libya.  Those are things we need to look to.  These are very important choices.</p> <p>  It is important to note that the current Commission is an outgoing one.  We will have a new European Commission soon and it needs to hear from the witnesses about their priorities.  Among the priorities the outgoing Juncker Commission has brought to today's European Council meeting on the future of Europe, what it calls "protective Europe" is number one.  That means a European defence union.  We must be very clear that there are high-level people in Europe who want a European army.  However, that is not the same thing as saying Europe wants a European army.  There are also brilliant parliamentarians and passionate Europeans from every member state of the EU 27 who want to work together on peace.  That is the narrative we can push and strengthen.  I would love to hear in response what the witnesses think the work of peace should be.  It is not just about saying we do not want militarisation.  What is the work of peace?  That is the work from Good Friday and the work we have seen across the world.  How does Ireland lead the work of peace within Europe to make Europe a champion on human rights and peace?  It is a real choice.  We cannot do that while also spending &euro;13 billion on a European Defence Fund which we do not scrutinise.  We must all challenge these issues because we want Europe to live up to its brilliant and historic past and to shape a better future.  The following point is very important.  In the initial PESCO agreement, the words "peace" and "peacekeeping" were not even used once.  We need something that is not the PESCO agreement but which is rather a European mandate on peace work.  That should be the centrepiece of Europe's next five-year strategy.  I would love to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that work of peace.</p></speech>

I now invite the witnesses to respond to members' questions.  While I do not wish to cut anybody short I ask the witnesses to be conscious that we are running out of time for this particular session.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.837" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cornelia-Adriana Baciu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019050900002#K00200"><p>I will try to address the many interesting questions posed.  On defending ourselves, territorial defence is mandated to NATO.  One of the issues on the agenda for discussion is to what extent EU member states should start thinking more seriously about gaining an element of strategic autonomy and independence from US decision-making.  Territorial defence, leadership and nuclear weapons are some of the points linked with this debate, but many states have been silent on this particular aspect.  There is also the scenario of the US abandonment, which I addressed in my opening statement.  The United States has withdrawn from several multilateral or bilateral agreements.  The US foreign policy narrative might in the future be linked with developments in the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea.  In the case of US inability to provide security guarantees in Europe, the EU should have a plan B and give serious consideration to the territorial defence aspect.</p> <p>  From a rational choice perspective, into the future, the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, for member states will be, probably, a trade-off between utility and strategic choice.  It is important to emphasise that security is a prerequisite and will remain a prerequisite for the other benefits of EU membership, including economic and political benefits.  It is a precondition of other benefits as well.  The major challenges to CSDP in the future will probably be linked to member states' commitment and the robustness of CSDP institutions.  I mentioned the new strategic instruments that are likely to generate new assets and perhaps increase the value of defence co-operation in Europe.</p> <p>  In regard to Irish neutrality, last year I wrote an article on security, multilateralism and Irish neutrality based on debates in the Irish Parliament from 1998 to 2018, which is available online.  One of my key findings was that the concept of Irish neutrality is multifaceted.  I found different concepts associated with it, including positive neutrality, negative neutrality, total neutrality and so on.  Every time there is a debate in Brussels related to security implications, there are intensive debates in the Irish Parliament on the implications for Irish neutrality.  There is informed decision-making on a case-by-case basis.  Surprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, Irish neutrality was found to be strongly linked with UN peacekeeping and stabilisation missions.  From this we could infer that there is a compatibility between the Irish foreign policy and EU foreign policy narrative.  The EU global strategy has been focused on peace and stabilisation missions in fragile states.  Recent statistics show an increase in the support of Irish people for the CSDP.  One explanation for this might be that the Common Security and Defence Policy works at intergovernmental level and it is likely to remain so into the future.  Security might be an area in which intergovernmental co-operation is more effective.  Sovereignty is not transferred at supranational level.  Any change in this regard will require a change in the EU treaty.</p> <p>  On the value added of PESCO, for Ireland the value added is that the capabilities developed under PESCO remain in the possession of member states.  For Ireland this means that capabilities developed under PESCO can be utilised in UN peacekeeping missions and other missions.  As far as I am aware, Ireland has been active in providing personnel and staff to EU and international civilian and military missions since it joined the European Union in 1973.  As of December 2018, there were approximately 650 Irish personnel deployed to such missions.</p> <p>  On Brexit, much of my research recently has been focused on the implications of Brexit.  I recently co-authored a book with my supervisor, Professor John Doyle from DCU, on this subject.  Brexit will transform relationships between the UK and the EU from multilateral to bilateral.  This will have implications for the European Union evolutionary stable equilibrium.  The EU will need to find a way to address this equilibrium to remain stable over time and to be able to cope with so-called atypical sequences or shocks, of which Brexit could be one.  The literature argues that continual change is the prerequisite to remain relevant and competitive.  The implication or consequence of this would be geopolitical adaptation of the EU.  This will have further implications for future transatlantic relations, the EU global strategy and international security as a collective good.</p> <p>  It was mentioned earlier that peace is work.  Modern peace is based on anticipation, resilience and integration of aspects of daily life.  One could imagine modern peace at the intersection of three epistemological debates, international - liberal values; national - nationalist sometimes as a destructive force; and, everyday life level - daily interactions and power relations between people.  We have to see all three sides as knowledge production sides.  Knowledge is very important for concepts such as peace, order, justice, security and so on.  This is, perhaps, a matter we should further address in our research.</p></speech>

Cultural values were disregarded.  Questions were posed in regard to neutrality, PESCO and peace.</p><p>If we look at the culture of all European states, it comprises the cultures of 28 different states, soon to be 27.  These have very different cultural values.  After 70 years of this project, it is time to introduce new ways of looking at things.  It is not always driven by politics and economics, although we are in a political chamber.  It is very important that we look towards cultures.  I am sure most Irish people would not be impressed to hear that we are supporting PESCO.  Claims were made that money we pay into the European budget for defence goes to camps in Libya and so on.  That is not what we anticipated our tax money would be used for.  There are also cultures within Europe that really promote a strong, hard-line defence policy, which we do not.  We are more focused on peacekeeping and neutrality.  There needs to be a balance in how we look at cultures and cultural values.  Only in that way can we address all of the issues that have been brought up.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be here this morning to chair what is a very important session.  I thank all the witnesses for coming before us for what has been a very informative engagement.  I am Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.  This committee was set up to consider the Citizens' Assembly report.  We published a cross-party report on 16 April, which I believe is the beginning of a new era for policy direction with regard to how the State deals with climate change.  As the witnesses will know, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is working on an all-of-Government action plan with regard to rolling out these policy changes, which will be critical for this and future generations.  I will not delay because I know the clock is ticking and my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, is waiting to step in to chair the next session.</p> <p>  Our first speaker is Mr. P&aacute;draig Flattery from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.

I am a PhD student in the ICARUS climate research unit at the Maynooth University department of geography.  My work is a drop in the ocean of climate change research being undertaken around the world every day, all of which bolsters the consensus that climate change is happening, that it is urgent, and that human activities are responsible.<br/><br/>I have been asked to speak today on the topic of climate action and sustainable development.  When I first read the title of this topic, I immediately thought of speeches made by the young Swedish climate activist, Greta Thunberg, who has helped mobilise a generation against the actions of their governments by holding weekly school strikes.  At her recent speeches to the World Economic Forum and the United Nations she told the delegates, &quot;I want you to panic&quot;.  In the brief time I have I will try to explain the scientific basis behind why she wants people to panic, and how climate action and sustainable development must be embraced to create a sustainable future for the next generations.<br/><br/>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, states that we must keep global warming to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change.  Warming of more than 1.5&deg;C increases the likelihood of climate tipping points being triggered.  These tipping points are thresholds that, if exceeded, can fundamentally alter the state of the climate system.  To provide members with an example, one possible consequence of warming above 1.5&deg;C is the thawing of permafrost in the Arctic, a process which is already under way and which releases vast amounts of methane, which is more than 25 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2</sub>, which will result in significant irreversible warming and is likely to trigger the collapse of other systems, including the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.  This ice sheet is already melting more and more each year.  If temperatures increase and the ice sheet reaches a point where it will melt entirely, we will be committed as a planet to a sea level rise of 6 m.  If we allow this to happen, there will be unimaginable global consequences which pose a genuine existential threat to humanity.<br/><br/>When people hear climate scientists speaking about these changes in the Arctic and Greenland, they wonder how it relates to us here in Ireland, but these sea level changes will be felt on a local as well as a global scale and our coastal cities will be threatened.  If we do not take action to prevent this happening, it will not matter which country did not meet its targets or which national interest was prioritised.  We have already warmed by around 1&deg;C, and will reach 1.5&deg;C warming somewhere between 2030 and 2052, meaning we have a decade to make radical changes to our economy and way of life.<br/><br/>The reality is clear.  As members of the EU we are committed to reducing our emissions by 40% compared with 1990 levels by the year 2030, just 11 years from now.  The EU has set the goal of an 80% to 95% reduction in emissions by 2050.  Current Irish policies are not aligned with our goals.  While the EU as a whole will achieve its 2020 emissions target, Ireland will significantly overshoot ours.  This sets us up to fail at achieving our future targets, and the longer we wait, the more difficult it becomes.  We need to encourage sustainable development and ensure all members of society can reduce their carbon footprints by decarbonising public transportation, energy generation and agriculture to give everyone the opportunity to make the right choices regarding their emissions.  While grants for new electric cars are encouraging, how many people can realistically avail of them? The importance of a holistic approach to adaptation is emphasised by a 2018 statement from the IPCC:</p> <blockquote> 	If poorly designed or implemented, adaptation projects in a range of sectors can increase greenhouse gas emissions and water use, increase gender and social inequality, undermine health conditions, and encroach on natural ecosystems [...] These trade-offs can be reduced by adaptations that include attention to poverty and sustainable development  </blockquote> <p>The joint committee&rsquo;s report on climate change and cross-party action echoes this sentiment in its call for a just transition to a green economy. <br/><br/>We need to safeguard the lives of all our future citizens.  We are the first generation to feel the effects of climate change and the last generation who will be able to do anything about it.  Individuals can and do take action, but the onus is on politicians to find solutions, create dialogue, and work towards our common goal of creating a better world for us all.  Sustainable development is not only possible, it is essential if Ireland is to maintain our green reputation on the world stage.  As shown by the committee&rsquo;s recent report, the transition to a green economy is an opportunity for economic growth and job creation in rural and urban Ireland, and ought to be embraced for the benefits it will bring.  The recommendations of the report are far-reaching and inspiring and must be implemented urgently.  They range from citizen-scale efforts to retrofit homes to renewable energy generation to a national push for offshore wind generation and decarbonisation of our economy.<br/><br/>As a direct result of protests by the Extinction Rebellion group, the UK declared a national climate change emergency just last week.  This was closely followed by Wicklow County Council which announced a climate and biodiversity emergency last week.  This shows us that there is hope, but time is running out.</p></speech>

I know members will fully understand my French accent, so it will not disturb them too much.  Climate change is urging us to take actions and to change our way of life radically.  Such actions and policies will require unprecedented levels of collaborative decision-making between all actors in society, including the public.  Yet, voices of local communities are still, in 2019, facing brick walls.  As European citizens, we need to be given the opportunity to participate actively and to have a real input on decisions that have effects on our daily life.</p> <p>  We know the positive effects that public participation can have.  We know, for instance, that local communities can substantially enhance the quality of decisions with locally grounded and value-based knowledge.  We should not see decisions tailored to reduce our vulnerability to climate change as purely technical.  This is not to say that experts should not contribute - their role is crucial - but common technical approaches to decision-making, such as cost-benefit analyses, cannot be the sole remedy to our problems.  Often, the real value of assets and landscapes can hardly be monetised and summarised into graphics, as they will have a deeper value and a deeper meaning to local communities.  Moreover, we should not forget that local communities are situated at the forefront of climate change, being the first to experience damage from storms, flooding, erosion or biodiversity losses.  Why should they then be kept silent?  Public participation is, after all, a democratic right.</p> <p>  The problem is that today's conventional forms of public participation do not work.  First, uploading a document on a website and then asking people to submit comments or suggestions does not guarantee that these submissions will have any effect on the decision.</p><p>Second, and most important, these forms of engagement do not resonate with most people.  Do Members of the Oireachtas believe that people of my age regularly check the websites of their local authorities?  This is the core of the problem.  There is a gap between our decision makers and the public.  This criticism demands that new mediums of participation need to be established in Ireland.  The Citizens' Assembly is a fantastic example that we can build on, but it cannot be limited to that.  Most decisions that affect our everyday lives take place in our communities at a local level.  Should every local authority have its owns citizens' assembly?  Why not?  There are countless examples of successful forms of active participation.  Citizen panels, citizen juries, citizen advisory committees, participatory budgeting, participatory planning, participatory mapping, e-participation and citizen science are forms of active public participation that have proven to be successful around the world.  Why should we limit those examples as isolated case studies rather than trying to make them the common practice?<br/><br/>The ball is in the court of those who represent us.  As we saw recently with the school strikes for climate, many people, especially those from the younger generation, are willing to engage in climate actions.  Strong and ambitious policies need to be implemented at national level to create nationwide structures for public participation and incite local decision makers to abandon the <i>status quo</i>and find innovative ways of engaging directly with their constituents.  Climate change represents one of the greatest challenges of our century.  We desperately need to reduce our carbon emissions and adapt to present and forthcoming impacts of climate change.  Decisions aiming at driving these societal changes cannot take place behind closed doors.  We need to seize climate change as an opportunity to change profoundly the way our democracy works in Ireland and in Europe.</p></speech>

This is why I have dedicated the last four years of my life to researching how we can develop effective and successful policies to deal with our climate and sustainable development challenges.  My presentation is based on cutting-edge research within political science as well as dozens of research interviews I have conducted in Germany in an attempt to understand the factors that have helped to underpin the success of Germany's historic energy transition.  I am looking at the factors that help to create policy that is politically and socially acceptable.  This is really the Holy Grail.  I hope to demonstrate how we can make stringent policy without facing electoral penalties.</p> <p>  I will mention a few insights and factors that have the potential to help us in our work.  The first of them underpins what has been said about the importance of citizen-centred energy and green industrial supports.  The key causal mechanism here is something called coalition building, which is essentially about the development of policy that seeks specifically to build coalitions of support for a green policy that allows policy measures to be ratcheted up over time.  The provision of direct industrial incentives to support the growth of particular green industries, such as renewables, is an effective way to build these new coalitions.  This has been borne out in the case of Germany, where it was a main driver of the energy transition.  The expansion of green industrial supports gave citizens access to the energy grid.  A payment for the energy fed into the grid supported the development of citizen-centred and community-centred renewable energies.  This solidified the societal acceptance of energy transitions, which is a key factor in determining our success as we go forward.</p> <p>  A second insight is that carbon-pricing approaches can face significant barriers to effective implementation.  An understanding of the dynamics of the political landscape is necessary in this context.  Carbon pricing incentivises regulatory losers, those who are going to lose out as a result of certain policies, to organise politically to prevent such policies from being implemented, thereby rendering measures difficult to implement and making them no more than marginally effective in the short and medium term.  It can be costly and time-consuming to tweak proposed instruments in order that they can be implemented in any form.  The EU emissions trading system and its related offset schemes have faced significant challenges.  Research indicates that switching to green industrial supports and focusing on such supports as well as on citizen-centred energy faces fewer political barriers and is more conducive to effective and sustainable policymaking.</p> <p>  Clear action on decarbonisation can have a powerful signalling effect and can create a facilitative framework.  Conversely, any moves to build new fossil fuel infrastructure can have lock-in impacts that undermine and derail sustainability transitions.  It is important to note that natural gas infrastructure projects that are planned within the EU's list of projects of common interest, including the planned Shannon liquified natural gas terminal, categorically impede our ability to decarbonise in a timely manner.  Alternatively, research has started to show that supply side policies, such as bans and moratoriums, have significant economic and political advantages compared with demand side policies.  The political advantages of such an approach include superior potential to mobilise public support, including within fossil fuel industries, as well as low administrative and transactional costs.</p> <p>  The EU can provide a framework for developing effective and just pathways to sustainable development and successful climate action.  Countries as small as Ireland can have a substantial impact within this framework.  Much of the work that is being done now involves the development of new norms of behaviour.  This has a powerful contagion effect.  We have an opportunity to implement a dynamic policy for effective climate action and sustainable development, but the window is closing fast.  Climate and ecological breakdown are hitting us faster than was ever predicted.  On our current path, a safe planet for human life will disappear before today's children reach the age of those we are addressing this morning.</p> <p>  No financial argument makes any sense when faced with these facts, regardless of whether it is hedged in terms of budget speak, bureaucratic processes, profits or vested interests.  The survival of all of us and all of those we care about is directly threatened by climate change.  This is not political.  It is a scientific fact that is based on science, physics and the laws of nature.  All Members of the Oireachtas will face important decisions in the coming weeks and months.  I want them to understand that everything they care about will be touched by climate and ecological breakdown.  They need to think about that and act from a place of love when they are making decisions.  Young people are asking politicians to give them a chance to live a dignified life and to have a safe world in which to live.  We are asking them to let us hope.  This is not about us versus them or young people versus politicians.  That is old thinking.  This is about the shared fate of all of us who are interconnected on this planet.  We are in this together for better or for worse, so let us make it better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.848" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Connor McGookin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019050900002#M00300"><p>I thank the committees for the opportunity to speak.  I have three brief points to make.  I will probably echo much of the frustration we heard in the previous statements.  First, climate change policy must be stepped up ambitiously.  Second, there is growing public appetite for climate action.  We have heard about Greta Thunberg.  Third, local actions must be adequately supported.  This should not just be about high-level ambition.  As Deputies and Senators are probably aware, European leaders are meeting in Romania today to discuss the future of Europe.  At this summit, eight countries and 210 cities are urging national leaders and the European Council to adopt a zero emissions target for 2050.  Last November, a report produced by the European Commission set out a number of pathways for achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  This commitment is essential if we are to avoid the apocalyptic narratives of climate change.  It is up to the EU 27 to lead the way.</p> <p>  I would like to mention one example of how Ireland is failing miserably to meet this responsibility.  Last October, a stark warning in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gave us just 11 years to make a meaningful difference.  Embarrassingly, this was followed by a failure to provide in the budget for an increase in carbon tax.  This reflects the lack of political leadership that has slowed the progress of climate policy across the world.  Thanks to a young Swedish girl, a growing movement throughout Europe is now demanding greater government ambition and moving climate policy onto the agenda.  The recent report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which achieved cross-party consensus, was a significant milestone.  The all-of-Government action plan that is being prepared is another important step in the right direction.  The achievement of political consensus is not the final hurdle, however.  We must build from here to secure social consensus.</p> <p>  While high-level ambition is essential, many of us have a lot to learn if we are to understand what this means at local level.  This is the focus of my own research.  I have explored new approaches to energy system modelling and planning that account for local values and perceptions.  As Mr. Leahy pointed out, there is a need to address some of the flaws in the planning and decision-making processes that can lead to opposition to infrastructural projects like large-scale wind developments and overhead pylons.  In 2015, the White Paper on energy mentioned that there was an "increasing recognition of the value that effective communication and a participative approach between developer, local community and local authority can bring to the development of energy infrastructure".</p><p>This has been echoed in recent policy with repeated references to phrases like "energy citizen" or "community engagement".  I imagine we can all agree this is a welcome narrative and is undoubtedly important for the energy transition.</p><p> However, within communities, several constraints are hindering meaningful progress.  I will list some of the key challenges and opportunities.  These have been compiled from my personal research and that of some of my colleagues.  First, volunteers are required, but depending on them will not be adequate.  As local champions these people are often part of several community groups and are already stretched.  The existing community networks represent a major opportunity but must be engaged in a respectful manner.  Second, I reiterate that core funding is needed.  Regular funding must be made available for the administration and co-ordination of community energy groups if they are to function effectively.  Third, until policy barriers in the form of tariffs, planning, finance and grid access are addressed, it will be unhelpful and perhaps counterproductive to continuously talk up community ownership of energy.  The final point is closest to my heart.  Community energy does not guarantee community acceptance but a more transparent and inclusive decision-making processes can help ease tensions and inspire positive action.</p><p> I will summarise my contribution.  I have noted the need for European leadership in stepping up ambition.  I touched on the noticeable growth in public appetite for meaningful climate action.  National leadership, extensive local engagement and clear benefits for communities are essential in driving the energy transition.</p></speech>

Last September, I began studying in DCU on the climate change masters programme.  I have always been interested in reading up on environmental news and over several years I have become increasingly concerned about climate change and environmental degradation.  Since beginning the course two things have happened.  I have realised how bad the situation is, but also that there is still hope.  It has hit home for me that there needs to be a fundamental change in our society if we are to tackle this problem in the short time there is left to effectively halt the worst of what could happen.<br/><br/>Ireland is rightly seen to be at the back of the pack.  However, the recent report from the Joint Committee on Climate Action is a welcome step in the right direction.  We can learn much from our European counterparts about what has worked and what has not.  We can build on these in an Irish context.<br/><br/>Effectively communicating the challenges and opportunities to citizens is the most important step.  There is a lot of fear and misunderstanding regarding climate change.  Public debate on what must happen to transition to a low-carbon economy is essential.  We need to have open conversations in the media and at the dinner table about how we must change the <i>status quo</i>and the best ways to do this for our local communities and large-scale industries.<br/><br/>I look forward to an all-of-Government action plan, as I believe it will help drive the public debate in a meaningful way to give the general public clear guidance on what is being proposed and how it will affect them personally and society as a whole.<br/><br/>The announcement by Bord na M&oacute;na last October of the loss of more than 400 jobs in the midlands shows the need for extensive planning and programmes to retrain workers or aid in job replacement schemes for those who will be most affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy.  Last October, the Spanish Government and coal miner unions reached a transition deal.  It offered early retirement or retraining for coal miners who are to lose their jobs as the industry is scaled back.  This is an example of good practice that can be repeated in an Irish context.  Some industries will be disproportionately affected, such as agriculture and peat production, while there will be more opportunities for green jobs elsewhere and these must be embraced.  Workers who believe their livelihoods are being threatened need to be engaged in what happens but at a community level there must be a discussion as well.  The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, campaigning on a green new deal platform, won the recent Spanish elections with up to 50% of the vote in some mining towns.  The party had worked with the coal miners unions previously.<br/><br/>Recently, there has been a surge in social activism around climate change, such as the school strikes for climate and the extinction rebellion.  I went to the two events held in Dublin.  As a former teacher, I know how hard it can be to motivate teenagers, but at the school strike, I was moved by the enthusiasm students showed that day.  At the extinction rebellion protest, I was inspired by the diversity of participants who showed up.  These movements show that the public are becoming increasingly aware of climate change, biodiversity loss and the general destruction of the natural world that is occurring at an unprecedented rate.  There has never been a better time to engage the public on the urgency of the crisis facing our planet.  Small-scale actions that individuals can take will not be enough without large-scale actions and policies by governments.  The EU, Ireland included, must lead the way and take bold unmitigated action now, with engaged citizens at the core of this transition.  The release earlier this week of the global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services is another stark reminder that our current system is failing and putting life on earth at risk.  The technology to make the shift is in place.  The financial risk will lessen the sooner we take action.  The public will to act has never been stronger.  It is time to change.</p></speech>

I will go to my colleagues with questions.  The witnesses might note the questions and then whoever wants to come in can answer them.  Is it okay if we proceed that way?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The witnesses have raised some important and key issues that the Joint Committee on Climate Action has been considering during the past seven months.  Ms Fitzgerald mentioned one of our key concerns, which is the price of carbon.  Although it was only a small part of our work, it was a key concern in respect of protecting the most vulnerable.  We considered the need to be politically palatable in bringing people with us and not making the mistakes we have made in other areas in engagement in with the community and bringing people on board.  That is why these conversations are important for us.  We have a body of work to complete and we can see that.  This is only the start.  Community engagement and how we communicate to the citizen are important.  We must protect the most vulnerable and those facing fuel poverty.  Key sectors will find the transition hardest, including the peat industry, the farming community and rural communities.  These are key areas that we have to work on as well.</p> <p>  I am keen to hear of any of the witnesses want to expand on what we can do in respect of the price of carbon.  They will have seen from our report how we are conscious of protecting those affected and the need to have a short, sharp engagement on the issue of the price of carbon and the key sectors that will be affected.  What else needs to be done on the regulatory and policy side?  What is the nature of the regulatory and policy mix needed for that to be a success?  That is one key component.</p> <p>  There was a major emphasis in all the contributions on new mediums of participation.  Mr. Leahy mentioned this and the question of community engagement.  This again is a whole-of-society approach.  The Government has a role to play but we cannot do it all; it has to be within the community as well.  One issue we have faced as elected representatives is that when we want to put in place renewable energy projects there is local opposition.  We talk about communities coming together feeding into the grid, tapping into the grid and selling their own electricity back into the grid.  We need to unlock the planning regulations.  The issues goes beyond acceptance.  If the witnesses have any more insights, I would be grateful to hear them.</p> <p>  I will bring in my colleagues now.  Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy and Senator M&aacute;ire Devine are first.  We will then hear from Deputy Tom Neville.</p></speech>

They will not find any argument from this side in respect of the challenge facing us all nationally and globally in terms of trying to halt global warming.</p> <p>  Mr. McGookin talked about reaching into local communities.  I wonder if he has looked at whether public participation networks are a good starting point.  I attended an event recently in my county of Offaly.  The public participation network there established Green Offaly, which is a great initiative.  Should initiatives like this be happening throughout the country?  It is something the Joint Committee on Climate Action discussed and recommended.</p> <p>  Ms Caroline Moran referred to Bord na M&oacute;na.  I am from Offaly.  A just transition is something that we are anxious to ensure.  Has she been keeping track of the efforts Offaly County Council has made recognising the challenges to the communities involved and the workers?  We need to bring together all the stakeholders to ensure that the workers involved are aware of all the benefits for them in terms of social protection as well as the opportunities for retraining and upskilling.  An event is being planned for the week after next.  It is a job-matching initiative in which local companies will come together with the workers who are taking voluntary redundancy.</p><p>There are many positives.  Other areas could learn from it.  Is Ms Moran keeping track of this?  It is important that we be aware of such efforts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.855" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1388" speakername="Maire Devine" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019050900002#O00200"><p>I thank the witnesses.  I am still a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  We were the black sheep of the committee when we voted against the carbon tax.  The committee has done 90% of its work collaboratively, but we were concerned about the just transition and the tax's imposition on less fortunate people who are struggling.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to expand on another point.  There is an emergency in our public health system because of climate change, and it will be even more harmful for communities tomorrow.  This is about communicating with communities not only about heatwaves, floods, storms and the resultant deaths, but about the day in, day out worldwide epidemic of asthma, respiratory tract infections and diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD.  Many of these have to do with pollution, for example, the quality of the water that we drink.  According to the World Health Organization, WHO, this threat costs many billions of dollars and causes millions of deaths per year.  The WHO believes that will only increase.  Should we declare this an emergency alongside climate change?</p> <p>  We have received representations from the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA.  It made an important statement that has stuck with me, namely, that we must rethink how we feed the world.  In the 1960s and 1970s, we did not have meat with every meal.  We could not afford it, as it was a luxury.  However, it has become so commonplace now that we expect it even though it is responsible for much of the destruction of the environment and our bodies' health.</p> <p>  When one sits down in a canteen, bistro or caf&eacute;, everything is packaged.  When did we stop being communal and sharing sugar bowls and milk jugs?  These simple points seem stupid, but they are down to hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, legislation.  We must revisit it, as it is so clinical and clean that it is damaging us, in that we are not being exposed to stuff and material is being wasted.  It is nonsensical that we all just sit around with sachets that we tear apart, adding to the destruction.  The global scale is larger, but I am interested in this matter.</p></speech>

I sat on the Joint Committee on Climate Action and, hopefully, will sit on a permanent version chaired by the Co-Chairman, Deputy Naughton.</p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses' presentations.  I went on a great journey of discovery during the eight months that I sat on the committee.  My knowledge of the parameters and facets of this issue was minuscule.  The witnesses are preaching to the converted as regards the necessary timelines and actions.</p> <p>  I was struck by the question of consultation and building coalitions raised in one of the presentations.  That is paramount to our success.  If we do not build a coalition and agreement across all parties and sectors of society, there will be a knee-jerk kickback.  Be it political or something else, it will be a "Them" and "Us" response that could set us back ten or 15 years or even a generation.  We do not want that.</p> <p>  Our committee viewed public consultation as paramount.  I was interested to hear about how an industry coalition was built on the ground in Germany, but Ireland needs to go to an even more micro level.  Since we have a smaller population, we are a more integrated society.  For example, managing directors of companies have siblings who are farmers or teachers.  As such, we wanted to propose town hall-type meetings that would involve peer-to-peer and community learning involving people from all sectors of society - young and old, farmers and doctors, unemployed people, those in receipt of disability payments and so on.  They would educate one another from the bottom up or at the same level.  Politicians taking a top-down approach will not work.  Europe and America have kicked back at such an approach.  We must alter our communication style.  That will be paramount in coalition building.  It will require maturity, not only from people, but also from political parties.  The latter must take a step back from the politics and build a coalition of consensus to drive this through.  I would be interested in hearing more about the coalition building that happened in Germany.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.860" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019050900002#O00700"><p>I welcome our guests, who have spoken passionately.  These are issues that we considered in significant depth in writing our report.  Action is needed.  The requirement that we live more sustainably, which we have not been doing for years, is at the heart of this.  It is the fallout of industrialisation and so on.  If people were surveyed, everyone would agree with the targets under the Paris Agreement.  It is only when one starts to drill down into who will take the pain and cost that a problem arises.  That is what we must address if we want to see action.  As Deputy Neville stated, though, there must be a consensus.</p> <p>  Recently, I attended a climate action forum of secondary schools in my county of Mayo that was facilitated by the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, the county council and the latter's climate action officer.  We were sitting around a table and one of the issues debated was that of cost.  In terms of transport, for example, we talked about how, if the pupils' parents had to get electric vehicles, it would cost them money regardless of how large a grant the State provided.  The same would be the case with heating systems.  When I asked them if they believed that would be acceptable, they could not say that it would be.</p> <p>  There is another political reality.  No matter what people say in the abstract about targets and the need to take action, the experience in Canada, Australia, Finland, France and Germany has been that, when politicians take political action, a large number of people do not agree with doing so.  It does not mean that we should balk at trying to do the right thing, as we cannot continue taking from the Earth something that will not be replenished and will cause greenhouse gas emissions.  We are smarter now and have more technology.  We must be smarter and live more smartly.  However, the idea that everyone is in agreement is incorrect.  It is not even that they do not believe that there is climate change.  Rather, they are more concerned with living in the here and now than with taking on additional pressures.  If someone is in receipt of social welfare payments, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, can fund 100% of certain energy efficiency works on his or her house.  If someone is earning a low income and, accordingly, will only receive partial supports, he or she will be under pressure.  These are the people who will be financing their children going to college.  From where will that money come?  The bill will be significant.  That is even evident from our social housing programme, given the additional cost of building houses.  People are revolting against costs.  That does not take from the witnesses' message, but we must refine our discussion to listening to people's concerns.</p> <p>  I have raised an issue previously and, while I do not want to labour the point, it must be borne in mind that when the witnesses refer to the measures that are necessary to tackle climate change, they are asking for more to be done by people living in rural areas.  They are asking rural areas to take wind farms and grid infrastructure.  They are asking for peat-burning power stations to be shut down.  Where I am from, such a station closed a number of years ago.  The area is only a shadow of its former itself economically.</p><p>The issue of community gain is very relevant there.</p><p> There is also the issue of farming and the speaker from Teagasc earlier made a sensible proposition.  We are very well suited to producing protein from dairy and beef.  It does not mean that we continue exactly in the same vein but this is not discussed.  There is now a situation where farmers are saying they have been doing all of this.  The national herd has increased and that is why our greenhouse gases and emissions of methane have increased but farmers are farming more efficiently than ever before.  They are put to the pin of their collars by payments on environmental measures, water quality and biodiversity.  They have an appetite to do more but feel persecuted.  People are disengaging.</p><p> I will say one final thing.  The generation coming after us ask us to look at what we are doing.  The reality is that the parents of the children I was talking to would give their left arms for their children.  Their grandparents would do the same.  The generations that have come before are trying to cope and do their best.  They care and want to be given credit for that.  We have to get realistic solutions which balance idealism with the reality to achieve them and not crush people in the process.  </p><p> We will have a revolution.  It will not be like those revolting in London who are from more middle class backgrounds and have time on their hands.  The ordinary person will revolt which will create another set of problems that will set us back economically.  We cannot take from the advances and lifestyles we enjoy.  We must find technology to match that.</p><p> The last speaker on the environment was positive and hopeful, as I am.  Human beings have great capacity to innovate and, although there will always be issues and problems, there can be business opportunities here.  We see a lot of signals sent out by China and India, major emerging economies, that they have to go to green technology and transport etc.  Ireland has to take these signals if it wants to participate in the global economy.  We must also be clever.   It is not only about misery, it is about opportunities and living in a different way.</p></speech>

I will come to Senator Higgins.  I am conscious of letting our speakers come back to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.863" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019050900002#P00300"><p>I apologise to the speakers that I am having to come and go from the Chamber but I was very interested in their presentations on this issue.  I campaigned with Tr&oacute;caire on climate change in 2008 when a group of young activists, who are no longer young, were demanding action.  Even then, climate change was not new and there were huge impacts on many parts of the world and many communities were seeing their futures destroyed.</p><p>It is good that there is momentum now and climate change is centre stage in discussions.  Europe Day is about Europe and the real test will be if Europe will place the sustainable development goals and climate change actions at the centre of the new five-year European strategy.  Will they also be at the centre of the multiannual financial framework, the European budget?  Simply putting climate action front and centre for photos at the moment will not be enough.  </p><p>The European Investment Bank put &euro;11 billion into fossil fuels between 2007 and 2013.  The European climate action fund is proposed to be &euro;5 billion.  I want people to discuss the balance between where we invest and how we can stop taking backward steps.</p><p>One of the speakers mentioned the LNG terminal which is an example of something that was funded by European investment funding.  How do we get that joined up?  It comes down to public participation.  </p><p>I am passionate about new forms of participation and we need them.  I like the idea of town hall meetings, I think they are important, and I also think people should be looking at their local authority's development plans and putting in opinions.  That is important.  It is crucial to ask how we ensure the public discussion does not stay in a silo as a separate discussion on climate, but rather bring climate action into the economic discussion around budgets.  We need to ensure that closed-door economic decisions such as trade agreements and procurement are joined up and informed by climate considerations.  We need not to have any backward steps.  I would like to hear the comments of the speakers on that matter.</p><p>Another consideration is the comparative roles of the public and private sectors which was touched on by some of the speakers.  For example, it might be tempting to support the electric car industry because it has the potential to make profit whereas public transport might not, but public transport might lead us to make much greater progress much more quickly.  There will be things that will cost money and will not necessarily be profitable but, if we do not take the action now, the cost will be borne elsewhere in the world and by those most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>That brings us to the question of carbon pricing.  I am on the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection and am very passionate about just transition.  We must not wait for people to become redundant from sectors that are no longer sustainable but need to talk to them while they are still employed about their plans for the future.  I have been arguing for that in the context of just transition.  We must manage the pragmatic issues around just transition in Ireland and look to climate justice on a global level so we not only address the concerns in Ireland but look to climate justice for other parts of the world.</p><p>The price of carbon is artificially low and needs to be higher.  The price has driven an unsustainable global development model.  Do we make social protection payments?  Fuel poverty payments will get us to a certain level but, as was rightly said, many people on low incomes will not be caught by the fuel supplement.  How do we recognise and ensure that industry is reflecting the price of carbon and does not have artificially deflated prices because of artificially deflated carbon costs while ensuring that individuals are not taking the worst of the impacts?  Those are the key questions.  Perhaps we should look at bans, moratoriums and levies on sectors.</p><p>I will conclude because I want to hear the responses of the speakers.  It comes back to the question of business as usual.  Where do we frontload?  Can we, and should we, balance keeping interests aligned while ensuring that we do not wait for certain climate actions to become profitable?<b></b>We have to frontload it.  All of the speakers had practical thoughts on how we do that.  </p><p>My key questions relate to climate justice, just transition, the public and private spheres and how to ensure this is an economic transformation as well as a social movement.</p></speech>

There is a great deal we can do on climate change in a relatively short time.  We are supposed to achieve certain targets within ten years and it is well within our capacity to achieve them in that time period even though we are late starters.</p> <p>  The first thing we had to do was to convince people of the necessity to change and become less reliant on fossil fuels.  As we do that, we must also become less reliant on the electricity generated from fossil fuels.  Once we have crossed that part of the divide, the rest will follow readily.  There is serious interest in electric cars this year where there was no such interest in the past.</p> <p>  Some of us have, over the past number of years, tried to sell the idea of alternative energy and the renewable energy sector and been publicly criticised and ridiculed for it.  That is part of the battle we must face into.  We must balance our approach, try to ensure that we do not target part of our community, or be seen to do so, in our journey towards achieving the necessary change.  We have the capacity to do that, provided we do it right, and avoid the possibility of postponing forever something we need to start doing now.</p></speech>

The first point made was about carbon tax and we looked at that and what it would mean to raise the weekly allowance in order to offset the extra &euro;10.</p><p>It was something like &euro;4 in the winter and &euro;2 in the summer.  We will revert to the committee as we have some figures on that.  It would not hit the people in fuel poverty.  Much of what comes from our research must account for fuel poverty.</p><p> Climate change is a cross-cutting matter and there were questions as to how to overcome the problems.  There are significant benefits to dealing with climate change, particularly in the rural sector, and I hope dealing with climate change would address many of the problems of rural degradation and help to revive many rural areas.  It would help farmers through diversification of income by generating electricity, growing other crops or being paid for the carbon captured in their forests.  Reforestation would be a major part of achieving carbon neutrality, along with restoring wetlands.</p><p> Public participation networks were a recommendation in the report from the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which is why I left them out of my bullet points.  I certainly agree that we need such town hall meetings and there is an attempt to achieve this with the national dialogue on climate change.  It is important to capacity building in communities to have access to impartial experts who can point to the facts and challenges being faced.  It is about open discussion.  My research in the Dingle peninsula relates to this if the members are interested.</p><p> Somebody mentioned going through the local authority and we thought that if we could follow the example of the UK and Wicklow in declaring a climate emergency, local authorities should have it as a top priority to have a climate change officer who would be able to advise homeowners or community groups.  It is an important element in building capacity, which has been mentioned quite often.  There was mention of the middle class accessing grants.  It is a major problem.  I know in Australia, poorer people were basically subsidising richer people getting solar panels put on their homes.  We must be careful to avoid such things.</p></speech>

As has been mentioned, it is really important that there should be plans in place before peat production is closed so workers can have options in what they do afterwards.  If there is to be a change, those workers need different options and time to think.  At a community level there must be thought on what new industries can be brought in to benefit the entire community.</p> <p>  There was mention of carbon tax and feed-in tariffs for solar photovoltaic equipment, which is really important.  The uptake of solar photovoltaic technology in countries with feed-in tariffs has been huge.  If there is fuel poverty or people have low incomes without supplements, they could get profits from a feed-in tariff rather than just a grant.  Retired people in their homes during the day may use electricity while it is generated and therefore it would cut their costs.  Conversely, if people are at work all day they do not get the benefit of energy that is being produced but they would see a benefit through a feed-in tariff.  They would get the money back.  Such a process could work, especially in rural communities.  We have spoken much about farmers and if they are leaving land spare, there could be large-scale solar photovoltaic installations to generate income as well.  We need to be creative in what we do.</p></speech>

This goes beyond just public consultation, which is also a good step.  This is also about what policy choices we make and the outcomes and effects they have.  To underline what has already been said, feed-in tariffs, for example, have the effect of building powerful coalitions.  In Germany there were all sorts of actors who became supportive of the policy and really tried to protect it, including people who may not necessarily have been green-minded.  They support it being ratcheted up.</p> <p>  It is really important to note the social dimension.  We have seen the yellow vest movement in France and what happens when we do not have this lens in implementing the decarbonisation policy.  There was mention of a just transition and this should not be about climate action versus farmers or peat workers.  Farmers are on the front line of climate change and they are already experiencing it.  We have seen that with the fodder crisis.  The fossil fuel age is collapsing and one way or another, peat workers will see an impact from climate change policy.  We must achieve this in a just way.</p> <p>  I will speak briefly to carbon pricing.  As I stated, I am drawing on an understanding of policy dynamics.  Carbon pricing should be seen as one of many tools in a policy mix.  One of the issues is the need to build alternatives and allow people to have alternatives through something like a feed-in tariff.  To draw on a German case, there was a delay in trying to implement carbon pricing through the emissions trading system and, essentially, there was neglect of the areas of transport, heating and the idea of a more systemic just transition.  Now the country is facing the consequences, so we would do well to learn from their mistakes and not have this happen with carbon price implementation in Ireland.  Green industrial support, citizen energy, bans and moratoriums can be used.  The paper I quoted was by Mr. Fergus Green and Dr. Richard Denniss from 2017 and it is available online.  They argue that supply-side bans have a host of advantages and gain much support, including from actors like the fossil fuel industry, which we might not expect.</p> <p>  Citizen energy feeds into the transformative elements and resilience in communities and globally.  It builds more community resilience and this enables communities to face climate change issues.  That work comes from people like Mr. Craig Morris.  There is a need to look locally but also globally at what is coming.  People in Mozambique are panicking, for example, and people across the global South already facing the impact of climate change are panicking.  We would do well to respond right now to what we are all facing.</p></speech>

We could speak about this for hours and all the information has almost given me a headache.  There is one point that has been mentioned a few times and it relates to consultation.  It is one type of participation but this cannot just be about consultation.  According to my research, many different authors and academics have stated that typical formal consultation does not work.  Submissions may not be taken into account with a final decision and there is also the question of when consultation happens.  Does it happen when all the options are closed and if so, how efficient can that be?  There is the question of timing in participation.</p> <p>  I can give a brief example.  Last year the national adaptation framework was published in January and it marked the first step in a process of building national adaptation for different sectors and local authorities.  It was put out for consultation in September 2017 and there were 27 or 28 submissions.  It was not a very high number.  The submissions are available online and only four were submitted by private individuals not representing an organisation or State agency.  This demonstrates a problem.  Is the general public just not interested in those policies or is there a lack of communication in advertising those formal consultation processes?  It is something we must be aware of and we probably need to go a step further than just consultation.  It would amount to considerable responsibility for local authorities but this needs to happen at a local level.</p></speech>

There is certainly a need to panic as we are missing our targets for 2020 and we are set up to miss the 2030 targets.  If by 2050 we are to be carbon-neutral or reduce our emissions by 80% or 100%, we are not on track to do it, even if we implement many of the recommendations of the report.</p> <p>  To focus on agriculture, my research was on soils and soil carbon in Ireland, taking into account the effect of extreme weather on those soils.  Our natural grasslands are carbon sinks because they are grazed by cattle and they provide minerals for the soil.  Those soils are carbon sinks in the same way that our untouched peatlands are.  There are 7 million cows in Ireland producing methane.</p><p>I do not understand how we square getting to carbon neutrality by 2050 with retaining that number of cows.  We need also to recognise the benefit the cows have to the soil.  These are complex issues and communicating their complexity is very important, especially if we do not want an "us versus them" strategy coming out.  Farmers are certainly looking after their land to the best of their ability as they want to pass it on to future generations.  Focusing on the complexities of the issue is important but so is recognising the limitations of our current actions.  </p></speech>

This is a very important topic, especially on this day, for as Europeans we have known the reality of migration, most often forced migration due to war, conflict, famine, disease and escape from poverty across the centuries.  It is beyond dispute that the people of Ireland have known migration and its causes like few others across the Continent.  This generational awareness, experience and knowledge should contribute to our being a truly welcoming people, giving truth to the claim that this is an Ireland of the welcomes.  Sadly, of course, this is not always the case.  </p> <p>  While we have some time issues, there will be no restriction in respect of the three speakers.

I will present some facts and numbers and some challenges that the EU is facing in respect of migration.  The 2015 migration crisis became a starting point to a wider debate on migration in the European Union but also on burden sharing and the member states' responsibilities.  The lack of joint action between the member states has shown that in 2015 the EU was unprepared to handle this issue, which resulted in disorderly migration, human trafficking and tragedy.  In respect of the numbers, 2.5 million immigrants entered the EU from non-EU countries in 2017; and 4.4% of people living in the EU on 1 January 2018 were non-EU citizens, which is 22 million people out of a total of 512 million.  The European agency for human rights has pointed out that the number of irregular migrants crossing the borders dropped in 2017, when 200,000 people crossed the EU borders, in comparison to approximately 500,000 in 2016.  The number of deaths at sea has also dropped; however, the emergency remains as the deaths are continuing, mainly in the central Mediterranean.</p> <p>  Also concerning is the fact that migrants arriving within EU borders have been mistreated.  This mistreatment worsened in 2017 with Bulgaria, Hungary and Croatia as the leading countries of migrant mistreatment.  Another issue is the relocation of immigrants and the problem of overcrowding.  This has been critical in numerous locations, especially in Greece, France and Italy.  Providing adequate housing remains a challenge and the lack of co-operation between member states has a significant impact on how immigration is handled in the EU.  The European Council established a temporary relocation scheme with a plan to relocate 160,000 people in need.  This was not accomplished due to lack of co-operation from the member states.  President Antonio Tajani has stated that migration is our biggest challenge and that it is putting at risk the very future of the European Union.  As a result of intense migration within the EU in recent years, EU internal borders have been subject to additional border controls, which is putting the free movement of EU citizens at risk.  There is a need for better co-operation between member states with regard to border management as the migration crisis has put major pressure on the member states' border authorities.  The European institutions responded with a call for strengthening the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, however this remains a work in progress, with a plan of giving the agency a standing corps of 10,000 border guards by 2027, which is a bit far away.  A Eurobarometer survey has reported that 73% of European citizens want the EU to do more on the issue of migration and 58% described EU action on migration as inadequate.  There is a need to do more on the part of both member states and the EU as a whole.  Reaching agreement on migrant issues has been a challenge for the European Union.  It is a sensitive issue and member states have different views and policies on migration, making it difficult to negotiate co-ordinated common positions.  The migration crisis in 2015 showed that the EU was not prepared to handle a humanitarian crisis.  Plans to relocate migrants, strengthen the borders, integrate refugees and much more are still a work in progress.</p> <p>  Member states and their representatives have to become aware of the next upcoming crisis, which is climate displacement.  This crisis is not spoken about or understood by many.  It is not defined or backed by international law.  It is true that civil war and unrest in Syria, Libya and the Middle East are reasons for the migrant crisis but there are deeper reasons for current migration from these places.  These areas are experiencing rainfall patterns, unbearably high temperatures, floods, droughts and all sorts of natural disasters which lead to major changes in farming, fishing and herding, causing migration from these areas to more developed ones.  Reports on climate displacement presented by the EU are often very generalised and do not provide clear solutions to the problem.  Following the 2015 migration crisis, it is clear that member states are not united with regard to burden sharing and this has to be addressed in order to prepare Europe and help those in need.  </p> <p>  I will present a couple of recommendations made by the Mary Robinson Foundation on Climate Justice in its 2016 position paper.  Above EU national level, the rights of climate displaced people have to be respected in the same way as human rights in general.  The burdens in respect of dealing with climate migration have to be addressed together as a Union.  There is a need for engagement with already displaced people but also with those who are vulnerable to climate displacement, in order to protect the rights of people who are at risk of climate displacement.  The most important action the countries can take is to reduce the impact of climate change at all costs.  This will reduce the threats in areas at risk.</p></speech>

As a younger citizen, I am particularly grateful for this opportunity to engage on such a timely policy issue.  My knowledge is based on my European-funded research at Dublin City University, the University of Glasgow and Charles University, Prague.  My research focuses on migration to Europe, specifically the power of the media and policy makers to shape public opinion.  My current research examines the ways in which migration has been constructed as a threat and questions the dominance of this threat-centric approach.</p> <p>  It is without doubt that international migration and issues surrounding migrants, refugees and asylum seekers can be seen as defining characteristics of the 21st century in an era of globalisation.  In the context of conflict and growing inequalities, the IOM's 2018 report estimates that there are 258 million international migrants globally.  Ireland's strong cultural memory and historic trend to emigration mean that we are acutely aware of the realities of migration and displacement.</p><p>Yet more recently, Ireland has experienced increased inward migration and has become an increasingly diverse society with the 2016 census indicating that the 535,000 non-Irish nationals living in Ireland originate from 200 different nations.  Such figures illustrate the increased diversity and prompt the need to examine political and societal attitudes to immigrants, and explore different ways to support integration and social cohesion within Irish and European society.</p><p> The first challenge I will address relates to the power of language and narrative.  Migration has remained one of the most divisive issues for the public in recent years and this is reflected in the polarised narratives and language which frame discussions.  Past decades have seen a language shift from emigrant and immigrant to the use of the word "migrant" which has effect of de-contextualising the experience of these people by removing their home location and their destination.  There is also selectivity in respect of those to whom we apply these terms which often indicates a hierarchy of worthiness, suggesting that we have "good" versus "bad" migrants.</p><p> The language we use matters.  It has power to reinforce negative stereotypes and racial hierarchies which permeate to every level of society.  As such we must recognise and challenge harmful, polarising language and myths regarding migration.  We must refrain from using terms such as "illegal migrant" in any forum of discussion and instead use "irregular" or "undocumented".  We must commit to increased engagement in order to confront the myths of migration at local, national and EU levels.</p><p> There is a need to engage in difficult discussions regarding migration for policy makers, journalists and activists to maintain credibility.  We must create a space where communication of the perceived and actual challenges of migration is possible, but not in a way which stigmatises or alienates communities.  The creation of action plans and strategies by Government and local authorities, such as the migrant integration strategy or even the UN migration pact convey effective messages which are honest, fair and accessible.</p><p> The second challenge I wish to address is promoting integration in communities.  There is increasing recognition of the inherent potential of diverse society.  There is also an awareness of the difficulties associated with integration policies and programmes.  The dilemma often relates to how to prioritise integration without fuelling unfairness among certain groups that feel left behind.  Research has shown that encounters with the reality of migration foster a more tolerant mindset within host communities, which needs to be looked at further.</p><p> In discussions on the topic of integration, it is often said that the process is a two-way street involving the host community and the newcomer.  However, we need to move away from this binary give-and-take view of integration, as it does not always capture the complex, multifaceted and dynamic process which involves a network of actors and interactions.  As such we must disrupt the preconceptions that contribute to a gap between the expectation and reality of migration.  We must do this through promoting intercultural competency and integration programmes, such as arts and language acquisition, for all members of society.  We must aim to equip all citizens with the education to gain empathy and perspective-taking skills.</p><p> We must view the integration process in the context of the whole of society and facilitate the undoing of notion of "us" versus "them".  We must broaden the view of immigration beyond simply contributing to GDP or market growth.  It is not just about financially benefiting from migration, but about the overall health of our societies over the next generation.  In addition we need to carry out further research into attitudes towards diversity and integration within Irish and European society, such as the recent ERSI study.</p><p> With the immense challenges facing European and Irish society, such as changing demographics, political fragmentation, labour market changes and the pace of political and social changes, we need to have broader perspectives on the challenges we are facing and also an ambitious vision of what our future communities may look like.</p><p> We should not think of integration as an endpoint, but to understand it as an ongoing, inclusive process which provides opportunities and builds resilience in communities to confront the growing range of future challenges, not just in respect of migration.</p><p> I look forward to hearing the committee's views.</p></speech>

I am honoured to be addressing the committee today.  I am a BSc student in University College Cork in the second year of my undergraduate studies.  Appropriately we are speaking on Europe Day about a month before the European Parliament elections.  Given the changes in the political climate, it is now more important than ever to use the ballot box to have our voices heard in Europe.</p> <p>  The Treaty of Rome established the freedom of movement in respect of goods, services, capital and, what seems to be getting most attention lately, the movement of people, as we have seen from our colleagues in the European Union.  Migration has many different definitions and comes in many types, including economic migrants, refugees and ex-pats.  The perception of migration is intriguing as to whether it is harmful or positive, and what are its economic effects and difficulties.  Many people see the advantages of labour gaps being filled and society becoming more diverse.  We also see the negativity that jobs are being take away by members of the migrant community or that there is a social pressure on civic services along with an increase in racism and discrimination.</p> <p>  The cross-national Role of European Mobility and its Impacts in Narratives, Debates and EU Reforms, REMINDER, study shows that more than half of EU citizens regard the freedom of movement as positive for Europe despite an increase in support for far-right parties which has the effect of making mainstream parties take tougher stances on immigration.  European countries tend to view the effects of migrants in two ways - cultural and economic.  More recently we are starting to think about safety and terrorism.  The REMINDER study took place across seven countries in western Europe.  Apart from the UK, most countries showed more than 50% in favour of the freedom of movement.  These viewed most immigrants to western European as beneficial and not an economic or cultural threat.  Africans were viewed as most threatening to the economy while Middle Eastern migrants were considered the most threatening to safety and culture.  This has been as a result of the image of migrants portrayed in our media.</p> <p>  Europeans perceive that migrants from outside Europe make up 16.7% of the EU population.  The reality is that it is about 4.4% as of January 2018.  The representation of migrants in the media has had a profound effect on how we view our migrants.  The media provide both a human face in the form of refugees but also a mild terror attack in the form of big news headlines which terrify us.</p> <p>  Migration is an important topic for us all.  It has been shown to be a top priority for countries in the southern coastal part of Europe, namely in Croatia, Italy and Greece.  It is not so much of an issue in Ireland and is not a voter priority.  This is mainly due to the fact in the late 2010s it is shown that the majority of non-EU migrants arrive by sea.</p> <p>  Our landscape is changing through climate change and we need to become proactive rather than reactive if we are to prepare for another migrant crisis such as we saw in 2015.  We need to make sure that with coming of an EU army we are not creating a fortress Europe but rather creating a Europe that is open to all and not just Europeans.</p></speech>

This is not my area of expertise.  The Seanad has a public consultation committee.  In the autumn I plan on opening a conversation by inviting representatives from the direct provision system, which is a shame and stain on our country.  I would like to invite the three witnesses present to come to talk about migration and how people get to that point of desperation.  We are displaying inhumanity to people who need embracing, care and love, and a shelter from the horrific circumstances they left behind.</p> <p>  The witnesses talked about climate displacement - which could have been appropriate to the previous speakers - the greed of the developed world and our destructive impact on those less fortunate.</p><p>Our objective in having a public consultation in the autumn will be to challenge perceptions in this country and reach out to the 40% of people who feel afraid of and unsure about migration.  It is about getting the media to respond and to counteract some of the hysterical and hateful headlines we have seen.  The witnesses noted that voters in several European countries have elected more delegates from right-wing, fortress Europe parties.  My colleague, Senator Gavan, was in Hungary recently and may speak about what he saw there.  I will be happy to extend an invitation to the witnesses, who have made an excellent contribution to this debate, to attend the public consultation later this year.</p></speech>

We have had very impressive contributions from all the witnesses.  As part of my work as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I have witnessed teenagers the same age as my own children being kept in cages, for more than six months in one case.  That is what is happening in parts of Europe to migrant children.  The witnesses have played their part today in seeking to break the shameful silence around this issue.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on the EU's deal on migration with Turkey, which is deemed a third country of safe origin.  It is no such thing but is, in fact, a dictatorship in which horrendous human rights abuses are taking place.  It suits the EU to do that deal, however, because it keeps people out and there is apparently little interest in how migrants are being treated in Turkey.  It is an appalling human rights situation and the EU is utterly complicit in it.  It is a situation that must be ended.  I thank all the speakers for their contributions.</p></speech>

However, compared with countries like Hungary and Turkey, there are ways in which we can seek to integrate people into our society as much as possible.  We have seen great projects, for example, from Scouting Ireland and the Irish Second-Level Students Union.  However, if we remain silent on what is happening in other countries, what is the point of any such efforts?  We should be taking the lead by saying we will not stand for this.  We are a Europe of peace but there is no point if we are not working to keep the peace between people internally in our member countries.</p></speech>

It is timely, therefore, to have a public consultation on the issue.  I agree that the EU seems to be outsourcing many of our problems with migration to a neighbourhood comprising Libya, Morocco and Turkey.  There needs to be a re-engagement across European society on the values we are meant to uphold, such as strength in diversity.  The actions being taken in the EU at a high political level do not reflect those principles.  Likewise in Ireland, the refugee programme has reached only half its quota.  We need to reflect on our claim to be the island of c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.  A public consultation will be very helpful in that regard.</p></speech>

On burden sharing, as long as countries do not take responsibility for that at European level, nothing will change.  As it stands, burden sharing is voluntary.  We must push at European level to make such commitments binding and ensure we take responsibility for the care of migrants.  In the context of climate displacement, we in Europe are the lucky ones who are safe for now, but we must take responsibility for the damage we are doing to the planet and to the people who will be displaced by climate change.</p></speech>

Ms Thompson clearly linked increased migration with the climate crisis, especially as it affects less developed and impoverished parts of the globe.  Ms Bartley spoke about the importance of language and how "illegal migrant" is an inappropriate and stigmatising term and one we should not use.  I thank her for that strong message.  She spoke, too, about how an "us and them" outlook is blinkered and serves to feed prejudice and racism.  Ms Richardson noted that the free movement of people is one of the key principles of the European Union and, like her colleague, linked migration to the importance of addressing the climate crisis.</p> <p>  In the absence of my Co-Chairman, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, it falls to me to draw the meeting to a close.  The witnesses have distinguished themselves and their respective colleges and organisations.  It is a great pleasure for us as Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to welcome young, focused and enthusiastic voices from across the length and breadth of the island of Ireland.  That has been an important feature of today's discussion.  I especially welcome the fellow voices from Ulster, which makes me feel at home.  Every time I cross the Boyne Valley Bridge, I let out a small cheer that I am heading there again.  I thank colleagues for their part in marking Europe Day so well as we have done.  I hope it will be the first of many years of interesting engagement between ourselves and witnesses like those we have heard from today.</p></speech>

Before we start, I remind members and witnesses to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off.  This is important as they cause serious problems for the broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.</p> <p>  I am delighted that today we have engagement on Europe Day.  We have a presentation by the students on the challenges facing the European Union and we are all very much looking forward to that.</p> <p>  I welcome all the witnesses to this special meeting of the joint committees on Europe Day.</p><p>On this day in 1950 Robert Schuman outlined his vision for Europe of peace and co-operation between nations.  That was nearly 70 years ago, but it laid the foundations for the European Union we know today.  It is a strong partnership of nations that are working together to achieve the common goals of peace and prosperity.  Ireland joined the European Economic Community, EEC, now the European Union, in 1973 and has been a proud participant in European institutions for more than 45 years.  Citizens of Ireland tend to be very positive about our EU membership.  The results of a recent poll carried out by Red C Research and Marketing for the European Movement of Ireland showed that 93% of Irish people supported remaining in the European Union.  This shows the success of the European project and the benefits the European Union has brought to the country.<br/><br/>For Ireland, membership of international rules-based organisations is the best way to build relationships and alliances and for countries to support each other.  Europe Day is a great opportunity for us all to reflect on where we are and what we have achieved.  Importantly, it is also an opportunity to discuss the challenges ahead for all of us and how we can work together to find solutions to them.  In the context of Brexit and all of the implications that stem from it, it is more important than ever before for politicians, of all political allegiances and none, to work together and show a united front when it comes to doing our job and ensuring a good team effort across the political divide.  I sincerely believe it is terribly important for us to do so.  <br/><br/>Elections to the European Parliament will be held across the European Union in a few weeks' time.  The results of the same poll to which I referred showed that younger cohorts who were the most positive towards the European Union and many of its policies and who certainly had views on the issues at stake were also the least likely group to vote on 24 May.  It is important that we find ways to engage with each other and hear from experts emerging in their fields.  It is especially important that we hear the views of young people on the issues that will affect the future of the European Union.  I am passionate about this issue.  When I look at young people, I see them as the future.  In the years to come they will be the politicians and employers.  Every one of us is on a wheel and our time in our different roles comes and then finishes.  It will then be the turn of the young people who are before me.  When I go into schools, national and secondary, all I think of is that they are the future.  They are the ones who will be running the country, the Europe Union and the world in the years ahead.  I am very conscious of this, as we all should be.  <br/><br/>I do not think we have ever held a meeting of five joint committees before.  Today's event shows a new approach and how important it is that we take a cross-sectoral approach to such broad issues.  I welcome our guests, the students and young people from Queens University Belfast, QUB; Ulster University, UU; Teagasc; University College Dublin, UCD; Dublin City University, DCU; National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG; National University of Ireland, Maynooth, NUIM; and our neighbours in University College Cork, UCC.  <br/><br/>The meeting will be divided into four sessions and the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the relevant committee will chair its session.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. <br/><br/>I ask the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Deering, to lead us in the discussion on the reform of the Common Agriculture Policy.</p></speech>

In this session we will deal with the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which has served the country well in recent years.  In our discussion we are going to hear about where it is going to go in the months and years ahead.  The discussion will include the environmental and budgetary aspects of the CAP.  Budgets are very important, as nothing can be done without them.  We will also hear about reform, subsidiarity and flexibility.  We would like to hear about all of these elements.  Whenever there is a discussion about the CAP, we hear about the need to make it more simplified.  "Simplification" is a big word, but the CAP always seems to come out more bureaucratic.  We are looking forward to the discussion on the next CAP taking place and being concluded in the next year or so to finally have a more simplified programme.  I am delighted that we are joined by Mr. Daniel Bakker from Queens University Belfast, Dr. Sin&eacute;ad Furey and Dr. Lynsey Hollywood from Ulster University, Dr. Sin&eacute;ad McCarthy from Teagasc and Ms Si&uacute;n M&aacute;ire Riordan from University College Cork.  I welcome them and thank them for attending to discuss this very important issue, on which I look forward to a very good discussion.  I call Mr. Bakker to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I will speak about the CAP for a few minutes.  </p> <p>  In June 2018 the European Commission put forward its legislative proposals for the future of the CAP post 2020.  Previous reforms of the CAP had been driven by political and economic change.  It is important, therefore, for all concerned to look at the political challenges facing the European Union and what the future of the CAP might look like.</p> <p>  The European Union is facing the challenges of UK withdrawal, the rise of a Eurosceptic tide across member states, global market instability, particularly in agricultural prices, and greater pressure to respond and adapt to climate change.  The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union is crucial because it has contributed significantly to a forecasted reduction in the CAP budget for the period 2021 to 2027.  The cut proposed is 5%, but it will be around 12% in real terms.  As the CAP is one of the cornerstones of European integration, it is important that the Commission&rsquo;s proposals be considered and scrutinised.</p> <p>  The proposed legislation retains the current two pillar structure of direct payments and rural development but allows much greater flexibility for member states to choose where their allocation of funds will go.  The Commission&rsquo;s rationale is to streamline the CAP and increase overall efficiency.  Member states will be better able to target their interventions to suit their specific contexts.  The proposals also have revised greening architecture for pillar 1 payments and put strong emphasis on the CAP&rsquo;s commitment to environmental sustainability.</p> <p>  Member states will be responsible for drawing up strategic plans which will then be approved by the Commission to ensure they stay within the CAP&rsquo;s overall objectives.  Some see this as a step in the right direction, but others, including some member states, have raised concerns as strategic plans might place a further administrative burden on national governments.  Many agricultural stakeholders have criticised the idea as it could potentially lead to an undermining of the Single Market and compromise a level playing field for farmers.  Some fear the proposals amount to a renationalisation of agriculture and will increase bureaucracy and market distortions, resulting from differences in implementation across the European Union.  Affording member states too much flexibility has also been criticised by environmentalists.  As well as criticising the continuation of "perverse subsidies", environmentalists argue that flexibility with no real incentives to have ambitious targets could lead to declining environmental standards across the European Union.  The proposed "enhanced conditionality" clause in the new legislative proposals has been viewed as more greenwashing of the CAP, without sufficient accountability mechanisms to ensure adherence to environmental regulations.</p> <p>  It is important to stress that the proposals are in their very early stages.</p><p>As we saw with the previous CAP reform in 2013, nothing is likely to be passed until the EU budget is agreed.  There will be a new European Parliament and perhaps a new European Commissioner by the time the legislation enters into force, but as the proposal stands, there are several steps that could be taken to ensure a successful CAP.</p><p> There could be greater promotion of dialogue between environmentalist organisations and agricultural stakeholders.  At least since the 1992 reform of CAP, we have seen the struggle to merge agricultural production with environmental protection, which, unfortunately, sometimes leads to conflicting and contradictory interests.  Helping to promote common ground at EU and national levels could result in a more coherent policy.  The approval process for strategic plans needs to be transparent and as strong as possible, as this is essentially the only mechanism for ensuring that national priorities do not conflict with EU-wide objectives.  Maintaining the common aspect of the CAP is essential.  Furthermore, the proposals allow for only the Commission to approve strategic plans, but to improve accountability, that process could be based formally on widespread consultation and should involve input from the co-legislators and various stakeholders.  What happens if there is an impasse between national priorities and CAP objectives should be spelled out by the Commission.  As the Commission views the next CAP as a move towards evidence-based policy, which prioritises results over compliance, it is important the quality of data sources are to an appropriate standard and that national Governments have the technical capacity to construct and defend a strategic plan.  This might involve greater investment in technical assistance and upgrading of skills, which will be difficult if the current budget predictions are accurate.</p><p> The period for the next CAP is one of learning for the European Union as it experiments with this new delivery model.  It is important for all concerned that there is an awareness of the challenges facing the upcoming reform, which will be shaped by competing interests among stakeholders within a potentially reduced budget.  It is important to stress the crucial role of dialogue and consultation to ensure an efficient and coherent CAP.</p></speech>

I will present a joint perspective on behalf of myself and my colleague from Ulster University business school, Dr. Lynsey Hollywood.  We very much welcome the opportunity to discuss our perspective on the future and ongoing reform of the CAP.  It is entirely appropriate that such a collaborative and open approach is used because it is in this capacity as stakeholders that farmers and wider stakeholders have an important opinion in this area.</p> <p>  Our presentation will focus on four main priorities we believe that any ongoing CAP reform should include.  The first is to address the volatility or instability of our agricultural markets because we consider primary food production a special case.  The exceptionalism of food means that a political and social importance is attached to it, and it is entirely appropriate to give meaningful support to farmers in recognition of their contribution to this important primary production.  It is also important to consider the issue of cross-compliance, but without subsidising or supporting any lack of competitiveness or inefficiencies within agriculture.  It is also entirely appropriate that the support is directed towards farmers in less favourable farming areas.  Any income support or resilience payment should not be allowed to become a surrogate for income support, nor a means of indefinitely maintaining uneconomical farming units.  There should continue to be a focus on the full decoupling of primary production from income support, without any regression to coupling food production with any kind of payment.  This will allow any agrifood industry ultimately to become more responsive, which is an important future direction to be consumer orientated and market led.</p> <p>  The lack of collaboration in the farming community and, more widely, agrifood is an issue.  Government intervention could usefully foster greater collaboration, although that will need careful consideration through, for example, appropriate incentivisation.  A better understanding of market requirements would enable farmers to move from a production mentality to a more marketing mindset.  Any support could usefully be focused on support for know-how of marketing aspects.  Identifying that market need or niche in the market and how to differentiate one's product offering would help create diversification, support farmers in that mentality and allow us to look towards a strong, value-added market with strong export potential.  In the light of agricultural exceptionalism, some mechanism needs to be in place to ensure a secure, sustainable, healthy environment, and to prevent instability of the agricultural market, erratic food prices and market distortion.  It is important that any solution does not serve to increase food prices for the end consumer.</p> <p>  That brings me to the second priority, namely, food security, which covers the continuity of supply, health and food poverty.  The security of supply is especially important in the context of Europe and globally, given the increasing population and the need to feed more people and produce more food for more people.  The world's population is predicted to be 9 billion by 2050.  It would be appropriate for any ongoing and future reform of the CAP or agricultural framework to consider health, simply because of the relationship between food choice, nutrition and health.  These policies should usefully complement one another.  We need our industry to encourage production of food consistent with guidelines for healthy eating and for population nutrition.  That leaves us a space in food innovation to ensure we meet that market nee, although it cannot be at the expense of the twin objectives of productivity alongside environmental sustainability.  As for unnecessary costs being accrued to the consumer, paradoxically, those consumers who stand to benefit most from a healthy diet are those who can least afford it.  Consumers, therefore, must not be disadvantaged by a two-tier pricing policy or as a consequence of their reality.  They must be able to access, afford and avail of healthy food.</p> <p>  Our third priority is ensuring that food and farming are public goods, which we hinted at earlier in the context of environmental production.  We need to consider and continue the emphasis on the active management of land, which should be rewarded in a way that respects cross-compliance.  Farming is more than its principal purpose of primary production and, therefore, any payment schedule made to farmers must be conditional upon food safety, food quality, environmental and animal welfare, and occupational health and safety standards.  We need to consider the pivotal role that farming can play in preserving and enhancing the rural and natural environments, the importance of which we should not diminish.  Our farming counterparts are the custodians of our natural environment and it is important to respect the amenity value of the countryside.  Any future agricultural framework and policy should aim to preserve and enhance the amenity and recreational value of our land, and to reward landowners for conducting that public good on society's behalf.</p> <p>  Our final priority is the maintenance of the rural population and rural development.  Agriculture requires generational renewal of active farmers.  As we hinted at in the context of incentivisation, one might expect us, from a university perspective, to suggest that continuing professional development, short courses and educational attainment in this regard are also important.  Universities and the higher education sector have a role to play in providing access to increasing professional educational attainment in this area, and in allowing farmers to have that marketing mindset and the export potential to be exploited.  We welcome a multi-actor approach to science and innovation, involving support agencies and research institutions.</p> <p>  In conclusions, further reform of the CAP is to be welcomed.  We recommend that policy makers continue to pursue aggressively the decoupling of food production from payments to exploit that truly market-orientated, consumer-led approach and to allow for complementary agrifood and health policies in a way that is mutually supportive of people, the planet and profit.</p></speech>

I will comment on the sustainability of the Irish diet from the point of view of carbon footprint, its implications for policy, including policy from the point of view of the end user and the end of the food supply chain, and accounting for consumer food behaviour.  The contribution of food consumption towards climate change has received increasing attention in recent years, especially recently with the launch of the EAT-Lancet report.  In its present form, food consumption is responsible for as much as 30% of EU greenhouse gas emissions, GHGs.  Therefore, we need to look at food choices and food behaviour and see how we can alter them to influence health and the environment.</p> <p>  Are there any food choice behaviours that are sustainable as a diet and nutritionally acceptable?  Can the two areas meet?  The UN Food and Agriculture Organization defines sustainable diets as those "with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations.  Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy". </p> <p>The "economically fair" aspect of this is very important as the agriculture industry is the largest indigenous industry in Ireland.  GHGs associated with food production are measured in carbon equivalents to produce a carbon footprint for the food we consume.  In general, plant-based foods are low in GHG emissions, whereas foods from animal sources are higher, especially those from ruminant animals.  The European Commission has found that Ireland has one of the lowest carbon footprints of animal products in Europe because of the system we use to produce meat.  Foods from animal sources provide many essential nutrients necessary for good health and, therefore, are an important part of a healthy diet.  Certain nutrients can only be found in meat products and are not available in plant products.  Environmental and human health issues should be considered together to ensure socially and nutritionally optimal outcomes for both.</p> <p>  Research is ongoing in Teagasc, in conjunction with University College Cork, to examine the carbon footprint of the Irish diet and food consumption behaviours which result in a more or less sustainable and health diet.  The aim is to determine the quantity of GHG emissions associated with food consumption patterns in Irish adults and to determine what patterns of food consumption are associated with sustainability and health.  We use the best publicly available data to do the national adult nutrition survey funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine through its fair funding measure.  Each food consumed was converted into carbon equivalents and measured the carbon produced by consuming these foods, instead of looking at nutrients as is traditionally done.  It is no surprise that meat, in particular ruminant meat, made the highest contribution to carbon in the Irish diet as a result of the high conversion factor associated with meat and dairy, while plant sourced foods had the lowest CO2 in the diet.</p> <p>  It is important to eat a varied diet and not just one particular food group.  Consumers who followed a cultural pattern traditional to the Irish diet, with high meat, fruit and vegetable consumption, had the lowest CO2 footprint of all consumers, showing that meat plays a very important role in health and a sustainable diet.  We also found that food consumption and energy intake beyond our nutritional requirements contributed to the public health epidemic of obesity, as well as food waste.  Promoting a healthier diet and lifestyle, which reduces food consumption, also helps from an environmental perspective.  The findings from this research support the notion that any policy measures should be evidence based and should consider the prevailing cultural food consumption patterns of a population.  CAP reform, and any associated food policy instruments developed for sustainability reasons, should be holistic in nature and take other parameters such as health and nutrition into consideration, rather than concentrating on one food group.  It should reward more sustainable production and meet our consumer demands. </p></speech>

I welcome their engagement with younger citizens.  I am a second year European studies student in University College Cork.<br/><br/>As a young person growing up in rural Ireland, I have seen the importance of the agricultural industry and the difference the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, makes in Ireland.  One of the leading incentives behind Ireland&rsquo;s decision to apply for European Union membership was the opportunity of gaining support from the CAP.  When the CAP was introduced under the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the objectives were to improve and stabilise the incomes of those engaged in the farm sector, largely through market support mechanisms but with some activities oriented towards improving farming productivity and structural adjustments within the farm sector.  As the EU now discusses the future of the CAP post 2020, it is important to recall how beneficial this policy is and has been for Ireland.<br/><br/>One of the aspects of the CAP that has had the greatest impact on the lives of farmers across the EU has been the payment schemes.  Farmers are given money for maintaining their land and young farmers are given payments to encourage them to start farming.  They are given grants or loans to help start up and farmers can receive the green direct payments for reaching environment objectives.  The objective of the CAP is to give farmers and other agricultural workers a decent standard of living.  While the CAP is not always fairly divided among all recipients, it has still improved the income for thousands of farmers across Ireland and the EU.  The CAP&rsquo;s direct payment schemes help protect farmers from the uncertainty of the market.  At the moment, the CAP has a small farmers' scheme which is aimed at supporting smaller farmers in Europe.  However, this only operates in 15 EU countries and<i></i>Ireland is not among them.  This is unfortunate because if this policy was introduced in Ireland, it would aid many more in the agricultural industry.  Many Irish farmers are small farmers and the CAP currently does not have a big an impact on their lives.<br/><br/>The CAP encourages green, sustainable farming.  Part of the direct payment is given to farmers who strive for greener, more environment friendly agricultural production.  In theory, this should help Ireland improve its carbon footprint and reach its climate change objectives.  Farmers gain more by diversifying their crop and meeting environmental goals.  This is important for farmers as it gives them the opportunity to receive more from the CAP schemes while also encouraging them to be more environmentally conscious.  The CAP may be more known for its payments to farmers but it is also very focused on rural development and sustainability.  The CAP has helped many local, rural regions around Ireland.  Between 2007 and 2013, &euro;4.3 billion of funding was given to help agricultural production that would benefit rural areas.<br/><br/>The CAP also helps non-agricultural activities, such as small-scale manufacturing and food processing.  Such activities encourage businesses to set up in rural areas, focusing on the development of the local food sector.  This is important as it brings employment to rural regions and allows small, rural, agricultural communities to prosper and to use their large agricultural sector to develop compatible businesses.  When rural areas are developed, this development attracts more people to the area, offers more employment and can increase tourism.  The increase in employment is especially important as many farmers who operate small farms must get jobs outside the farm to supplement their household income.  This is made easier when the region around them is more developed, giving them a greater opportunity to find employment.  The development of these areas is vital to encourage people to stay and continue, or even start, farming in these rural areas.  The continuance of CAP ensures the development of Irish rural areas and gives further aid to the agricultural workers here.<br/><br/>The Agriculture and Fisheries Council will meet next week and I will follow its discussions about the future of the CAP post 2020 very closely.  At the most recent meeting in April, I was stuck by the emphasis by the Romanian Presidency on the environmental ambition of the CAP.  I agree that this is a major feature of CAP reform.  It will be advantageous not only to EU farmers but to every single EU citizen.  As a young citizen, I value sustainable development and want a green future for Ireland.  I know that Ministers have been discussing climate, biodiversity and water quality, to name just a few issues.  I hope to see a future in which we can enjoy sustainable food security and see an improvement in the environmental issues that exist today.</p></speech>

The CAP and CAP reform are a key part of our body of work at committee level and we have already made a number of submissions to Europe.</p><p>We attended several Council meetings around Europe, including in Croatia and Romania in recent months.  Members of the committee made a presentation at the European Parliament's agriculture committee approximately a year ago.  It is a priority matter for the committee and a significant issue for agriculture in Ireland, as all present are aware.  It is important that we keep engaging with this process.  Agriculture is our largest indigenous industry but it does not get its fair share of media coverage when it needs it.  It is great to have this opportunity to discuss the matter.  I am joined by some members of the committee and I would like to have engagement with them and the witnesses over the next ten or 15 minutes.  We will take a couple of questions together if that is acceptable to the witnesses.</p></speech>

Has research been conducted on what will happen in the advent of Brexit for the farmers in Northern Ireland in terms of their current income?  That question is for Mr. Bakker and Dr. Furey.  Does Dr. McCarthy know whether Teagasc has conducted research on our capacity to sustainably provide sufficient plant-based food for this country and some for export, in addition to a certain amount of meat production and land being used to plant forestry, in the case of increased demand for a plant-based diet?</p></speech>

Dr. Furey mentioned that we should move away from coupling and towards decoupling.  How can the vulnerable sectors be supported to ensure a sustainable future for them?  On suckler beef farmers, who are a key part of the industry in the west of Ireland, if that industry goes into decline, large parts of that region may be depopulated, which would have a significantly negative effect on rural Ireland.  How could the next CAP protect the vulnerable sectors of the agriculture industry?</p></speech>

We have a very busy schedule today and there is a significant amount of work relating to this meeting.  It is a momentous day and it is great to be able to record our participation in the European Union and celebrate Europe Day.</p> <p>  Agriculture accounts for a large part of our portfolio and work.  There has been a significant shift in recent years to larger dairy and crop farmers.  Similarly, larger dry stock farmers seem to be more prevalent.  The days of the part-time farmer who may have a second job and tend 40 acres or 50 acres may be numbered.  From the perspective of Dr. McCarthy and Teagasc, in ten or 15 years, will part-time farming be a thing of the past?  While canvassing for the local and European elections, as all politicians have been doing, I noted the number of unoccupied smaller farm holdings which are being subsumed by larger farmholders.  Does Dr. McCarthy anticipate a massive change in our model of farming?  That seems to have happened in recent years.</p></speech>

From which countries are these products coming?  The products at which I have looked are not produced in Ireland.  I am specifically referring to plant-based protein foods for human consumption.  Is there a desire or ability to grow them in Ireland?  I know there are issues around soya beans in that regard.  I understand that many types of beans come from the tropics and are more suited to such climates, which obviously means there is a carbon footprint involved in bringing them here.  In many parts of the tropics, people do not have enough food or their diet is not as good as it should be.  I direct my questions particularly at Dr. McCarthy.</p></speech>

Parliamentary questions to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine are being heard in the D&aacute;il and the spokespersons of the main parties are tied up there.  I offer their apologies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.921" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sin&eacute;ad McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019050900002#E00900"><p>I will roll two responses into one.  On the issue of from where plant-based foods are coming and whether there is a way to combine animal and plant-based production in Ireland, certain climates and agricultural environments lend themselves better to certain types of food production.  For example, producing meat and dairy in Ireland is very suited to our climate as we get a lot of rain and do not solely rely on the water supply for agriculture.  Many of our animals are grass fed for more than 300 days per year and when they are kept in during the winter months they are fed from silage.  Very little animal feed is given to them.</p> <p>  On beef production, meat and dairy very efficiently convert food such as grass that humans cannot consume to protein which they can.  If we were to change that production type to more plant-based production, it might not be as successful because the land that we currently use for producing meat and dairy is not necessarily suitable for plant production.  There is also an issue in terms of the amount of carbon that is kept as a sink in the ground or soil and which would be released if the land was ploughed to plant alternative food sources.</p> <p>  My answer to Deputy Corcoran-Kennedy's question is yes and no.  There is a possibility to produce both but we need to be careful regarding the land we choose to use differently.  It would not necessarily result in a lower carbon footprint.  Some research indicates that as a result of the higher inputs of fertiliser and so on that are required to produce plant-based crops, there may be, at best, a 10% to 12% reduction in carbon footprint.  It is not a direct swap of one for the other as there are other challenges in changing farming practices and the resultant dietary CO2.</p> <p>  Many plant-based proteins such as beans and legumes are imported and have many associated food miles.  It is not always possible to recommend a plant-based diet to certain vulnerable groups in the community.  For example, older adults naturally consume less food but need a higher protein intake.  The best source of protein for older consumers to maintain muscle mass and prevent falls and frailty is animal protein.  They would need to eat four to five times the amount of lentils or beans to get the same amount of protein and it would not be possible for them to eat that much food.  There is a role for both plant and animal protein in diet and it is about getting the balance right in terms of achieving concordant measures of health and sustainability.  One must not focus solely on the carbon footprint of the diet without taking account of the nutrition and health outcomes.</p></speech>

Ulster University is not actively involved in farming research but we are most certainly involved in more general research on food poverty and food insecurity.  If it satisfies members, I will speak more generally on that point.  It is anticipated that Brexit will create an additional cost of &pound;25 per week on the average household's food bill.  For citizens who are already squeezed, impoverished or vulnerable, this will create an additional burden and we are worried about that.  Ulster University is very active in the food poverty research agenda.  We are developing an at-risk of food poverty index that will consider low income and rurality in identifying where such consumers are located to enable more targeted interventions.</p> <p>  More specifically, there area also concerns regarding rural dwellers and agricultural smallholders.  Given that the average age of smallholders in Northern Ireland and Great Britain is approximately 60 years, we are concerned about generational renewal and the need for young farmers.  It was for this reason that we addressed the point of diversification and the need to add value.  We will be actively involved in the food innovation effort to try to complement agriculture, food availability and health.  We need to be concerned about the departure of farmers from farming because it has become unprofitable.</p> <p>  There is an opportunity to educate and engage with consumers on the more general point of the importance of eating locally and seasonally so that we can celebrate our local and indigenous foods.  We must showcase indigenous produce so that we are not reliant on alternative protein sources from other countries.</p> <p>  We are working with policymakers in Northern Ireland in a collaborative effort on agrifood and food policy generally.  Brexit has caused concerns about food affordability and availability and the possibility that access to a fresh and varied diet may become more problematic for Northern Ireland consumers.</p></speech>

The raw materials may move from the North to the South to be processed, return to the North to be packaged and, finally, be sold in the South.  It is great that the common travel area is secure but much more could be done in terms of regulatory alignment between the market in the North and the South to minimise disruption to goods moving across the Border.  If the Assembly in the North gets up and running, the North-South Ministerial Council would be a good forum to promote more alignment on agrifood and minimise disruption.</p></speech>

As members will probably expect me to say, I believe a joint collaborative effort by university and other research and educational institutions could be useful in providing such an incentivisation.  This would not necessarily have to be economic.  One way forward could be to subsidise educational attainment efforts or repurpose farmers, as it were, to enable them to move into more diverse food processing areas.</p></speech>

When one considers the food supply chain from a carbon footprint perspective, between 80% and 85% of the carbon footprint is generated before the food leaves the farmyard.  It is very important that we put measures in place from a sustainability perspective to reduce the carbon footprint of food as it is being produced and support smaller farmers to produce food more sustainably.  Farming should not be only large-scale and intensive.  CAP could address this by implementing more sustainable practices at farm level.  A great deal of research has been done in Europe.  I am involved in a circular agricultural economics research project in the European Union, which has 20 partners across Europe.  We are looking at more sustainable farming practices and how acceptable they would be to consumers at the end of the food chain.  We need to develop a more circular economy and maintain better sustainability at farm level.  This would help to maintain smaller farms and keep European farmers in the farming industry.</p></speech>

When I was asked to speak about the European common security and defence policy on the occasion of Europe Day the first topic to come to mind was the role of Irish neutrality.  The debate is probably as old as the country itself but has surely not lost its intensity since then.  I finally decided to address the issue because recent developments in the area of European common and security policy make neutrality very topical again.  I draw attention to a couple of developments that place neutrality back on the agenda and demand urgent discussion of its meaning and implications.</p> <p>  The first of these is Brexit.</p><p>The loss of the major Atlanticist power within the European Union has serious consequences for the further development of the European Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP.  Having always tried to prevent or at least slow down integration in this policy field, the United Kingdom has been a kind of natural ally to Ireland in trying to keep security issues out of European integration.  The consequences of this development are already visible.  Not long after the Brexit vote, the President of the EU Commission, the French President and later the German Chancellor were calling for the creation of an EU army.  Although for the time being this is not much more than a blurry vision, it became obvious where integration in the European Common Security and Defence Policy field is heading.<br/><br/>Already in 2018 permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, was launched, marking a huge step in integrating security and defence co-operation towards a military alliance.  Causing a lively discussion in Ireland, its participation was finally backed by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, denying a conflict between Irish neutrality and participation in PESCO.  Of all the other neutral member states of the EU only Malta opted out, choosing to first observe if PESCO and neutrality are compatible.  Especially in Finland and Sweden, former neutral states, a consensus has been reached to the effect that EU membership in general is not logically compatible with the traditional notion of neutrality.  In practice these EU member states have thus given up their neutrality to a large extent.  In Ireland, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a Bill to enshrine Irish neutrality in the Constitution.  After a lively debate, in which European politicians were even called warmongers, the Bill was eventually rejected in the D&aacute;il.<br/><br/>Finally, I draw members' attention to a poll by Red C for the European Movement Ireland, published just last week.  Apart from an overwhelming support for EU membership in general, the poll revealed that a majority of 58% of the Irish people think that Ireland should be part of intensified EU security and defence co-operation and that PESCO does not pose a threat to Irish neutrality.  Approval is even stronger amongst young Irish people.<br/><br/>For me as a German citizen, the whole discussion about neutrality is new.  Despite the <i>tabula rasa </i>after the Second World War, Germany did not have the chance to have its own discussion about this, having to align itself to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, in the face of an expansionist Soviet Union.  While living in Ireland for one year and studying at University College Dublin it is very interesting to follow the public debate about neutrality and discuss it with my Irish and non-Irish fellow students.  This brings insights into this very politicised topic and the fact that Irish neutrality is loaded with different meanings and historical resonances.  Various narratives are contesting the nature of Irish foreign and security policy and its expression in Europe's contemporary security architecture.  While there seems to be a broad consensus that Ireland can and should make a contribution to global peace and security, this is not the case for the question as to which institutional framework should be used to achieve this.<br/><br/>Due to the aforementioned recent developments, however, Ireland seems to be forced to take a decision.  The departure of the major damper of integration in the area of foreign and security policy and the concomitant developments, such as PESCO and discussions of an EU army, make it an urgent topic.  For Ireland's European partners, and therefore also for me in this case, it is essential to know where Ireland is coming from in order to fully understand the significance and the implications of neutrality for Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.941" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cornelia-Adriana Baciu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019050900002#G00200"><p>My name is Ms Cornelia-Adriana Baciu.  I am studying at the School of Law and Government at Dublin City University.  Today I will address four key challenges facing the Common Security and Defence Policy.  The first is related to strategic coherence and internal cohesion.  In the counterfactual scenario in which the EU is not able to manage internal cracks such as the rise of nationalism, so-called <i>souvereignism</i>or major differences in member states' strategic cultures, future risks and challenges to CSDP might be endogenous.  A failure to co-ordinate efforts on the CSDP might draw Europe back to the US.  Some researchers argue it might return the European security landscape to the 1950s.  The EU will thus need to find innovative ways to solve the crises of sovereignty of borders and of defence.  What Europe wants is not easy to operationalise because of increasing polarisation or even fragmentation of European integration.<br/><br/>The CSDP is a domain in which some argue differentiated integration might work better.  This is because states' national strategies are driven by different threat perceptions, strategic environments, capabilities and strategic interests.  My research suggests that differentiated integration in the form of a role-player model in the CSDP could enhance strategic knowledge production and capability development.  Security and defence collaborative regimes such as the CSDP can have an empowering effect on member states.  However, an unintended consequence of the role-player model could be a &quot;Europe <i>&agrave; la carte</i>&quot; in which members would only support the policies in which they see a benefit for their own national interests.<br/><br/>I will now refer to Brexit.  The anticipated withdrawal of the UK from the European Union is forecasted to strain the CSDP budget.  In 2018 the UK accounted for approximately 16% of the CSDP budget.  To compensate for this an increase in member states' investments in security and defence can be expected.  A series of peace and defence co-operation mechanisms were adopted after Brexit.  The major examples are PESCO, the European Defence Fund, EDF, the co-ordinated annual review on defence, CARD, the European peace facility and the European intervention initiative.  For the new instruments to be effective it is important for the EU to manage member states' expectations and ensure they will enable the achievement of strategic objectives.<br/><br/>I will now address the external strategic environment and external sources of instability.  A particular tendency in US leadership and what some have termed a US strategy underpinned by a logic of &quot;retreat&quot; and &quot;systemic competition&quot; with China have pushed the EU to think more seriously about the scenario of US abandonment.  Some researchers argue that strategic autonomy would allow the EU to gain an element of independence from US decision-making and pursue an agenda of international peace and security based on its own normative vision with mediation, diplomacy, trade co-operation, peace missions and global justice at its core.  Some argue that the road to strategic autonomy might lie in a merger between the CSDP and NATO, that is, the Europeanisation of NATO.  Multipolarity and great power competition represent another challenge with implications for the CSDP.  In the future, the EU is expected to aim at having good relationships with all countries and avoid a return to bipolarity.  This is because a bipolar logic might push countries to choose and some of them might choose China for economic reasons.<br/><br/>My last point is related to new security technologies.  Future and emerging technologies such as autonomous robotics and artificial intelligence can have a disruptive and transformative impact in the security and defence domain.  If the EU invests sufficiently in research and development, it might be in a position to harness the benefits of new security technologies.  New funding of transnational and interdisciplinary research, under the European Defence Fund <i>inter alia </i>, will have the potential to address capability shortcomings and technological and industrial weaknesses to a certain extent.  The EU could establish a new area of competence in dual-use technology, that is, technologies which can be attributed to both civilian and military purposes.</p></speech>

On this day it is particularly important to recall why the EU was initially established; to end frequent and bloody wars between neighbours and to unite European countries both economically and politically to secure lasting peace across the Continent.  We can largely say that this has been successful.  At the moment, however, huge challenges are ahead for the EU in the area of common security and defence.  As is true for most of the challenges the EU faces, Brexit crops up in this area.  The greatest challenge is the development of a common policy on security and defence that includes a cohesive development of policies with third countries in future missions, especially the UK once it leaves.  This policy must simultaneously protect the integrity of the European Union and the sovereignty of member states.  It is very important that there is a balance between these three concerns.  The greatest challenge lies in finding this balance.</p> <p>  Different visions of the CSDP proposed by the initial "big three" member states, Germany, the UK and France, have long created space for smaller member states like Ireland to avoid hard choices concerning issues of security and defence.  A more cohesive EU in the post-Brexit future presents significant challenges for all states that have long thrived in the murky waters of strategic ambiguity.</p><p>Indeed, it could be argued that the United Kingdom leaving removes a significant stumbling block for European defence co-operation.  British scepticism has previously allowed others such as Denmark and central European states to avoid hard questions on tensions between formal military non-alignment and the realities of being part of a deeply integrated organisation because NATO has long provided what they have seen to be the primary security provider in the European theatre. </p><p> The UK&rsquo;s absence from future Common Security and Defence Policy debates after Brexit will likely push these states into the limelight in terms of blocking or opting out from security co-operation.  Our greatest challenge is how we deal with this.  While the EU must grapple with the loss of its transatlantic alliance partner, it is imperative that it now attempts to balance a bilateral agreement on Common Security and Defence Policy with the UK that also complements a type of unified EU approach to issues of security and defence, encompassing the considerations of small states, such as Ireland, and big states such as France and Germany.</p><p> That is not to say that the EU has not taken any steps thus far.  If we look at the decision taken by the High Representative, Ms Mogherini, to forge ahead with the publication of the EU&rsquo;s new global strategy in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum in June 2016, it is apparent that some attempts have been made by the EU to push ahead with CSDP.  Although faced with something of an existential crisis, the EU found a response in building a security architecture to reinvigorate EU institutions and to reunite the remaining 27 member states.  This provided a common ground for co-operation without reopening a Pandora&rsquo;s box of institutional reform that would be required to deal with more traditional areas of European co-operation such as market regulation.  </p><p> The Common Security and Defence Policy may not have always been high on Ireland&rsquo;s agenda but the aftermath of the Brexit vote has been particularly challenging for us all.  We now must strongly reconsider our own security and defence policy, in addition to that of our position in the wider EU CSDP.  Brexit has uncovered a number of political and constitutional fault lines, none more serious than its potential impacts on the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government deserves credit for the way in which it has managed the Brexit negotiations to date, particularly in securing support from our European partners concerning Ireland&rsquo;s position on the Border.  However, what price will we pay for this in future negotiations on matters such as common security and defence?  </p><p> The reduced room for manoeuvre on common security and defence for small states, such as ourselves, in an EU that will be more dominated by France and Germany than before, must be taken into account.  In a Franco-German EU, the space for constructive ambiguity is likely to be greatly reduced.  Ireland&rsquo;s hesitancy and ambivalence on this matter may no longer be sustainable.  Irish attitudes to European security and defence might best be characterised by paraphrasing Winston Churchill, in that Ireland is with common security and defence policy, but not of it.  We are linked, but not compromised.  We are interested and associated, but not absorbed.  It is perhaps time that we do become absorbed in greater co-operation with the EU on issues of common security and defence that extend beyond PESCO, as others here have noted, as we lose the shelter of the UK in future debates.  </p><p> The threats of a no-deal Brexit and the medium to longer-term security threats posed by any kind of withdrawal have yet to be provided for.  Both the Irish State and the EU as a whole faces profound challenges in this regard and are there, as of yet, no signs that neither it nor the EU is prepared to address them. </p></speech>

I compliment all the witnesses who I have heard so far this morning on the quality and depth of their submissions and the knowledge and research that went into them.  They are all to be complimented on the even-handed and balanced way in which  they went about their business.</p><p>I raise a question about the Common Security and Defence Policy.  It is an issue which has been with us for a very long time.  Over time, different emphases occur.  It is important to note that we are a neutral country.  There is nothing incompatible between our neutrality and our membership of the European Union or certain associations in the peacekeeping and defence areas.  In the past, we have excelled in peacekeeping and have shown ourselves to be international leaders in that area.  We have a useful influence and role to play in the European context.  I note modern terrorism has no boundaries and can reach far into neutral countries, peacekeeping countries and so on.  Do the witnesses see a space in which Ireland might be expected to defend itself in such a situation?</p><p>I refer to the question of whether something in this area will be attached to the discussion on Brexit and if a <i>quid pro quo </i>be sought.  I do not think that will be the case.  We are very strong members of the European Union with a strong commitment to its ideals which have existed from the beginning and get stronger over time.  It is not likely that we would be expected to concede one for another in this context.  I think that because the European Union must prevail.  If it does not and it fragments, going in different directions, and if demands are made within itself, of itself, by itself or by single member states, then there is a grave danger that the European Union will cease to be.  If that happens there will be great political, military and economic implications for the entire Continent of Europe and outside.  I do not need to tell our witnesses this; they are experts on this area, but the question arises as to whether we want to go back to where we were.  Some member states refer to the good old days, which presumably was the first half of the 20th century.  My question to young people is whether they want to go back to those much referred to good old days, when almost 70 million people died in the conflict which followed when Europe turned upon itself.  All these things relate to military matters and peace.  We should remember that the EU was the single most important peace agreement that the world has ever known.  For all those years we have been peaceful.  There can come times of turbulence occasionally and in times of economic difficulty, someone is always sought to blame.  I encourage our guests to focus on the alternatives, because they are not good, and they can proceed to work in an equitable manner, to be fair to all people including refugees from outside.  As we know, some of the people of Europe were themselves refugees in the not too-distant past.</p></speech>

This is very timely.  There are debates at the moment relating to plans for an EU army.  It is clear from this morning's contributions that despite the denials from some on the political right that an advanced conversation on this is taking place.  The contributions here have been challenging.  While I acknowledge the poll undertaken by the European Movement, which would be very much in favour of changing our policy, we should recall that a Red C poll last year also showed tremendous support in Ireland for Irish neutrality.  I ask if Irish people would really support what PESCO is doing off the coast of Libya, for example, if they knew.</p><p>If they followed the reports of Sally Hayden, the Irish journalist, she has highlighted EU support, including Irish financial support, for funding death camps in Libya.  That funding was confirmed to me by the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, just a few weeks ago in the Seanad.  These are camps in which people are tortured, raped, mutilated and killed.  This is the reality of PESCO as it operates right now.  One does not have to take my word for it.  Sally Hayden has documented and continues to document it in an effort to bring attention to the realities, unfortunately, of what PESCO is doing.  Do we think the Irish people would support funding of &euro;13 billion in research subsidies for the defence industries of Europe as set out in the next financial plan for Europe?  That is a reality of PESCO.  The final question I ask is as follows.  Surely, the best people to decide our future neutrality are the people of Ireland.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in was right to pursue the Bill.  As democrats, the best way forward in this debate is to support that call for a referendum.  Let us have a full debate on the future of Irish neutrality.  I thank the witnesses for their thoughtful contributions today.</p></speech>

I am delighted to welcome the witnesses and thank them for their contributions.  We are at an important crossroads in Europe.  Certainly, I have concerns about some activities taking place under the flag of and with the financial support of the European Union.  We need to be more awake, engaged and vocal and to scrutinise more deeply legislation that comes before us on PESCO and other situations.  Europe as a project must be preserved.  We must work at that and learn from it.  A recent report I intend to raise on Leaders' Questions today is on the future of farming in Europe.  It states that 1,000 farmers and farm families are leaving farming every week right across the EU.  That is leading to the degeneration, neglect and slippage of rural Ireland at a time when we are talking about rolling broadband out to rural areas.  If we do not maintain sustainable farm families in rural Ireland, North and South, and across Europe, it will lead to more factory farms and large conglomerates buying up land, which is not good.  In my own county of Tipperary, we have an equine company purchasing every square perch of land that becomes available.  It has amassed almost 28,000 acres.  While it provides employment and has great prowess in the equine industry, it is disgraceful that we do not have a land commission or other land agency to monitor and curtail what is happening.  The family farm is the lifeblood of Ireland.  In the two previous recessions to the one we have just come out of, it was agriculture that led us back to growth with, I might add, the support of the EU.  People were always there on family farms and working the land in parishes and communities nationally.  Every euro that goes into agriculture is spent locally.  Farm families support schools, sports clubs, the tourism industry and everything else.  It is therefore timely to have this discussion.  I thank our visitors for attending today.  It is my first time speaking in this new Chamber.  I am delighted.  It is an honour to be here.</p></speech>

The situation around security events is not a stark one.  It is more the case that there are real choices and priorities to address.  It is true that Europe came out of a project of peace.  The wonderful thing about Europe was that after literally thousands of years of conflict, countries which had experienced in some cases hundreds of years of war against each other decided to come together to determine how to live together more peacefully and constructively.  That is absolutely true.  However, while there is an incredible legacy of peace in the European project, being European and being part of the European project means thinking about that constant question of how we live together.  It is about being critically present and asking critical questions, as the witnesses have.  That is part of being pro-European.  It is about caring enough about Europe to care about the decisions it makes.</p> <p>  There are very important decisions being made and there are priorities and concerns.  It was a decision for Ireland to opt into PESCO.  Ireland was not required to opt in, rather it chose to do so.  PESCO moved us further away by involving us, for example, in joint purchases of military equipment.  Ireland has an incredibly strong tradition of peace and neutrality and of leading disarmament.  One of the most moving things I have ever been involved with was the global ban on cluster bombs, which are basically like landmines.  The global ban was negotiated here in Ireland because Ireland was free from some of the military-industrial pressures experienced by other countries and was able to lead the way.  It is not a choice between Ireland and our neutrality and Europe.  It is about Ireland being a voice for peace, neutrality and disarmament within Europe.  That is a key point.  It is a service we provide.  It was Eamon Gilmore, a former Irish parliamentarian, who represented the European Commission in Colombia to negotiate the peace deal.  That is because Ireland's neutrality allowed us to have that strong voice.</p> <p>  We cannot turn a blind eye to militarisation.  It is a disservice to Ireland and Europe if we do.  It was very concerning that, just two weeks ago, the European Parliament voted against having oversight of the &euro;13 billion European Defence Fund.  That is the European Parliament choosing not to scrutinise what that fund is spent on.  Will it be on autonomous weapons?  How does it relate to UN mandates?  We must question constantly.  When we have global challenges for Europe and the world like climate change, which we will discuss later, we must ask whether we should be spending &euro;13 billion on European defence.  I do not think so.  Peace and security are put together.  Peace is work.  We know that from the Good Friday Agreement.  The work of peace is about investment in community building, understanding and social exchange.  If we spent some of that &euro;13 billion to build understanding between communities, not just here in Ireland but across the Balkan states which have come out of an experience of war as recently as the 1990s, that would deliver far more than to ramp up military spending on our borders and invest huge amounts in Frontex.  As was mentioned, it is a real concern to see these immigration control deals whereby we are funding border police and military actions in places like Sudan and Libya.  Those are things we need to look to.  These are very important choices.</p> <p>  It is important to note that the current Commission is an outgoing one.  We will have a new European Commission soon and it needs to hear from the witnesses about their priorities.  Among the priorities the outgoing Juncker Commission has brought to today's European Council meeting on the future of Europe, what it calls "protective Europe" is number one.  That means a European defence union.  We must be very clear that there are high-level people in Europe who want a European army.  However, that is not the same thing as saying Europe wants a European army.  There are also brilliant parliamentarians and passionate Europeans from every member state of the EU 27 who want to work together on peace.  That is the narrative we can push and strengthen.  I would love to hear in response what the witnesses think the work of peace should be.  It is not just about saying we do not want militarisation.  What is the work of peace?  That is the work from Good Friday and the work we have seen across the world.  How does Ireland lead the work of peace within Europe to make Europe a champion on human rights and peace?  It is a real choice.  We cannot do that while also spending &euro;13 billion on a European Defence Fund which we do not scrutinise.  We must all challenge these issues because we want Europe to live up to its brilliant and historic past and to shape a better future.  The following point is very important.  In the initial PESCO agreement, the words "peace" and "peacekeeping" were not even used once.  We need something that is not the PESCO agreement but which is rather a European mandate on peace work.  That should be the centrepiece of Europe's next five-year strategy.  I would love to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that work of peace.</p></speech>

I now invite the witnesses to respond to members' questions.  While I do not wish to cut anybody short I ask the witnesses to be conscious that we are running out of time for this particular session.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.951" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cornelia-Adriana Baciu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019050900002#K00200"><p>I will try to address the many interesting questions posed.  On defending ourselves, territorial defence is mandated to NATO.  One of the issues on the agenda for discussion is to what extent EU member states should start thinking more seriously about gaining an element of strategic autonomy and independence from US decision-making.  Territorial defence, leadership and nuclear weapons are some of the points linked with this debate, but many states have been silent on this particular aspect.  There is also the scenario of the US abandonment, which I addressed in my opening statement.  The United States has withdrawn from several multilateral or bilateral agreements.  The US foreign policy narrative might in the future be linked with developments in the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea.  In the case of US inability to provide security guarantees in Europe, the EU should have a plan B and give serious consideration to the territorial defence aspect.</p> <p>  From a rational choice perspective, into the future, the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, for member states will be, probably, a trade-off between utility and strategic choice.  It is important to emphasise that security is a prerequisite and will remain a prerequisite for the other benefits of EU membership, including economic and political benefits.  It is a precondition of other benefits as well.  The major challenges to CSDP in the future will probably be linked to member states' commitment and the robustness of CSDP institutions.  I mentioned the new strategic instruments that are likely to generate new assets and perhaps increase the value of defence co-operation in Europe.</p> <p>  In regard to Irish neutrality, last year I wrote an article on security, multilateralism and Irish neutrality based on debates in the Irish Parliament from 1998 to 2018, which is available online.  One of my key findings was that the concept of Irish neutrality is multifaceted.  I found different concepts associated with it, including positive neutrality, negative neutrality, total neutrality and so on.  Every time there is a debate in Brussels related to security implications, there are intensive debates in the Irish Parliament on the implications for Irish neutrality.  There is informed decision-making on a case-by-case basis.  Surprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, Irish neutrality was found to be strongly linked with UN peacekeeping and stabilisation missions.  From this we could infer that there is a compatibility between the Irish foreign policy and EU foreign policy narrative.  The EU global strategy has been focused on peace and stabilisation missions in fragile states.  Recent statistics show an increase in the support of Irish people for the CSDP.  One explanation for this might be that the Common Security and Defence Policy works at intergovernmental level and it is likely to remain so into the future.  Security might be an area in which intergovernmental co-operation is more effective.  Sovereignty is not transferred at supranational level.  Any change in this regard will require a change in the EU treaty.</p> <p>  On the value added of PESCO, for Ireland the value added is that the capabilities developed under PESCO remain in the possession of member states.  For Ireland this means that capabilities developed under PESCO can be utilised in UN peacekeeping missions and other missions.  As far as I am aware, Ireland has been active in providing personnel and staff to EU and international civilian and military missions since it joined the European Union in 1973.  As of December 2018, there were approximately 650 Irish personnel deployed to such missions.</p> <p>  On Brexit, much of my research recently has been focused on the implications of Brexit.  I recently co-authored a book with my supervisor, Professor John Doyle from DCU, on this subject.  Brexit will transform relationships between the UK and the EU from multilateral to bilateral.  This will have implications for the European Union evolutionary stable equilibrium.  The EU will need to find a way to address this equilibrium to remain stable over time and to be able to cope with so-called atypical sequences or shocks, of which Brexit could be one.  The literature argues that continual change is the prerequisite to remain relevant and competitive.  The implication or consequence of this would be geopolitical adaptation of the EU.  This will have further implications for future transatlantic relations, the EU global strategy and international security as a collective good.</p> <p>  It was mentioned earlier that peace is work.  Modern peace is based on anticipation, resilience and integration of aspects of daily life.  One could imagine modern peace at the intersection of three epistemological debates, international - liberal values; national - nationalist sometimes as a destructive force; and, everyday life level - daily interactions and power relations between people.  We have to see all three sides as knowledge production sides.  Knowledge is very important for concepts such as peace, order, justice, security and so on.  This is, perhaps, a matter we should further address in our research.</p></speech>

Cultural values were disregarded.  Questions were posed in regard to neutrality, PESCO and peace.</p><p>If we look at the culture of all European states, it comprises the cultures of 28 different states, soon to be 27.  These have very different cultural values.  After 70 years of this project, it is time to introduce new ways of looking at things.  It is not always driven by politics and economics, although we are in a political chamber.  It is very important that we look towards cultures.  I am sure most Irish people would not be impressed to hear that we are supporting PESCO.  Claims were made that money we pay into the European budget for defence goes to camps in Libya and so on.  That is not what we anticipated our tax money would be used for.  There are also cultures within Europe that really promote a strong, hard-line defence policy, which we do not.  We are more focused on peacekeeping and neutrality.  There needs to be a balance in how we look at cultures and cultural values.  Only in that way can we address all of the issues that have been brought up.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be here this morning to chair what is a very important session.  I thank all the witnesses for coming before us for what has been a very informative engagement.  I am Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.  This committee was set up to consider the Citizens' Assembly report.  We published a cross-party report on 16 April, which I believe is the beginning of a new era for policy direction with regard to how the State deals with climate change.  As the witnesses will know, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is working on an all-of-Government action plan with regard to rolling out these policy changes, which will be critical for this and future generations.  I will not delay because I know the clock is ticking and my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, is waiting to step in to chair the next session.</p> <p>  Our first speaker is Mr. P&aacute;draig Flattery from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.

I am a PhD student in the ICARUS climate research unit at the Maynooth University department of geography.  My work is a drop in the ocean of climate change research being undertaken around the world every day, all of which bolsters the consensus that climate change is happening, that it is urgent, and that human activities are responsible.<br/><br/>I have been asked to speak today on the topic of climate action and sustainable development.  When I first read the title of this topic, I immediately thought of speeches made by the young Swedish climate activist, Greta Thunberg, who has helped mobilise a generation against the actions of their governments by holding weekly school strikes.  At her recent speeches to the World Economic Forum and the United Nations she told the delegates, &quot;I want you to panic&quot;.  In the brief time I have I will try to explain the scientific basis behind why she wants people to panic, and how climate action and sustainable development must be embraced to create a sustainable future for the next generations.<br/><br/>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, states that we must keep global warming to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change.  Warming of more than 1.5&deg;C increases the likelihood of climate tipping points being triggered.  These tipping points are thresholds that, if exceeded, can fundamentally alter the state of the climate system.  To provide members with an example, one possible consequence of warming above 1.5&deg;C is the thawing of permafrost in the Arctic, a process which is already under way and which releases vast amounts of methane, which is more than 25 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2</sub>, which will result in significant irreversible warming and is likely to trigger the collapse of other systems, including the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.  This ice sheet is already melting more and more each year.  If temperatures increase and the ice sheet reaches a point where it will melt entirely, we will be committed as a planet to a sea level rise of 6 m.  If we allow this to happen, there will be unimaginable global consequences which pose a genuine existential threat to humanity.<br/><br/>When people hear climate scientists speaking about these changes in the Arctic and Greenland, they wonder how it relates to us here in Ireland, but these sea level changes will be felt on a local as well as a global scale and our coastal cities will be threatened.  If we do not take action to prevent this happening, it will not matter which country did not meet its targets or which national interest was prioritised.  We have already warmed by around 1&deg;C, and will reach 1.5&deg;C warming somewhere between 2030 and 2052, meaning we have a decade to make radical changes to our economy and way of life.<br/><br/>The reality is clear.  As members of the EU we are committed to reducing our emissions by 40% compared with 1990 levels by the year 2030, just 11 years from now.  The EU has set the goal of an 80% to 95% reduction in emissions by 2050.  Current Irish policies are not aligned with our goals.  While the EU as a whole will achieve its 2020 emissions target, Ireland will significantly overshoot ours.  This sets us up to fail at achieving our future targets, and the longer we wait, the more difficult it becomes.  We need to encourage sustainable development and ensure all members of society can reduce their carbon footprints by decarbonising public transportation, energy generation and agriculture to give everyone the opportunity to make the right choices regarding their emissions.  While grants for new electric cars are encouraging, how many people can realistically avail of them? The importance of a holistic approach to adaptation is emphasised by a 2018 statement from the IPCC:</p> <blockquote> 	If poorly designed or implemented, adaptation projects in a range of sectors can increase greenhouse gas emissions and water use, increase gender and social inequality, undermine health conditions, and encroach on natural ecosystems [...] These trade-offs can be reduced by adaptations that include attention to poverty and sustainable development  </blockquote> <p>The joint committee&rsquo;s report on climate change and cross-party action echoes this sentiment in its call for a just transition to a green economy. <br/><br/>We need to safeguard the lives of all our future citizens.  We are the first generation to feel the effects of climate change and the last generation who will be able to do anything about it.  Individuals can and do take action, but the onus is on politicians to find solutions, create dialogue, and work towards our common goal of creating a better world for us all.  Sustainable development is not only possible, it is essential if Ireland is to maintain our green reputation on the world stage.  As shown by the committee&rsquo;s recent report, the transition to a green economy is an opportunity for economic growth and job creation in rural and urban Ireland, and ought to be embraced for the benefits it will bring.  The recommendations of the report are far-reaching and inspiring and must be implemented urgently.  They range from citizen-scale efforts to retrofit homes to renewable energy generation to a national push for offshore wind generation and decarbonisation of our economy.<br/><br/>As a direct result of protests by the Extinction Rebellion group, the UK declared a national climate change emergency just last week.  This was closely followed by Wicklow County Council which announced a climate and biodiversity emergency last week.  This shows us that there is hope, but time is running out.</p></speech>

I know members will fully understand my French accent, so it will not disturb them too much.  Climate change is urging us to take actions and to change our way of life radically.  Such actions and policies will require unprecedented levels of collaborative decision-making between all actors in society, including the public.  Yet, voices of local communities are still, in 2019, facing brick walls.  As European citizens, we need to be given the opportunity to participate actively and to have a real input on decisions that have effects on our daily life.</p> <p>  We know the positive effects that public participation can have.  We know, for instance, that local communities can substantially enhance the quality of decisions with locally grounded and value-based knowledge.  We should not see decisions tailored to reduce our vulnerability to climate change as purely technical.  This is not to say that experts should not contribute - their role is crucial - but common technical approaches to decision-making, such as cost-benefit analyses, cannot be the sole remedy to our problems.  Often, the real value of assets and landscapes can hardly be monetised and summarised into graphics, as they will have a deeper value and a deeper meaning to local communities.  Moreover, we should not forget that local communities are situated at the forefront of climate change, being the first to experience damage from storms, flooding, erosion or biodiversity losses.  Why should they then be kept silent?  Public participation is, after all, a democratic right.</p> <p>  The problem is that today's conventional forms of public participation do not work.  First, uploading a document on a website and then asking people to submit comments or suggestions does not guarantee that these submissions will have any effect on the decision.</p><p>Second, and most important, these forms of engagement do not resonate with most people.  Do Members of the Oireachtas believe that people of my age regularly check the websites of their local authorities?  This is the core of the problem.  There is a gap between our decision makers and the public.  This criticism demands that new mediums of participation need to be established in Ireland.  The Citizens' Assembly is a fantastic example that we can build on, but it cannot be limited to that.  Most decisions that affect our everyday lives take place in our communities at a local level.  Should every local authority have its owns citizens' assembly?  Why not?  There are countless examples of successful forms of active participation.  Citizen panels, citizen juries, citizen advisory committees, participatory budgeting, participatory planning, participatory mapping, e-participation and citizen science are forms of active public participation that have proven to be successful around the world.  Why should we limit those examples as isolated case studies rather than trying to make them the common practice?<br/><br/>The ball is in the court of those who represent us.  As we saw recently with the school strikes for climate, many people, especially those from the younger generation, are willing to engage in climate actions.  Strong and ambitious policies need to be implemented at national level to create nationwide structures for public participation and incite local decision makers to abandon the <i>status quo</i>and find innovative ways of engaging directly with their constituents.  Climate change represents one of the greatest challenges of our century.  We desperately need to reduce our carbon emissions and adapt to present and forthcoming impacts of climate change.  Decisions aiming at driving these societal changes cannot take place behind closed doors.  We need to seize climate change as an opportunity to change profoundly the way our democracy works in Ireland and in Europe.</p></speech>

This is why I have dedicated the last four years of my life to researching how we can develop effective and successful policies to deal with our climate and sustainable development challenges.  My presentation is based on cutting-edge research within political science as well as dozens of research interviews I have conducted in Germany in an attempt to understand the factors that have helped to underpin the success of Germany's historic energy transition.  I am looking at the factors that help to create policy that is politically and socially acceptable.  This is really the Holy Grail.  I hope to demonstrate how we can make stringent policy without facing electoral penalties.</p> <p>  I will mention a few insights and factors that have the potential to help us in our work.  The first of them underpins what has been said about the importance of citizen-centred energy and green industrial supports.  The key causal mechanism here is something called coalition building, which is essentially about the development of policy that seeks specifically to build coalitions of support for a green policy that allows policy measures to be ratcheted up over time.  The provision of direct industrial incentives to support the growth of particular green industries, such as renewables, is an effective way to build these new coalitions.  This has been borne out in the case of Germany, where it was a main driver of the energy transition.  The expansion of green industrial supports gave citizens access to the energy grid.  A payment for the energy fed into the grid supported the development of citizen-centred and community-centred renewable energies.  This solidified the societal acceptance of energy transitions, which is a key factor in determining our success as we go forward.</p> <p>  A second insight is that carbon-pricing approaches can face significant barriers to effective implementation.  An understanding of the dynamics of the political landscape is necessary in this context.  Carbon pricing incentivises regulatory losers, those who are going to lose out as a result of certain policies, to organise politically to prevent such policies from being implemented, thereby rendering measures difficult to implement and making them no more than marginally effective in the short and medium term.  It can be costly and time-consuming to tweak proposed instruments in order that they can be implemented in any form.  The EU emissions trading system and its related offset schemes have faced significant challenges.  Research indicates that switching to green industrial supports and focusing on such supports as well as on citizen-centred energy faces fewer political barriers and is more conducive to effective and sustainable policymaking.</p> <p>  Clear action on decarbonisation can have a powerful signalling effect and can create a facilitative framework.  Conversely, any moves to build new fossil fuel infrastructure can have lock-in impacts that undermine and derail sustainability transitions.  It is important to note that natural gas infrastructure projects that are planned within the EU's list of projects of common interest, including the planned Shannon liquified natural gas terminal, categorically impede our ability to decarbonise in a timely manner.  Alternatively, research has started to show that supply side policies, such as bans and moratoriums, have significant economic and political advantages compared with demand side policies.  The political advantages of such an approach include superior potential to mobilise public support, including within fossil fuel industries, as well as low administrative and transactional costs.</p> <p>  The EU can provide a framework for developing effective and just pathways to sustainable development and successful climate action.  Countries as small as Ireland can have a substantial impact within this framework.  Much of the work that is being done now involves the development of new norms of behaviour.  This has a powerful contagion effect.  We have an opportunity to implement a dynamic policy for effective climate action and sustainable development, but the window is closing fast.  Climate and ecological breakdown are hitting us faster than was ever predicted.  On our current path, a safe planet for human life will disappear before today's children reach the age of those we are addressing this morning.</p> <p>  No financial argument makes any sense when faced with these facts, regardless of whether it is hedged in terms of budget speak, bureaucratic processes, profits or vested interests.  The survival of all of us and all of those we care about is directly threatened by climate change.  This is not political.  It is a scientific fact that is based on science, physics and the laws of nature.  All Members of the Oireachtas will face important decisions in the coming weeks and months.  I want them to understand that everything they care about will be touched by climate and ecological breakdown.  They need to think about that and act from a place of love when they are making decisions.  Young people are asking politicians to give them a chance to live a dignified life and to have a safe world in which to live.  We are asking them to let us hope.  This is not about us versus them or young people versus politicians.  That is old thinking.  This is about the shared fate of all of us who are interconnected on this planet.  We are in this together for better or for worse, so let us make it better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.962" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Connor McGookin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019050900002#M00300"><p>I thank the committees for the opportunity to speak.  I have three brief points to make.  I will probably echo much of the frustration we heard in the previous statements.  First, climate change policy must be stepped up ambitiously.  Second, there is growing public appetite for climate action.  We have heard about Greta Thunberg.  Third, local actions must be adequately supported.  This should not just be about high-level ambition.  As Deputies and Senators are probably aware, European leaders are meeting in Romania today to discuss the future of Europe.  At this summit, eight countries and 210 cities are urging national leaders and the European Council to adopt a zero emissions target for 2050.  Last November, a report produced by the European Commission set out a number of pathways for achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  This commitment is essential if we are to avoid the apocalyptic narratives of climate change.  It is up to the EU 27 to lead the way.</p> <p>  I would like to mention one example of how Ireland is failing miserably to meet this responsibility.  Last October, a stark warning in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gave us just 11 years to make a meaningful difference.  Embarrassingly, this was followed by a failure to provide in the budget for an increase in carbon tax.  This reflects the lack of political leadership that has slowed the progress of climate policy across the world.  Thanks to a young Swedish girl, a growing movement throughout Europe is now demanding greater government ambition and moving climate policy onto the agenda.  The recent report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which achieved cross-party consensus, was a significant milestone.  The all-of-Government action plan that is being prepared is another important step in the right direction.  The achievement of political consensus is not the final hurdle, however.  We must build from here to secure social consensus.</p> <p>  While high-level ambition is essential, many of us have a lot to learn if we are to understand what this means at local level.  This is the focus of my own research.  I have explored new approaches to energy system modelling and planning that account for local values and perceptions.  As Mr. Leahy pointed out, there is a need to address some of the flaws in the planning and decision-making processes that can lead to opposition to infrastructural projects like large-scale wind developments and overhead pylons.  In 2015, the White Paper on energy mentioned that there was an "increasing recognition of the value that effective communication and a participative approach between developer, local community and local authority can bring to the development of energy infrastructure".</p><p>This has been echoed in recent policy with repeated references to phrases like "energy citizen" or "community engagement".  I imagine we can all agree this is a welcome narrative and is undoubtedly important for the energy transition.</p><p> However, within communities, several constraints are hindering meaningful progress.  I will list some of the key challenges and opportunities.  These have been compiled from my personal research and that of some of my colleagues.  First, volunteers are required, but depending on them will not be adequate.  As local champions these people are often part of several community groups and are already stretched.  The existing community networks represent a major opportunity but must be engaged in a respectful manner.  Second, I reiterate that core funding is needed.  Regular funding must be made available for the administration and co-ordination of community energy groups if they are to function effectively.  Third, until policy barriers in the form of tariffs, planning, finance and grid access are addressed, it will be unhelpful and perhaps counterproductive to continuously talk up community ownership of energy.  The final point is closest to my heart.  Community energy does not guarantee community acceptance but a more transparent and inclusive decision-making processes can help ease tensions and inspire positive action.</p><p> I will summarise my contribution.  I have noted the need for European leadership in stepping up ambition.  I touched on the noticeable growth in public appetite for meaningful climate action.  National leadership, extensive local engagement and clear benefits for communities are essential in driving the energy transition.</p></speech>

Last September, I began studying in DCU on the climate change masters programme.  I have always been interested in reading up on environmental news and over several years I have become increasingly concerned about climate change and environmental degradation.  Since beginning the course two things have happened.  I have realised how bad the situation is, but also that there is still hope.  It has hit home for me that there needs to be a fundamental change in our society if we are to tackle this problem in the short time there is left to effectively halt the worst of what could happen.<br/><br/>Ireland is rightly seen to be at the back of the pack.  However, the recent report from the Joint Committee on Climate Action is a welcome step in the right direction.  We can learn much from our European counterparts about what has worked and what has not.  We can build on these in an Irish context.<br/><br/>Effectively communicating the challenges and opportunities to citizens is the most important step.  There is a lot of fear and misunderstanding regarding climate change.  Public debate on what must happen to transition to a low-carbon economy is essential.  We need to have open conversations in the media and at the dinner table about how we must change the <i>status quo</i>and the best ways to do this for our local communities and large-scale industries.<br/><br/>I look forward to an all-of-Government action plan, as I believe it will help drive the public debate in a meaningful way to give the general public clear guidance on what is being proposed and how it will affect them personally and society as a whole.<br/><br/>The announcement by Bord na M&oacute;na last October of the loss of more than 400 jobs in the midlands shows the need for extensive planning and programmes to retrain workers or aid in job replacement schemes for those who will be most affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy.  Last October, the Spanish Government and coal miner unions reached a transition deal.  It offered early retirement or retraining for coal miners who are to lose their jobs as the industry is scaled back.  This is an example of good practice that can be repeated in an Irish context.  Some industries will be disproportionately affected, such as agriculture and peat production, while there will be more opportunities for green jobs elsewhere and these must be embraced.  Workers who believe their livelihoods are being threatened need to be engaged in what happens but at a community level there must be a discussion as well.  The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, campaigning on a green new deal platform, won the recent Spanish elections with up to 50% of the vote in some mining towns.  The party had worked with the coal miners unions previously.<br/><br/>Recently, there has been a surge in social activism around climate change, such as the school strikes for climate and the extinction rebellion.  I went to the two events held in Dublin.  As a former teacher, I know how hard it can be to motivate teenagers, but at the school strike, I was moved by the enthusiasm students showed that day.  At the extinction rebellion protest, I was inspired by the diversity of participants who showed up.  These movements show that the public are becoming increasingly aware of climate change, biodiversity loss and the general destruction of the natural world that is occurring at an unprecedented rate.  There has never been a better time to engage the public on the urgency of the crisis facing our planet.  Small-scale actions that individuals can take will not be enough without large-scale actions and policies by governments.  The EU, Ireland included, must lead the way and take bold unmitigated action now, with engaged citizens at the core of this transition.  The release earlier this week of the global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services is another stark reminder that our current system is failing and putting life on earth at risk.  The technology to make the shift is in place.  The financial risk will lessen the sooner we take action.  The public will to act has never been stronger.  It is time to change.</p></speech>

I will go to my colleagues with questions.  The witnesses might note the questions and then whoever wants to come in can answer them.  Is it okay if we proceed that way?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The witnesses have raised some important and key issues that the Joint Committee on Climate Action has been considering during the past seven months.  Ms Fitzgerald mentioned one of our key concerns, which is the price of carbon.  Although it was only a small part of our work, it was a key concern in respect of protecting the most vulnerable.  We considered the need to be politically palatable in bringing people with us and not making the mistakes we have made in other areas in engagement in with the community and bringing people on board.  That is why these conversations are important for us.  We have a body of work to complete and we can see that.  This is only the start.  Community engagement and how we communicate to the citizen are important.  We must protect the most vulnerable and those facing fuel poverty.  Key sectors will find the transition hardest, including the peat industry, the farming community and rural communities.  These are key areas that we have to work on as well.</p> <p>  I am keen to hear of any of the witnesses want to expand on what we can do in respect of the price of carbon.  They will have seen from our report how we are conscious of protecting those affected and the need to have a short, sharp engagement on the issue of the price of carbon and the key sectors that will be affected.  What else needs to be done on the regulatory and policy side?  What is the nature of the regulatory and policy mix needed for that to be a success?  That is one key component.</p> <p>  There was a major emphasis in all the contributions on new mediums of participation.  Mr. Leahy mentioned this and the question of community engagement.  This again is a whole-of-society approach.  The Government has a role to play but we cannot do it all; it has to be within the community as well.  One issue we have faced as elected representatives is that when we want to put in place renewable energy projects there is local opposition.  We talk about communities coming together feeding into the grid, tapping into the grid and selling their own electricity back into the grid.  We need to unlock the planning regulations.  The issues goes beyond acceptance.  If the witnesses have any more insights, I would be grateful to hear them.</p> <p>  I will bring in my colleagues now.  Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy and Senator M&aacute;ire Devine are first.  We will then hear from Deputy Tom Neville.</p></speech>

They will not find any argument from this side in respect of the challenge facing us all nationally and globally in terms of trying to halt global warming.</p> <p>  Mr. McGookin talked about reaching into local communities.  I wonder if he has looked at whether public participation networks are a good starting point.  I attended an event recently in my county of Offaly.  The public participation network there established Green Offaly, which is a great initiative.  Should initiatives like this be happening throughout the country?  It is something the Joint Committee on Climate Action discussed and recommended.</p> <p>  Ms Caroline Moran referred to Bord na M&oacute;na.  I am from Offaly.  A just transition is something that we are anxious to ensure.  Has she been keeping track of the efforts Offaly County Council has made recognising the challenges to the communities involved and the workers?  We need to bring together all the stakeholders to ensure that the workers involved are aware of all the benefits for them in terms of social protection as well as the opportunities for retraining and upskilling.  An event is being planned for the week after next.  It is a job-matching initiative in which local companies will come together with the workers who are taking voluntary redundancy.</p><p>There are many positives.  Other areas could learn from it.  Is Ms Moran keeping track of this?  It is important that we be aware of such efforts.</p></speech>

I am still a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  We were the black sheep of the committee when we voted against the carbon tax.  The committee has done 90% of its work collaboratively, but we were concerned about the just transition and the tax's imposition on less fortunate people who are struggling.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to expand on another point.  There is an emergency in our public health system because of climate change, and it will be even more harmful for communities tomorrow.  This is about communicating with communities not only about heatwaves, floods, storms and the resultant deaths, but about the day in, day out worldwide epidemic of asthma, respiratory tract infections and diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD.  Many of these have to do with pollution, for example, the quality of the water that we drink.  According to the World Health Organization, WHO, this threat costs many billions of dollars and causes millions of deaths per year.  The WHO believes that will only increase.  Should we declare this an emergency alongside climate change?</p> <p>  We have received representations from the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA.  It made an important statement that has stuck with me, namely, that we must rethink how we feed the world.  In the 1960s and 1970s, we did not have meat with every meal.  We could not afford it, as it was a luxury.  However, it has become so commonplace now that we expect it even though it is responsible for much of the destruction of the environment and our bodies' health.</p> <p>  When one sits down in a canteen, bistro or caf&eacute;, everything is packaged.  When did we stop being communal and sharing sugar bowls and milk jugs?  These simple points seem stupid, but they are down to hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, legislation.  We must revisit it, as it is so clinical and clean that it is damaging us, in that we are not being exposed to stuff and material is being wasted.  It is nonsensical that we all just sit around with sachets that we tear apart, adding to the destruction.  The global scale is larger, but I am interested in this matter.</p></speech>

I sat on the Joint Committee on Climate Action and, hopefully, will sit on a permanent version chaired by the Co-Chairman, Deputy Naughton.</p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses' presentations.  I went on a great journey of discovery during the eight months that I sat on the committee.  My knowledge of the parameters and facets of this issue was minuscule.  The witnesses are preaching to the converted as regards the necessary timelines and actions.</p> <p>  I was struck by the question of consultation and building coalitions raised in one of the presentations.  That is paramount to our success.  If we do not build a coalition and agreement across all parties and sectors of society, there will be a knee-jerk kickback.  Be it political or something else, it will be a "Them" and "Us" response that could set us back ten or 15 years or even a generation.  We do not want that.</p> <p>  Our committee viewed public consultation as paramount.  I was interested to hear about how an industry coalition was built on the ground in Germany, but Ireland needs to go to an even more micro level.  Since we have a smaller population, we are a more integrated society.  For example, managing directors of companies have siblings who are farmers or teachers.  As such, we wanted to propose town hall-type meetings that would involve peer-to-peer and community learning involving people from all sectors of society - young and old, farmers and doctors, unemployed people, those in receipt of disability payments and so on.  They would educate one another from the bottom up or at the same level.  Politicians taking a top-down approach will not work.  Europe and America have kicked back at such an approach.  We must alter our communication style.  That will be paramount in coalition building.  It will require maturity, not only from people, but also from political parties.  The latter must take a step back from the politics and build a coalition of consensus to drive this through.  I would be interested in hearing more about the coalition building that happened in Germany.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.974" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019050900002#O00700"><p>I welcome our guests, who have spoken passionately.  These are issues that we considered in significant depth in writing our report.  Action is needed.  The requirement that we live more sustainably, which we have not been doing for years, is at the heart of this.  It is the fallout of industrialisation and so on.  If people were surveyed, everyone would agree with the targets under the Paris Agreement.  It is only when one starts to drill down into who will take the pain and cost that a problem arises.  That is what we must address if we want to see action.  As Deputy Neville stated, though, there must be a consensus.</p> <p>  Recently, I attended a climate action forum of secondary schools in my county of Mayo that was facilitated by the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, the county council and the latter's climate action officer.  We were sitting around a table and one of the issues debated was that of cost.  In terms of transport, for example, we talked about how, if the pupils' parents had to get electric vehicles, it would cost them money regardless of how large a grant the State provided.  The same would be the case with heating systems.  When I asked them if they believed that would be acceptable, they could not say that it would be.</p> <p>  There is another political reality.  No matter what people say in the abstract about targets and the need to take action, the experience in Canada, Australia, Finland, France and Germany has been that, when politicians take political action, a large number of people do not agree with doing so.  It does not mean that we should balk at trying to do the right thing, as we cannot continue taking from the Earth something that will not be replenished and will cause greenhouse gas emissions.  We are smarter now and have more technology.  We must be smarter and live more smartly.  However, the idea that everyone is in agreement is incorrect.  It is not even that they do not believe that there is climate change.  Rather, they are more concerned with living in the here and now than with taking on additional pressures.  If someone is in receipt of social welfare payments, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, can fund 100% of certain energy efficiency works on his or her house.  If someone is earning a low income and, accordingly, will only receive partial supports, he or she will be under pressure.  These are the people who will be financing their children going to college.  From where will that money come?  The bill will be significant.  That is even evident from our social housing programme, given the additional cost of building houses.  People are revolting against costs.  That does not take from the witnesses' message, but we must refine our discussion to listening to people's concerns.</p> <p>  I have raised an issue previously and, while I do not want to labour the point, it must be borne in mind that when the witnesses refer to the measures that are necessary to tackle climate change, they are asking for more to be done by people living in rural areas.  They are asking rural areas to take wind farms and grid infrastructure.  They are asking for peat-burning power stations to be shut down.  Where I am from, such a station closed a number of years ago.  The area is only a shadow of its former itself economically.</p><p>The issue of community gain is very relevant there.</p><p> There is also the issue of farming and the speaker from Teagasc earlier made a sensible proposition.  We are very well suited to producing protein from dairy and beef.  It does not mean that we continue exactly in the same vein but this is not discussed.  There is now a situation where farmers are saying they have been doing all of this.  The national herd has increased and that is why our greenhouse gases and emissions of methane have increased but farmers are farming more efficiently than ever before.  They are put to the pin of their collars by payments on environmental measures, water quality and biodiversity.  They have an appetite to do more but feel persecuted.  People are disengaging.</p><p> I will say one final thing.  The generation coming after us ask us to look at what we are doing.  The reality is that the parents of the children I was talking to would give their left arms for their children.  Their grandparents would do the same.  The generations that have come before are trying to cope and do their best.  They care and want to be given credit for that.  We have to get realistic solutions which balance idealism with the reality to achieve them and not crush people in the process.  </p><p> We will have a revolution.  It will not be like those revolting in London who are from more middle class backgrounds and have time on their hands.  The ordinary person will revolt which will create another set of problems that will set us back economically.  We cannot take from the advances and lifestyles we enjoy.  We must find technology to match that.</p><p> The last speaker on the environment was positive and hopeful, as I am.  Human beings have great capacity to innovate and, although there will always be issues and problems, there can be business opportunities here.  We see a lot of signals sent out by China and India, major emerging economies, that they have to go to green technology and transport etc.  Ireland has to take these signals if it wants to participate in the global economy.  We must also be clever.   It is not only about misery, it is about opportunities and living in a different way.</p></speech>

I will come to Senator Higgins.  I am conscious of letting our speakers come back to respond.</p></speech>

I campaigned with Tr&oacute;caire on climate change in 2008 when a group of young activists, who are no longer young, were demanding action.  Even then, climate change was not new and there were huge impacts on many parts of the world and many communities were seeing their futures destroyed.</p><p>It is good that there is momentum now and climate change is centre stage in discussions.  Europe Day is about Europe and the real test will be if Europe will place the sustainable development goals and climate change actions at the centre of the new five-year European strategy.  Will they also be at the centre of the multiannual financial framework, the European budget?  Simply putting climate action front and centre for photos at the moment will not be enough.  </p><p>The European Investment Bank put &euro;11 billion into fossil fuels between 2007 and 2013.  The European climate action fund is proposed to be &euro;5 billion.  I want people to discuss the balance between where we invest and how we can stop taking backward steps.</p><p>One of the speakers mentioned the LNG terminal which is an example of something that was funded by European investment funding.  How do we get that joined up?  It comes down to public participation.  </p><p>I am passionate about new forms of participation and we need them.  I like the idea of town hall meetings, I think they are important, and I also think people should be looking at their local authority's development plans and putting in opinions.  That is important.  It is crucial to ask how we ensure the public discussion does not stay in a silo as a separate discussion on climate, but rather bring climate action into the economic discussion around budgets.  We need to ensure that closed-door economic decisions such as trade agreements and procurement are joined up and informed by climate considerations.  We need not to have any backward steps.  I would like to hear the comments of the speakers on that matter.</p><p>Another consideration is the comparative roles of the public and private sectors which was touched on by some of the speakers.  For example, it might be tempting to support the electric car industry because it has the potential to make profit whereas public transport might not, but public transport might lead us to make much greater progress much more quickly.  There will be things that will cost money and will not necessarily be profitable but, if we do not take the action now, the cost will be borne elsewhere in the world and by those most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>That brings us to the question of carbon pricing.  I am on the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection and am very passionate about just transition.  We must not wait for people to become redundant from sectors that are no longer sustainable but need to talk to them while they are still employed about their plans for the future.  I have been arguing for that in the context of just transition.  We must manage the pragmatic issues around just transition in Ireland and look to climate justice on a global level so we not only address the concerns in Ireland but look to climate justice for other parts of the world.</p><p>The price of carbon is artificially low and needs to be higher.  The price has driven an unsustainable global development model.  Do we make social protection payments?  Fuel poverty payments will get us to a certain level but, as was rightly said, many people on low incomes will not be caught by the fuel supplement.  How do we recognise and ensure that industry is reflecting the price of carbon and does not have artificially deflated prices because of artificially deflated carbon costs while ensuring that individuals are not taking the worst of the impacts?  Those are the key questions.  Perhaps we should look at bans, moratoriums and levies on sectors.</p><p>I will conclude because I want to hear the responses of the speakers.  It comes back to the question of business as usual.  Where do we frontload?  Can we, and should we, balance keeping interests aligned while ensuring that we do not wait for certain climate actions to become profitable?<b></b>We have to frontload it.  All of the speakers had practical thoughts on how we do that.  </p><p>My key questions relate to climate justice, just transition, the public and private spheres and how to ensure this is an economic transformation as well as a social movement.</p></speech>

There is a great deal we can do on climate change in a relatively short time.  We are supposed to achieve certain targets within ten years and it is well within our capacity to achieve them in that time period even though we are late starters.</p> <p>  The first thing we had to do was to convince people of the necessity to change and become less reliant on fossil fuels.  As we do that, we must also become less reliant on the electricity generated from fossil fuels.  Once we have crossed that part of the divide, the rest will follow readily.  There is serious interest in electric cars this year where there was no such interest in the past.</p> <p>  Some of us have, over the past number of years, tried to sell the idea of alternative energy and the renewable energy sector and been publicly criticised and ridiculed for it.  That is part of the battle we must face into.  We must balance our approach, try to ensure that we do not target part of our community, or be seen to do so, in our journey towards achieving the necessary change.  We have the capacity to do that, provided we do it right, and avoid the possibility of postponing forever something we need to start doing now.</p></speech>

The first point made was about carbon tax and we looked at that and what it would mean to raise the weekly allowance in order to offset the extra &euro;10.</p><p>It was something like &euro;4 in the winter and &euro;2 in the summer.  We will revert to the committee as we have some figures on that.  It would not hit the people in fuel poverty.  Much of what comes from our research must account for fuel poverty.</p><p> Climate change is a cross-cutting matter and there were questions as to how to overcome the problems.  There are significant benefits to dealing with climate change, particularly in the rural sector, and I hope dealing with climate change would address many of the problems of rural degradation and help to revive many rural areas.  It would help farmers through diversification of income by generating electricity, growing other crops or being paid for the carbon captured in their forests.  Reforestation would be a major part of achieving carbon neutrality, along with restoring wetlands.</p><p> Public participation networks were a recommendation in the report from the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which is why I left them out of my bullet points.  I certainly agree that we need such town hall meetings and there is an attempt to achieve this with the national dialogue on climate change.  It is important to capacity building in communities to have access to impartial experts who can point to the facts and challenges being faced.  It is about open discussion.  My research in the Dingle peninsula relates to this if the members are interested.</p><p> Somebody mentioned going through the local authority and we thought that if we could follow the example of the UK and Wicklow in declaring a climate emergency, local authorities should have it as a top priority to have a climate change officer who would be able to advise homeowners or community groups.  It is an important element in building capacity, which has been mentioned quite often.  There was mention of the middle class accessing grants.  It is a major problem.  I know in Australia, poorer people were basically subsidising richer people getting solar panels put on their homes.  We must be careful to avoid such things.</p></speech>

As has been mentioned, it is really important that there should be plans in place before peat production is closed so workers can have options in what they do afterwards.  If there is to be a change, those workers need different options and time to think.  At a community level there must be thought on what new industries can be brought in to benefit the entire community.</p> <p>  There was mention of carbon tax and feed-in tariffs for solar photovoltaic equipment, which is really important.  The uptake of solar photovoltaic technology in countries with feed-in tariffs has been huge.  If there is fuel poverty or people have low incomes without supplements, they could get profits from a feed-in tariff rather than just a grant.  Retired people in their homes during the day may use electricity while it is generated and therefore it would cut their costs.  Conversely, if people are at work all day they do not get the benefit of energy that is being produced but they would see a benefit through a feed-in tariff.  They would get the money back.  Such a process could work, especially in rural communities.  We have spoken much about farmers and if they are leaving land spare, there could be large-scale solar photovoltaic installations to generate income as well.  We need to be creative in what we do.</p></speech>

This goes beyond just public consultation, which is also a good step.  This is also about what policy choices we make and the outcomes and effects they have.  To underline what has already been said, feed-in tariffs, for example, have the effect of building powerful coalitions.  In Germany there were all sorts of actors who became supportive of the policy and really tried to protect it, including people who may not necessarily have been green-minded.  They support it being ratcheted up.</p> <p>  It is really important to note the social dimension.  We have seen the yellow vest movement in France and what happens when we do not have this lens in implementing the decarbonisation policy.  There was mention of a just transition and this should not be about climate action versus farmers or peat workers.  Farmers are on the front line of climate change and they are already experiencing it.  We have seen that with the fodder crisis.  The fossil fuel age is collapsing and one way or another, peat workers will see an impact from climate change policy.  We must achieve this in a just way.</p> <p>  I will speak briefly to carbon pricing.  As I stated, I am drawing on an understanding of policy dynamics.  Carbon pricing should be seen as one of many tools in a policy mix.  One of the issues is the need to build alternatives and allow people to have alternatives through something like a feed-in tariff.  To draw on a German case, there was a delay in trying to implement carbon pricing through the emissions trading system and, essentially, there was neglect of the areas of transport, heating and the idea of a more systemic just transition.  Now the country is facing the consequences, so we would do well to learn from their mistakes and not have this happen with carbon price implementation in Ireland.  Green industrial support, citizen energy, bans and moratoriums can be used.  The paper I quoted was by Mr. Fergus Green and Dr. Richard Denniss from 2017 and it is available online.  They argue that supply-side bans have a host of advantages and gain much support, including from actors like the fossil fuel industry, which we might not expect.</p> <p>  Citizen energy feeds into the transformative elements and resilience in communities and globally.  It builds more community resilience and this enables communities to face climate change issues.  That work comes from people like Mr. Craig Morris.  There is a need to look locally but also globally at what is coming.  People in Mozambique are panicking, for example, and people across the global South already facing the impact of climate change are panicking.  We would do well to respond right now to what we are all facing.</p></speech>

We could speak about this for hours and all the information has almost given me a headache.  There is one point that has been mentioned a few times and it relates to consultation.  It is one type of participation but this cannot just be about consultation.  According to my research, many different authors and academics have stated that typical formal consultation does not work.  Submissions may not be taken into account with a final decision and there is also the question of when consultation happens.  Does it happen when all the options are closed and if so, how efficient can that be?  There is the question of timing in participation.</p> <p>  I can give a brief example.  Last year the national adaptation framework was published in January and it marked the first step in a process of building national adaptation for different sectors and local authorities.  It was put out for consultation in September 2017 and there were 27 or 28 submissions.  It was not a very high number.  The submissions are available online and only four were submitted by private individuals not representing an organisation or State agency.  This demonstrates a problem.  Is the general public just not interested in those policies or is there a lack of communication in advertising those formal consultation processes?  It is something we must be aware of and we probably need to go a step further than just consultation.  It would amount to considerable responsibility for local authorities but this needs to happen at a local level.</p></speech>

There is certainly a need to panic as we are missing our targets for 2020 and we are set up to miss the 2030 targets.  If by 2050 we are to be carbon-neutral or reduce our emissions by 80% or 100%, we are not on track to do it, even if we implement many of the recommendations of the report.</p> <p>  To focus on agriculture, my research was on soils and soil carbon in Ireland, taking into account the effect of extreme weather on those soils.  Our natural grasslands are carbon sinks because they are grazed by cattle and they provide minerals for the soil.  Those soils are carbon sinks in the same way that our untouched peatlands are.  There are 7 million cows in Ireland producing methane.</p><p>I do not understand how we square getting to carbon neutrality by 2050 with retaining that number of cows.  We need also to recognise the benefit the cows have to the soil.  These are complex issues and communicating their complexity is very important, especially if we do not want an "us versus them" strategy coming out.  Farmers are certainly looking after their land to the best of their ability as they want to pass it on to future generations.  Focusing on the complexities of the issue is important but so is recognising the limitations of our current actions.  </p></speech>

I especially welcome the three speakers for this section, Ms Sara Thompson from UCD, Ms Laura Bartley from DCU and Ms Maeve Richardson from UCC.  It has been a very interesting and illuminating morning for the members listening to all of the witnesses' contributions.  I also welcome the presence of an ever-depleting number of my colleagues from the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  Such is the draw on all our time here in the Houses.  I represent two Ulster counties, Cavan and Monaghan, and have been Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality since 2016.</p> <p>  Migration is the final topic of today's session marking Europe Day 2019.  This is a very important topic, especially on this day, for as Europeans we have known the reality of migration, most often forced migration due to war, conflict, famine, disease and escape from poverty across the centuries.  It is beyond dispute that the people of Ireland have known migration and its causes like few others across the Continent.  This generational awareness, experience and knowledge should contribute to our being a truly welcoming people, giving truth to the claim that this is an Ireland of the welcomes.  Sadly, of course, this is not always the case.  </p> <p>  While we have some time issues, there will be no restriction in respect of the three speakers.  If I have to restrict anybody it will be my colleague, Senator Devine.  I call on Ms Thompson to address us.</p></speech>

I will present some facts and numbers and some challenges that the EU is facing in respect of migration.  The 2015 migration crisis became a starting point to a wider debate on migration in the European Union but also on burden sharing and the member states' responsibilities.  The lack of joint action between the member states has shown that in 2015 the EU was unprepared to handle this issue, which resulted in disorderly migration, human trafficking and tragedy.  In respect of the numbers, 2.5 million immigrants entered the EU from non-EU countries in 2017; and 4.4% of people living in the EU on 1 January 2018 were non-EU citizens, which is 22 million people out of a total of 512 million.  The European agency for human rights has pointed out that the number of irregular migrants crossing the borders dropped in 2017, when 200,000 people crossed the EU borders, in comparison to approximately 500,000 in 2016.  The number of deaths at sea has also dropped; however, the emergency remains as the deaths are continuing, mainly in the central Mediterranean.</p> <p>  Also concerning is the fact that migrants arriving within EU borders have been mistreated.  This mistreatment worsened in 2017 with Bulgaria, Hungary and Croatia as the leading countries of migrant mistreatment.  Another issue is the relocation of immigrants and the problem of overcrowding.  This has been critical in numerous locations, especially in Greece, France and Italy.  Providing adequate housing remains a challenge and the lack of co-operation between member states has a significant impact on how immigration is handled in the EU.  The European Council established a temporary relocation scheme with a plan to relocate 160,000 people in need.  This was not accomplished due to lack of co-operation from the member states.  President Antonio Tajani has stated that migration is our biggest challenge and that it is putting at risk the very future of the European Union.  As a result of intense migration within the EU in recent years, EU internal borders have been subject to additional border controls, which is putting the free movement of EU citizens at risk.  There is a need for better co-operation between member states with regard to border management as the migration crisis has put major pressure on the member states' border authorities.  The European institutions responded with a call for strengthening the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, however this remains a work in progress, with a plan of giving the agency a standing corps of 10,000 border guards by 2027, which is a bit far away.  A Eurobarometer survey has reported that 73% of European citizens want the EU to do more on the issue of migration and 58% described EU action on migration as inadequate.  There is a need to do more on the part of both member states and the EU as a whole.  Reaching agreement on migrant issues has been a challenge for the European Union.  It is a sensitive issue and member states have different views and policies on migration, making it difficult to negotiate co-ordinated common positions.  The migration crisis in 2015 showed that the EU was not prepared to handle a humanitarian crisis.  Plans to relocate migrants, strengthen the borders, integrate refugees and much more are still a work in progress.</p> <p>  Member states and their representatives have to become aware of the next upcoming crisis, which is climate displacement.  This crisis is not spoken about or understood by many.  It is not defined or backed by international law.  It is true that civil war and unrest in Syria, Libya and the Middle East are reasons for the migrant crisis but there are deeper reasons for current migration from these places.  These areas are experiencing rainfall patterns, unbearably high temperatures, floods, droughts and all sorts of natural disasters which lead to major changes in farming, fishing and herding, causing migration from these areas to more developed ones.  Reports on climate displacement presented by the EU are often very generalised and do not provide clear solutions to the problem.  Following the 2015 migration crisis, it is clear that member states are not united with regard to burden sharing and this has to be addressed in order to prepare Europe and help those in need.  </p> <p>  I will present a couple of recommendations made by the Mary Robinson Foundation on Climate Justice in its 2016 position paper.  Above EU national level, the rights of climate displaced people have to be respected in the same way as human rights in general.  The burdens in respect of dealing with climate migration have to be addressed together as a Union.  There is a need for engagement with already displaced people but also with those who are vulnerable to climate displacement, in order to protect the rights of people who are at risk of climate displacement.  The most important action the countries can take is to reduce the impact of climate change at all costs.  This will reduce the threats in areas at risk.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.996" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Bartley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019050900002#R00500"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it.  As a younger citizen, I am particularly grateful for this opportunity to engage on such a timely policy issue.  My knowledge is based on my European-funded research at Dublin City University, the University of Glasgow and Charles University, Prague.  My research focuses on migration to Europe, specifically the power of the media and policy makers to shape public opinion.  My current research examines the ways in which migration has been constructed as a threat and questions the dominance of this threat-centric approach.</p> <p>  It is without doubt that international migration and issues surrounding migrants, refugees and asylum seekers can be seen as defining characteristics of the 21st century in an era of globalisation.  In the context of conflict and growing inequalities, the IOM's 2018 report estimates that there are 258 million international migrants globally.  Ireland's strong cultural memory and historic trend to emigration mean that we are acutely aware of the realities of migration and displacement.</p><p>Yet more recently, Ireland has experienced increased inward migration and has become an increasingly diverse society with the 2016 census indicating that the 535,000 non-Irish nationals living in Ireland originate from 200 different nations.  Such figures illustrate the increased diversity and prompt the need to examine political and societal attitudes to immigrants, and explore different ways to support integration and social cohesion within Irish and European society.</p><p> The first challenge I will address relates to the power of language and narrative.  Migration has remained one of the most divisive issues for the public in recent years and this is reflected in the polarised narratives and language which frame discussions.  Past decades have seen a language shift from emigrant and immigrant to the use of the word "migrant" which has effect of de-contextualising the experience of these people by removing their home location and their destination.  There is also selectivity in respect of those to whom we apply these terms which often indicates a hierarchy of worthiness, suggesting that we have "good" versus "bad" migrants.</p><p> The language we use matters.  It has power to reinforce negative stereotypes and racial hierarchies which permeate to every level of society.  As such we must recognise and challenge harmful, polarising language and myths regarding migration.  We must refrain from using terms such as "illegal migrant" in any forum of discussion and instead use "irregular" or "undocumented".  We must commit to increased engagement in order to confront the myths of migration at local, national and EU levels.</p><p> There is a need to engage in difficult discussions regarding migration for policy makers, journalists and activists to maintain credibility.  We must create a space where communication of the perceived and actual challenges of migration is possible, but not in a way which stigmatises or alienates communities.  The creation of action plans and strategies by Government and local authorities, such as the migrant integration strategy or even the UN migration pact convey effective messages which are honest, fair and accessible.</p><p> The second challenge I wish to address is promoting integration in communities.  There is increasing recognition of the inherent potential of diverse society.  There is also an awareness of the difficulties associated with integration policies and programmes.  The dilemma often relates to how to prioritise integration without fuelling unfairness among certain groups that feel left behind.  Research has shown that encounters with the reality of migration foster a more tolerant mindset within host communities, which needs to be looked at further.</p><p> In discussions on the topic of integration, it is often said that the process is a two-way street involving the host community and the newcomer.  However, we need to move away from this binary give-and-take view of integration, as it does not always capture the complex, multifaceted and dynamic process which involves a network of actors and interactions.  As such we must disrupt the preconceptions that contribute to a gap between the expectation and reality of migration.  We must do this through promoting intercultural competency and integration programmes, such as arts and language acquisition, for all members of society.  We must aim to equip all citizens with the education to gain empathy and perspective-taking skills.</p><p> We must view the integration process in the context of the whole of society and facilitate the undoing of notion of "us" versus "them".  We must broaden the view of immigration beyond simply contributing to GDP or market growth.  It is not just about financially benefiting from migration, but about the overall health of our societies over the next generation.  In addition we need to carry out further research into attitudes towards diversity and integration within Irish and European society, such as the recent ERSI study.</p><p> With the immense challenges facing European and Irish society, such as changing demographics, political fragmentation, labour market changes and the pace of political and social changes, we need to have broader perspectives on the challenges we are facing and also an ambitious vision of what our future communities may look like.</p><p> We should not think of integration as an endpoint, but to understand it as an ongoing, inclusive process which provides opportunities and builds resilience in communities to confront the growing range of future challenges, not just in respect of migration.</p><p> I look forward to hearing the committee's views.</p></speech>

I am honoured to be addressing the committee today.  I am a BSc student in University College Cork in the second year of my undergraduate studies.  Appropriately we are speaking on Europe Day about a month before the European Parliament elections.  Given the changes in the political climate, it is now more important than ever to use the ballot box to have our voices heard in Europe.</p> <p>  The Treaty of Rome established the freedom of movement in respect of goods, services, capital and, what seems to be getting most attention lately, the movement of people, as we have seen from our colleagues in the European Union.  Migration has many different definitions and comes in many types, including economic migrants, refugees and ex-pats.  The perception of migration is intriguing as to whether it is harmful or positive, and what are its economic effects and difficulties.  Many people see the advantages of labour gaps being filled and society becoming more diverse.  We also see the negativity that jobs are being take away by members of the migrant community or that there is a social pressure on civic services along with an increase in racism and discrimination.</p> <p>  The cross-national Role of European Mobility and its Impacts in Narratives, Debates and EU Reforms, REMINDER, study shows that more than half of EU citizens regard the freedom of movement as positive for Europe despite an increase in support for far-right parties which has the effect of making mainstream parties take tougher stances on immigration.  European countries tend to view the effects of migrants in two ways - cultural and economic.  More recently we are starting to think about safety and terrorism.  The REMINDER study took place across seven countries in western Europe.  Apart from the UK, most countries showed more than 50% in favour of the freedom of movement.  These viewed most immigrants to western European as beneficial and not an economic or cultural threat.  Africans were viewed as most threatening to the economy while Middle Eastern migrants were considered the most threatening to safety and culture.  This has been as a result of the image of migrants portrayed in our media.</p> <p>  Europeans perceive that migrants from outside Europe make up 16.7% of the EU population.  The reality is that it is about 4.4% as of January 2018.  The representation of migrants in the media has had a profound effect on how we view our migrants.  The media provide both a human face in the form of refugees but also a mild terror attack in the form of big news headlines which terrify us.</p> <p>  Migration is an important topic for us all.  It has been shown to be a top priority for countries in the southern coastal part of Europe, namely in Croatia, Italy and Greece.  It is not so much of an issue in Ireland and is not a voter priority.  This is mainly due to the fact in the late 2010s it is shown that the majority of non-EU migrants arrive by sea.</p> <p>  Our landscape is changing through climate change and we need to become proactive rather than reactive if we are to prepare for another migrant crisis such as we saw in 2015.  We need to make sure that with coming of an EU army we are not creating a fortress Europe but rather creating a Europe that is open to all and not just Europeans.</p></speech>

This is not my area of expertise.  The Seanad has a public consultation committee.  In the autumn I plan on opening a conversation by inviting representatives from the direct provision system, which is a shame and stain on our country.  I would like to invite the three witnesses present to come to talk about migration and how people get to that point of desperation.  We are displaying inhumanity to people who need embracing, care and love, and a shelter from the horrific circumstances they left behind.</p> <p>  The witnesses talked about climate displacement - which could have been appropriate to the previous speakers - the greed of the developed world and our destructive impact on those less fortunate.</p><p>Our objective in having a public consultation in the autumn will be to challenge perceptions in this country and reach out to the 40% of people who feel afraid of and unsure about migration.  It is about getting the media to respond and to counteract some of the hysterical and hateful headlines we have seen.  The witnesses noted that voters in several European countries have elected more delegates from right-wing, fortress Europe parties.  My colleague, Senator Gavan, was in Hungary recently and may speak about what he saw there.  I will be happy to extend an invitation to the witnesses, who have made an excellent contribution to this debate, to attend the public consultation later this year.</p></speech>

We have had very impressive contributions from all the witnesses.  As part of my work as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I have witnessed teenagers the same age as my own children being kept in cages, for more than six months in one case.  That is what is happening in parts of Europe to migrant children.  The witnesses have played their part today in seeking to break the shameful silence around this issue.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on the EU's deal on migration with Turkey, which is deemed a third country of safe origin.  It is no such thing but is, in fact, a dictatorship in which horrendous human rights abuses are taking place.  It suits the EU to do that deal, however, because it keeps people out and there is apparently little interest in how migrants are being treated in Turkey.  It is an appalling human rights situation and the EU is utterly complicit in it.  It is a situation that must be ended.  I thank all the speakers for their contributions.</p></speech>

However, compared with countries like Hungary and Turkey, there are ways in which we can seek to integrate people into our society as much as possible.  We have seen great projects, for example, from Scouting Ireland and the Irish Second-Level Students Union.  However, if we remain silent on what is happening in other countries, what is the point of any such efforts?  We should be taking the lead by saying we will not stand for this.  We are a Europe of peace but there is no point if we are not working to keep the peace between people internally in our member countries.</p></speech>

It is timely, therefore, to have a public consultation on the issue.  I agree that the EU seems to be outsourcing many of our problems with migration to a neighbourhood comprising Libya, Morocco and Turkey.  There needs to be a re-engagement across European society on the values we are meant to uphold, such as strength in diversity.  The actions being taken in the EU at a high political level do not reflect those principles.  Likewise in Ireland, the refugee programme has reached only half its quota.  We need to reflect on our claim to be the island of c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.  A public consultation will be very helpful in that regard.</p></speech>

On burden sharing, as long as countries do not take responsibility for that at European level, nothing will change.  As it stands, burden sharing is voluntary.  We must push at European level to make such commitments binding and ensure we take responsibility for the care of migrants.  In the context of climate displacement, we in Europe are the lucky ones who are safe for now, but we must take responsibility for the damage we are doing to the planet and to the people who will be displaced by climate change.</p></speech>

Ms Thompson clearly linked increased migration with the climate crisis, especially as it affects less developed and impoverished parts of the globe.  Ms Bartley spoke about the importance of language and how "illegal migrant" is an inappropriate and stigmatising term and one we should not use.  I thank her for that strong message.  She spoke, too, about how an "us and them" outlook is blinkered and serves to feed prejudice and racism.  Ms Richardson noted that the free movement of people is one of the key principles of the European Union and, like her colleague, linked migration to the importance of addressing the climate crisis.</p> <p>  In the absence of my Co-Chairman, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, it falls to me to draw the meeting to a close.  The witnesses have distinguished themselves and their respective colleges and organisations.  It is a great pleasure for us as Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to welcome young, focused and enthusiastic voices from across the length and breadth of the island of Ireland.  That has been an important feature of today's discussion.  I especially welcome the fellow voices from Ulster, which makes me feel at home.  Every time I cross the Boyne Valley Bridge, I let out a small cheer that I am heading there again.  I thank colleagues for their part in marking Europe Day so well as we have done.  I hope it will be the first of many years of interesting engagement between ourselves and witnesses like those we have heard from today.</p></speech>

Before we start, I remind members and witnesses to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off.  This is important as they cause serious problems for the broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.</p> <p>  I am delighted that today we have engagement on Europe Day.  We have a presentation by the students on the challenges facing the European Union and we are all very much looking forward to that.</p> <p>  I welcome all the witnesses to this special meeting of the joint committees on Europe Day.</p><p>On this day in 1950 Robert Schuman outlined his vision for Europe of peace and co-operation between nations.  That was nearly 70 years ago, but it laid the foundations for the European Union we know today.  It is a strong partnership of nations that are working together to achieve the common goals of peace and prosperity.  Ireland joined the European Economic Community, EEC, now the European Union, in 1973 and has been a proud participant in European institutions for more than 45 years.  Citizens of Ireland tend to be very positive about our EU membership.  The results of a recent poll carried out by Red C Research and Marketing for the European Movement of Ireland showed that 93% of Irish people supported remaining in the European Union.  This shows the success of the European project and the benefits the European Union has brought to the country.<br/><br/>For Ireland, membership of international rules-based organisations is the best way to build relationships and alliances and for countries to support each other.  Europe Day is a great opportunity for us all to reflect on where we are and what we have achieved.  Importantly, it is also an opportunity to discuss the challenges ahead for all of us and how we can work together to find solutions to them.  In the context of Brexit and all of the implications that stem from it, it is more important than ever before for politicians, of all political allegiances and none, to work together and show a united front when it comes to doing our job and ensuring a good team effort across the political divide.  I sincerely believe it is terribly important for us to do so.  <br/><br/>Elections to the European Parliament will be held across the European Union in a few weeks' time.  The results of the same poll to which I referred showed that younger cohorts who were the most positive towards the European Union and many of its policies and who certainly had views on the issues at stake were also the least likely group to vote on 24 May.  It is important that we find ways to engage with each other and hear from experts emerging in their fields.  It is especially important that we hear the views of young people on the issues that will affect the future of the European Union.  I am passionate about this issue.  When I look at young people, I see them as the future.  In the years to come they will be the politicians and employers.  Every one of us is on a wheel and our time in our different roles comes and then finishes.  It will then be the turn of the young people who are before me.  When I go into schools, national and secondary, all I think of is that they are the future.  They are the ones who will be running the country, the Europe Union and the world in the years ahead.  I am very conscious of this, as we all should be.  <br/><br/>I do not think we have ever held a meeting of five joint committees before.  Today's event shows a new approach and how important it is that we take a cross-sectoral approach to such broad issues.  I welcome our guests, the students and young people from Queens University Belfast, QUB; Ulster University, UU; Teagasc; University College Dublin, UCD; Dublin City University, DCU; National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG; National University of Ireland, Maynooth, NUIM; and our neighbours in University College Cork, UCC.  <br/><br/>The meeting will be divided into four sessions and the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the relevant committee will chair its session.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. <br/><br/>I ask the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Deering, to lead us in the discussion on the reform of the Common Agriculture Policy.</p></speech>

In this session we will deal with the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which has served the country well in recent years.  In our discussion we are going to hear about where it is going to go in the months and years ahead.  The discussion will include the environmental and budgetary aspects of the CAP.  Budgets are very important, as nothing can be done without them.  We will also hear about reform, subsidiarity and flexibility.  We would like to hear about all of these elements.  Whenever there is a discussion about the CAP, we hear about the need to make it more simplified.  "Simplification" is a big word, but the CAP always seems to come out more bureaucratic.  We are looking forward to the discussion on the next CAP taking place and being concluded in the next year or so to finally have a more simplified programme.  I am delighted that we are joined by Mr. Daniel Bakker from Queens University Belfast, Dr. Sin&eacute;ad Furey and Dr. Lynsey Hollywood from Ulster University, Dr. Sin&eacute;ad McCarthy from Teagasc and Ms Si&uacute;n M&aacute;ire Riordan from University College Cork.  I welcome them and thank them for attending to discuss this very important issue, on which I look forward to a very good discussion.  I call Mr. Bakker to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I will speak about the CAP for a few minutes.  </p> <p>  In June 2018 the European Commission put forward its legislative proposals for the future of the CAP post 2020.  Previous reforms of the CAP had been driven by political and economic change.  It is important, therefore, for all concerned to look at the political challenges facing the European Union and what the future of the CAP might look like.</p> <p>  The European Union is facing the challenges of UK withdrawal, the rise of a Eurosceptic tide across member states, global market instability, particularly in agricultural prices, and greater pressure to respond and adapt to climate change.  The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union is crucial because it has contributed significantly to a forecasted reduction in the CAP budget for the period 2021 to 2027.  The cut proposed is 5%, but it will be around 12% in real terms.  As the CAP is one of the cornerstones of European integration, it is important that the Commission&rsquo;s proposals be considered and scrutinised.</p> <p>  The proposed legislation retains the current two pillar structure of direct payments and rural development but allows much greater flexibility for member states to choose where their allocation of funds will go.  The Commission&rsquo;s rationale is to streamline the CAP and increase overall efficiency.  Member states will be better able to target their interventions to suit their specific contexts.  The proposals also have revised greening architecture for pillar 1 payments and put strong emphasis on the CAP&rsquo;s commitment to environmental sustainability.</p> <p>  Member states will be responsible for drawing up strategic plans which will then be approved by the Commission to ensure they stay within the CAP&rsquo;s overall objectives.  Some see this as a step in the right direction, but others, including some member states, have raised concerns as strategic plans might place a further administrative burden on national governments.  Many agricultural stakeholders have criticised the idea as it could potentially lead to an undermining of the Single Market and compromise a level playing field for farmers.  Some fear the proposals amount to a renationalisation of agriculture and will increase bureaucracy and market distortions, resulting from differences in implementation across the European Union.  Affording member states too much flexibility has also been criticised by environmentalists.  As well as criticising the continuation of "perverse subsidies", environmentalists argue that flexibility with no real incentives to have ambitious targets could lead to declining environmental standards across the European Union.  The proposed "enhanced conditionality" clause in the new legislative proposals has been viewed as more greenwashing of the CAP, without sufficient accountability mechanisms to ensure adherence to environmental regulations.</p> <p>  It is important to stress that the proposals are in their very early stages.</p><p>As we saw with the previous CAP reform in 2013, nothing is likely to be passed until the EU budget is agreed.  There will be a new European Parliament and perhaps a new European Commissioner by the time the legislation enters into force, but as the proposal stands, there are several steps that could be taken to ensure a successful CAP.</p><p> There could be greater promotion of dialogue between environmentalist organisations and agricultural stakeholders.  At least since the 1992 reform of CAP, we have seen the struggle to merge agricultural production with environmental protection, which, unfortunately, sometimes leads to conflicting and contradictory interests.  Helping to promote common ground at EU and national levels could result in a more coherent policy.  The approval process for strategic plans needs to be transparent and as strong as possible, as this is essentially the only mechanism for ensuring that national priorities do not conflict with EU-wide objectives.  Maintaining the common aspect of the CAP is essential.  Furthermore, the proposals allow for only the Commission to approve strategic plans, but to improve accountability, that process could be based formally on widespread consultation and should involve input from the co-legislators and various stakeholders.  What happens if there is an impasse between national priorities and CAP objectives should be spelled out by the Commission.  As the Commission views the next CAP as a move towards evidence-based policy, which prioritises results over compliance, it is important the quality of data sources are to an appropriate standard and that national Governments have the technical capacity to construct and defend a strategic plan.  This might involve greater investment in technical assistance and upgrading of skills, which will be difficult if the current budget predictions are accurate.</p><p> The period for the next CAP is one of learning for the European Union as it experiments with this new delivery model.  It is important for all concerned that there is an awareness of the challenges facing the upcoming reform, which will be shaped by competing interests among stakeholders within a potentially reduced budget.  It is important to stress the crucial role of dialogue and consultation to ensure an efficient and coherent CAP.</p></speech>

I will present a joint perspective on behalf of myself and my colleague from Ulster University business school, Dr. Lynsey Hollywood.  We very much welcome the opportunity to discuss our perspective on the future and ongoing reform of the CAP.  It is entirely appropriate that such a collaborative and open approach is used because it is in this capacity as stakeholders that farmers and wider stakeholders have an important opinion in this area.</p> <p>  Our presentation will focus on four main priorities we believe that any ongoing CAP reform should include.  The first is to address the volatility or instability of our agricultural markets because we consider primary food production a special case.  The exceptionalism of food means that a political and social importance is attached to it, and it is entirely appropriate to give meaningful support to farmers in recognition of their contribution to this important primary production.  It is also important to consider the issue of cross-compliance, but without subsidising or supporting any lack of competitiveness or inefficiencies within agriculture.  It is also entirely appropriate that the support is directed towards farmers in less favourable farming areas.  Any income support or resilience payment should not be allowed to become a surrogate for income support, nor a means of indefinitely maintaining uneconomical farming units.  There should continue to be a focus on the full decoupling of primary production from income support, without any regression to coupling food production with any kind of payment.  This will allow any agrifood industry ultimately to become more responsive, which is an important future direction to be consumer orientated and market led.</p> <p>  The lack of collaboration in the farming community and, more widely, agrifood is an issue.  Government intervention could usefully foster greater collaboration, although that will need careful consideration through, for example, appropriate incentivisation.  A better understanding of market requirements would enable farmers to move from a production mentality to a more marketing mindset.  Any support could usefully be focused on support for know-how of marketing aspects.  Identifying that market need or niche in the market and how to differentiate one's product offering would help create diversification, support farmers in that mentality and allow us to look towards a strong, value-added market with strong export potential.  In the light of agricultural exceptionalism, some mechanism needs to be in place to ensure a secure, sustainable, healthy environment, and to prevent instability of the agricultural market, erratic food prices and market distortion.  It is important that any solution does not serve to increase food prices for the end consumer.</p> <p>  That brings me to the second priority, namely, food security, which covers the continuity of supply, health and food poverty.  The security of supply is especially important in the context of Europe and globally, given the increasing population and the need to feed more people and produce more food for more people.  The world's population is predicted to be 9 billion by 2050.  It would be appropriate for any ongoing and future reform of the CAP or agricultural framework to consider health, simply because of the relationship between food choice, nutrition and health.  These policies should usefully complement one another.  We need our industry to encourage production of food consistent with guidelines for healthy eating and for population nutrition.  That leaves us a space in food innovation to ensure we meet that market nee, although it cannot be at the expense of the twin objectives of productivity alongside environmental sustainability.  As for unnecessary costs being accrued to the consumer, paradoxically, those consumers who stand to benefit most from a healthy diet are those who can least afford it.  Consumers, therefore, must not be disadvantaged by a two-tier pricing policy or as a consequence of their reality.  They must be able to access, afford and avail of healthy food.</p> <p>  Our third priority is ensuring that food and farming are public goods, which we hinted at earlier in the context of environmental production.  We need to consider and continue the emphasis on the active management of land, which should be rewarded in a way that respects cross-compliance.  Farming is more than its principal purpose of primary production and, therefore, any payment schedule made to farmers must be conditional upon food safety, food quality, environmental and animal welfare, and occupational health and safety standards.  We need to consider the pivotal role that farming can play in preserving and enhancing the rural and natural environments, the importance of which we should not diminish.  Our farming counterparts are the custodians of our natural environment and it is important to respect the amenity value of the countryside.  Any future agricultural framework and policy should aim to preserve and enhance the amenity and recreational value of our land, and to reward landowners for conducting that public good on society's behalf.</p> <p>  Our final priority is the maintenance of the rural population and rural development.  Agriculture requires generational renewal of active farmers.  As we hinted at in the context of incentivisation, one might expect us, from a university perspective, to suggest that continuing professional development, short courses and educational attainment in this regard are also important.  Universities and the higher education sector have a role to play in providing access to increasing professional educational attainment in this area, and in allowing farmers to have that marketing mindset and the export potential to be exploited.  We welcome a multi-actor approach to science and innovation, involving support agencies and research institutions.</p> <p>  In conclusions, further reform of the CAP is to be welcomed.  We recommend that policy makers continue to pursue aggressively the decoupling of food production from payments to exploit that truly market-orientated, consumer-led approach and to allow for complementary agrifood and health policies in a way that is mutually supportive of people, the planet and profit.</p></speech>

I will comment on the sustainability of the Irish diet from the point of view of carbon footprint, its implications for policy, including policy from the point of view of the end user and the end of the food supply chain, and accounting for consumer food behaviour.  The contribution of food consumption towards climate change has received increasing attention in recent years, especially recently with the launch of the EAT-Lancet report.  In its present form, food consumption is responsible for as much as 30% of EU greenhouse gas emissions, GHGs.  Therefore, we need to look at food choices and food behaviour and see how we can alter them to influence health and the environment.</p> <p>  Are there any food choice behaviours that are sustainable as a diet and nutritionally acceptable?  Can the two areas meet?  The UN Food and Agriculture Organization defines sustainable diets as those "with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations.  Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy". </p> <p>The "economically fair" aspect of this is very important as the agriculture industry is the largest indigenous industry in Ireland.  GHGs associated with food production are measured in carbon equivalents to produce a carbon footprint for the food we consume.  In general, plant-based foods are low in GHG emissions, whereas foods from animal sources are higher, especially those from ruminant animals.  The European Commission has found that Ireland has one of the lowest carbon footprints of animal products in Europe because of the system we use to produce meat.  Foods from animal sources provide many essential nutrients necessary for good health and, therefore, are an important part of a healthy diet.  Certain nutrients can only be found in meat products and are not available in plant products.  Environmental and human health issues should be considered together to ensure socially and nutritionally optimal outcomes for both.</p> <p>  Research is ongoing in Teagasc, in conjunction with University College Cork, to examine the carbon footprint of the Irish diet and food consumption behaviours which result in a more or less sustainable and health diet.  The aim is to determine the quantity of GHG emissions associated with food consumption patterns in Irish adults and to determine what patterns of food consumption are associated with sustainability and health.  We use the best publicly available data to do the national adult nutrition survey funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine through its fair funding measure.  Each food consumed was converted into carbon equivalents and measured the carbon produced by consuming these foods, instead of looking at nutrients as is traditionally done.  It is no surprise that meat, in particular ruminant meat, made the highest contribution to carbon in the Irish diet as a result of the high conversion factor associated with meat and dairy, while plant sourced foods had the lowest CO2 in the diet.</p> <p>  It is important to eat a varied diet and not just one particular food group.  Consumers who followed a cultural pattern traditional to the Irish diet, with high meat, fruit and vegetable consumption, had the lowest CO2 footprint of all consumers, showing that meat plays a very important role in health and a sustainable diet.  We also found that food consumption and energy intake beyond our nutritional requirements contributed to the public health epidemic of obesity, as well as food waste.  Promoting a healthier diet and lifestyle, which reduces food consumption, also helps from an environmental perspective.  The findings from this research support the notion that any policy measures should be evidence based and should consider the prevailing cultural food consumption patterns of a population.  CAP reform, and any associated food policy instruments developed for sustainability reasons, should be holistic in nature and take other parameters such as health and nutrition into consideration, rather than concentrating on one food group.  It should reward more sustainable production and meet our consumer demands. </p></speech>

I welcome their engagement with younger citizens.  I am a second year European studies student in University College Cork.<br/><br/>As a young person growing up in rural Ireland, I have seen the importance of the agricultural industry and the difference the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, makes in Ireland.  One of the leading incentives behind Ireland&rsquo;s decision to apply for European Union membership was the opportunity of gaining support from the CAP.  When the CAP was introduced under the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the objectives were to improve and stabilise the incomes of those engaged in the farm sector, largely through market support mechanisms but with some activities oriented towards improving farming productivity and structural adjustments within the farm sector.  As the EU now discusses the future of the CAP post 2020, it is important to recall how beneficial this policy is and has been for Ireland.<br/><br/>One of the aspects of the CAP that has had the greatest impact on the lives of farmers across the EU has been the payment schemes.  Farmers are given money for maintaining their land and young farmers are given payments to encourage them to start farming.  They are given grants or loans to help start up and farmers can receive the green direct payments for reaching environment objectives.  The objective of the CAP is to give farmers and other agricultural workers a decent standard of living.  While the CAP is not always fairly divided among all recipients, it has still improved the income for thousands of farmers across Ireland and the EU.  The CAP&rsquo;s direct payment schemes help protect farmers from the uncertainty of the market.  At the moment, the CAP has a small farmers' scheme which is aimed at supporting smaller farmers in Europe.  However, this only operates in 15 EU countries and<i></i>Ireland is not among them.  This is unfortunate because if this policy was introduced in Ireland, it would aid many more in the agricultural industry.  Many Irish farmers are small farmers and the CAP currently does not have a big an impact on their lives.<br/><br/>The CAP encourages green, sustainable farming.  Part of the direct payment is given to farmers who strive for greener, more environment friendly agricultural production.  In theory, this should help Ireland improve its carbon footprint and reach its climate change objectives.  Farmers gain more by diversifying their crop and meeting environmental goals.  This is important for farmers as it gives them the opportunity to receive more from the CAP schemes while also encouraging them to be more environmentally conscious.  The CAP may be more known for its payments to farmers but it is also very focused on rural development and sustainability.  The CAP has helped many local, rural regions around Ireland.  Between 2007 and 2013, &euro;4.3 billion of funding was given to help agricultural production that would benefit rural areas.<br/><br/>The CAP also helps non-agricultural activities, such as small-scale manufacturing and food processing.  Such activities encourage businesses to set up in rural areas, focusing on the development of the local food sector.  This is important as it brings employment to rural regions and allows small, rural, agricultural communities to prosper and to use their large agricultural sector to develop compatible businesses.  When rural areas are developed, this development attracts more people to the area, offers more employment and can increase tourism.  The increase in employment is especially important as many farmers who operate small farms must get jobs outside the farm to supplement their household income.  This is made easier when the region around them is more developed, giving them a greater opportunity to find employment.  The development of these areas is vital to encourage people to stay and continue, or even start, farming in these rural areas.  The continuance of CAP ensures the development of Irish rural areas and gives further aid to the agricultural workers here.<br/><br/>The Agriculture and Fisheries Council will meet next week and I will follow its discussions about the future of the CAP post 2020 very closely.  At the most recent meeting in April, I was stuck by the emphasis by the Romanian Presidency on the environmental ambition of the CAP.  I agree that this is a major feature of CAP reform.  It will be advantageous not only to EU farmers but to every single EU citizen.  As a young citizen, I value sustainable development and want a green future for Ireland.  I know that Ministers have been discussing climate, biodiversity and water quality, to name just a few issues.  I hope to see a future in which we can enjoy sustainable food security and see an improvement in the environmental issues that exist today.</p></speech>

The CAP and CAP reform are a key part of our body of work at committee level and we have already made a number of submissions to Europe.</p><p>We attended several Council meetings around Europe, including in Croatia and Romania in recent months.  Members of the committee made a presentation at the European Parliament's agriculture committee approximately a year ago.  It is a priority matter for the committee and a significant issue for agriculture in Ireland, as all present are aware.  It is important that we keep engaging with this process.  Agriculture is our largest indigenous industry but it does not get its fair share of media coverage when it needs it.  It is great to have this opportunity to discuss the matter.  I am joined by some members of the committee and I would like to have engagement with them and the witnesses over the next ten or 15 minutes.  We will take a couple of questions together if that is acceptable to the witnesses.</p></speech>

Has research been conducted on what will happen in the advent of Brexit for the farmers in Northern Ireland in terms of their current income?  That question is for Mr. Bakker and Dr. Furey.  Does Dr. McCarthy know whether Teagasc has conducted research on our capacity to sustainably provide sufficient plant-based food for this country and some for export, in addition to a certain amount of meat production and land being used to plant forestry, in the case of increased demand for a plant-based diet?</p></speech>

Dr. Furey mentioned that we should move away from coupling and towards decoupling.  How can the vulnerable sectors be supported to ensure a sustainable future for them?  On suckler beef farmers, who are a key part of the industry in the west of Ireland, if that industry goes into decline, large parts of that region may be depopulated, which would have a significantly negative effect on rural Ireland.  How could the next CAP protect the vulnerable sectors of the agriculture industry?</p></speech>

We have a very busy schedule today and there is a significant amount of work relating to this meeting.  It is a momentous day and it is great to be able to record our participation in the European Union and celebrate Europe Day.</p> <p>  Agriculture accounts for a large part of our portfolio and work.  There has been a significant shift in recent years to larger dairy and crop farmers.  Similarly, larger dry stock farmers seem to be more prevalent.  The days of the part-time farmer who may have a second job and tend 40 acres or 50 acres may be numbered.  From the perspective of Dr. McCarthy and Teagasc, in ten or 15 years, will part-time farming be a thing of the past?  While canvassing for the local and European elections, as all politicians have been doing, I noted the number of unoccupied smaller farm holdings which are being subsumed by larger farmholders.  Does Dr. McCarthy anticipate a massive change in our model of farming?  That seems to have happened in recent years.</p></speech>

From which countries are these products coming?  The products at which I have looked are not produced in Ireland.  I am specifically referring to plant-based protein foods for human consumption.  Is there a desire or ability to grow them in Ireland?  I know there are issues around soya beans in that regard.  I understand that many types of beans come from the tropics and are more suited to such climates, which obviously means there is a carbon footprint involved in bringing them here.  In many parts of the tropics, people do not have enough food or their diet is not as good as it should be.  I direct my questions particularly at Dr. McCarthy.</p></speech>

Parliamentary questions to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine are being heard in the D&aacute;il and the spokespersons of the main parties are tied up there.  I offer their apologies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1035" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sin&eacute;ad McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019050900002#E00900"><p>I will roll two responses into one.  On the issue of from where plant-based foods are coming and whether there is a way to combine animal and plant-based production in Ireland, certain climates and agricultural environments lend themselves better to certain types of food production.  For example, producing meat and dairy in Ireland is very suited to our climate as we get a lot of rain and do not solely rely on the water supply for agriculture.  Many of our animals are grass fed for more than 300 days per year and when they are kept in during the winter months they are fed from silage.  Very little animal feed is given to them.</p> <p>  On beef production, meat and dairy very efficiently convert food such as grass that humans cannot consume to protein which they can.  If we were to change that production type to more plant-based production, it might not be as successful because the land that we currently use for producing meat and dairy is not necessarily suitable for plant production.  There is also an issue in terms of the amount of carbon that is kept as a sink in the ground or soil and which would be released if the land was ploughed to plant alternative food sources.</p> <p>  My answer to Deputy Corcoran-Kennedy's question is yes and no.  There is a possibility to produce both but we need to be careful regarding the land we choose to use differently.  It would not necessarily result in a lower carbon footprint.  Some research indicates that as a result of the higher inputs of fertiliser and so on that are required to produce plant-based crops, there may be, at best, a 10% to 12% reduction in carbon footprint.  It is not a direct swap of one for the other as there are other challenges in changing farming practices and the resultant dietary CO2.</p> <p>  Many plant-based proteins such as beans and legumes are imported and have many associated food miles.  It is not always possible to recommend a plant-based diet to certain vulnerable groups in the community.  For example, older adults naturally consume less food but need a higher protein intake.  The best source of protein for older consumers to maintain muscle mass and prevent falls and frailty is animal protein.  They would need to eat four to five times the amount of lentils or beans to get the same amount of protein and it would not be possible for them to eat that much food.  There is a role for both plant and animal protein in diet and it is about getting the balance right in terms of achieving concordant measures of health and sustainability.  One must not focus solely on the carbon footprint of the diet without taking account of the nutrition and health outcomes.</p></speech>

Ulster University is not actively involved in farming research but we are most certainly involved in more general research on food poverty and food insecurity.  If it satisfies members, I will speak more generally on that point.  It is anticipated that Brexit will create an additional cost of &pound;25 per week on the average household's food bill.  For citizens who are already squeezed, impoverished or vulnerable, this will create an additional burden and we are worried about that.  Ulster University is very active in the food poverty research agenda.  We are developing an at-risk of food poverty index that will consider low income and rurality in identifying where such consumers are located to enable more targeted interventions.</p> <p>  More specifically, there area also concerns regarding rural dwellers and agricultural smallholders.  Given that the average age of smallholders in Northern Ireland and Great Britain is approximately 60 years, we are concerned about generational renewal and the need for young farmers.  It was for this reason that we addressed the point of diversification and the need to add value.  We will be actively involved in the food innovation effort to try to complement agriculture, food availability and health.  We need to be concerned about the departure of farmers from farming because it has become unprofitable.</p> <p>  There is an opportunity to educate and engage with consumers on the more general point of the importance of eating locally and seasonally so that we can celebrate our local and indigenous foods.  We must showcase indigenous produce so that we are not reliant on alternative protein sources from other countries.</p> <p>  We are working with policymakers in Northern Ireland in a collaborative effort on agrifood and food policy generally.  Brexit has caused concerns about food affordability and availability and the possibility that access to a fresh and varied diet may become more problematic for Northern Ireland consumers.</p></speech>

The raw materials may move from the North to the South to be processed, return to the North to be packaged and, finally, be sold in the South.  It is great that the common travel area is secure but much more could be done in terms of regulatory alignment between the market in the North and the South to minimise disruption to goods moving across the Border.  If the Assembly in the North gets up and running, the North-South Ministerial Council would be a good forum to promote more alignment on agrifood and minimise disruption.</p></speech>

As members will probably expect me to say, I believe a joint collaborative effort by university and other research and educational institutions could be useful in providing such an incentivisation.  This would not necessarily have to be economic.  One way forward could be to subsidise educational attainment efforts or repurpose farmers, as it were, to enable them to move into more diverse food processing areas.</p></speech>

When one considers the food supply chain from a carbon footprint perspective, between 80% and 85% of the carbon footprint is generated before the food leaves the farmyard.  It is very important that we put measures in place from a sustainability perspective to reduce the carbon footprint of food as it is being produced and support smaller farmers to produce food more sustainably.  Farming should not be only large-scale and intensive.  CAP could address this by implementing more sustainable practices at farm level.  A great deal of research has been done in Europe.  I am involved in a circular agricultural economics research project in the European Union, which has 20 partners across Europe.  We are looking at more sustainable farming practices and how acceptable they would be to consumers at the end of the food chain.  We need to develop a more circular economy and maintain better sustainability at farm level.  This would help to maintain smaller farms and keep European farmers in the farming industry.</p></speech>

When I was asked to speak about the European common security and defence policy on the occasion of Europe Day the first topic to come to mind was the role of Irish neutrality.  The debate is probably as old as the country itself but has surely not lost its intensity since then.  I finally decided to address the issue because recent developments in the area of European common and security policy make neutrality very topical again.  I draw attention to a couple of developments that place neutrality back on the agenda and demand urgent discussion of its meaning and implications.</p> <p>  The first of these is Brexit.</p><p>The loss of the major Atlanticist power within the European Union has serious consequences for the further development of the European Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP.  Having always tried to prevent or at least slow down integration in this policy field, the United Kingdom has been a kind of natural ally to Ireland in trying to keep security issues out of European integration.  The consequences of this development are already visible.  Not long after the Brexit vote, the President of the EU Commission, the French President and later the German Chancellor were calling for the creation of an EU army.  Although for the time being this is not much more than a blurry vision, it became obvious where integration in the European Common Security and Defence Policy field is heading.<br/><br/>Already in 2018 permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, was launched, marking a huge step in integrating security and defence co-operation towards a military alliance.  Causing a lively discussion in Ireland, its participation was finally backed by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, denying a conflict between Irish neutrality and participation in PESCO.  Of all the other neutral member states of the EU only Malta opted out, choosing to first observe if PESCO and neutrality are compatible.  Especially in Finland and Sweden, former neutral states, a consensus has been reached to the effect that EU membership in general is not logically compatible with the traditional notion of neutrality.  In practice these EU member states have thus given up their neutrality to a large extent.  In Ireland, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a Bill to enshrine Irish neutrality in the Constitution.  After a lively debate, in which European politicians were even called warmongers, the Bill was eventually rejected in the D&aacute;il.<br/><br/>Finally, I draw members' attention to a poll by Red C for the European Movement Ireland, published just last week.  Apart from an overwhelming support for EU membership in general, the poll revealed that a majority of 58% of the Irish people think that Ireland should be part of intensified EU security and defence co-operation and that PESCO does not pose a threat to Irish neutrality.  Approval is even stronger amongst young Irish people.<br/><br/>For me as a German citizen, the whole discussion about neutrality is new.  Despite the <i>tabula rasa </i>after the Second World War, Germany did not have the chance to have its own discussion about this, having to align itself to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, in the face of an expansionist Soviet Union.  While living in Ireland for one year and studying at University College Dublin it is very interesting to follow the public debate about neutrality and discuss it with my Irish and non-Irish fellow students.  This brings insights into this very politicised topic and the fact that Irish neutrality is loaded with different meanings and historical resonances.  Various narratives are contesting the nature of Irish foreign and security policy and its expression in Europe's contemporary security architecture.  While there seems to be a broad consensus that Ireland can and should make a contribution to global peace and security, this is not the case for the question as to which institutional framework should be used to achieve this.<br/><br/>Due to the aforementioned recent developments, however, Ireland seems to be forced to take a decision.  The departure of the major damper of integration in the area of foreign and security policy and the concomitant developments, such as PESCO and discussions of an EU army, make it an urgent topic.  For Ireland's European partners, and therefore also for me in this case, it is essential to know where Ireland is coming from in order to fully understand the significance and the implications of neutrality for Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1055" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cornelia-Adriana Baciu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019050900002#G00200"><p>My name is Ms Cornelia-Adriana Baciu.  I am studying at the School of Law and Government at Dublin City University.  Today I will address four key challenges facing the Common Security and Defence Policy.  The first is related to strategic coherence and internal cohesion.  In the counterfactual scenario in which the EU is not able to manage internal cracks such as the rise of nationalism, so-called <i>souvereignism</i>or major differences in member states' strategic cultures, future risks and challenges to CSDP might be endogenous.  A failure to co-ordinate efforts on the CSDP might draw Europe back to the US.  Some researchers argue it might return the European security landscape to the 1950s.  The EU will thus need to find innovative ways to solve the crises of sovereignty of borders and of defence.  What Europe wants is not easy to operationalise because of increasing polarisation or even fragmentation of European integration.<br/><br/>The CSDP is a domain in which some argue differentiated integration might work better.  This is because states' national strategies are driven by different threat perceptions, strategic environments, capabilities and strategic interests.  My research suggests that differentiated integration in the form of a role-player model in the CSDP could enhance strategic knowledge production and capability development.  Security and defence collaborative regimes such as the CSDP can have an empowering effect on member states.  However, an unintended consequence of the role-player model could be a &quot;Europe <i>&agrave; la carte</i>&quot; in which members would only support the policies in which they see a benefit for their own national interests.<br/><br/>I will now refer to Brexit.  The anticipated withdrawal of the UK from the European Union is forecasted to strain the CSDP budget.  In 2018 the UK accounted for approximately 16% of the CSDP budget.  To compensate for this an increase in member states' investments in security and defence can be expected.  A series of peace and defence co-operation mechanisms were adopted after Brexit.  The major examples are PESCO, the European Defence Fund, EDF, the co-ordinated annual review on defence, CARD, the European peace facility and the European intervention initiative.  For the new instruments to be effective it is important for the EU to manage member states' expectations and ensure they will enable the achievement of strategic objectives.<br/><br/>I will now address the external strategic environment and external sources of instability.  A particular tendency in US leadership and what some have termed a US strategy underpinned by a logic of &quot;retreat&quot; and &quot;systemic competition&quot; with China have pushed the EU to think more seriously about the scenario of US abandonment.  Some researchers argue that strategic autonomy would allow the EU to gain an element of independence from US decision-making and pursue an agenda of international peace and security based on its own normative vision with mediation, diplomacy, trade co-operation, peace missions and global justice at its core.  Some argue that the road to strategic autonomy might lie in a merger between the CSDP and NATO, that is, the Europeanisation of NATO.  Multipolarity and great power competition represent another challenge with implications for the CSDP.  In the future, the EU is expected to aim at having good relationships with all countries and avoid a return to bipolarity.  This is because a bipolar logic might push countries to choose and some of them might choose China for economic reasons.<br/><br/>My last point is related to new security technologies.  Future and emerging technologies such as autonomous robotics and artificial intelligence can have a disruptive and transformative impact in the security and defence domain.  If the EU invests sufficiently in research and development, it might be in a position to harness the benefits of new security technologies.  New funding of transnational and interdisciplinary research, under the European Defence Fund <i>inter alia </i>, will have the potential to address capability shortcomings and technological and industrial weaknesses to a certain extent.  The EU could establish a new area of competence in dual-use technology, that is, technologies which can be attributed to both civilian and military purposes.</p></speech>

On this day it is particularly important to recall why the EU was initially established; to end frequent and bloody wars between neighbours and to unite European countries both economically and politically to secure lasting peace across the Continent.  We can largely say that this has been successful.  At the moment, however, huge challenges are ahead for the EU in the area of common security and defence.  As is true for most of the challenges the EU faces, Brexit crops up in this area.  The greatest challenge is the development of a common policy on security and defence that includes a cohesive development of policies with third countries in future missions, especially the UK once it leaves.  This policy must simultaneously protect the integrity of the European Union and the sovereignty of member states.  It is very important that there is a balance between these three concerns.  The greatest challenge lies in finding this balance.</p> <p>  Different visions of the CSDP proposed by the initial "big three" member states, Germany, the UK and France, have long created space for smaller member states like Ireland to avoid hard choices concerning issues of security and defence.  A more cohesive EU in the post-Brexit future presents significant challenges for all states that have long thrived in the murky waters of strategic ambiguity.</p><p>Indeed, it could be argued that the United Kingdom leaving removes a significant stumbling block for European defence co-operation.  British scepticism has previously allowed others such as Denmark and central European states to avoid hard questions on tensions between formal military non-alignment and the realities of being part of a deeply integrated organisation because NATO has long provided what they have seen to be the primary security provider in the European theatre. </p><p> The UK&rsquo;s absence from future Common Security and Defence Policy debates after Brexit will likely push these states into the limelight in terms of blocking or opting out from security co-operation.  Our greatest challenge is how we deal with this.  While the EU must grapple with the loss of its transatlantic alliance partner, it is imperative that it now attempts to balance a bilateral agreement on Common Security and Defence Policy with the UK that also complements a type of unified EU approach to issues of security and defence, encompassing the considerations of small states, such as Ireland, and big states such as France and Germany.</p><p> That is not to say that the EU has not taken any steps thus far.  If we look at the decision taken by the High Representative, Ms Mogherini, to forge ahead with the publication of the EU&rsquo;s new global strategy in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum in June 2016, it is apparent that some attempts have been made by the EU to push ahead with CSDP.  Although faced with something of an existential crisis, the EU found a response in building a security architecture to reinvigorate EU institutions and to reunite the remaining 27 member states.  This provided a common ground for co-operation without reopening a Pandora&rsquo;s box of institutional reform that would be required to deal with more traditional areas of European co-operation such as market regulation.  </p><p> The Common Security and Defence Policy may not have always been high on Ireland&rsquo;s agenda but the aftermath of the Brexit vote has been particularly challenging for us all.  We now must strongly reconsider our own security and defence policy, in addition to that of our position in the wider EU CSDP.  Brexit has uncovered a number of political and constitutional fault lines, none more serious than its potential impacts on the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government deserves credit for the way in which it has managed the Brexit negotiations to date, particularly in securing support from our European partners concerning Ireland&rsquo;s position on the Border.  However, what price will we pay for this in future negotiations on matters such as common security and defence?  </p><p> The reduced room for manoeuvre on common security and defence for small states, such as ourselves, in an EU that will be more dominated by France and Germany than before, must be taken into account.  In a Franco-German EU, the space for constructive ambiguity is likely to be greatly reduced.  Ireland&rsquo;s hesitancy and ambivalence on this matter may no longer be sustainable.  Irish attitudes to European security and defence might best be characterised by paraphrasing Winston Churchill, in that Ireland is with common security and defence policy, but not of it.  We are linked, but not compromised.  We are interested and associated, but not absorbed.  It is perhaps time that we do become absorbed in greater co-operation with the EU on issues of common security and defence that extend beyond PESCO, as others here have noted, as we lose the shelter of the UK in future debates.  </p><p> The threats of a no-deal Brexit and the medium to longer-term security threats posed by any kind of withdrawal have yet to be provided for.  Both the Irish State and the EU as a whole faces profound challenges in this regard and are there, as of yet, no signs that neither it nor the EU is prepared to address them. </p></speech>

I compliment all the witnesses who I have heard so far this morning on the quality and depth of their submissions and the knowledge and research that went into them.  They are all to be complimented on the even-handed and balanced way in which  they went about their business.</p><p>I raise a question about the Common Security and Defence Policy.  It is an issue which has been with us for a very long time.  Over time, different emphases occur.  It is important to note that we are a neutral country.  There is nothing incompatible between our neutrality and our membership of the European Union or certain associations in the peacekeeping and defence areas.  In the past, we have excelled in peacekeeping and have shown ourselves to be international leaders in that area.  We have a useful influence and role to play in the European context.  I note modern terrorism has no boundaries and can reach far into neutral countries, peacekeeping countries and so on.  Do the witnesses see a space in which Ireland might be expected to defend itself in such a situation?</p><p>I refer to the question of whether something in this area will be attached to the discussion on Brexit and if a <i>quid pro quo </i>be sought.  I do not think that will be the case.  We are very strong members of the European Union with a strong commitment to its ideals which have existed from the beginning and get stronger over time.  It is not likely that we would be expected to concede one for another in this context.  I think that because the European Union must prevail.  If it does not and it fragments, going in different directions, and if demands are made within itself, of itself, by itself or by single member states, then there is a grave danger that the European Union will cease to be.  If that happens there will be great political, military and economic implications for the entire Continent of Europe and outside.  I do not need to tell our witnesses this; they are experts on this area, but the question arises as to whether we want to go back to where we were.  Some member states refer to the good old days, which presumably was the first half of the 20th century.  My question to young people is whether they want to go back to those much referred to good old days, when almost 70 million people died in the conflict which followed when Europe turned upon itself.  All these things relate to military matters and peace.  We should remember that the EU was the single most important peace agreement that the world has ever known.  For all those years we have been peaceful.  There can come times of turbulence occasionally and in times of economic difficulty, someone is always sought to blame.  I encourage our guests to focus on the alternatives, because they are not good, and they can proceed to work in an equitable manner, to be fair to all people including refugees from outside.  As we know, some of the people of Europe were themselves refugees in the not too-distant past.</p></speech>

This is very timely.  There are debates at the moment relating to plans for an EU army.  It is clear from this morning's contributions that despite the denials from some on the political right that an advanced conversation on this is taking place.  The contributions here have been challenging.  While I acknowledge the poll undertaken by the European Movement, which would be very much in favour of changing our policy, we should recall that a Red C poll last year also showed tremendous support in Ireland for Irish neutrality.  I ask if Irish people would really support what PESCO is doing off the coast of Libya, for example, if they knew.</p><p>If they followed the reports of Sally Hayden, the Irish journalist, she has highlighted EU support, including Irish financial support, for funding death camps in Libya.  That funding was confirmed to me by the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, just a few weeks ago in the Seanad.  These are camps in which people are tortured, raped, mutilated and killed.  This is the reality of PESCO as it operates right now.  One does not have to take my word for it.  Sally Hayden has documented and continues to document it in an effort to bring attention to the realities, unfortunately, of what PESCO is doing.  Do we think the Irish people would support funding of &euro;13 billion in research subsidies for the defence industries of Europe as set out in the next financial plan for Europe?  That is a reality of PESCO.  The final question I ask is as follows.  Surely, the best people to decide our future neutrality are the people of Ireland.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in was right to pursue the Bill.  As democrats, the best way forward in this debate is to support that call for a referendum.  Let us have a full debate on the future of Irish neutrality.  I thank the witnesses for their thoughtful contributions today.</p></speech>

I am delighted to welcome the witnesses and thank them for their contributions.  We are at an important crossroads in Europe.  Certainly, I have concerns about some activities taking place under the flag of and with the financial support of the European Union.  We need to be more awake, engaged and vocal and to scrutinise more deeply legislation that comes before us on PESCO and other situations.  Europe as a project must be preserved.  We must work at that and learn from it.  A recent report I intend to raise on Leaders' Questions today is on the future of farming in Europe.  It states that 1,000 farmers and farm families are leaving farming every week right across the EU.  That is leading to the degeneration, neglect and slippage of rural Ireland at a time when we are talking about rolling broadband out to rural areas.  If we do not maintain sustainable farm families in rural Ireland, North and South, and across Europe, it will lead to more factory farms and large conglomerates buying up land, which is not good.  In my own county of Tipperary, we have an equine company purchasing every square perch of land that becomes available.  It has amassed almost 28,000 acres.  While it provides employment and has great prowess in the equine industry, it is disgraceful that we do not have a land commission or other land agency to monitor and curtail what is happening.  The family farm is the lifeblood of Ireland.  In the two previous recessions to the one we have just come out of, it was agriculture that led us back to growth with, I might add, the support of the EU.  People were always there on family farms and working the land in parishes and communities nationally.  Every euro that goes into agriculture is spent locally.  Farm families support schools, sports clubs, the tourism industry and everything else.  It is therefore timely to have this discussion.  I thank our visitors for attending today.  It is my first time speaking in this new Chamber.  I am delighted.  It is an honour to be here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1063" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019050900002#J00300"><p>I thank all those who have contributed.  The situation around security events is not a stark one.  It is more the case that there are real choices and priorities to address.  It is true that Europe came out of a project of peace.  The wonderful thing about Europe was that after literally thousands of years of conflict, countries which had experienced in some cases hundreds of years of war against each other decided to come together to determine how to live together more peacefully and constructively.  That is absolutely true.  However, while there is an incredible legacy of peace in the European project, being European and being part of the European project means thinking about that constant question of how we live together.  It is about being critically present and asking critical questions, as the witnesses have.  That is part of being pro-European.  It is about caring enough about Europe to care about the decisions it makes.</p> <p>  There are very important decisions being made and there are priorities and concerns.  It was a decision for Ireland to opt into PESCO.  Ireland was not required to opt in, rather it chose to do so.  PESCO moved us further away by involving us, for example, in joint purchases of military equipment.  Ireland has an incredibly strong tradition of peace and neutrality and of leading disarmament.  One of the most moving things I have ever been involved with was the global ban on cluster bombs, which are basically like landmines.  The global ban was negotiated here in Ireland because Ireland was free from some of the military-industrial pressures experienced by other countries and was able to lead the way.  It is not a choice between Ireland and our neutrality and Europe.  It is about Ireland being a voice for peace, neutrality and disarmament within Europe.  That is a key point.  It is a service we provide.  It was Eamon Gilmore, a former Irish parliamentarian, who represented the European Commission in Colombia to negotiate the peace deal.  That is because Ireland's neutrality allowed us to have that strong voice.</p> <p>  We cannot turn a blind eye to militarisation.  It is a disservice to Ireland and Europe if we do.  It was very concerning that, just two weeks ago, the European Parliament voted against having oversight of the &euro;13 billion European Defence Fund.  That is the European Parliament choosing not to scrutinise what that fund is spent on.  Will it be on autonomous weapons?  How does it relate to UN mandates?  We must question constantly.  When we have global challenges for Europe and the world like climate change, which we will discuss later, we must ask whether we should be spending &euro;13 billion on European defence.  I do not think so.  Peace and security are put together.  Peace is work.  We know that from the Good Friday Agreement.  The work of peace is about investment in community building, understanding and social exchange.  If we spent some of that &euro;13 billion to build understanding between communities, not just here in Ireland but across the Balkan states which have come out of an experience of war as recently as the 1990s, that would deliver far more than to ramp up military spending on our borders and invest huge amounts in Frontex.  As was mentioned, it is a real concern to see these immigration control deals whereby we are funding border police and military actions in places like Sudan and Libya.  Those are things we need to look to.  These are very important choices.</p> <p>  It is important to note that the current Commission is an outgoing one.  We will have a new European Commission soon and it needs to hear from the witnesses about their priorities.  Among the priorities the outgoing Juncker Commission has brought to today's European Council meeting on the future of Europe, what it calls "protective Europe" is number one.  That means a European defence union.  We must be very clear that there are high-level people in Europe who want a European army.  However, that is not the same thing as saying Europe wants a European army.  There are also brilliant parliamentarians and passionate Europeans from every member state of the EU 27 who want to work together on peace.  That is the narrative we can push and strengthen.  I would love to hear in response what the witnesses think the work of peace should be.  It is not just about saying we do not want militarisation.  What is the work of peace?  That is the work from Good Friday and the work we have seen across the world.  How does Ireland lead the work of peace within Europe to make Europe a champion on human rights and peace?  It is a real choice.  We cannot do that while also spending &euro;13 billion on a European Defence Fund which we do not scrutinise.  We must all challenge these issues because we want Europe to live up to its brilliant and historic past and to shape a better future.  The following point is very important.  In the initial PESCO agreement, the words "peace" and "peacekeeping" were not even used once.  We need something that is not the PESCO agreement but which is rather a European mandate on peace work.  That should be the centrepiece of Europe's next five-year strategy.  I would love to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that work of peace.</p></speech>

On defending ourselves, territorial defence is mandated to NATO.  One of the issues on the agenda for discussion is to what extent EU member states should start thinking more seriously about gaining an element of strategic autonomy and independence from US decision-making.  Territorial defence, leadership and nuclear weapons are some of the points linked with this debate, but many states have been silent on this particular aspect.  There is also the scenario of the US abandonment, which I addressed in my opening statement.  The United States has withdrawn from several multilateral or bilateral agreements.  The US foreign policy narrative might in the future be linked with developments in the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea.  In the case of US inability to provide security guarantees in Europe, the EU should have a plan B and give serious consideration to the territorial defence aspect.</p> <p>  From a rational choice perspective, into the future, the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, for member states will be, probably, a trade-off between utility and strategic choice.  It is important to emphasise that security is a prerequisite and will remain a prerequisite for the other benefits of EU membership, including economic and political benefits.  It is a precondition of other benefits as well.  The major challenges to CSDP in the future will probably be linked to member states' commitment and the robustness of CSDP institutions.  I mentioned the new strategic instruments that are likely to generate new assets and perhaps increase the value of defence co-operation in Europe.</p> <p>  In regard to Irish neutrality, last year I wrote an article on security, multilateralism and Irish neutrality based on debates in the Irish Parliament from 1998 to 2018, which is available online.  One of my key findings was that the concept of Irish neutrality is multifaceted.  I found different concepts associated with it, including positive neutrality, negative neutrality, total neutrality and so on.  Every time there is a debate in Brussels related to security implications, there are intensive debates in the Irish Parliament on the implications for Irish neutrality.  There is informed decision-making on a case-by-case basis.  Surprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, Irish neutrality was found to be strongly linked with UN peacekeeping and stabilisation missions.  From this we could infer that there is a compatibility between the Irish foreign policy and EU foreign policy narrative.  The EU global strategy has been focused on peace and stabilisation missions in fragile states.  Recent statistics show an increase in the support of Irish people for the CSDP.  One explanation for this might be that the Common Security and Defence Policy works at intergovernmental level and it is likely to remain so into the future.  Security might be an area in which intergovernmental co-operation is more effective.  Sovereignty is not transferred at supranational level.  Any change in this regard will require a change in the EU treaty.</p> <p>  On the value added of PESCO, for Ireland the value added is that the capabilities developed under PESCO remain in the possession of member states.  For Ireland this means that capabilities developed under PESCO can be utilised in UN peacekeeping missions and other missions.  As far as I am aware, Ireland has been active in providing personnel and staff to EU and international civilian and military missions since it joined the European Union in 1973.  As of December 2018, there were approximately 650 Irish personnel deployed to such missions.</p> <p>  On Brexit, much of my research recently has been focused on the implications of Brexit.  I recently co-authored a book with my supervisor, Professor John Doyle from DCU, on this subject.  Brexit will transform relationships between the UK and the EU from multilateral to bilateral.  This will have implications for the European Union evolutionary stable equilibrium.  The EU will need to find a way to address this equilibrium to remain stable over time and to be able to cope with so-called atypical sequences or shocks, of which Brexit could be one.  The literature argues that continual change is the prerequisite to remain relevant and competitive.  The implication or consequence of this would be geopolitical adaptation of the EU.  This will have further implications for future transatlantic relations, the EU global strategy and international security as a collective good.</p> <p>  It was mentioned earlier that peace is work.  Modern peace is based on anticipation, resilience and integration of aspects of daily life.  One could imagine modern peace at the intersection of three epistemological debates, international - liberal values; national - nationalist sometimes as a destructive force; and, everyday life level - daily interactions and power relations between people.  We have to see all three sides as knowledge production sides.  Knowledge is very important for concepts such as peace, order, justice, security and so on.  This is, perhaps, a matter we should further address in our research.</p></speech>

Cultural values were disregarded.  Questions were posed in regard to neutrality, PESCO and peace.</p><p>If we look at the culture of all European states, it comprises the cultures of 28 different states, soon to be 27.  These have very different cultural values.  After 70 years of this project, it is time to introduce new ways of looking at things.  It is not always driven by politics and economics, although we are in a political chamber.  It is very important that we look towards cultures.  I am sure most Irish people would not be impressed to hear that we are supporting PESCO.  Claims were made that money we pay into the European budget for defence goes to camps in Libya and so on.  That is not what we anticipated our tax money would be used for.  There are also cultures within Europe that really promote a strong, hard-line defence policy, which we do not.  We are more focused on peacekeeping and neutrality.  There needs to be a balance in how we look at cultures and cultural values.  Only in that way can we address all of the issues that have been brought up.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be here this morning to chair what is a very important session.  I thank all the witnesses for coming before us for what has been a very informative engagement.  I am Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.  This committee was set up to consider the Citizens' Assembly report.  We published a cross-party report on 16 April, which I believe is the beginning of a new era for policy direction with regard to how the State deals with climate change.  As the witnesses will know, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is working on an all-of-Government action plan with regard to rolling out these policy changes, which will be critical for this and future generations.  I will not delay because I know the clock is ticking and my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, is waiting to step in to chair the next session.</p> <p>  Our first speaker is Mr. P&aacute;draig Flattery from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.  We also have Mr. Axel Leahy from the National University of Ireland, Galway, Ms Louise Fitzgerald from University College Dublin, Mr. Connor McGookin from University College Cork, and Ms Caroline Moran from Dublin City University.</p></speech>

I am a PhD student in the ICARUS climate research unit at the Maynooth University department of geography.  My work is a drop in the ocean of climate change research being undertaken around the world every day, all of which bolsters the consensus that climate change is happening, that it is urgent, and that human activities are responsible.<br/><br/>I have been asked to speak today on the topic of climate action and sustainable development.  When I first read the title of this topic, I immediately thought of speeches made by the young Swedish climate activist, Greta Thunberg, who has helped mobilise a generation against the actions of their governments by holding weekly school strikes.  At her recent speeches to the World Economic Forum and the United Nations she told the delegates, &quot;I want you to panic&quot;.  In the brief time I have I will try to explain the scientific basis behind why she wants people to panic, and how climate action and sustainable development must be embraced to create a sustainable future for the next generations.<br/><br/>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, states that we must keep global warming to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change.  Warming of more than 1.5&deg;C increases the likelihood of climate tipping points being triggered.  These tipping points are thresholds that, if exceeded, can fundamentally alter the state of the climate system.  To provide members with an example, one possible consequence of warming above 1.5&deg;C is the thawing of permafrost in the Arctic, a process which is already under way and which releases vast amounts of methane, which is more than 25 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2</sub>, which will result in significant irreversible warming and is likely to trigger the collapse of other systems, including the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.  This ice sheet is already melting more and more each year.  If temperatures increase and the ice sheet reaches a point where it will melt entirely, we will be committed as a planet to a sea level rise of 6 m.  If we allow this to happen, there will be unimaginable global consequences which pose a genuine existential threat to humanity.<br/><br/>When people hear climate scientists speaking about these changes in the Arctic and Greenland, they wonder how it relates to us here in Ireland, but these sea level changes will be felt on a local as well as a global scale and our coastal cities will be threatened.  If we do not take action to prevent this happening, it will not matter which country did not meet its targets or which national interest was prioritised.  We have already warmed by around 1&deg;C, and will reach 1.5&deg;C warming somewhere between 2030 and 2052, meaning we have a decade to make radical changes to our economy and way of life.<br/><br/>The reality is clear.  As members of the EU we are committed to reducing our emissions by 40% compared with 1990 levels by the year 2030, just 11 years from now.  The EU has set the goal of an 80% to 95% reduction in emissions by 2050.  Current Irish policies are not aligned with our goals.  While the EU as a whole will achieve its 2020 emissions target, Ireland will significantly overshoot ours.  This sets us up to fail at achieving our future targets, and the longer we wait, the more difficult it becomes.  We need to encourage sustainable development and ensure all members of society can reduce their carbon footprints by decarbonising public transportation, energy generation and agriculture to give everyone the opportunity to make the right choices regarding their emissions.  While grants for new electric cars are encouraging, how many people can realistically avail of them? The importance of a holistic approach to adaptation is emphasised by a 2018 statement from the IPCC:</p> <blockquote> 	If poorly designed or implemented, adaptation projects in a range of sectors can increase greenhouse gas emissions and water use, increase gender and social inequality, undermine health conditions, and encroach on natural ecosystems [...] These trade-offs can be reduced by adaptations that include attention to poverty and sustainable development  </blockquote> <p>The joint committee&rsquo;s report on climate change and cross-party action echoes this sentiment in its call for a just transition to a green economy. <br/><br/>We need to safeguard the lives of all our future citizens.  We are the first generation to feel the effects of climate change and the last generation who will be able to do anything about it.  Individuals can and do take action, but the onus is on politicians to find solutions, create dialogue, and work towards our common goal of creating a better world for us all.  Sustainable development is not only possible, it is essential if Ireland is to maintain our green reputation on the world stage.  As shown by the committee&rsquo;s recent report, the transition to a green economy is an opportunity for economic growth and job creation in rural and urban Ireland, and ought to be embraced for the benefits it will bring.  The recommendations of the report are far-reaching and inspiring and must be implemented urgently.  They range from citizen-scale efforts to retrofit homes to renewable energy generation to a national push for offshore wind generation and decarbonisation of our economy.<br/><br/>As a direct result of protests by the Extinction Rebellion group, the UK declared a national climate change emergency just last week.  This was closely followed by Wicklow County Council which announced a climate and biodiversity emergency last week.  This shows us that there is hope, but time is running out.</p></speech>

I know members will fully understand my French accent, so it will not disturb them too much.  Climate change is urging us to take actions and to change our way of life radically.  Such actions and policies will require unprecedented levels of collaborative decision-making between all actors in society, including the public.  Yet, voices of local communities are still, in 2019, facing brick walls.  As European citizens, we need to be given the opportunity to participate actively and to have a real input on decisions that have effects on our daily life.</p> <p>  We know the positive effects that public participation can have.  We know, for instance, that local communities can substantially enhance the quality of decisions with locally grounded and value-based knowledge.  We should not see decisions tailored to reduce our vulnerability to climate change as purely technical.  This is not to say that experts should not contribute - their role is crucial - but common technical approaches to decision-making, such as cost-benefit analyses, cannot be the sole remedy to our problems.  Often, the real value of assets and landscapes can hardly be monetised and summarised into graphics, as they will have a deeper value and a deeper meaning to local communities.  Moreover, we should not forget that local communities are situated at the forefront of climate change, being the first to experience damage from storms, flooding, erosion or biodiversity losses.  Why should they then be kept silent?  Public participation is, after all, a democratic right.</p> <p>  The problem is that today's conventional forms of public participation do not work.  First, uploading a document on a website and then asking people to submit comments or suggestions does not guarantee that these submissions will have any effect on the decision.</p><p>Second, and most important, these forms of engagement do not resonate with most people.  Do Members of the Oireachtas believe that people of my age regularly check the websites of their local authorities?  This is the core of the problem.  There is a gap between our decision makers and the public.  This criticism demands that new mediums of participation need to be established in Ireland.  The Citizens' Assembly is a fantastic example that we can build on, but it cannot be limited to that.  Most decisions that affect our everyday lives take place in our communities at a local level.  Should every local authority have its owns citizens' assembly?  Why not?  There are countless examples of successful forms of active participation.  Citizen panels, citizen juries, citizen advisory committees, participatory budgeting, participatory planning, participatory mapping, e-participation and citizen science are forms of active public participation that have proven to be successful around the world.  Why should we limit those examples as isolated case studies rather than trying to make them the common practice?<br/><br/>The ball is in the court of those who represent us.  As we saw recently with the school strikes for climate, many people, especially those from the younger generation, are willing to engage in climate actions.  Strong and ambitious policies need to be implemented at national level to create nationwide structures for public participation and incite local decision makers to abandon the <i>status quo</i>and find innovative ways of engaging directly with their constituents.  Climate change represents one of the greatest challenges of our century.  We desperately need to reduce our carbon emissions and adapt to present and forthcoming impacts of climate change.  Decisions aiming at driving these societal changes cannot take place behind closed doors.  We need to seize climate change as an opportunity to change profoundly the way our democracy works in Ireland and in Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1075" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Louise Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019050900002#M00200"><p>I am speaking not only as an Irish Research Council-funded scholar based at the UCD school of politics and international relations but also as someone who cannot remember a time when I was not faced with fear, anxiety and a deep sense of sadness about the current ecological and climate breakdown, which is already causing pain for millions of people around the world.  This is why I have dedicated the last four years of my life to researching how we can develop effective and successful policies to deal with our climate and sustainable development challenges.  My presentation is based on cutting-edge research within political science as well as dozens of research interviews I have conducted in Germany in an attempt to understand the factors that have helped to underpin the success of Germany's historic energy transition.  I am looking at the factors that help to create policy that is politically and socially acceptable.  This is really the Holy Grail.  I hope to demonstrate how we can make stringent policy without facing electoral penalties.</p> <p>  I will mention a few insights and factors that have the potential to help us in our work.  The first of them underpins what has been said about the importance of citizen-centred energy and green industrial supports.  The key causal mechanism here is something called coalition building, which is essentially about the development of policy that seeks specifically to build coalitions of support for a green policy that allows policy measures to be ratcheted up over time.  The provision of direct industrial incentives to support the growth of particular green industries, such as renewables, is an effective way to build these new coalitions.  This has been borne out in the case of Germany, where it was a main driver of the energy transition.  The expansion of green industrial supports gave citizens access to the energy grid.  A payment for the energy fed into the grid supported the development of citizen-centred and community-centred renewable energies.  This solidified the societal acceptance of energy transitions, which is a key factor in determining our success as we go forward.</p> <p>  A second insight is that carbon-pricing approaches can face significant barriers to effective implementation.  An understanding of the dynamics of the political landscape is necessary in this context.  Carbon pricing incentivises regulatory losers, those who are going to lose out as a result of certain policies, to organise politically to prevent such policies from being implemented, thereby rendering measures difficult to implement and making them no more than marginally effective in the short and medium term.  It can be costly and time-consuming to tweak proposed instruments in order that they can be implemented in any form.  The EU emissions trading system and its related offset schemes have faced significant challenges.  Research indicates that switching to green industrial supports and focusing on such supports as well as on citizen-centred energy faces fewer political barriers and is more conducive to effective and sustainable policymaking.</p> <p>  Clear action on decarbonisation can have a powerful signalling effect and can create a facilitative framework.  Conversely, any moves to build new fossil fuel infrastructure can have lock-in impacts that undermine and derail sustainability transitions.  It is important to note that natural gas infrastructure projects that are planned within the EU's list of projects of common interest, including the planned Shannon liquified natural gas terminal, categorically impede our ability to decarbonise in a timely manner.  Alternatively, research has started to show that supply side policies, such as bans and moratoriums, have significant economic and political advantages compared with demand side policies.  The political advantages of such an approach include superior potential to mobilise public support, including within fossil fuel industries, as well as low administrative and transactional costs.</p> <p>  The EU can provide a framework for developing effective and just pathways to sustainable development and successful climate action.  Countries as small as Ireland can have a substantial impact within this framework.  Much of the work that is being done now involves the development of new norms of behaviour.  This has a powerful contagion effect.  We have an opportunity to implement a dynamic policy for effective climate action and sustainable development, but the window is closing fast.  Climate and ecological breakdown are hitting us faster than was ever predicted.  On our current path, a safe planet for human life will disappear before today's children reach the age of those we are addressing this morning.</p> <p>  No financial argument makes any sense when faced with these facts, regardless of whether it is hedged in terms of budget speak, bureaucratic processes, profits or vested interests.  The survival of all of us and all of those we care about is directly threatened by climate change.  This is not political.  It is a scientific fact that is based on science, physics and the laws of nature.  All Members of the Oireachtas will face important decisions in the coming weeks and months.  I want them to understand that everything they care about will be touched by climate and ecological breakdown.  They need to think about that and act from a place of love when they are making decisions.  Young people are asking politicians to give them a chance to live a dignified life and to have a safe world in which to live.  We are asking them to let us hope.  This is not about us versus them or young people versus politicians.  That is old thinking.  This is about the shared fate of all of us who are interconnected on this planet.  We are in this together for better or for worse, so let us make it better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1076" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Connor McGookin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019050900002#M00300"><p>I thank the committees for the opportunity to speak.  I have three brief points to make.  I will probably echo much of the frustration we heard in the previous statements.  First, climate change policy must be stepped up ambitiously.  Second, there is growing public appetite for climate action.  We have heard about Greta Thunberg.  Third, local actions must be adequately supported.  This should not just be about high-level ambition.  As Deputies and Senators are probably aware, European leaders are meeting in Romania today to discuss the future of Europe.  At this summit, eight countries and 210 cities are urging national leaders and the European Council to adopt a zero emissions target for 2050.  Last November, a report produced by the European Commission set out a number of pathways for achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  This commitment is essential if we are to avoid the apocalyptic narratives of climate change.  It is up to the EU 27 to lead the way.</p> <p>  I would like to mention one example of how Ireland is failing miserably to meet this responsibility.  Last October, a stark warning in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gave us just 11 years to make a meaningful difference.  Embarrassingly, this was followed by a failure to provide in the budget for an increase in carbon tax.  This reflects the lack of political leadership that has slowed the progress of climate policy across the world.  Thanks to a young Swedish girl, a growing movement throughout Europe is now demanding greater government ambition and moving climate policy onto the agenda.  The recent report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which achieved cross-party consensus, was a significant milestone.  The all-of-Government action plan that is being prepared is another important step in the right direction.  The achievement of political consensus is not the final hurdle, however.  We must build from here to secure social consensus.</p> <p>  While high-level ambition is essential, many of us have a lot to learn if we are to understand what this means at local level.  This is the focus of my own research.  I have explored new approaches to energy system modelling and planning that account for local values and perceptions.  As Mr. Leahy pointed out, there is a need to address some of the flaws in the planning and decision-making processes that can lead to opposition to infrastructural projects like large-scale wind developments and overhead pylons.  In 2015, the White Paper on energy mentioned that there was an "increasing recognition of the value that effective communication and a participative approach between developer, local community and local authority can bring to the development of energy infrastructure".</p><p>This has been echoed in recent policy with repeated references to phrases like "energy citizen" or "community engagement".  I imagine we can all agree this is a welcome narrative and is undoubtedly important for the energy transition.</p><p> However, within communities, several constraints are hindering meaningful progress.  I will list some of the key challenges and opportunities.  These have been compiled from my personal research and that of some of my colleagues.  First, volunteers are required, but depending on them will not be adequate.  As local champions these people are often part of several community groups and are already stretched.  The existing community networks represent a major opportunity but must be engaged in a respectful manner.  Second, I reiterate that core funding is needed.  Regular funding must be made available for the administration and co-ordination of community energy groups if they are to function effectively.  Third, until policy barriers in the form of tariffs, planning, finance and grid access are addressed, it will be unhelpful and perhaps counterproductive to continuously talk up community ownership of energy.  The final point is closest to my heart.  Community energy does not guarantee community acceptance but a more transparent and inclusive decision-making processes can help ease tensions and inspire positive action.</p><p> I will summarise my contribution.  I have noted the need for European leadership in stepping up ambition.  I touched on the noticeable growth in public appetite for meaningful climate action.  National leadership, extensive local engagement and clear benefits for communities are essential in driving the energy transition.</p></speech>

Last September, I began studying in DCU on the climate change masters programme.  I have always been interested in reading up on environmental news and over several years I have become increasingly concerned about climate change and environmental degradation.  Since beginning the course two things have happened.  I have realised how bad the situation is, but also that there is still hope.  It has hit home for me that there needs to be a fundamental change in our society if we are to tackle this problem in the short time there is left to effectively halt the worst of what could happen.<br/><br/>Ireland is rightly seen to be at the back of the pack.  However, the recent report from the Joint Committee on Climate Action is a welcome step in the right direction.  We can learn much from our European counterparts about what has worked and what has not.  We can build on these in an Irish context.<br/><br/>Effectively communicating the challenges and opportunities to citizens is the most important step.  There is a lot of fear and misunderstanding regarding climate change.  Public debate on what must happen to transition to a low-carbon economy is essential.  We need to have open conversations in the media and at the dinner table about how we must change the <i>status quo</i>and the best ways to do this for our local communities and large-scale industries.<br/><br/>I look forward to an all-of-Government action plan, as I believe it will help drive the public debate in a meaningful way to give the general public clear guidance on what is being proposed and how it will affect them personally and society as a whole.<br/><br/>The announcement by Bord na M&oacute;na last October of the loss of more than 400 jobs in the midlands shows the need for extensive planning and programmes to retrain workers or aid in job replacement schemes for those who will be most affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy.  Last October, the Spanish Government and coal miner unions reached a transition deal.  It offered early retirement or retraining for coal miners who are to lose their jobs as the industry is scaled back.  This is an example of good practice that can be repeated in an Irish context.  Some industries will be disproportionately affected, such as agriculture and peat production, while there will be more opportunities for green jobs elsewhere and these must be embraced.  Workers who believe their livelihoods are being threatened need to be engaged in what happens but at a community level there must be a discussion as well.  The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, campaigning on a green new deal platform, won the recent Spanish elections with up to 50% of the vote in some mining towns.  The party had worked with the coal miners unions previously.<br/><br/>Recently, there has been a surge in social activism around climate change, such as the school strikes for climate and the extinction rebellion.  I went to the two events held in Dublin.  As a former teacher, I know how hard it can be to motivate teenagers, but at the school strike, I was moved by the enthusiasm students showed that day.  At the extinction rebellion protest, I was inspired by the diversity of participants who showed up.  These movements show that the public are becoming increasingly aware of climate change, biodiversity loss and the general destruction of the natural world that is occurring at an unprecedented rate.  There has never been a better time to engage the public on the urgency of the crisis facing our planet.  Small-scale actions that individuals can take will not be enough without large-scale actions and policies by governments.  The EU, Ireland included, must lead the way and take bold unmitigated action now, with engaged citizens at the core of this transition.  The release earlier this week of the global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services is another stark reminder that our current system is failing and putting life on earth at risk.  The technology to make the shift is in place.  The financial risk will lessen the sooner we take action.  The public will to act has never been stronger.  It is time to change.</p></speech>

I will go to my colleagues with questions.  The witnesses might note the questions and then whoever wants to come in can answer them.  Is it okay if we proceed that way?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The witnesses have raised some important and key issues that the Joint Committee on Climate Action has been considering during the past seven months.  Ms Fitzgerald mentioned one of our key concerns, which is the price of carbon.  Although it was only a small part of our work, it was a key concern in respect of protecting the most vulnerable.  We considered the need to be politically palatable in bringing people with us and not making the mistakes we have made in other areas in engagement in with the community and bringing people on board.  That is why these conversations are important for us.  We have a body of work to complete and we can see that.  This is only the start.  Community engagement and how we communicate to the citizen are important.  We must protect the most vulnerable and those facing fuel poverty.  Key sectors will find the transition hardest, including the peat industry, the farming community and rural communities.  These are key areas that we have to work on as well.</p> <p>  I am keen to hear of any of the witnesses want to expand on what we can do in respect of the price of carbon.  They will have seen from our report how we are conscious of protecting those affected and the need to have a short, sharp engagement on the issue of the price of carbon and the key sectors that will be affected.  What else needs to be done on the regulatory and policy side?  What is the nature of the regulatory and policy mix needed for that to be a success?  That is one key component.</p> <p>  There was a major emphasis in all the contributions on new mediums of participation.  Mr. Leahy mentioned this and the question of community engagement.  This again is a whole-of-society approach.  The Government has a role to play but we cannot do it all; it has to be within the community as well.  One issue we have faced as elected representatives is that when we want to put in place renewable energy projects there is local opposition.  We talk about communities coming together feeding into the grid, tapping into the grid and selling their own electricity back into the grid.  We need to unlock the planning regulations.  The issues goes beyond acceptance.  If the witnesses have any more insights, I would be grateful to hear them.</p> <p>  I will bring in my colleagues now.  Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy and Senator M&aacute;ire Devine are first.  We will then hear from Deputy Tom Neville.</p></speech>

They will not find any argument from this side in respect of the challenge facing us all nationally and globally in terms of trying to halt global warming.</p> <p>  Mr. McGookin talked about reaching into local communities.  I wonder if he has looked at whether public participation networks are a good starting point.  I attended an event recently in my county of Offaly.  The public participation network there established Green Offaly, which is a great initiative.  Should initiatives like this be happening throughout the country?  It is something the Joint Committee on Climate Action discussed and recommended.</p> <p>  Ms Caroline Moran referred to Bord na M&oacute;na.  I am from Offaly.  A just transition is something that we are anxious to ensure.  Has she been keeping track of the efforts Offaly County Council has made recognising the challenges to the communities involved and the workers?  We need to bring together all the stakeholders to ensure that the workers involved are aware of all the benefits for them in terms of social protection as well as the opportunities for retraining and upskilling.  An event is being planned for the week after next.  It is a job-matching initiative in which local companies will come together with the workers who are taking voluntary redundancy.</p><p>There are many positives.  Other areas could learn from it.  Is Ms Moran keeping track of this?  It is important that we be aware of such efforts.</p></speech>

I am still a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  We were the black sheep of the committee when we voted against the carbon tax.  The committee has done 90% of its work collaboratively, but we were concerned about the just transition and the tax's imposition on less fortunate people who are struggling.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to expand on another point.  There is an emergency in our public health system because of climate change, and it will be even more harmful for communities tomorrow.  This is about communicating with communities not only about heatwaves, floods, storms and the resultant deaths, but about the day in, day out worldwide epidemic of asthma, respiratory tract infections and diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD.  Many of these have to do with pollution, for example, the quality of the water that we drink.  According to the World Health Organization, WHO, this threat costs many billions of dollars and causes millions of deaths per year.  The WHO believes that will only increase.  Should we declare this an emergency alongside climate change?</p> <p>  We have received representations from the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA.  It made an important statement that has stuck with me, namely, that we must rethink how we feed the world.  In the 1960s and 1970s, we did not have meat with every meal.  We could not afford it, as it was a luxury.  However, it has become so commonplace now that we expect it even though it is responsible for much of the destruction of the environment and our bodies' health.</p> <p>  When one sits down in a canteen, bistro or caf&eacute;, everything is packaged.  When did we stop being communal and sharing sugar bowls and milk jugs?  These simple points seem stupid, but they are down to hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, legislation.  We must revisit it, as it is so clinical and clean that it is damaging us, in that we are not being exposed to stuff and material is being wasted.  It is nonsensical that we all just sit around with sachets that we tear apart, adding to the destruction.  The global scale is larger, but I am interested in this matter.</p></speech>

I sat on the Joint Committee on Climate Action and, hopefully, will sit on a permanent version chaired by the Co-Chairman, Deputy Naughton.</p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses' presentations.  I went on a great journey of discovery during the eight months that I sat on the committee.  My knowledge of the parameters and facets of this issue was minuscule.  The witnesses are preaching to the converted as regards the necessary timelines and actions.</p> <p>  I was struck by the question of consultation and building coalitions raised in one of the presentations.  That is paramount to our success.  If we do not build a coalition and agreement across all parties and sectors of society, there will be a knee-jerk kickback.  Be it political or something else, it will be a "Them" and "Us" response that could set us back ten or 15 years or even a generation.  We do not want that.</p> <p>  Our committee viewed public consultation as paramount.  I was interested to hear about how an industry coalition was built on the ground in Germany, but Ireland needs to go to an even more micro level.  Since we have a smaller population, we are a more integrated society.  For example, managing directors of companies have siblings who are farmers or teachers.  As such, we wanted to propose town hall-type meetings that would involve peer-to-peer and community learning involving people from all sectors of society - young and old, farmers and doctors, unemployed people, those in receipt of disability payments and so on.  They would educate one another from the bottom up or at the same level.  Politicians taking a top-down approach will not work.  Europe and America have kicked back at such an approach.  We must alter our communication style.  That will be paramount in coalition building.  It will require maturity, not only from people, but also from political parties.  The latter must take a step back from the politics and build a coalition of consensus to drive this through.  I would be interested in hearing more about the coalition building that happened in Germany.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1088" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019050900002#O00700"><p>I welcome our guests, who have spoken passionately.  These are issues that we considered in significant depth in writing our report.  Action is needed.  The requirement that we live more sustainably, which we have not been doing for years, is at the heart of this.  It is the fallout of industrialisation and so on.  If people were surveyed, everyone would agree with the targets under the Paris Agreement.  It is only when one starts to drill down into who will take the pain and cost that a problem arises.  That is what we must address if we want to see action.  As Deputy Neville stated, though, there must be a consensus.</p> <p>  Recently, I attended a climate action forum of secondary schools in my county of Mayo that was facilitated by the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, the county council and the latter's climate action officer.  We were sitting around a table and one of the issues debated was that of cost.  In terms of transport, for example, we talked about how, if the pupils' parents had to get electric vehicles, it would cost them money regardless of how large a grant the State provided.  The same would be the case with heating systems.  When I asked them if they believed that would be acceptable, they could not say that it would be.</p> <p>  There is another political reality.  No matter what people say in the abstract about targets and the need to take action, the experience in Canada, Australia, Finland, France and Germany has been that, when politicians take political action, a large number of people do not agree with doing so.  It does not mean that we should balk at trying to do the right thing, as we cannot continue taking from the Earth something that will not be replenished and will cause greenhouse gas emissions.  We are smarter now and have more technology.  We must be smarter and live more smartly.  However, the idea that everyone is in agreement is incorrect.  It is not even that they do not believe that there is climate change.  Rather, they are more concerned with living in the here and now than with taking on additional pressures.  If someone is in receipt of social welfare payments, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, can fund 100% of certain energy efficiency works on his or her house.  If someone is earning a low income and, accordingly, will only receive partial supports, he or she will be under pressure.  These are the people who will be financing their children going to college.  From where will that money come?  The bill will be significant.  That is even evident from our social housing programme, given the additional cost of building houses.  People are revolting against costs.  That does not take from the witnesses' message, but we must refine our discussion to listening to people's concerns.</p> <p>  I have raised an issue previously and, while I do not want to labour the point, it must be borne in mind that when the witnesses refer to the measures that are necessary to tackle climate change, they are asking for more to be done by people living in rural areas.  They are asking rural areas to take wind farms and grid infrastructure.  They are asking for peat-burning power stations to be shut down.  Where I am from, such a station closed a number of years ago.  The area is only a shadow of its former itself economically.</p><p>The issue of community gain is very relevant there.</p><p> There is also the issue of farming and the speaker from Teagasc earlier made a sensible proposition.  We are very well suited to producing protein from dairy and beef.  It does not mean that we continue exactly in the same vein but this is not discussed.  There is now a situation where farmers are saying they have been doing all of this.  The national herd has increased and that is why our greenhouse gases and emissions of methane have increased but farmers are farming more efficiently than ever before.  They are put to the pin of their collars by payments on environmental measures, water quality and biodiversity.  They have an appetite to do more but feel persecuted.  People are disengaging.</p><p> I will say one final thing.  The generation coming after us ask us to look at what we are doing.  The reality is that the parents of the children I was talking to would give their left arms for their children.  Their grandparents would do the same.  The generations that have come before are trying to cope and do their best.  They care and want to be given credit for that.  We have to get realistic solutions which balance idealism with the reality to achieve them and not crush people in the process.  </p><p> We will have a revolution.  It will not be like those revolting in London who are from more middle class backgrounds and have time on their hands.  The ordinary person will revolt which will create another set of problems that will set us back economically.  We cannot take from the advances and lifestyles we enjoy.  We must find technology to match that.</p><p> The last speaker on the environment was positive and hopeful, as I am.  Human beings have great capacity to innovate and, although there will always be issues and problems, there can be business opportunities here.  We see a lot of signals sent out by China and India, major emerging economies, that they have to go to green technology and transport etc.  Ireland has to take these signals if it wants to participate in the global economy.  We must also be clever.   It is not only about misery, it is about opportunities and living in a different way.</p></speech>

I campaigned with Tr&oacute;caire on climate change in 2008 when a group of young activists, who are no longer young, were demanding action.  Even then, climate change was not new and there were huge impacts on many parts of the world and many communities were seeing their futures destroyed.</p><p>It is good that there is momentum now and climate change is centre stage in discussions.  Europe Day is about Europe and the real test will be if Europe will place the sustainable development goals and climate change actions at the centre of the new five-year European strategy.  Will they also be at the centre of the multiannual financial framework, the European budget?  Simply putting climate action front and centre for photos at the moment will not be enough.  </p><p>The European Investment Bank put &euro;11 billion into fossil fuels between 2007 and 2013.  The European climate action fund is proposed to be &euro;5 billion.  I want people to discuss the balance between where we invest and how we can stop taking backward steps.</p><p>One of the speakers mentioned the LNG terminal which is an example of something that was funded by European investment funding.  How do we get that joined up?  It comes down to public participation.  </p><p>I am passionate about new forms of participation and we need them.  I like the idea of town hall meetings, I think they are important, and I also think people should be looking at their local authority's development plans and putting in opinions.  That is important.  It is crucial to ask how we ensure the public discussion does not stay in a silo as a separate discussion on climate, but rather bring climate action into the economic discussion around budgets.  We need to ensure that closed-door economic decisions such as trade agreements and procurement are joined up and informed by climate considerations.  We need not to have any backward steps.  I would like to hear the comments of the speakers on that matter.</p><p>Another consideration is the comparative roles of the public and private sectors which was touched on by some of the speakers.  For example, it might be tempting to support the electric car industry because it has the potential to make profit whereas public transport might not, but public transport might lead us to make much greater progress much more quickly.  There will be things that will cost money and will not necessarily be profitable but, if we do not take the action now, the cost will be borne elsewhere in the world and by those most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>That brings us to the question of carbon pricing.  I am on the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection and am very passionate about just transition.  We must not wait for people to become redundant from sectors that are no longer sustainable but need to talk to them while they are still employed about their plans for the future.  I have been arguing for that in the context of just transition.  We must manage the pragmatic issues around just transition in Ireland and look to climate justice on a global level so we not only address the concerns in Ireland but look to climate justice for other parts of the world.</p><p>The price of carbon is artificially low and needs to be higher.  The price has driven an unsustainable global development model.  Do we make social protection payments?  Fuel poverty payments will get us to a certain level but, as was rightly said, many people on low incomes will not be caught by the fuel supplement.  How do we recognise and ensure that industry is reflecting the price of carbon and does not have artificially deflated prices because of artificially deflated carbon costs while ensuring that individuals are not taking the worst of the impacts?  Those are the key questions.  Perhaps we should look at bans, moratoriums and levies on sectors.</p><p>I will conclude because I want to hear the responses of the speakers.  It comes back to the question of business as usual.  Where do we frontload?  Can we, and should we, balance keeping interests aligned while ensuring that we do not wait for certain climate actions to become profitable?<b></b>We have to frontload it.  All of the speakers had practical thoughts on how we do that.  </p><p>My key questions relate to climate justice, just transition, the public and private spheres and how to ensure this is an economic transformation as well as a social movement.</p></speech>

There is a great deal we can do on climate change in a relatively short time.  We are supposed to achieve certain targets within ten years and it is well within our capacity to achieve them in that time period even though we are late starters.</p> <p>  The first thing we had to do was to convince people of the necessity to change and become less reliant on fossil fuels.  As we do that, we must also become less reliant on the electricity generated from fossil fuels.  Once we have crossed that part of the divide, the rest will follow readily.  There is serious interest in electric cars this year where there was no such interest in the past.</p> <p>  Some of us have, over the past number of years, tried to sell the idea of alternative energy and the renewable energy sector and been publicly criticised and ridiculed for it.  That is part of the battle we must face into.  We must balance our approach, try to ensure that we do not target part of our community, or be seen to do so, in our journey towards achieving the necessary change.  We have the capacity to do that, provided we do it right, and avoid the possibility of postponing forever something we need to start doing now.</p></speech>

The first point made was about carbon tax and we looked at that and what it would mean to raise the weekly allowance in order to offset the extra &euro;10.</p><p>It was something like &euro;4 in the winter and &euro;2 in the summer.  We will revert to the committee as we have some figures on that.  It would not hit the people in fuel poverty.  Much of what comes from our research must account for fuel poverty.</p><p> Climate change is a cross-cutting matter and there were questions as to how to overcome the problems.  There are significant benefits to dealing with climate change, particularly in the rural sector, and I hope dealing with climate change would address many of the problems of rural degradation and help to revive many rural areas.  It would help farmers through diversification of income by generating electricity, growing other crops or being paid for the carbon captured in their forests.  Reforestation would be a major part of achieving carbon neutrality, along with restoring wetlands.</p><p> Public participation networks were a recommendation in the report from the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which is why I left them out of my bullet points.  I certainly agree that we need such town hall meetings and there is an attempt to achieve this with the national dialogue on climate change.  It is important to capacity building in communities to have access to impartial experts who can point to the facts and challenges being faced.  It is about open discussion.  My research in the Dingle peninsula relates to this if the members are interested.</p><p> Somebody mentioned going through the local authority and we thought that if we could follow the example of the UK and Wicklow in declaring a climate emergency, local authorities should have it as a top priority to have a climate change officer who would be able to advise homeowners or community groups.  It is an important element in building capacity, which has been mentioned quite often.  There was mention of the middle class accessing grants.  It is a major problem.  I know in Australia, poorer people were basically subsidising richer people getting solar panels put on their homes.  We must be careful to avoid such things.</p></speech>

As has been mentioned, it is really important that there should be plans in place before peat production is closed so workers can have options in what they do afterwards.  If there is to be a change, those workers need different options and time to think.  At a community level there must be thought on what new industries can be brought in to benefit the entire community.</p> <p>  There was mention of carbon tax and feed-in tariffs for solar photovoltaic equipment, which is really important.  The uptake of solar photovoltaic technology in countries with feed-in tariffs has been huge.  If there is fuel poverty or people have low incomes without supplements, they could get profits from a feed-in tariff rather than just a grant.  Retired people in their homes during the day may use electricity while it is generated and therefore it would cut their costs.  Conversely, if people are at work all day they do not get the benefit of energy that is being produced but they would see a benefit through a feed-in tariff.  They would get the money back.  Such a process could work, especially in rural communities.  We have spoken much about farmers and if they are leaving land spare, there could be large-scale solar photovoltaic installations to generate income as well.  We need to be creative in what we do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Louise Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019050900002#Q00400"><p>With regard to coalition building, I am speaking to this new dynamic understanding of policy that is coming out of social and political science research and how we can harness the feedback effects of policy and understanding the political landscape.  This goes beyond just public consultation, which is also a good step.  This is also about what policy choices we make and the outcomes and effects they have.  To underline what has already been said, feed-in tariffs, for example, have the effect of building powerful coalitions.  In Germany there were all sorts of actors who became supportive of the policy and really tried to protect it, including people who may not necessarily have been green-minded.  They support it being ratcheted up.</p> <p>  It is really important to note the social dimension.  We have seen the yellow vest movement in France and what happens when we do not have this lens in implementing the decarbonisation policy.  There was mention of a just transition and this should not be about climate action versus farmers or peat workers.  Farmers are on the front line of climate change and they are already experiencing it.  We have seen that with the fodder crisis.  The fossil fuel age is collapsing and one way or another, peat workers will see an impact from climate change policy.  We must achieve this in a just way.</p> <p>  I will speak briefly to carbon pricing.  As I stated, I am drawing on an understanding of policy dynamics.  Carbon pricing should be seen as one of many tools in a policy mix.  One of the issues is the need to build alternatives and allow people to have alternatives through something like a feed-in tariff.  To draw on a German case, there was a delay in trying to implement carbon pricing through the emissions trading system and, essentially, there was neglect of the areas of transport, heating and the idea of a more systemic just transition.  Now the country is facing the consequences, so we would do well to learn from their mistakes and not have this happen with carbon price implementation in Ireland.  Green industrial support, citizen energy, bans and moratoriums can be used.  The paper I quoted was by Mr. Fergus Green and Dr. Richard Denniss from 2017 and it is available online.  They argue that supply-side bans have a host of advantages and gain much support, including from actors like the fossil fuel industry, which we might not expect.</p> <p>  Citizen energy feeds into the transformative elements and resilience in communities and globally.  It builds more community resilience and this enables communities to face climate change issues.  That work comes from people like Mr. Craig Morris.  There is a need to look locally but also globally at what is coming.  People in Mozambique are panicking, for example, and people across the global South already facing the impact of climate change are panicking.  We would do well to respond right now to what we are all facing.</p></speech>

We could speak about this for hours and all the information has almost given me a headache.  There is one point that has been mentioned a few times and it relates to consultation.  It is one type of participation but this cannot just be about consultation.  According to my research, many different authors and academics have stated that typical formal consultation does not work.  Submissions may not be taken into account with a final decision and there is also the question of when consultation happens.  Does it happen when all the options are closed and if so, how efficient can that be?  There is the question of timing in participation.</p> <p>  I can give a brief example.  Last year the national adaptation framework was published in January and it marked the first step in a process of building national adaptation for different sectors and local authorities.  It was put out for consultation in September 2017 and there were 27 or 28 submissions.  It was not a very high number.  The submissions are available online and only four were submitted by private individuals not representing an organisation or State agency.  This demonstrates a problem.  Is the general public just not interested in those policies or is there a lack of communication in advertising those formal consultation processes?  It is something we must be aware of and we probably need to go a step further than just consultation.  It would amount to considerable responsibility for local authorities but this needs to happen at a local level.</p></speech>

There is certainly a need to panic as we are missing our targets for 2020 and we are set up to miss the 2030 targets.  If by 2050 we are to be carbon-neutral or reduce our emissions by 80% or 100%, we are not on track to do it, even if we implement many of the recommendations of the report.</p> <p>  To focus on agriculture, my research was on soils and soil carbon in Ireland, taking into account the effect of extreme weather on those soils.  Our natural grasslands are carbon sinks because they are grazed by cattle and they provide minerals for the soil.  Those soils are carbon sinks in the same way that our untouched peatlands are.  There are 7 million cows in Ireland producing methane.</p><p>I do not understand how we square getting to carbon neutrality by 2050 with retaining that number of cows.  We need also to recognise the benefit the cows have to the soil.  These are complex issues and communicating their complexity is very important, especially if we do not want an "us versus them" strategy coming out.  Farmers are certainly looking after their land to the best of their ability as they want to pass it on to future generations.  Focusing on the complexities of the issue is important but so is recognising the limitations of our current actions.  </p></speech>

I especially welcome the three speakers for this section, Ms Sara Thompson from UCD, Ms Laura Bartley from DCU and Ms Maeve Richardson from UCC.  It has been a very interesting and illuminating morning for the members listening to all of the witnesses' contributions.  I also welcome the presence of an ever-depleting number of my colleagues from the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  Such is the draw on all our time here in the Houses.  I represent two Ulster counties, Cavan and Monaghan, and have been Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality since 2016.</p> <p>  Migration is the final topic of today's session marking Europe Day 2019.  This is a very important topic, especially on this day, for as Europeans we have known the reality of migration, most often forced migration due to war, conflict, famine, disease and escape from poverty across the centuries.  It is beyond dispute that the people of Ireland have known migration and its causes like few others across the Continent.  This generational awareness, experience and knowledge should contribute to our being a truly welcoming people, giving truth to the claim that this is an Ireland of the welcomes.  Sadly, of course, this is not always the case.  </p> <p>  While we have some time issues, there will be no restriction in respect of the three speakers.  If I have to restrict anybody it will be my colleague, Senator Devine.  I call on Ms Thompson to address us.</p></speech>

I will present some facts and numbers and some challenges that the EU is facing in respect of migration.  The 2015 migration crisis became a starting point to a wider debate on migration in the European Union but also on burden sharing and the member states' responsibilities.  The lack of joint action between the member states has shown that in 2015 the EU was unprepared to handle this issue, which resulted in disorderly migration, human trafficking and tragedy.  In respect of the numbers, 2.5 million immigrants entered the EU from non-EU countries in 2017; and 4.4% of people living in the EU on 1 January 2018 were non-EU citizens, which is 22 million people out of a total of 512 million.  The European agency for human rights has pointed out that the number of irregular migrants crossing the borders dropped in 2017, when 200,000 people crossed the EU borders, in comparison to approximately 500,000 in 2016.  The number of deaths at sea has also dropped; however, the emergency remains as the deaths are continuing, mainly in the central Mediterranean.</p> <p>  Also concerning is the fact that migrants arriving within EU borders have been mistreated.  This mistreatment worsened in 2017 with Bulgaria, Hungary and Croatia as the leading countries of migrant mistreatment.  Another issue is the relocation of immigrants and the problem of overcrowding.  This has been critical in numerous locations, especially in Greece, France and Italy.  Providing adequate housing remains a challenge and the lack of co-operation between member states has a significant impact on how immigration is handled in the EU.  The European Council established a temporary relocation scheme with a plan to relocate 160,000 people in need.  This was not accomplished due to lack of co-operation from the member states.  President Antonio Tajani has stated that migration is our biggest challenge and that it is putting at risk the very future of the European Union.  As a result of intense migration within the EU in recent years, EU internal borders have been subject to additional border controls, which is putting the free movement of EU citizens at risk.  There is a need for better co-operation between member states with regard to border management as the migration crisis has put major pressure on the member states' border authorities.  The European institutions responded with a call for strengthening the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, however this remains a work in progress, with a plan of giving the agency a standing corps of 10,000 border guards by 2027, which is a bit far away.  A Eurobarometer survey has reported that 73% of European citizens want the EU to do more on the issue of migration and 58% described EU action on migration as inadequate.  There is a need to do more on the part of both member states and the EU as a whole.  Reaching agreement on migrant issues has been a challenge for the European Union.  It is a sensitive issue and member states have different views and policies on migration, making it difficult to negotiate co-ordinated common positions.  The migration crisis in 2015 showed that the EU was not prepared to handle a humanitarian crisis.  Plans to relocate migrants, strengthen the borders, integrate refugees and much more are still a work in progress.</p> <p>  Member states and their representatives have to become aware of the next upcoming crisis, which is climate displacement.  This crisis is not spoken about or understood by many.  It is not defined or backed by international law.  It is true that civil war and unrest in Syria, Libya and the Middle East are reasons for the migrant crisis but there are deeper reasons for current migration from these places.  These areas are experiencing rainfall patterns, unbearably high temperatures, floods, droughts and all sorts of natural disasters which lead to major changes in farming, fishing and herding, causing migration from these areas to more developed ones.  Reports on climate displacement presented by the EU are often very generalised and do not provide clear solutions to the problem.  Following the 2015 migration crisis, it is clear that member states are not united with regard to burden sharing and this has to be addressed in order to prepare Europe and help those in need.  </p> <p>  I will present a couple of recommendations made by the Mary Robinson Foundation on Climate Justice in its 2016 position paper.  Above EU national level, the rights of climate displaced people have to be respected in the same way as human rights in general.  The burdens in respect of dealing with climate migration have to be addressed together as a Union.  There is a need for engagement with already displaced people but also with those who are vulnerable to climate displacement, in order to protect the rights of people who are at risk of climate displacement.  The most important action the countries can take is to reduce the impact of climate change at all costs.  This will reduce the threats in areas at risk.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1110" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Bartley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019050900002#R00500"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it.  As a younger citizen, I am particularly grateful for this opportunity to engage on such a timely policy issue.  My knowledge is based on my European-funded research at Dublin City University, the University of Glasgow and Charles University, Prague.  My research focuses on migration to Europe, specifically the power of the media and policy makers to shape public opinion.  My current research examines the ways in which migration has been constructed as a threat and questions the dominance of this threat-centric approach.</p> <p>  It is without doubt that international migration and issues surrounding migrants, refugees and asylum seekers can be seen as defining characteristics of the 21st century in an era of globalisation.  In the context of conflict and growing inequalities, the IOM's 2018 report estimates that there are 258 million international migrants globally.  Ireland's strong cultural memory and historic trend to emigration mean that we are acutely aware of the realities of migration and displacement.</p><p>Yet more recently, Ireland has experienced increased inward migration and has become an increasingly diverse society with the 2016 census indicating that the 535,000 non-Irish nationals living in Ireland originate from 200 different nations.  Such figures illustrate the increased diversity and prompt the need to examine political and societal attitudes to immigrants, and explore different ways to support integration and social cohesion within Irish and European society.</p><p> The first challenge I will address relates to the power of language and narrative.  Migration has remained one of the most divisive issues for the public in recent years and this is reflected in the polarised narratives and language which frame discussions.  Past decades have seen a language shift from emigrant and immigrant to the use of the word "migrant" which has effect of de-contextualising the experience of these people by removing their home location and their destination.  There is also selectivity in respect of those to whom we apply these terms which often indicates a hierarchy of worthiness, suggesting that we have "good" versus "bad" migrants.</p><p> The language we use matters.  It has power to reinforce negative stereotypes and racial hierarchies which permeate to every level of society.  As such we must recognise and challenge harmful, polarising language and myths regarding migration.  We must refrain from using terms such as "illegal migrant" in any forum of discussion and instead use "irregular" or "undocumented".  We must commit to increased engagement in order to confront the myths of migration at local, national and EU levels.</p><p> There is a need to engage in difficult discussions regarding migration for policy makers, journalists and activists to maintain credibility.  We must create a space where communication of the perceived and actual challenges of migration is possible, but not in a way which stigmatises or alienates communities.  The creation of action plans and strategies by Government and local authorities, such as the migrant integration strategy or even the UN migration pact convey effective messages which are honest, fair and accessible.</p><p> The second challenge I wish to address is promoting integration in communities.  There is increasing recognition of the inherent potential of diverse society.  There is also an awareness of the difficulties associated with integration policies and programmes.  The dilemma often relates to how to prioritise integration without fuelling unfairness among certain groups that feel left behind.  Research has shown that encounters with the reality of migration foster a more tolerant mindset within host communities, which needs to be looked at further.</p><p> In discussions on the topic of integration, it is often said that the process is a two-way street involving the host community and the newcomer.  However, we need to move away from this binary give-and-take view of integration, as it does not always capture the complex, multifaceted and dynamic process which involves a network of actors and interactions.  As such we must disrupt the preconceptions that contribute to a gap between the expectation and reality of migration.  We must do this through promoting intercultural competency and integration programmes, such as arts and language acquisition, for all members of society.  We must aim to equip all citizens with the education to gain empathy and perspective-taking skills.</p><p> We must view the integration process in the context of the whole of society and facilitate the undoing of notion of "us" versus "them".  We must broaden the view of immigration beyond simply contributing to GDP or market growth.  It is not just about financially benefiting from migration, but about the overall health of our societies over the next generation.  In addition we need to carry out further research into attitudes towards diversity and integration within Irish and European society, such as the recent ERSI study.</p><p> With the immense challenges facing European and Irish society, such as changing demographics, political fragmentation, labour market changes and the pace of political and social changes, we need to have broader perspectives on the challenges we are facing and also an ambitious vision of what our future communities may look like.</p><p> We should not think of integration as an endpoint, but to understand it as an ongoing, inclusive process which provides opportunities and builds resilience in communities to confront the growing range of future challenges, not just in respect of migration.</p><p> I look forward to hearing the committee's views.</p></speech>

I am honoured to be addressing the committee today.  I am a BSc student in University College Cork in the second year of my undergraduate studies.  Appropriately we are speaking on Europe Day about a month before the European Parliament elections.  Given the changes in the political climate, it is now more important than ever to use the ballot box to have our voices heard in Europe.</p> <p>  The Treaty of Rome established the freedom of movement in respect of goods, services, capital and, what seems to be getting most attention lately, the movement of people, as we have seen from our colleagues in the European Union.  Migration has many different definitions and comes in many types, including economic migrants, refugees and ex-pats.  The perception of migration is intriguing as to whether it is harmful or positive, and what are its economic effects and difficulties.  Many people see the advantages of labour gaps being filled and society becoming more diverse.  We also see the negativity that jobs are being take away by members of the migrant community or that there is a social pressure on civic services along with an increase in racism and discrimination.</p> <p>  The cross-national Role of European Mobility and its Impacts in Narratives, Debates and EU Reforms, REMINDER, study shows that more than half of EU citizens regard the freedom of movement as positive for Europe despite an increase in support for far-right parties which has the effect of making mainstream parties take tougher stances on immigration.  European countries tend to view the effects of migrants in two ways - cultural and economic.  More recently we are starting to think about safety and terrorism.  The REMINDER study took place across seven countries in western Europe.  Apart from the UK, most countries showed more than 50% in favour of the freedom of movement.  These viewed most immigrants to western European as beneficial and not an economic or cultural threat.  Africans were viewed as most threatening to the economy while Middle Eastern migrants were considered the most threatening to safety and culture.  This has been as a result of the image of migrants portrayed in our media.</p> <p>  Europeans perceive that migrants from outside Europe make up 16.7% of the EU population.  The reality is that it is about 4.4% as of January 2018.  The representation of migrants in the media has had a profound effect on how we view our migrants.  The media provide both a human face in the form of refugees but also a mild terror attack in the form of big news headlines which terrify us.</p> <p>  Migration is an important topic for us all.  It has been shown to be a top priority for countries in the southern coastal part of Europe, namely in Croatia, Italy and Greece.  It is not so much of an issue in Ireland and is not a voter priority.  This is mainly due to the fact in the late 2010s it is shown that the majority of non-EU migrants arrive by sea.</p> <p>  Our landscape is changing through climate change and we need to become proactive rather than reactive if we are to prepare for another migrant crisis such as we saw in 2015.  We need to make sure that with coming of an EU army we are not creating a fortress Europe but rather creating a Europe that is open to all and not just Europeans.</p></speech>

This is not my area of expertise.  The Seanad has a public consultation committee.  In the autumn I plan on opening a conversation by inviting representatives from the direct provision system, which is a shame and stain on our country.  I would like to invite the three witnesses present to come to talk about migration and how people get to that point of desperation.  We are displaying inhumanity to people who need embracing, care and love, and a shelter from the horrific circumstances they left behind.</p> <p>  The witnesses talked about climate displacement - which could have been appropriate to the previous speakers - the greed of the developed world and our destructive impact on those less fortunate.</p><p>Our objective in having a public consultation in the autumn will be to challenge perceptions in this country and reach out to the 40% of people who feel afraid of and unsure about migration.  It is about getting the media to respond and to counteract some of the hysterical and hateful headlines we have seen.  The witnesses noted that voters in several European countries have elected more delegates from right-wing, fortress Europe parties.  My colleague, Senator Gavan, was in Hungary recently and may speak about what he saw there.  I will be happy to extend an invitation to the witnesses, who have made an excellent contribution to this debate, to attend the public consultation later this year.</p></speech>

We have had very impressive contributions from all the witnesses.  As part of my work as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I have witnessed teenagers the same age as my own children being kept in cages, for more than six months in one case.  That is what is happening in parts of Europe to migrant children.  The witnesses have played their part today in seeking to break the shameful silence around this issue.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on the EU's deal on migration with Turkey, which is deemed a third country of safe origin.  It is no such thing but is, in fact, a dictatorship in which horrendous human rights abuses are taking place.  It suits the EU to do that deal, however, because it keeps people out and there is apparently little interest in how migrants are being treated in Turkey.  It is an appalling human rights situation and the EU is utterly complicit in it.  It is a situation that must be ended.  I thank all the speakers for their contributions.</p></speech>

However, compared with countries like Hungary and Turkey, there are ways in which we can seek to integrate people into our society as much as possible.  We have seen great projects, for example, from Scouting Ireland and the Irish Second-Level Students Union.  However, if we remain silent on what is happening in other countries, what is the point of any such efforts?  We should be taking the lead by saying we will not stand for this.  We are a Europe of peace but there is no point if we are not working to keep the peace between people internally in our member countries.</p></speech>

It is timely, therefore, to have a public consultation on the issue.  I agree that the EU seems to be outsourcing many of our problems with migration to a neighbourhood comprising Libya, Morocco and Turkey.  There needs to be a re-engagement across European society on the values we are meant to uphold, such as strength in diversity.  The actions being taken in the EU at a high political level do not reflect those principles.  Likewise in Ireland, the refugee programme has reached only half its quota.  We need to reflect on our claim to be the island of c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.  A public consultation will be very helpful in that regard.</p></speech>

On burden sharing, as long as countries do not take responsibility for that at European level, nothing will change.  As it stands, burden sharing is voluntary.  We must push at European level to make such commitments binding and ensure we take responsibility for the care of migrants.  In the context of climate displacement, we in Europe are the lucky ones who are safe for now, but we must take responsibility for the damage we are doing to the planet and to the people who will be displaced by climate change.</p></speech>

Ms Thompson clearly linked increased migration with the climate crisis, especially as it affects less developed and impoverished parts of the globe.  Ms Bartley spoke about the importance of language and how "illegal migrant" is an inappropriate and stigmatising term and one we should not use.  I thank her for that strong message.  She spoke, too, about how an "us and them" outlook is blinkered and serves to feed prejudice and racism.  Ms Richardson noted that the free movement of people is one of the key principles of the European Union and, like her colleague, linked migration to the importance of addressing the climate crisis.</p> <p>  In the absence of my Co-Chairman, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, it falls to me to draw the meeting to a close.  The witnesses have distinguished themselves and their respective colleges and organisations.  It is a great pleasure for us as Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to welcome young, focused and enthusiastic voices from across the length and breadth of the island of Ireland.  That has been an important feature of today's discussion.  I especially welcome the fellow voices from Ulster, which makes me feel at home.  Every time I cross the Boyne Valley Bridge, I let out a small cheer that I am heading there again.  I thank colleagues for their part in marking Europe Day so well as we have done.  I hope it will be the first of many years of interesting engagement between ourselves and witnesses like those we have heard from today.</p></speech>

As this is my first appearance before the committee, I feel it is respectful to members to take a few moments to introduce myself.  Last September, I moved to Ireland from Manchester and I am privileged to have taken up the role as CEO of Ulster Bank.  I have worked in financial services for almost 39 years in a variety of roles, including in retail, corporate, operations and risk management.  In my previous post, at the Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, I was managing director of NatWest and RBS personal banking, where I was responsible for leading the team for the day-to-day banking needs of approximately 15 million customers throughout the UK.</p> <p>  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Paul Stanley, chief financial officer and deputy CEO, and Mr. Ciaran Coyle, managing director of personal banking.  In the invitation letter, the committee expressed an interest in Brexit preparedness and the accountability framework for the banking sector, which I will cover in my opening statement. </p> <p>  I begin by providing some insights into the progress we are making in Ulster Bank.  Our strategy is to continue to leverage our parent and to build a stronger, safe and sustainable bank, offering high-tech and high-touch solutions to provide effortless everyday banking services that our customers value, and to be there for them for what matters to them.  We believe that a blend of digital and physical banking is the winning combination because our customers tell us that is what they want and value.  To support our strategy, we continue to focus on innovation.  We have expanded our partnership with Dogpatch Labs, a leading co-working space for technology start-ups.  Some of our colleagues are developing their entrepreneurial talent and creativity to deliver innovative solutions for our customers.  We recently co-hosted a fifth annual Hackathon, a weekend which brought together members of the community, including the tech community, to design innovative banking solutions for customers. </p> <p>Underpinning, and fundamental to, our strategy is the continuation of transforming our culture to one where customers are consistently at the heart of everything we do, served and supported by professional colleagues. </p> <p>  Since Ulster Bank&rsquo;s previous appearance before the committee, we have made tangible progress on our priorities.  In respect of lending to support our customers and the economy, a core part of our strategy is to help our personal customers to buy a home and to save money by switching to lower rates.  This aligns with our investment to improve the service and offer market-leading fixed rates.  Last year, we saw a 13% increase in new mortgage lending to &euro;1.13 billion.  That momentum has continued into this year.  We also lent approximately &euro;1.4 billion to our business customers and, with a good start to 2019, we expect that figure to grow this year.  Our Lombard asset finance business saw volumes increase by more than 40%, or almost &euro;200 million of new lending.  We were conscious that 2018 was a particularly challenging year for the agrifood sector and introduced a weather fund to support customers in a year of unprecedented weather events.  We expanded our relationship with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland through its Brexit loan scheme and joined the BGF backers for businesses.  We also intend to participate in the new future growth loan scheme. </p> <p>  We continue to see more customers change the way they bank.  Today, seven out of ten active personal current account customers choose to bank using digital channels and in the first quarter of this year, we have seen a 31% increase in mobile payments and transfers compared with quarter 1 2018.  We are listening to what our customers want from us and innovating to make our customer experience effortlessly everyday and brilliant when it matters.</p><p>In the past year, we have introduced new applications and services such as: ClearSpend, which gives businesses better control of their expenses; Manage my Mortgage for our residential mortgage customers, enabling them to make changes to their mortgage online and from the comfort of their home; and Cora, our new artificial intelligence-driven digital banking assistant to help answer customer queries 24-7 every day of the year.  We have also been adding more features such as FaceID and paperless processes for our everyday banking products, making the digital experience simpler and more secure for customers.</p><p> As I mentioned, our strategy is both high-tech and high-touch.  We have invested in our physical presence, expanded our mortgage broker panel and increased the number of mobile mortgage managers across the country, offering flexible meeting times and locations, chosen by our customers.  We have five mobile banks, a community protection adviser and our team of community bankers.  We are continuously improving our branch network and 41 branches have seen investment.  We plan more this year.  New needs arise for our customers and last year we launched Friends Against Scams.  We are committed to playing our part in the fight against fraud so we trained colleagues across the bank.  We are educating customers on how to protect themselves against the horrific practices of scams which, when they happen, can impact consumers and our customers so badly.</p><p> Since our previous appearance before the committee, we have made progress on reducing our non-performing loans, NPLs, which stand at just over 10% of the total, but there is more to do.  Our regulators have set out capital requirements for NPLs and those requirements mean that over the coming years we will need to increase the capital we hold up to a point where we will have to hold enough capital for the full amount of the non-performing loan.  That capital is then tied up and we cannot use it to support loan growth which would contribute to the Irish economy.  To be clear, our priority is to work with our customers to put in place long-term sustainable arrangements so that as many customers as possible can remain in their home and paying off their mortgage.  We have invested in additional resources to ensure that every customer has every opportunity to engage with us to enter into a long-term solution.  We have found that when customers have worked with us, a solution can be found for four out of five, meaning they can remain in their homes.</p><p> We have also made significant progress on our customer remediation programmes to put right our wrongs of the past and learn from our mistakes.  We completed a thorough process to identify all impacted tracker mortgage customers and we do not anticipate any new or additional impacted upon groups of tracker customers to emerge at this point.  We have made redress and compensation payments to all tracker mortgage examination customers for whom we have contact details.  The thorough review identified other issues relating to errors on the accounts of business and mortgage customers that we will have resolved by the middle of this year and end of this year respectively.  Let me take the opportunity now, as this is my first time in front of the committee, to sincerely apologise for our past mistakes and the impact they had on our customers.</p><p> Turning to Brexit, the subject is top of mind for many customers, although many of our business customers tell us also that shortages of both skilled and unskilled labour is a bigger issue.  Supporting our customers is a top priority and we continue to do this, first, by communicating what we can do to support them to understand the impacts of Brexit and, second, drawing to their attention all the Government and agency supports available, which are excellent.  We see different types of businesses that can adapt and which are adapting.  Many are well-prepared and have sound contingency plans.  There are particular challenges for some customers who export to the UK or who use the UK as a land bridge to the European market.  Where additional resources and guarantees are required in respect of customs and tariffs, for example, we are ready to support our customers.</p><p> We continue to monitor the impact of the UK decision to leave the European Union on the bank and our customers and have been preparing for a number of scenarios, including a no-deal position, as part of our contingency planning as a stand-alone bank and as part of RBS.  There has been no material impact noted to date; however we are conscious of the potential for future impacts on the bank, our customers and our operations.  A bank-wide Brexit response programme has been mobilised to assess those impacts and to develop contingencies under a number of Brexit scenarios to ensure that we can continue to serve our customers well.  Regardless of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, our aim is to support customers with the same level of service and range of products as we do today and to help them address any related challenges.</p><p> The committee also asked me to address the topic of the accountability framework.  I welcome the introduction of the senior executive accountability regime and I know from my experience in the UK how such a regime can make a difference to promoting stronger accountability, ethics and culture in financial services.  Increased accountability will be better for our customers and for society as a whole and while a senior executive accountability regime alone will not transform culture within the banking industry, it will help.</p><p> I will finish on the topic of culture.  Much has been said about banking culture at this committee and at other fora in recent times.  We in Ulster Bank have learned many lessons.  We got things wrong and we are fixing mistakes from the past and learning from them.  We are absolutely committed to rebuilding trust with our customers and Irish society.  We recognise we have much to do and we are changing.  We are making different decisions today from those we may have made in the past.</p><p> In Ulster Bank we have defined our culture as "the way we do things" and it is consistently living our values to act in the best interests of our customers, colleagues and stakeholders.  Our four core values &ndash; serving customers, working together, doing the right thing and thinking for the long term &ndash; guide our priorities, activities and decision making.  We have strengthened our risk and control environment to reduce the possibility of errors occurring.  We are building a customer-focused culture where colleagues are encouraged to help customers be financially fitter and to speak up if and when see things that might look wrong or if they have any concerns.  Tone from the top is something I and my leadership team are conscious of every day.  This is one of the reasons I have personally committed to completing the Institute of Bankers professional diploma in leading cultural change and ethical behaviours in financial services and sitting on the Irish Banking Culture Board.</p><p> I am pleased to report we have made progress over the past 12 months across our customer, operational and financial metrics, along with the continued execution of our strategy to transform Ulster Bank.  We are happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I wish her well and every success, although I know she is well settled into her role at this stage.  I welcome her colleagues, Mr. Paul Stanley and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Coyle, and I thank the witnesses for the comprehensive responses to the questionnaire we received in advance of the meeting.  I also thank Ms Howard for her opening statement.</p> <p>  I will start with the matter of NPLs and the work that must be done to reduce non-performing loan ratios.  The opening statement indicates the current NPLs level is just over 10% and it is acknowledged in the replies in section 4 of the questionnaire that the regulators expect banks to reduce the level of NPLs towards the European average and have set out capital requirements that must be adhered to in respect of those loans.  Will Ms Howard outline her understanding as chief executive of where it must go in terms of the NPLs ratio, when it needs to do this and how it intends to get there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jane Howard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019050900002#D00300"><p>There is not a specific target set by the European Central Bank but it is clear that any bank with NPLs in excess of a 5% level is regarded as having a high number of NPLs.  The banks are expected to have a plan to reduce those towards the European average.  We have seen that European average reduce more recently to between 3% and 3.4%.  That is sound risk management for any bank.  Although we do not have a specific target, we absolutely understand our commitment to reduce our level of NPLs.</p> <p>  As the Deputy notes, we have made progress.  The last time representatives of the bank were before the committee, the level was approximately 17% and it is currently 10.3%.  It is important that I highlight our first priority, which is to help customers with a non-performing loan - a mortgage - to get into a long-term and sustainable solution.</p><p>Accordingly, we have always contacted customers who are in arrears.</p><p> We have also committed additional resources to ensure that we can contact all of our customers who are in a non-performing status so that they can engage with us and we can help as many of them as possible.  We have employed additional resources because the economy is stronger, unemployment is at a lower rate of just under 5%, many of our customers who are in a non-performing status have higher available incomes and house prices have increased significantly.  Against that background, we have found that when customers fully engage with us, which includes completing a standard financial statement, we can offer a long-term solution to four out of five customers that keeps them in their homes.  Sadly, we cannot find a long-term solution for one in five customers who engage with us that keeps them in their homes.  It is almost an impossible situation.  In such circumstances, we work with the customers on an individual basis and examine other options.  These might include mortgage-to-rent or a voluntary surrender.</p><p> Our priority is to help customers, but we need to reduce our number of NPLs.  While there is no target, there is an expectation that we reduce them.  We believe that is right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019050900002#E00200"><p>The bank's current rate in respect of NPLs is 10.3%.  We have heard from a number of other banks that they have attached particular significance to the end of this year.  Has that been communicated to Ulster Bank?  Is there a figure it needs to reach or is there pressure on it to reduce the number of its NPLs significantly by year end?  That would most likely only be achieved by way of a step change reduction through a portfolio sale.  Ulster Bank has already undertaken portfolio sales, but that type of sale is controversial.  While the Central Bank, the Department and bank CEOs always tell this committee that protections travel with the loan and the mortgage contract remains unchanged, we have also heard from the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, and the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, which have outlined a number of specific instances where they felt that customers were disadvantaged when their loans were sold on.  The most significant change is the change in attitude.  While Ulster Bank may make every endeavour to reach a restructuring arrangement with a borrower, the same may not hold true for the fund that purchases the loan because that fund takes a much shorter-term view regarding the loan's return.  Is there an onus on Ulster Bank to reduce its NPL rate further this year?  If so, are further loan portfolio sales on the table and actively under consideration?</p></speech>

We do not have a specific target, but there is an expectation that we will move towards 5%.  We are likely to set that ambition for next year rather than this year.  However, we indicated during our third quarter results last year that we would be expecting to conduct a further sale.  We still expect that, but our first priority is to help all of our customers to find a solution.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1135" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Stanley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019050900002#E00500"><p>I will address that question.  As Ms Howard stated, we took a provision in the third quarter of last year for an estimated size of loan sale, but we are going through a process of engaging with all customers who will engage with us to define what the perimeter of the loan sale will be.  It will principally comprise PDHs because most of our non-performing buy-to-lets are effectively gone at this stage.  The key for us is working with our customers on trying to find out whether, due to the points that Ms Howard has mentioned, there are long-term sustainable solutions for them.  If there are, they will not form part of the perimeter and we will have to adjust appropriately whatever provisions we have taken.</p></speech>

Almost a year ago - in June 2018 - Ulster Bank announced the lowest rate on the market, namely, a two-year fixed rate of 2.3%.  How has that gone for the bank?  Has the bank promoted it sufficiently?  It is a two-year offer, so it is not long term.  At the time, however, it was by some distance the lowest rate on the market.  I believe it still is the lowest even though others are coming closer to it.  I had hoped that it would start something of a price war in mortgages, although our guests might not have welcomed that.  Is Ulster Bank getting a return from it?  Is the bank winning new business on the back of that rate?</p></speech>

We offer a range of rates to all of our new and existing customers.  We have the lowest fixed rate on the market at 2.3%, which fits with our strategy.  We are finding that more than 80% of the new mortgages that we are writing today are on the fixed rate.  Customers tell us that they like the rate and that it gives them certainty of payment.  The latter is important to our customers.  We deliberately went out to compete because we wanted to grow our market share in mortgages.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019050900002#E01200"><p>Perhaps Mr. Coyle will also inform us of the bank's current market share of new business being written.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right about the two-year fixed rate.  We also have the lowest four-year fixed rate in the marketplace.  To build on Ms Howard's point, we have seen good momentum in the business.  I will help the committee to understand what we have done.  For nearly a year, we have had an extensive marketing campaign across media - outdoors, radio, cinema, etc.  Judging by our marketing team and market analysis, this has had the exact level of impact that we wanted.  In recent months, we invested in and launched a new online portal to make it easier than ever for customers to switch to the new rate.  If an existing customer is on a variable or fixed rate, he or she can go online from the comfort of home and change to any of our new rates in a matter of minutes, 24 hours per day, when it would previously have taken a couple of weeks.</p> <p>  Regarding performance, when we last appeared before the committee, we mentioned that our natural stock in this market was approximately 14%.  We were slightly behind that figure then.  At the end of the first quarter of this year, though, we had a drawdown market share of over 16% and our approvals were slightly higher than that.  To build on Ms Howard's point, we are hearing from our customers that they like the clarity and certainty regarding what they pay.  Effectively, rates remain important to our customers.  We are making other changes beyond the rates to make the process of coming to us easier and faster.  It is a work in progress, but it is having an impact as well.</p></speech>

The online portal works on the basis of the initial valuation we have of the property.  It corresponds with the value in the house price index we take from the Central Statistics Office and it applies the LTV based on that.  If, however, a customer believes his LTV band is better than that derived from the index, he can get a valuation done.  If it proves to be correct, we will apply the correct LTV band.</p></speech>

Many individuals, including first-time buyers, see an attraction.  I hold the view that they end up paying more in the long run because they are paying a higher interest rate, but it can be difficult for people to weigh up where their best long-term interests lie, and &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 upfront can be attractive if one is buying a home and needs to furnish it.  How does this play out in the market?  Cash-back packages are attractive to individuals on the one hand but the bank believes it is offering better long-term value.  How is it finding people's ability to weigh it up and balance what is in their best interest?</p></speech>

We do actually support the first-time buyers also.  We have, however, chosen to do so in a way that supports them with what is relevant to their buying of their home.  Mr. Coyle shall talk a little about that because it is important to us.</p></speech>

We help make contributions to people's legal fees, because these are practical costs that customers face.  We also help make contributions towards life assurance, which is also important to customers, and we make contributions towards their home insurance.  We see it as a combination of the low rate plus other elements we know matter to our customers.</p> <p>  With regard to the dynamic, it is very dependent on customers' circumstances.  The research we are doing backs up the fact that we are a fixed-rate-led mortgage provider.  That is our strategy and it has been for a period.  It is because feedback indicates that value for money and rates are still the most important things to people.  The certainty of a rate over a period and the transparency it brings are important.  Home buying occurs at a busy time in people&rsquo;s lives.  Therefore, the best approach is being very clear on the rate and the duration of payments.  It also involves giving people the best choices over two years, four years and seven years.  We have rates across that whole period.  So far, we can see the momentum this approach is creating in business.</p></speech>

I am sure Ms Howard is aware that Ulster Bank was pretty slow in getting up to speed and coming to grips with the tracker mortgage issue.  It took a long time to identify the relevant accounts and pay out in redress and compensation.  The message the bank is giving us in the questionnaire is that it is pretty much there, or very close to being there.  I have a question on the overall numbers.  The total paid to date for redress compensation and contributions towards advice is &euro;120 million, give or take.  The bank's overall provision is just under &euro;300 million.  Is the balance the operating cost of running the operation?  Have the witnesses factored in a potential enforcement fine from the Central Bank in respect of the enforcement investigation that is under way?</p></speech>

There have been some more payouts since then.  I have explained before that, out of &euro;297 million, there is roughly a 50:50 split between the costs of the examination from our side and the customer compensation and remediation.  One can take from this that there is still an element of around &euro;20 million or &euro;30 million odd still to paid out from 31 March.  That is a combination of some customers we have got to since that date and the 190 customers who, to date, we have been unable to contact.  We have highlighted that in the response also.</p></speech>

I assume the bank has a requirement to provide for the Central Bank fine.  The witnesses are very clear that, so far, the bank wrongly took &euro;95.54 million from its customers' accounts without their knowledge for many years.  It kept that money from them and has only recently given it back.  We all agree that the bank is going to be fined.  Is it not the case that it has to make provision?  Otherwise it would not be furnishing accurate accounts.</p></speech>

They have been noted by the Central Bank as part of that process.  If customers feel the compensation level is not appropriate given their particular circumstances, they have a right of appeal, including to the appeals panel.  They can appeal to the bank and take their case to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  They can take their case to the courts, if that is a requirement.  Therefore, there is a mechanism in place.  The levels of compensation are higher than the standard levels of compensation we would normally have across other remediation areas.</p></speech>

It states that with the help of the committee and Padraic Kissane, the writer was reinstated on a tracker mortgage last summer after a battle of almost ten years and that it was life changing for his family.  He states he received redress and compensation and a cheque of a certain amount to cover both, and a sum was taken off his mortgage.  He also states he is working with Mr. Kissane on an appeal.  The letter also states the amount of compensation awarded to the individual dwarfs the amount he has had to spend over the past ten years in preparing a case for the ombudsman, working with various financial advisers and voluntary organisations to try to get the bank to own up to what its CEO, Ms Howard, has just apologised for to the Irish people.  The amount of money he had to spend will not be covered as a point of principle by the bank.  Mr. Stanley is telling me this customer must appeal, perhaps to the ombudsman or through the courts, for the bank to give him what he should never have had to spend in the first place because the reason he spent it was because the bank took his money.</p></speech>

There are many cases like this.  This should be a point of principle.  If the bank were looking at a customer-centric approach, it would say to its customers that if they spent money on independent financial advice outside of the tracker mortgage examination to convince the bank it had done wrong to them and their families, then the bank would cover that cost.  It should not take me, letters or the bank's customers to tell the bank it should be doing the decent and right thing but it is not doing it.</p></speech>

We have information that Cerberus and Cabot, which is the servicing agent employed by Cerberus, are taking a very strong approach to the bank's previous buy-to-let customers.  They are appointing fixed asset receivers and giving former customers 30 days to clear all of their arrears or they will appoint fixed asset receivers.  The bank has employed two fixed asset receivers.  Deputy Michael McGrath is right, and we are saying this over and over again, that it is not about the protections that travel with the customer and the mortgage, it is the attitude.  The bank has appointed two fixed asset receivers.  The vulture is taking a policy decision to tell customers to clear their arrears within 30 days or it will put in place fixed asset receivers.  Does the bank have anything to say on this?  It has hung out it customers high and dry.  It has fed them to these vultures.</p> <p>  The bank knows fine well these were non-performing loans.  That does not mean they were not being paid, it means the customers were not able to pay the full amount and that they were in arrears.  The idea of any bank telling people to clear their arrears within 30 days or it will take its property is absolute madness.  That is what Ulster Bank has done to almost 2,200 customers who have tenants.  When fixed asset receivers are appointed, those tenants will be evicted.  That is what is happening here.</p> <p>  I have a letter from Cabot to a mortgage holder that states Cabot has noted there are arrears owing on an account mortgage - in the number and amount of X - and to assist the person in clearing these the following payment options are available but the letter then just gives the IBAN and BIC details of the bank.  The letter then states that failure to contact the office on receipt of the letter and clear the arrears in full within 30 calendar days from the date of the letter will leave Cabot no other option but to appoint a receiver over the secured property.</p><p>I can read Ms Howard other letters where former customers of Ulster Bank with multiple properties are in positive equity and are trying to sell the loans, but Cabot is saying "No".  They are willing to sell the properties and pay off the full amount but Cabot is saying it does not care.  It is telling them to clear their arrears within 30 days or it will appoint a fixed asset receiver.</p><p> We are told this is now policy within the vulture funds to which Ulster Bank handed its customer accounts, yet the bank has washed its hands and said it has nothing to do with it any more.  N&aacute;ire - shame on it for what it has done.  We warned it that this was going to happen.  This is what vultures do.  Has Ulster Bank no regard for people who made the bank profitable during good times and who are finding it difficult to make full repayments?  They are looking for a bit of time or support but are definitely not looking for this type of attitude.  In fairness, it is an attitude that Ulster Bank would not show to its customers.</p><p> How many buy-to-let customers does the bank have?  Can Ms Howard imagine her bank writing to customers tomorrow morning to tell them to clear their arrears within 30 days or it will repossess their homes?  People would take their accounts from the bank overnight and they would say they are having nothing to do with that.  However, the bank outsources its dirty work to the vultures and it is about to do it again.  Shame on it.  That is why we need this committee to pass my legislation, which will put in place a statutory responsibility to do what Ulster Bank should do anyway, that is, live up to the standards of the Central Bank, which says it should ask for permission before it sells to a vulture.  I ask Ms Howard for a response on how Ulster Bank has treated its customers. </p></speech>

Let me give a little colour.  As I said earlier, we are absolutely committed to contacting our customers even more, up to 18 times over two months, to see if we can help them to get onto a sustainable solution or another option.  That is very important because we are exploring everything first.  We have contacted nearly 10,500 customers in recent months, 2,500 of whom are in the early stages.  Some 5,000 of those are engaging with us and are co-operating.  I am using the word "co-operating" because that is the CCMA definition.  Of those 5,000, some 4,000 were offered a long-term solution and 1,000 were looking at different options.  We then have nearly 3,000 customers who are not contacting us and not engaging with us.  That worries us because we believe, based on the 5,000, that if people contact and engage, we may be able to help them.</p></speech>

They are engaging every bloody month when they are handing over their money.  There is a reason I say this.  Ms Howard is dodging the question.  I know some of these cases where the loans have been sold to a vulture fund and the people are about to have their property taken from them and their tenants evicted from their houses.  They are engaging.  They are paying the maximum amount that they have paid.  While Ms Howard says that they are not contacting the bank, they are paying.</p></speech>

We are trying our best to contact them and to ask them to get in touch with us to see how we can help them.  As I said, where we have done that, in four out of five cases, we are able to find a solution for them.  However, it is very hard for us to work with customers when they are not contacting us.  We exhaust those options before we come to the sale.  If any customers are listening today, we want them to get in contact with us and we will do whatever we can to help people.</p></speech>

Is it not the case that Ulster Bank sold to these vultures accounts of people who were both paying and engaging with the bank but who could not meet their full repayments, and they are now in the grips of the vultures, which are telling them to pay up within 30 days or they are taking the house and will sell the property with vacant possession, leaving their tenants high and dry?

I do not in any way think that these are people who are not interested in trying to help.  I think there might be fear of contacting the bank and there are all sorts of reasons.  That is why we are urging people to get in contact with us.  I have met people who are in arrears and people in NPL status.  There is a range of reasons they get into that situation.  At one extreme, there are incredibly sad situations or part crisis, and there may be illness and all sorts of reasons.  We genuinely want to try to help those people.  At the other extreme, when we have contacted people, we found that people have some money and they are able to get completely up-to-date with their arrears and get onto a sustainable solution.  We do not judge anybody at all.  It is all about trying to see what we can do to help them, and we do all of that before we do a sale.</p></speech>

Ms Howard knows the answer to this question because her bank could do it in the morning.  It would not do it because it would be absolutely appalling to do that, but vultures can do it because they do not give a damn.  They are here for a couple of years.

Not only were they told to clear their arrears within 30 days or the property would be taken and their tenants left high and try, there was a data breach, which resulted in their names, contact information, financial details and outstanding balances being released.  Ulster Bank put them in this position because it sold them.  We told the bank that if it sold to vultures, they would not care.  They play fast and loose.  Ulster Bank has a responsibility to treat its customers in an appropriate manner.  It gives a write-down to the vulture funds but it will not apply that to its customers.</p></speech>

I am aware that the bank is not required to have due regard to that, but we are all human.

It is much higher than that of the other Irish banks.  The level of capital, our core equity tier 1 ratio as it is referred to, is north of 27% at this point.  Our internal requirements would see the bank at 14% or 15% so, in effect, we hold double the capital we need.  That capital must earn a return or it should go back to the shareholder.  It costs us just physically having that capital sitting on our balance sheet because we must invest it in what are termed "high-quality liquid assets", which earn zero to negative returns.  There is a rationale in us paying back and getting to a more normalised level of capital within the bank, which will help its overall performance.</p></speech>

On the one hand, that money is being given to RBS and, on the other, the bank is trying to get vacant possessions and selling properties to vulture funds, which is causing a great deal of hardship.

I suppose that the whole issue is the moral aspect.  I am aware that the Government allows the banks to do this with deferred assets and so on but when we are in a situation with such homelessness - and considering Deputy Doherty's contribution on the vulture funds and people being given 30 days to pay up or get out - there is a moral obligation on the banks to look at things in the round, to treat Irish citizens a little bit better, and certainly not to contribute to the homeless crisis as it is.</p> <p>  I would like to get further clarification following on from Deputy Doherty's point because I am not clear on one part around people who needed help and assistance in trying to get back the very substantial amounts of money that was robbed from them.  Many people had their lives destroyed because of it.  Those people had to engage whatever supports or services they could, and not just legal services.  Will Ulster Bank Ireland allow for that within the compensation scheme?  I was not clear on that from the response.  What is the bank's policy on that?  </p></speech>

If customers feel that this has not been sufficient for compensation, aside from some exceptional circumstances we would certainly look at that for Deputy Doherty.  It is a reasonably straightforward process and we would help with that process in bringing those additional asks or requirements to the two levels of the appeals panels.  It may not just be about fees.  It could be lots of other issues also.</p></speech>

I will now turn to the bank's charges.  AIB charges too much for the use of ATMs while the Bank of Ireland charges 20 cent per debit card transaction.  Ulster Bank, however, combines the worst of both worlds by charging 35 cent for an ATM withdrawal and 20 cent per debit card transaction.  Why is that? Ulster Bank also charges for contactless payments.  Why are the charges so high?</p></speech>

We are talking here about the current accounts.  Fees and charges are a commercial decision.  The fees we have introduced in some way reflect our strategy.  As a bank we want to offer physical and digital choices for our customers.  Clearly it costs more depending on which channel a person uses to do his or her business.  We are moving in line with the market.  Our fees will remain under review, as one would expect, and-----</p></speech>

This is a commercial decision.  When we look at our fees and charges and the way we introduce them, we charge customers based on usage.  I would not say that we charge more.  I would look at it in the round and the full service offering we give, including having the lowest mortgage fixed rate on the market, as referred to earlier.  It is the entirety of the package.  Our customers can choose the preferred way to bank.  It is more expensive in some channels than others but we have a team of people ready to help anybody, in the branches or over the telephone, who would like to look at different ways of doing their banking.  Some 25% of our customers do not pay any fees; this is largely those customers who are over the age of 66 and our students.</p></speech>

It is interesting that we have created a tiered charging model that is aligned to the level of costs we incur.  If somebody chooses to come into a branch to take money out over the counter there is an 80 cent charge.  As Ms Howard has said this reflects the commercial reality of us employing people, premises, security and so on.  An element of the charge is for these overheads, if the customer chooses to do it that way.  We have people in branches up and down the country to support such customers.  The Senator referred to the ATM fee.  If a person wants to take money out through an ATM then it is a lesser charge of 35 cent.  This charge is driven by our costs for cash in transit fees when moving money around the State.  We also must secure the ATMs and the committee will be aware of the challenges with crimes on ATMs recently-----</p></speech>

If someone chooses to use the chip and pin payment, a direct debit or a standing order it is 20 cent.  The Senator also commented on our contactless payment charge, which is 1 cent.  The cost to us of effecting a contactless payment is not materially different from a person paying with chip and pin, but we recognise that in the market more and more people are using contactless payments for transactions under &euro;30.  It is quicker for customers and better for retailers.  We want to encourage that.  We give the contactless charge at a more discounted rate because we can see this is where the market trend is going.  On our overall fees versus those of our competitors, as Ms Howard has said I cannot comment on the cost base of our competitors and what their commercial decisions are.  In the round and given the options and transparency of fees we are satisfied with the blend we have right now.  The fees and charges, as was indicated, remain under review.  Putting this into context there are also the 25% of customers who are either students or those aged over 66 who do not pay fees and some 35% of customers who pay maintenance fees, which leaves us with 46% of people who pay the transactions fees.  This is the way we have been thinking about it.  I hope this is helpful in explaining the way we have approached it.</p></speech>

A tremendous amount of research has been done looking at how much difference it would make if the limit was increased by &euro;10 or if it actually needs to increase from &euro;30 to &euro;60, and what an increase would do to the fraud environment.  There are an awful lot of factors to be taken into account before the card schemes actually decide on the maximum amounts and a change to that.

There are no plans to close the branches.  In fact, we have actually increased our physical presence in recent months.  We are also investing in the branches.  As I said in my opening statement, our strategy is high tech and high touch because we know that customers like their daily banking to be effortless - they tell us this.  They enjoy using contactless payments but there are moments in people's lives when they want to have a named person and see someone.  At times, sadly, this can be during bereavements or it can be at nice times when a child is born or when seeking a mortgage.</p><p>Our customers tell us there are certain life events when they want to be able to speak to somebody.

As a rural dweller, I certainly do not trust that broadband will be delivered, even in the next seven years, to the area I come from.  Banking technology will advance all the time but if people do not have the necessary connectivity, that will be a real problem with regard to social exclusion and excluding customers, especially in rural areas.</p></speech>

With regard to the way we are thinking about our branches, if it helps the committee, we have 88 branches, we have mobile banks, community bankers, community protection advisers and mobile mortgage managers.  As Ms Howard said, there are physical and digital services.  The statistics show us that increasing numbers of people choose to engage with the mobile application, Internet banking or contactless cards for transactional activities.  We will continue to invest and we need to invest to secure that, upgrade systems and stay in line with regulatory changes.  New innovators in non-banks are coming into the markets.  We have invested tens of millions of euro in physical spaces in branches in the last couple of years, across a host of measures.  One is to put broadband into all of them.  Of the 88, 86 are done.  The role of the branch and what will happen inside it will invariably continue to change.  It will be less transactional.  The transaction capability will be there but it is more about supporting customers to give them advice, insight or help.</p></speech>

The Senator will recognise areas such as Glenamoy where we never had a presence historically.  We have community bankers going into those areas, in local community centres, meeting elderly people or, indeed, anybody, to help to do a couple of things with them.  It is to try to help them with financial education, to bring them up to speed with how things are changing and how we can help them.  Critically, we help them to protect themselves against fraud and scams, which are a growing issue.  People have a view that frauds and scams are a digital concept.  They are not.  They take all forms.  We are putting our community bankers in the communities, especially focused on rural areas.  We have held 70 events so far this year, across those parts of the country, helping people with that.</p></speech>

The anti-money laundering guidelines need to be revisited.  I think that case will evolve.  I want to ask two more questions.  One relates to deeds of houses.  If somebody has a loan on a house and pays it off in full, then asks at a local branch of an Ulster Bank for his or her deeds back, that person is told that they cannot be found.  The person can ask at the central office, then this can go on for years, and the person has to take a legal case against Ulster Bank.  Where are people's deeds held and can Ulster Bank lose deeds?  People are told at local branches that the deeds have been lost.  Surely people are entitled to get their deeds back without having to engage barristers and solicitors?</p></speech>

We have a defined process that within ten working days of a person asking for deeds, they should be back in his or her hands.

I wish Ms Howard well in her new job.  It is important that we have a strong banking sector in the country.  I have two brief questions.  The witnesses said their two-year and four-year fixed rates are the lowest in the country and that they have a new portal that will help to change mortgages from two to four or whatever.  That is welcome.  They also say that they are looking at legal fees, life assurance, life insurance and house insurance, and making contributions to them for customers.  Do the witnesses look at how much property tax would be when a client comes in?  Do the Revenue Commissioners contact the bank about the valuation of a house?  Is there communication between banks and the Revenue Commissioners?  Do they go into any detail about, and make provision for, property tax when the client  takes out the mortgage?  It is quite significant in some cases.</p></speech>

In that, we would look at all outgoings.  We have a team of very experienced mortgage advisers who would be thoughtful about what the costs are going to be when somebody moves into or buys a new home.  To that extent, we would expect property taxes to be included.  We look at people's future outgoings to make sure that people can afford the mortgage they are taking on.  I have not heard that it is a particular issue.</p></speech>

It has been brought to my attention in some cases that where the loans are being sold and where the vulture fund wants to get vacant possession, be it through eviction or the sale of the home, in some cases, it is the bank - Ulster Bank in this case - rather than the vulture fund that serves the eviction papers on the client.  When Ulster Bank sells its portfolio of loans, is it finished with them or does it still hold the papers and the rights to serve papers in this case if they are required to be served for court proceedings or evictions?</p></speech>

I want to touch on one item that has already been discussed, namely, non-performing loans.  I want to get a few benchmarks.  Ulster Bank is at 10% at the moment.

We do not have a specific target but the point I made is that it is clear from the regulators that there is an expectation that banks with non-performing loans in excess of 5% are regarded as having too high a percentage of non-performing loans.  Therefore, there is a very clear expectation that we would move towards the European average, which is running below 5%.  It is running at about 3.4%.</p></speech>

That is all I need to know.  My next point concerns Brexit.  Ulster Bank is unique in an Irish setting in that it is one of the four large pillar banks but effectively has a presence in Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  We are looking at Ulster Bank in the Republic of Ireland.  Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland is a separate entity and both are subsidiaries of RBS.  In respect of Ulster Bank customers and the Irish banking landscape, the witnesses noted that Ulster Bank has looked at a number of scenarios, including a no-deal Brexit, as a stand-alone bank.  Can the witnesses elaborate on the implications of what unfolds in the UK for Ulster Bank in the Republic of Ireland?</p></speech>

What we in the Republic of Ireland are concerned about is our customers, who will face different challenges.  Some of our customers export to the UK while others use it as a land bridge.  Depending on what happens with Brexit, and none of us knows what will happen, we need to support those customers.  Some of them will want to change their business model.  Some are capable of doing that while others are not.  Our focus will be on helping our customers in the Republic of Ireland.  The reason I express it that way is because there will be a different set of circumstances in the UK.  Does that explain it?</p></speech>

As well as trialling those, by the end of this year we will be testing what new branch designs might look like in a couple of locations in Dublin.  We think branch designs in the future will be different from what they have been in the past, and we spoke about that earlier.

At the larger end, they are in a unique position where they can afford to, in some examples, set up an additional plant in the UK and mitigate the risk.  At the very small end, they will be impacted by Brexit as, when, and if something happens and impacts the economy in Ireland.  It will impact their ability to do business locally, as a consequence of the economy.  There is also the middle group of customers, which is quite a range, but the biggest issue I hear about is not Brexit <i>per se</i>, but a lack of labour, both skilled and unskilled.  One hears about it whether in the middle of Dublin, Monaghan, or Cavan.  It does not matter where one is, that is one of the main things stopping customers from investing in their business or expanding it, and it worries them more than Brexit.<br/><br/>When one looks at the Brexit scheme, there is a concern about how prepared people are.  We have held road shows, and we have also written to customers about the obvious issues.  If one has been around as long as I have, one remembers things such as customs and excise and how painful that process is, and we need to make sure people have guarantees in place.  When we look at indicators of preparedness, we are looking at things like that.  For example, if someone is moving goods and does not have a guarantee in place, perhaps they do not understand that they will need that for goods to move, and then they would need an overdraft.</p></speech>

Are there aspects of the scheme that the witnesses would like to see changed, or that are not working?  Is it tied into taking on extra staff, or is there a reason the uptake is so low?  We are being told there are serious concerns around Brexit and being Brexit-ready.</p><p>Ms Howard was in the UK prior to coming to Ireland, and I would like to get her perspective in terms of what differences she sees in the Irish and UK landscapes.  Where does she see the differences in exposures on Brexit, and how does she feel we are prepared as a country in terms of business and across spectrums?  She brings an intellectual knowledge of what is happening on the ground in the UK with banking and business over the Irish Sea.</p><p>There are a number of aspects to my question, namely, whether the loan scheme, as structured, is the problem, Ms Howard's perspective on that, because she is looking at it, and a mark review on where she sees Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the UK in terms of the landscape and the Brexit, financial, and banking implications thereof.  I would like to hear her overall perspective as the head of one of the four main banks in Ireland. </p></speech>

Let me take that away and we will follow up on that to see whether we are not hearing it because we have not been asking the right questions or listening well enough.</p> <p>  The financial services in the UK and Ireland, and the impact of Brexit, are quite interesting in that they are very different.  If one is in financial services in London, which is clearly a central hub, the discussion there is about the fact that some of the skills and jobs have to be taken out of the UK and will be in a different part of Europe.  That is the concern one hears in the financial services market in the UK in terms of how it works.  When one comes to Ireland, we see that there are more banks choosing to make their European base in Ireland.  They are not necessarily retail banks, but that creates different challenges here such as competition for people with particular skillsets.  It is quite different in that regard.</p> <p>  When one comes down to customers, however, many things are the same.  If the economy is struggling, whether that is in the UK or here, then the concerns for customers are exactly the same regardless.  When one comes to preparedness, it is interesting because the UK has many schemes, including an RBS scheme directed specifically at supporting customers through Brexit, and they are not being drawn down either.  It is interesting that we have that similarity.  Even though governments, banks, and people are making help available, whether money or expertise and support, it is not being taken up in either Ireland or the UK.  </p></speech>

In terms of differences, I will start off with customers, and that is interesting in that there is not much difference.  When one thinks about customers, what they want, and what they tell us they want, it falls under five broad things.  They want to be able to borrow money from us, save with us, invest with a bank, protect the things that are precious to them, or they want us to help them make sure their banking is done well.  That includes education.  Those five things are no different here than they are in the UK.</p></speech>

For example, there is a lot more competition in the UK market than would typically be found here, in either retail or commercial banks.  There are differences there.</p> <p>  It is a privilege to be here.  We have more than 3,500 colleagues in Ulster Bank, and every day they come into work to do a great job for our customers.  The reality is that we have processes that get in their way of getting it right for customers, and equally, we need to change so that we get it right for customers every time.  The issue of consistency, which is key to culture, is absolutely crucial.</p><p>In terms of people wanting to do the right thing for customers in banking here, that is not much different from the UK.  Would the committee like me to talk a bit about culture?</p></speech>

The question is about the comparison at senior level, so she can tell me that the dynamics are different here and that the processes often get in the way of good staff, but it was not the staff who caused the tracker mortgage issue.  It was something else.  Was it a process that caused it, or was it the culture from board level?  What has caused the complete distrust of the public in the banking sector?</p></speech>

The Irish banks came out at the bottom of the Edelman trust barometer in terms of being least trusted by consumers.  The Irish Banking Culture Board survey on trust also made very sorry reading, and that trust is lower than in the UK, where a banking culture survey was also conducted.  The results here are lower in terms of consumers trusting banks.  Even though Ulster Bank scored well relative to other banks, it is not where we want to be, and we absolutely recognise that we have lot do to win back the trust of customers here in Ireland.</p> <p>  One thing that has been in the UK for a while is the senior management or accountability regime that is being introduced here.  What that did at a senior level was to make peoples' accountabilities and responsibilities very clear.  The current plan is for that to be introduced here in the first quarter of next year at the executive level.  It will also extend to board members, which it does not do in the UK, so we will go further here in Ireland than in the UK.</p> <p>  Culture is everything we do all the way from strategy down to how we serve the customer.  It is the way I behave, and the way the executive team behaves.  It is what we do and what we do not do.  All of that will impact the culture of Ulster Bank, and if we lead and put the customers first in our strategy, decision-making, and making sure we have better services for them, then that is how we will be seen and trusted by the Irish public and Irish customers.  They will decide on whether we do that well or not. </p></speech>

She should be in the D&aacute;il Chamber because she has given a political response.  I ask her to go back to it again.  What differences did she find between the culture here that led us into the crash and the tracker mortgage issue, and where she came from in the UK?</p> <p>  It is clear that customers were robbed by the banks, not just Ulster Bank but others as well.  The banks are just giving their customers' money back to them, and a lot of banks make a big song and dance about doing that, as if it were a good news story.  It is not, because the banks are just returning the money that was stolen from their customers.  The people do not have trust in the banks, and they are waiting for a banker who will give a straight answer to a question.  Did Ms Howard find a rotten culture here that she could describe by comparison to the UK, or is it the same?</p></speech>

As I said, we have more than 3,500 people in Ulster Bank and they are trying their best to help our customers get financially fitter.  It would be wrong for me to sit here and say that it is very different.  The UK may be further ahead, but it has had the payment protection insurance, PPI, issue, and it had that earlier than we had the tracker issue here, so I think it has moved, worked on its culture, and focused on customers earlier than we have.  It did have the same cultural issues, it just happened to be a different product.  Our commitment, and my commitment, is that we are going to take culture very seriously.  We are doing that and that work started before I arrived.  It comes to focusing on one's customers, listening to them, and acting on what they are telling us.</p></speech>

I am a CEO on the board as a bank representative, and there are also bankers from the other banks at different levels and in different roles.  Mr. Justice Hedigan has also chosen other members of society as well, so he has built a very diverse board of people who represent the customers or those who work in the industry.</p></speech>

I find that to be the strangest thing ever, because regardless of what one's business background is, whether it is big or small, the customer is the key to the success of one's business.  Here, the banks have to fund a board that will lead them to understand that, so they must really have gone off course in the last ten years.</p></speech>

According to Ulster Bank's analysis of the sale, 1,500 accounts were sold in 2015; 2,874 were sold in 2016; nothing was apparently sold in 2017; and 3,937 were sold in 2018.  In answer to a question earlier on, it was stated that Ulster Bank has almost &euro;1 billion of loans still to sell if it is to get down to 5%.</p> <p>  How much work does Ulster Bank undertake on any individual loan, particularly on the mortgage end, or even the buy-to-let end?  Those, after all, are homes for some people too.  What analysis is done of the social consequences or the consequences to society arising from these loans being sold on?  Does Ms Howard believe that the bank, until now, has endeavoured to get down to the real issues in each of these loans?  Has the bank made its best effort to ensure that a roof is kept over those peoples' heads?</p> <p>  Does Ms Howard think her bank has done that?</p></speech>

Those are typically the mortgage customers, and we are committed to engaging with them and to trying to help them get on to a solution, which is ideally to remain in their homes.</p><p>In some cases it might be helping with mortgage to rent or assisted surrender so they can go into another home they can afford to be in but we are committed to doing that.

The vulture will just take the whole loan for profit.  It does not give a damn about regulation or anything else.  The manner in which some of the vulture funds' agents are treating the people in this country is shocking and we are told constantly in these Houses and in this committee that the protection follows.  It does not.  They are a ruthless bunch who want nothing out of the Irish economy only profit and they do not care what sort of situation they leave behind, whether it is people in desperation or a devastated society.  They do not care.  What I am saying to Ms Howard is that is quite different from someone coming forward to Ulster Bank Ireland, asking if the bank cares about them and to help them transfer their loans to a charity that is not for profit.  Is it possible that within the change of culture in the banks, that the banks would accept that things went wrong and that there is a need for a change of culture and to signal that the banks would work with the not-for-profit organisations if they came forward?</p></speech>

As Mr. Coyle articulated earlier, we have helped more customers buy a home, we are saving them money when they switch to us and we are keen to do more of that when we have the best rates and we are keen to work to make sure the switching process from one bank to another is easier than it is at the moment.</p><p>Equally, on the business side there are customers who want to borrow and who are expanding.  We are keen to help them also.  We are demonstrating growth in that area and we have a good momentum into this year.</p><p> We are continuing to invest in digital.  There is no doubt that we have some customers who only want to do their banking digitally.  We need to be able to offer a solution that is as good as Revolut or something similar.  We do not think that is enough, however, and we believe it is right to offer a bank that is digital and physical, which is in line with our strategy.  We have a good, sound strategy and we are delivering against it.</p></speech>

Obviously, they relate to the prudential side.  One of the regulations relates to the need for retaining more capital in respect of non-performing loans and, as we discussed earlier, the averages and the desire to get banks to below 5% of non-performing loans because that percentage is seen as being high.  Undoubtedly, we will continue to see new regulation coming out, particularly as one gets new developments.  It could come out on the conduct side, which would be from the Central Bank, or it could come out from the EU.  As technologies develop and as we see things such as artificial intelligence being used in robotics there will need to be new regulation to ensure that consumers are protected.</p></speech>

It is a criminal offence and an investigation takes place.  When the ATM is within a retail outlet, it can depend on whether it is branded to a certain bank.  In those circumstances, there is potential to share the costs.  I will have to check the position for the Senator.  There would also be non-banks that are in the ATM market.  We have seen in recent weeks where it has happened and where the bank involved is ultimately going to be liable for the costs and must manage the risks around that.  This is one of the reasons we discussed earlier for having to cover some of the costs associated with banking in general but with ATMs in particular.</p></speech>

If the Chairman is in agreement, I will begin by saying something about the Centre for Cross Border Studies and the Towards a New Common Chapter project before Ms Farrell, Ms Coyle and Ms Dickson tell the committee about their own organisations and their involvement in the project.  I will also draw the committee's attention to the New Common Charter for Cooperation Within and Between these Islands, of which members should have a copy, as this is the ultimate reason for our attendance.</p> <p>  Since its creation in 1999, the Centre for Cross Border Studies has sought to contribute to the increased social, economic and territorial cohesion of the island of Ireland by promoting and improving the quality of cross-Border co-operation.  The centre's pursuit of its mission has been framed by two primary public policy imperatives: the European Union's cohesion policy with its focus on social, economic and territorial cohesion, and the commitment to cross-Border and North-South co-operation integral to strand two of the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  Throughout its existence, therefore, the centre has been deeply concerned with community, social and economic development and co-operation, particularly on the island of Ireland but also between the island of Ireland, Great Britain and beyond.  This concern has informed the centre's desire to initiate the Towards a New Common Chapter project.  The project began in late 2014 and has been made possible with the generous support of the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, Northern Ireland's Community Relations Council, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's reconciliation fund.  The project has looked to support and inspire grass-roots community commitment to cross-Border co-operation in all its dimensions, these being co-operation at the Border, wider North-South co-operation, and east-west co-operation between the island of Ireland and Great Britain.  It has worked towards a bottom-up vision of the importance and role of cross-Border co-operation within and between these islands while also noting the need for community groups to possess the necessary skills and capacity not only to engage in their own cross-Border initiatives but also to enter into more productive dialogues with relevant local, regional and central government policies and strategies.</p> <p>  The result of a series of intensive conversations between a range of community groups from Northern Ireland and Ireland, and more recently with groups from England, Scotland and Wales, is the New Common Charter for Cooperation Within and Between these Islands that committee members should have in front of them.  It represents a shared desire to maintain and strengthen relations between communities across these islands, to work together on issues of common concern, and to advocate for the provision of the requisite structures and means to co-operate within and between these islands in whatever circumstances may arise.</p><p>In light of this committee&rsquo;s specific role, and given that the sets of relations envisioned within the New Common Charter for Co-operation Within and Between these Islands reflect the core strands of the Good Friday Agreement, we would ask members to support it and work with us in ensuring all administrations across these islands put in place policies and funding structures to encourage cross-border and cross-jurisdictional co-operation at grassroots community level.  We hope that today&rsquo;s meeting will offer an opportunity to discuss the work undertaken as part of the Towards a New Common Chapter project, and how members of this committee and political representatives more generally can champion the objectives of the new common charter.  These are outlined in more detail in the series of recommendations within the supporting information provided to the committee.  They include how capacity-building measures should be introduced to improve how all levels of government and public bodies across these islands engage with community organisations in the development of policies and strategies with a cross-border or cross-jurisdictional dimension, as well as the need for a comprehensive assessment of the current funding landscape for cross-border and cross-jurisdictional co-operation initiatives aimed at community organisations, and what that landscape should look like going forward.  Crucially, we would also like to see concrete support in advancing the work undertaken in the Towards a New Common Chapter project, bringing it to a wider audience, and perhaps looking towards a platform for cross-border and cross-jurisdictional dialogue for community organisations that recalls the structure provided for governments and administrations across these islands through the British-Irish Council.</p><p> These are issues we may explore further during today&rsquo;s meeting, but I will hand over now to Ms Tara Farrell of Longford Women&rsquo;s Link.</p></speech>

I would like to thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation.  Longford Women&rsquo;s Link is a social enterprise founded in 1995 which provides services to approximately 900 women and 130 children in Longford annually.  These services include education, entrepreneurship, community employment and a domestic violence service, which we deliver using our unique model of integrated service delivery.  We also engage in widespread regional and national advocacy.  Our CEO is on the board of the National Women's Council of Ireland, while I am on the board of Irish Rural Link, and I am the current chairperson of AONTAS, the national adult learning organisation.  I am also on the steering group of The Next Chapter, which is an Irish Rural Link, Politics Plus and Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action, NICVA, initiative based in Stormont.</p> <p>  One of our flagship programmes is the Women's Manifesto programme, which is a unique model of local democratic participation that aims to support women in rural Ireland to play an active and meaningful role in their local decision-making structures.  Just last week, we launched the She project with the 50:50 North West group, supported by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  This aims to change the face of local government in rural Ireland by supporting women to play an active role in public life.  The Women&rsquo;s Manifesto project was supported by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust from 2012 until the cessation of the trust&rsquo;s funding in the Republic of Ireland in 2016.  Longford Women&rsquo;s Link and the Women&rsquo;s Manifesto programme have been active members of the Towards a New Common Chapter initiative since 2015 and see it as a key all-island programme of sustained engagement as we move beyond the Brexit referendum.  We believe that working at grassroots level, as this programme most definitely does, is absolutely critical if we are to see meaningful co-operation and community development alongside an empowered civic society across these islands.  We have seen with Brexit what happens when civil society is largely excluded from central discussions, and we believe that the voices of grassroots women, especially in rural areas, not only need to be heard but are essential in building inclusive and resilient communities.  We believe there is significant potential within the New Common Charter to do this.</p> <p>  If we are to have an effective democratic society that embodies the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement with active, engaged citizens and communities, then first we need support for the New Common Charter and second, support for civil society organisations.  This means financial support, but we believe it is an investment not only in our communities, but in the future of these islands.</p></speech>

NIRWN is a grassroots membership organisation which responds to its members' needs.  Our overall mission is to try to influence key decision-makers through providing a voice and representation for rural women, ensuring their equal and valued position in society.  NIRWN seeks to increase the voice of rural women at a policy level; to advocate and lobby on behalf of rural women; to provide information and networking opportunities; to pilot innovative projects such as this one; and to hold statutory bodies to account to measure the impact of their decisions on rural women.  We do this, among other things, through advocacy, organising local and regional networking events, providing an information service to Government Departments, and supporting any organisations that wants to link with rural women, to hear what they need and what their concerns are.  NIRWN is also a partner organisation in the North as part of the Women&rsquo;s Regional Consortium, which consists of seven women&rsquo;s sector organisations that have come together to try to provide a voice for women from disadvantaged and rural areas.  We are the rural element of that, as the other organisations are based in Derry-Londonderry and Belfast.  It is critical that we get rural women at the table, and our centres and groups work in partnership with each other for the needs of women regionally.</p> <p>  NIRWN has been engaged in the Towards a New Common Chapter initiative because it is a grassroots effort to build and develop co-operation across our islands.  As Ms Farrell said, Brexit has brought home very clearly how imperative that is, and the implications we are dealing with now of not having had that in place.  Taking account of historic barriers, there is a lack of parity and gender representation across our island and women have certainly been historically invisible in the North.  Even their peace-building as part of the Good Friday Agreement has been largely written out of our recent history.</p> <p>  The development and emergence of community and civic leaders, taking collective action to break silence, and to share space, for the greater good, requires leadership from within, as well as encouragement and support from external agencies and governments.  Community development offers active and potentially active individuals a process and a route they can use to lead and facilitate collective visioning and action.  Building peace in our rural areas and communities is all about supporting the processes that lead to an absence of violence, conflict, and fear, as well as flourishing economic, social and political justice in our rural areas, peaceful co-existence and the shared democratic use of power.  Even physically, rural people are further away from the decision-making spaces, and it is much harder to get one's voice and issues heard on how one experiences differences and change in one's area.  It is imperative that women in rural areas are listened to and supported so their historic invisibility is not mirrored in our post-conflict society.</p></speech>

Engender is Scotland&rsquo;s feminist policy organisation.  We work to give effect to women&rsquo;s equality and rights at local, national and international levels, to increase women&rsquo;s access to power, safety, and resources, and to make visible the impact of sexism on women, men and society.  With over 25 years&rsquo; experience in gendered policy and advocacy, we are ambitious in our desires to build a Scotland which secures equality for all women, and which works collaboratively with international and Scottish partners.  We work across a wide range of national policy portfolios to advocate for women&rsquo;s economic, social, and political equality with men, including social security, justice, public space and political representation.  Our Gender Matters roadmap, published in 2017, sets out a series of measures that, with political will, can be taken by the Scottish Government and other bodies in order to move towards women&rsquo;s equality in Scotland by 2030.</p> <p>  Internationally, we also represent Scotland on the UK Joint Committee on Women, through which we work closely as a member of the European Women&rsquo;s Lobby, EWL, and in 2018 we worked to consult with women in Scotland and across the UK as part of the shadow report to the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW.  To that end, we worked with sister organisations both locally and across the UK and internationally as part of our Gender Matters Internationally portfolio to highlight women&rsquo;s inequality as a global concern. </p> <p>  Engender became involved in the Towards a New Common Chapter initiative in 2018 through our links with women&rsquo;s sector organisations in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  Engender was asked to host a Scottish event for the project as part of its fourth stage in 2019, which focused on building support for the draft charter in community organisations in England, Wales and Scotland.  At this grassroots session, women&rsquo;s organisations based in Scotland were presented with the draft and we offered our thoughts on its scope and relevance to our experiences and priorities.  Engender was then invited to the evaluation session in Belfast in March 2019. </p> <p>  We value the process of the New Common Charter and its potential to further expand the networks we have relied on so far, and continue to do so, as well as its potential to encourage grassroots collaboration on projects of shared importance, particularly women&rsquo;s equality.  In the context of Brexit and the potential for further devolution, partnership working enables us to learn from one another&rsquo;s activities and successes.</p><p>We appreciate the opportunity to share space for discussion with communities, grassroots and other civil society organisations with shared ambitions and from other sectors in a forum which promotes collaboration, sustained engagement and critical expertise.</p></speech>

Coming from County Roscommon, I am familiar with the great work done by Ms Farrell and her organisation in County Longford.  The common charter is great news and very welcome because we have taken our relationships for granted North, South, east and west.  Brexit has brought a significant realisation that we are very close but it has caused much hurt and many issues need to be repaired.  The charter refers to valuing the musical, literary, artistic and cultural traditions.  We are familiar with that as well as sporting and other issues.</p> <p>  In every second house in the middle or west of Ireland, from where I come, somebody has worked in the UK or has relations there.  That is something we take for granted.  There are almost 15 or 16 daily flights to the UK from Ireland West Airport Knock.  After centuries of trade between our countries, the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce was established in 2011 when the Queen came to Ireland.  It has gone from strength to strength.  The London Irish Construction Network was also established.  We have begun to effectively mobilise and understand the importance of trade and sporting, cultural and religious links North, South, east and west, which is very welcome.</p> <p>  It is very welcome that Mark Durkan from Derry is running for Fine Gael in the European Parliament elections because it brings an influence.  My colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, who is present, is from east Belfast and brings flavour to the Seanad, which is very welcome.  More than a year ago, Senator Marshall became the first unionist to be appointed to the Seanad.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile can speak for himself, but I have noticed that he has brought people to the Republic or the Houses of the Oireachtas who would not otherwise interact with our Parliament.  That is one thing we have left out on a political level.  The Seanad is probably the most suitable vehicle to promote and share those ideas and to meet like-minded politicians.</p> <p>  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, made up of politicians from the various Parliaments, meets at a plenary session every six months.  It may now be time for a second Assembly, similar to the Seanad, in Stormont.  I acknowledge that the Assembly is not up and running.  Perhaps it is time to invite members of the diaspora in the UK to form part of the Seanad, as Senator Lawless represents the diaspora in the US.  They would not have to be from an Irish background.  It may be a person representing the British Labour Party or the Conservatives.  It may be time for the Scottish Parliament or Welsh Assembly to consider establishing an upper house.  It may be time for somebody from the Republic to sit in the House of Lords.  That would, at least, build up those relationships.</p> <p>  I have noticed from chairing the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly that there is goodwill towards the island of Ireland among UK politicians in spite of Brexit.  A few of them do not understand it but there is significant goodwill, as there is goodwill in our Oireachtas towards Northern Ireland and the UK.  That may be an opportunity that has been left out of the project.  I wish to hear the opinions of the witnesses in that regard.  It can be a controversial subject.  Some parties do not take their seats in Westminster and I respect that that is a matter for them.  There is an opportunity on a political level, especially after Brexit.  We have seen the great work done by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and its committees.  Some 21 years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, we very much need to move on a political level.</p></speech>

The headline is co-operation between these islands.  If the witnesses are uncomfortable answering the question, they do not have to do so.  Clearly, we are here to discuss co-operation and if they feel the Senator's suggestion is the way forward, it may form part of the discussion.  Others may have a different view.</p> <p>  There are other structures in place.  The committee has heard from some of the partnerships that are operating North and South.  We recently heard from such a partnership based in the north west and made up of councillors from the North and South.  All members found much of its work very positive.  It is signalling areas of co-operation that need to be followed through on.  Do the witnesses consider such groups worthwhile?</p> <p>  Senator Feighan referred to the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  Many members are frustrated that we are not really engaging with many of the communities that we represent in the different jurisdictions.  There is a sense that it might be a bit stale and we may have to examine those structures and so on.  However, the partnerships, particularly those which are currently operating on a cross-Border basis, are coming up with very positive solutions regarding co-operation and economic development and road structures.  Is there something which the two Governments ought to be doing in regard to the structures that are currently operating?  Everyone looks at what is not happening but in terms of what is happening on the ground, are the structures worthwhile?  Should they be enhanced?  Should there be follow-through regarding what supports are needed and so on?  Is that the sense of the witnesses in regard to many of those groups which they meet?</p></speech>

This is very much a grassroots charter produced by community organisations.  It is their vision for how they wish to co-operate and the value they place on that.  The institutions created under the Good Friday Agreement, such as the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Interparliamentary Conference, as well as structures such as the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly &ndash; to which we very much look forward to presenting the new common charter next Monday &ndash; may not have not been exploited to their full potential by one or both Governments, or perhaps some of the administration has not evolved.  For example, one could look to the persons who head the delegations of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Parliaments to the British-Irish Council and note the persons who lead the representations from the Irish and UK Governments to the same organisations.  Such an examination left me with the impression that insufficient importance is given to the structure by one of those members, while the others send their highest representatives to take part.</p><p>Institutions and channels exist to allow parliamentarians to co-operate and engage in dialogue.  As the Senator noted, it is essential that those opportunities for North-South and east-west dialogue exist and involve all parliamentarians.  Turning to civil society, however, we do not see the same opportunities for that type of dialogue.  </p><p> The Good Friday Agreement referred to a Northern Ireland civic forum.  It has since disappeared and been replaced by a civic advisory panel with six members.  I think it has met once or twice but not since the institutions stopped functioning.  Going from a Northern Ireland civic forum to a civic advisory panel with six members does not seem to give us much of a platform for civic society dialogue within Northern Ireland.  The St. Andrews Agreement pointed out that the all-island consultative forum suggested in the Good Friday Agreement had yet to come about.  We are still waiting for that all-Ireland dimension which will allow civic society to enter into dialogue in the same way that parliamentarians do.  </p><p> Strand three of the Good Friday Agreement referred to a British-Irish Council and a Northern Ireland civic forum but there was no suggestion that there should be an equivalent platform for an all-Ireland forum for civic society.  Perhaps it was a sign of the times when the Good Friday Agreement was written.  This charter might perhaps address that gap.  It could be something that starts the process and initiates thinking on this issue.  I refer to a vision of grassroots community organisation co-operation rather than looking at the political structures that exist already.  Those structures could be exploited even further, however.</p></speech>

There has been no other space for us.  We must bear in mind that this project has existed since 2014 and we started our involvement in 2015.  Without a platform we will not get a shared understanding of the issues facing communities right across the islands.  We have found in recent years that many of our challenges, issues, hopes and fears are shared and that is why a grassroots platform like this is so important.  It will enable opportunities to collaborate for the benefit of our communities.</p></speech>

I will not be so bold as to make any comment on the involvement of Scottish political structures in any of this.  From a civil society perspective, however, particularly given asymmetric devolution within the UK, it has been a valuable experience to be able to talk to other women's organisations.  The patriarchy does not stop at the Border.  We share similar challenges but in different contexts and the learning we derive is really valuable for our work.</p></speech>

I am sad to say I was not aware of the great work being done but it sounds brilliant.  Cross-Border and cross-community work to bring communities together is very important.  People everywhere have the same issues in respect of homelessness, unemployment and mental health.  I know the reality of that from going up North and into different communities.  I have referred previously to intergenerational trauma, mental health and other issues that people deal with daily in the North.  These are major issues.</p> <p>  I gave an example here before of a cross-Border, cross-community group run by the charitable organisation with which I am involved.  It focused on families impacted by addiction rather than people in addiction.  It was for family members who have someone they love in that situation.  I was blown away by the experience.  I sat in on the programme in which the two different communities came together.  There was also a cross-Border aspect, with people from the South involved.  It was very interesting.  There was some friction initially between people from the two communities.  When we worked through that, however, it was amazing how they came together.  We learned eventually that people from both communities were grieving.  I also realised that people from the South had no idea of the impact of the conflict and of people dying, with the resultant intergenerational trauma.</p> <p>  There is now also the ongoing issue of suicide in those communities.  I was involved in another event in north Belfast where families from both communities who had lost loved ones to suicide came together.  The heartbreak was exactly the same and the devastation and intergenerational trauma that comes from conflict was exactly the same.  It sounds like that is the essence of what the organisations represented today are trying to do.  It is about bringing civil society together and that is definitely the way forward.  It connects into the anxieties, problems and worries that people face daily and examines what those issues are.  In that way, it brings people together.  I have seen that happen and how it works.  I have participated in programmes and witnessed how the two communities come together through heartache.  People who have gone through the same thing can then find empathy for each other.  I believe such initiatives really work. </p> <p>  I approach this from the perspective of intergenerational trauma and mental health and the impact those issues have on addiction.  Many organisations are involved in addressing these issues.  Are the witnesses' organisations doing some work on issues such as intergenerational trauma, addiction or mental health?  </p></speech>

We are dealing with all kinds of issues in a post-conflict situation.  Senator Black has outlined some of them.  In addition, we find that people are suffering social isolation and that impacts on the mental health of people living rurally.  We have been dealing with a lack of investment in resourcing efforts to address those issues in our jurisdiction because the money is just not there.  We have no government to appeal to at the moment to redress the situation but I know the health service was being looked at when it was functioning.  There seems to be a plan in place but it cannot be executed in the absence of a government.  Real people are still dealing with their real issues, however.<br/><br/>We also have to prepare to deal with the implications of Brexit and its impact on access to services.  For those living in a Border area, the services they might wish to access could be on the other side of the Border.  We have become good at moving people around and we are used to being able to work, live and traverse our island freely.  Our members are very clear that there is no good news on Brexit for them.  They want to continue to live their lives the way they always have and that includes being able to access services.  There is a need to deal with the mental health impact on families who are rurally isolated.  If women are impacted, their entire family will be impacted and <i>vice versa</i>.  It is intergenerational.  We are part of an historically patriarchal society in which the care and responsibility for members of families fall to women.  That is particularly the case in rural areas.  There is a great burden in trying to care for people, whether that involves dealing with issues such as suicidal thoughts, addiction or mental health issues.  <br/><br/>To return Senator Black's question, our job as an organisation is to try to support those people and link them to existing services.  However, they have all of the frustrations I have just outlined.</p><p>Bringing this back to what the charter can do about that, it cannot sort the health service.  What we can do is talk to the likes of Longford Women's Link and ask where it is getting its help from and what has worked for it.  We can see what is happening in Scotland and what is working there.  Scotland is away ahead of us on gender equality and other matters.  It is a question of determining where the learning is and how we distil it.  As director of an organisation, whose role is to amplify the voice of our members, I consider it my job to try to talk to all of the committee members and whoever else can be in a position to make a change for that.  We cannot change it.  We can merely try and get the information and the support to our members.  I hope that is not an unwieldy answer but that is the gist of what we do.</p></speech>

It started in late 2014 and the work with community groups started in the beginning of 2015.  We deliberately kept this quiet and low profile because we wanted to give people the space and the opportunity to have conversations, exchange views and sometimes have some difficult conversations about what cross-Border co-operation means for them and what the Border means for them.  Depending on their life experiences and their particular backgrounds, they have different experiences.  If one comes from a rural community group, sometimes one might belong to what one thinks is the same community of identity.  One might live in a rural area and the other group lives in an urban setting and although one thinks one shares the same identity, in fact, one is very different.  Sometimes one is having these difficult conversations within the same kind of community, but rural versus urban.  It involves many difficult conversations.  It was vital that we did that because we were trying to assess to begin with - it was not coming up with this vision for co-operation - whether people believe in and value the thought of co-operation and wanted to co-operate in the first place.  If we jump straightaway to this vision and miss out on the attitudes to cross-Border co-operation, we end up perhaps with something that is artificial that does not have real support behind it.  That is why the Senator would not have heard of this.  We were trying to keep much of this conversation happening in the background quietly.</p></speech>

On the Senator's comment about people having the same issues, as Dr. Soares stated, many of the conversations we had were necessarily easy.  From our perspective, and ourselves and NIRWN started our involvement with the project around the same time, there was considerable willingness on behalf of participants to listen, engage and learn from each other.  We are in a post-Brexit - whatever that will look like - situation and conscious of the impact that will have on women, particularly in rural areas.</p> <p>  We are now working on various different levels and various different projects.  For example, we have spoken at a Northern Ireland Women's European Platform, NIWEP, five nations seminar on the economic impact of Brexit on women about matters that perhaps are not always talked about in the mainstream such as the post-Brexit impact on women who are experiencing domestic violence in terms of barring orders, jurisdictions, etc.  While the conversations have not always been easy, they have been at all times very respectful.  We have had a great willingness to exchange information and good practice.</p></speech>

This is what we are looking for ultimately.   Whatever happens in terms of Brexit, irrespective of the kind of Brexit we have or whether we even have Brexit at all, it is vital the structures and funds are there to support co-operation at community level on a North-South basis and all-island basis, but also on an east-west basis because we do not want to end up seeing a situation where the structures and funds are not there.  Those funds must come from all administrations across these islands and not only the Irish Government.</p> <p>  If one takes away EU funding and considers the funds that support cross-Border co-operation outside of EU funds, one of the funds that immediately comes to mind is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade reconciliation fund.  If that is taken out of the equation, one is left with very few.  I refer to charitable organisations.  For example, the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust funds what we do.  The Northern Ireland Community Relations Council supports what we are doing and we welcome that.  Outside of that, there is no direct equivalent on the UK Government side.  Neither has not been one equivalent to the reconciliation fund from the Northern Ireland Government side.  That is a glaring deficit that has to be addressed.</p> <p>  I will quickly point out what is coming from the UK Government.  We have been following closely the development of the UK shared prosperity fund, which is the government's proposal to replace EU Structural Funds.  In the little detail there is - it is still very little - they seem to have forgotten that Structural Funds support cross-Border co-operation.  Even though the Border on the island of Ireland is mentioned every two seconds and the backstop every other second the Brexit debate, when they are sitting formulating a new policy they forget, once again, that there is a Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic and between the island of Ireland and Great Britain and that the UK shared prosperity fund should be able to support cross-Border co-operation.  We request that members from this committee enter into dialogue with other politicians here, but also use their contacts with politicians in Westminster, Holyrood and Cardiff Bay to make sure that everybody is aware of this, and of that need going forward.</p></speech>

That is because community and grassroots organisations such as ourselves could see that these kind of activities were not priorities for our governments, including, I am afraid, the committee.  Because there was no mechanism in place for us to engage at that level to get those issues across, Brexit has distilled for everyone how we took for granted that everything would be fine, we would all get along and it would be all grand.  We now know that will not be the case and why it is so important to have defined and absolute structures in place that we follow, and that there are provisions in place to ensure that they happen.  Goodwill visions and great hopes are all very well but one can see when it comes down to it that while we have our Good Friday Agreement, as Dr. Soares outlined, key bits of it have been neglected and not delivered upon.  We should have had a Bill of rights for Northern Ireland which would have helped, certainly, our sector, quite a lot in the face of Brexit, but it is not there.  It is about maintaining that energy to deliver on those matters.  The fact is it was missing and that is why we started this work.  We maybe were a bit prophetic.  None of us wished for Brexit but could see that there were gaps in structural support and the energy and commitment by governments behind that structural support.</p> <p>  I was in front of the T&aacute;naiste regarding the Brexit stuff.  I said to him that I knew that politically things have to be done carefully but it is not political overreach to deliver on the Good Friday Agreement because the Government is co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and, as such, has a responsibility to all of us as citizens to deliver on that.  That is underneath many of the issues that we were raised in the charter.</p></speech>

First of all, the witnesses are very welcome and I thank them for coming and making the presentation.</p> <p>  As they state, the Good Friday Agreement provides for many of the things that we are talking about and many of the things that are missing and we are part of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Unfortunately, both governments seem to ignore that it has not been fully implemented yet and no efforts barely have been made to do it.  The constant danger is we will keep founding new organisations to do the job that an original organisation was supposed to do and did not.</p><p>The opportunity for a future civic forum under the Good Friday Agreement, including the all-Ireland civic forum, is a very important aspect that I hope will emerge from the discussions that are happening.  I hope it will be developed.  The intergovernmental forum exists but is not fulfilling its role.  Many of these organisations were supposed to step in when there was a crisis.  Instead of stepping in during crises, they were seen as developing them.  They did not do anything.  It is important, therefore, that the grass roots have a say to ensure everything is happening.  The development of the civic forum is one aspect.  </p><p> We are talking about women's organisations but, assuming the common charter is covering a wider aspect than women&rsquo;s organisations, which I hope is the case because men are starting to feel isolated, it is important that we recognise the cross-Border dimension.  The studies that have been done, in various ways, are co-ordinated to try to maximise the discussion right across the board.  People are feeling isolated.  The Scottish experience is worth noting from our point of view because it sheds light on all the fears in the community as regards a Border poll or referendum on Irish unity.  The Scottish experience, implying one can have a referendum on independence, comes and goes.  The Scots might have another one.  How does one allay some of the fears in the community such that, instead of having people say there is a problem or fear, we open up and try to manage the change that is happening and will happen right across the board?  Working within the common chapter is a good way to proceed. I hope the two Governments and the Assembly, which I hope will be re-established in the near future, will develop that and exist as a testing pool for the views and ideas that exist.  I hope individuals such as the witnesses will become a challenge to the Assembly and also to councils.  Much good work goes on in all the new councils, which have just been re-elected.  Resources exist to try to develop with the councils new ideas on how to manage the change.  If the councils can do it, it is sometimes easier for the other organisations and structures to do so.</p><p> Some of the structures in place were covered.  Unfortunately, there are many talking shops in Northern Ireland and many intergovernmental meetings that do not seem to have delivered very much in the past 20 years.  I accept people are meeting, which is good in itself.  At this stage however, we need to deliver.  We should not be talking at this stage about the issues that existed at the time of the Good Friday Agreement but about how we move beyond the agreement.  I am grateful for the initiative.  I hope we can tie in with it at local level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1529" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony Soares" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019050900002#H00200"><p>On the representation of women's groups in the development of the common charter, it just so happens there were two primary target groups our centre had when we started going down this road.  One was women's groups and the other was the PUL community along the Border.  We believed that if we were to get a real vision for co-operation and test the appetite for cross-Border co-operation, we should try to speak to some of those who might not have an automatically positive outlook.  We believed we should start with more challenging groups.  On women's groups, we have responded to consultations on Ireland's national action plan for UN Security Council Resolution 1325.  We have always pointed out that women's groups and women have always been at the forefront of peace and reconciliation processes here on the island but do not necessarily see it translated into policy and its shaping.  That is a reason we wanted to include women's group's.  There are other groups also involved in the development of the common charter.</p> <p>  I will not necessarily say anything about the Scottish referendum or Border poll in terms of allaying people's fears but I will talk about dialogue.  Whatever comes down the track, if people, including community groups of all shapes and sizes, north, south, east and west, are talking to each other, they can confront all sorts of challenges and seize all sorts of opportunities.  In order for us to do so, we have to be talking to each other.  As we were doing this project, we noted the lack of knowledge we have of one another.  Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, we still do not know how we live or who governs in our various jurisdictions.  People have no idea who the Taoiseach and First Ministers of Scotland or Northern Ireland are.  There is a lack of knowledge of political structures so we have to overcome that and continue the conversation.</p> <p>  On Scottish representation in this project in the development of the new common charter and on the Welsh and English aspects, although the English one is a little more challenging, the Good Friday Agreement binds us all together.  We wanted to get this across.  The Good Friday Agreement is not just about a corner of the island of Ireland or the whole island; it brings everybody together.  We are all part of it.  Our Scottish friends are as much part of it as our Welsh friends.  We are all co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  Obviously, ultimate responsibility lies with the Irish and UK Governments but we should not just wash our hands of it and just let them get on with it.  We should avoid moments of crisis and know when they are coming down the tracks.  We should all take responsibility as co-guarantors of the Agreement and make it a living document, not just a piece of paper.  Our Scottish, Welsh and English friends are also part of it, not to forget the Isle of Man and Channel Islands.</p></speech>

The important thing is to have as many forums as possible where we can have these conversations in the most appropriate setting.  They should be accessible for small organisations.  Engender is a national organisation.  We facilitated some of the grassroots organisations in Scotland to become involved in the charter.</p> <p>  The process, to which Dr. Soares and Ms Farrell can speak a little more, pointed to the influence of the different contexts, narratives and ways in which we use language in our political systems.  One can see this in the draft versions of the charter, even though the content was quite similar in each.  It took some additional work to make it relevant and usable for all the areas.</p> <p>  The common problem Ms Coyle mentioned, in terms of gender inequality, care, access to resources, the use of services and the potential impact when services are cut, does not stop at the Border.  The issues have, quite rightly, different connotations and frameworks associated with them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1531" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019050900002#H00400"><p>With regard to language, we had a draft before the all-Ireland and cross-Border meetings and workshops.  The Scotland meeting was the first we had.  We got comments on the language we had used.  We spent a lot of time talking about the culture, for example.  Culture has different connotations in different parts of these islands.  It has been really positive and important to have had the discussions in Scotland, Wales and England because we have to reflect what is happening in communities across the islands.</p><p> Dr. Soares was talking about responsibilities within community organisations.  To go back to the national action plan on women, peace and security, it specifically references the under-representation of women in political structures as having an impact on peace building and reconciliation.  Within the manifesto model, we believe we have a responsibility to support women, not just to participate in structures and in public life but to understand the structures.  We think that is something that is very important right across communities, no matter what kind of groups are involved, whether youth groups or cross-community groups.  If people do not understand the local, regional and national decision-making structures, it is very difficult for them even to see where they can have a voice.  That is something we have also held on to very strongly as we think it is a very important element of the common charter.</p></speech>

I have often thought we need some sort of system of training within schools and education in regard to the structures that govern everything.  Young people in particular may end up not participating, and the younger we get people to participate, the longer they will be involved.  In my constituency of mid-Ulster, there is the whole issue of apprentices, and this also applies across the Border.  One of the problems we have at the moment is that we cannot get workers.  Whereas unemployment was the big issue, it is now getting to the stage where we need training and apprenticeships to fill the vacancies that exist.  One of the cross-Border aspects that would be beneficial is if the two Governments were to take the opportunity to promote apprenticeships in engineering and across the board.  This would help deliver the skills required and would be positive within the cross-Border corridor.</p></speech>

Before I answer, unfortunately, because she has joined us today from Scotland, Ms Dickson has to scoot off now, if the committee is okay with that.</p> <p>  On the points just raised about the young people's groups that were involved in the development of the first draft of this charter, one of the things they pointed to was the fact they felt they were undervalued if they did not choose a university degree as their pathway in education, and if they chose anything that was outside of that, it was seen as being of lesser value.  These are groups of young people from North and South talking about that attitude, how it has to change, and how more emphasis and more value has to be given to those vocational qualifications, which are alternative paths to different careers.  Young people on both sides of the Border are saying we are obsessed with degrees, and they are told they must get a degree, with the result they do not feel valued.</p> <p>  There are opportunities to co-operate on a North-South basis on apprenticeships and training.  Employers are talking about the same issues in regard to the labour force and skills.  As an island, and as islands, we will be facing huge challenges in terms of the skills that will be needed in the future economy, not in the next five, ten or 15 years but in the next 20 years.  The question is what we are going to need and how we are going to achieve those goals.  Co-operation is one of the ways we can achieve that at a lesser cost for everybody.</p></speech>

One of the issues with employment is where it is based, how far people have to travel, and whether there is the infrastructure to get them to and from work and to and from education and apprenticeships.  When talking about young women, there is the issue of how apprenticeships are sold to young women and what opportunities there are.  I am obviously of the view that a young woman should be doing engineering as much as a young man, but we still have a way to go in terms of trying to promote that, even within businesses and organisations, as well as with the young women themselves.  Structurally, we must address the barriers for young women, particularly if they have any kind of caring responsibilities, and we must try to reduce those.  Given we are offering the opportunity, we must make sure there are no barriers in place preventing them from accessing that opportunity, and that includes where it is located.  We are a small place but it sometimes feels very big when people are trying to get from one place to another and there is no infrastructure to enable them to do that.</p></speech>

A young person pointed out to me that when we go into anybody's house, there are photographs on the wall of the person who has graduated but there is no photograph on the wall of the fitter, welder, painter or decorator.  We have to find some way of recognising those skills and trades because they are probably more important to deliver.</p></speech>

Our members are quite concerned as to how this community infrastructure and that level of support to rural communities is going to be resourced in the future.  There is a challenge for us all within that and it is not just for the committee.  There is a risk we will lose the things that have been working well.  We want to be building, not going back.</p></speech>

A commitment has been made by the European Commission and the Irish Government to replace the current INTERREG and PEACE programmes, even if there is a no-deal Brexit.  I ask that there is a dialogue with community organisations in terms of what that PEACE+ programme might represent and how it is to support cross-Border co-operation at grassroots community level.  In terms of the dialogue that has gone on around Brexit, much of the focus has been on the economic consequences of Brexit and how cross-Border trade might be affected, but it is not always apparent that the same level of attention has been given to how it is going to affect cross-Border relations between communities at the grassroots level, which it is essential to maintain.  The lifeblood of the Good Friday Agreement will disappear if we are just left with an economic dialogue around the Good Friday Agreement, rather than one that includes communities.</p></speech>

Having listened to the committee members, there is clear support for the charter.  The next question is how we can move it forward.  The witnesses have asked members to talk to other Oireachtas Members and those beyond that to try to encourage this process.  We all agree dialogue is the way forward.  If we disagree with someone, the only way to change that person's point of view is to talk to them.  One of the successes of our committee has been when we have gone out to those communities who feel left behind post ceasefire and post peace agreement.  We have engaged with them both publicly and quietly, and that is one of the success of the committee.  We intend to engage further.  If there are organisations and groups the witnesses feel it would be useful for this committee to meet, they should pass on that information.  We greatly appreciate their attendance today and their presentation.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Martina Maloney, who is the chair of our subgroup on performance indicators, and by Mr. Neill Dalton and Ms Claire Gavin in the Public Gallery, who are here on behalf of the NOAC secretariat.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for its invitation to meet today to discuss the work of the National Oversight and Audit Commission generally, but more specifically, its recent performance indicator report for 2017.  The annual performance indicator report published by NOAC is one of its key reports every year.  NOAC has the function of scrutinising local authority performance against relevant indicators.  The performance indicator subgroup&rsquo;s mandate is to recommend appropriate performance indicators in respect of local authority activity and to oversee the data collection, verification, compilation and publication of a report on those indicators annually.  NOAC believes that monitoring performance over time and against comparable authorities has the potential to encourage continuous improvement in local authority service provision.</p> <p>  Specifically on the issue of performance indicator reports, four performance indicator reports have been published by NOAC since 2014.  A number of organisations are involved in its production, including the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, 31 local authorities and various Government Departments.  The outcomes of the report should enable best practice to be highlighted so that local authorities can learn from each other for the betterment of the services that they provide for their communities.  In respect of the 2018 performance indicator report, the data for which is currently being collected, we have added two new indicators, bringing the total number to 37.  Indicators are kept under ongoing review with the purpose of developing more qualitative outcome focused indicators as NOAC acquires a greater understanding of local authority functions through its examination of different aspects of the work that they do.  NOAC is also beginning to examine the scope for grouping local authorities for comparative reporting purposes.</p> <p>  Underpinning the day to day work of NOAC is the requirement to see NOAC recognised as an organisation that can deliver real reform.  Central to this is making sure that local authorities are delivering real value for money while adhering to proper governance.  NOAC also ensures that it supports the best practices that are central to the work of local authorities.  Successful transformation requires robust planning, clear and coherent leadership and suitably skilled staff.  The impact of increasing demands across local government and the changing landscape in which councils operate mean that planning and oversight have never been more important.  Robust plans that project how local authorities&rsquo; outcomes and priorities will be delivered and funded are essential to ensuring the sustainability of services for the public.  It is important that NOAC be there to ensure that these decisions are taken in a planned and co-ordinated way and that the impact of decisions on communities and outcomes is transparent and also understood.  I look forward to the discussion to follow with committee members on the work of NOAC.</p></speech>

I am supportive of NOAC and I am familiar with the overview of it but I am not sure if the public at large is familiar with it.  There is a lot of work to be done there in how it promotes itself and how it sets the standards.  NOAC clearly has a matrix of standards that it judges people from.</p> <p>  On resources, does NOAC have the capacity and the resources?  Mr. McCarthy's predecessor mentioned here previously that there may have been issues and constraints with the resources.  I note that NOAC's budget was &euro;200,000 last year and this year again.  That is an issue I want to talk about.</p> <p>  NOAC also says that it has a second customer survey for users of local authority services and that this will be completed in a further 11 authorities.  The witnesses might tell us when that report is due because that is really important.  NOAC also mentions that it is looking at and planning to begin to examine the possible scope and the potential for grouping local authorities for comparative purposes and exercises.  What sort of local authorities is NOAC talking about grouping together and what is the rationale behind that?  It is difficult because they are all different in size and make up.  There is a range of reasons it is difficult but NOAC might look at that.</p> <p>  Is NOAC satisfied that it has sufficient resources to enable it to carry out its work and its future planned programme?  The witnesses might explain that to us.  NOAC also mentioned in its report that a Government Minister can commission NOAC to do a specific piece of work.  Has NOAC been asked by any Government Minister in the last 12 months or the last 24 months to specifically deal with a particular issue, project or piece of research?  If so, what was that about and what was the outcome of that?  I hope Mr. McCarthy does not mind me asking and he might just touch on that.  Does NOAC think that the revised indicators used to measure housing in 2017 are appropriate?  I would like the witnesses to comment on that and tell us what the changes are.  There are significant variations among the local authorities in processing fire safety certificates within the two month timeframe set down.  Can the witnesses explain the reasons for such variance?  It is 100% for Cork County Council and 10% for South Dublin County Council.  I will leave the witnesses with those questions.</p></speech>

I know he has been a strong supporter of local government and to be fair to him he has brought those issues to the floor of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  He has given a unique insight into the operation of the local government sector across the 31 local authorities.</p> <p>  I will talk about this year's report and the capacity and resources and then my colleague, Ms Maloney, will talk about the rationale for the grouping of the local authorities and the issue of housing.  To give a quick and short answer to the question on whether I am happy with the resources NOAC has, the answer is "Yes".  I pay tribute to my predecessor in this role who started in 2014 when NOAC was created.  It was a different Ireland, albeit it was only five years ago, in terms of how scarce resources were and the financial difficulties faced by the country at that stage.</p><p>In recent times, we have had an increase in capacity of the secretariat and I am satisfied that the Minister has provided resources for us.  We rely on the various talents and skillsets of the members of the board, especially for the project-specific work undertaken by the subgroups.  Much of that is done <i>pro bono</i>by the members of our subgroups.  We tend to do as much as we can with resources that are sufficient but also finite.  I am therefore happy that a capacity and resource issue does not arise.  Building up the profile is a significant challenge for us.  It is to reflect the work that is being done in our interaction with local authorities, with the Department, with the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and with other stakeholders.  Since my appointment last September, I am endeavouring to meet as many of those stakeholders as I can to ensure that we are doing what we can to extend that network and reflect the amount of work that is being done.<br/><br/>With regard to the question about ministerial requests for a post, the answer, in short, is &quot;No&quot;.  I suspect that may change in the future.  I do not have any firm knowledge but I suspect it.  It is prescribed in the Act.  We are open for business in that context.  The challenge in building the profile is always there.  All our reports are published online.  Significant work by a number of stakeholders goes into putting them together.  The Senator will find in his own experience in Leinster House that when one produces a volume of work, it is sometimes largely neglected by some organs of society.  I am not pointing a finger at anyone in particular but sometimes there might not be an appetite to ingest the news of the day in that report versus, for example, the topical current affairs issues that will always dominate the airwaves and print media.<br/><br/>Ms Maloney will address the rationale between the grouping of local authorities and the housing issue.  Ms Maloney is a former chief executive and has extensive experience.  She has contributed significantly to the work of the performance indicator report and the operations of NOAC as a whole.</p></speech>

One can hardly compare Dublin city with Leitrim because one is dealing with two very different areas with different geography, topography and demographic considerations.  There is no doubt that some counties are comparable.  When we interact with the chief executives, they would have identified that there are counties that they automatically compare with.  If one looks at Monaghan and Cavan, there is strong competition between them to see which is the best at different things.  They compare with one another.  The large counties along the west coast tend to compare, including Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry.  There is a rationale behind that comparison.  Some of the midland counties, including Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath, would be comparable.  We are trying to instil in local authorities the requirement to use the data that we have gathered from all the councils to improve their own performance.  We would ask them to look at their performance over time, including whether they are improving yearly, and to use the data for comparisons with comparable local authorities to see if there is something they can learn from similar local authorities on which they can build and improve and learn from their practice.  That is the purpose for which we group authorities.  There are some authorities which are difficult to identify partners for, for example, Dublin City Council, which is somewhat unique.<br/><br/>The Senator's second question focused on the issue of housing indicators.  We have quite a number of indicators in the housing area because we see it as a very important dimension of the work of local authorities that impacts much of our citizenry.  We look at changes to the housing stock owned by local authorities throughout the year, with regard to new acquisitions, new construction and disposals under the tenant purchase scheme and otherwise.  We also look at housing vacancies in the council housing stock because we are anxious to encourage councils to give the best performance they can in not having properties vacant and turning them around quickly.  Over the four years NOAC has been producing this report, we have seen a significant improvement in the level of occupancy of local authority housing.  If I go back to 2014, the figure for vacancies was 3.8% of social housing stock throughout the country.  That figure for 2017 was down to 2.72%.  That is a significant improvement.  In 13 local authorities, the vacancy rate was less than 2%.  The lowest rate in the country was 0.43%.  A real effort is being made by local authorities in delivering on occupancy levels, and also on turnaround times when a house becomes vacant, to make it habitable for the new tenant.  There has been a significant reduction in that over the last four years.  It is now running at 28 weeks, on average.  The quickest turnaround time is 6.8 weeks in one local authority.<br/><br/>Part of what we do is trying to encourage best practice.  Where we see really good practice, we try to spread it.  We hold an annual conference in collaboration with the LGMA.  One of the showcases was a local authority which had managed to cut that turnaround time down to the minimum possible.  We look at the cost of housing maintenance per unit of accommodation.  We also look at private rented inspections and how many houses are being inspected by local authorities.  We look at the question of the long-term homelessness.  We try to address a number of important dimensions for the housing service that the local authority carries out.  We changed the indicators relating to housing output for the 2017 report, reflecting the changes that come about through Rebuilding Ireland.  NOAC has to be dynamic and to respond to changes in Government policy.  We have included indicators under housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and housing delivered through approved housing bodies, AHBs, rather than housing delivered through local authorities themselves.<br/><br/>The Senator asked about fire safety certificates.  There is certainly a disparity in the figures for how fire safety certificates are processed.  They are a very important dimension in the work of the local authority.  I would not pretend to understand the dynamic behind the processing of the fire safety certificates.  We encourage the audit committees at local level to look at the performance indicators for their particular local authorities and to review them <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other local authorities, and to ask those questions at local level.  As we meet the chief executives of local authorities, we raise with them the questions that arise about performance under the different indicators.  It is a question that is best referred to the local authority concerned.</p></speech>

That is an alarming situation with fire safety.  We discussed issues with fire safety with various people here a few weeks ago and I will not repeat them.  People raised serious concerns and allegations about one of the local authorities and it got media attention.  We should look at it.  There are more than 980 county councillors and they are a conduit to be used better.  I find that I am asked to send councillors NOAC's report.  It is rather strange.  NOAC has an opportunity to engage.  The witnesses are talking about chief executives, the council and having conferences.  Remember that the elected representatives, sitting county councillors, are the closest politicians to the people on the ground.  There is an opportunity to engage better with them.  I suggest that when the witnesses produce reports, they are circulated then.  I have had a report sit on a chief executive's desk for two months before being circulated to elected members.  The whole thing is mad.  It applies to local government audits too but that is a matter for later.  There is also the issue of sanction.  What sanctions can the witnesses impose other than reporting about shortcomings?  What powers and sanctions do the witnesses have?  Do they want more powers or the ability to sanction local authorities?  Will they share their views on that?</p></speech>

I have mentioned a number of stakeholders, including the joint committee, the Department, the LGMA and the County and City Management Association, CCMA.</p><p>The Senator is correct that in a few weeks we will have over 900 new members across the 31 local authorities.  That is an avenue I will follow up on in terms of using that skillset.  From our point of view, we can do what we can, but there is much credence and merit in the Senator's proposal regarding a local knowledge.  I agree that the elected members of the local authority are best placed to interrogate what the issue might be and to have a particular insight into that, which we will never pick up by meeting the executive team.  That is something I will take up.</p><p> There are no sanctions and penalties.  Our role is specified in the Act.  It is an oversight role, by and large, without the carrot and stick.  There is a little carrot, and the Senator will have heard the point Martina Maloney mentioned regarding the number of voids.  That used to drive me bananas as a public representative in a previous life.  I could not understand why the voids were allowed to deteriorate to the level they had reached at that point in time.  There has been a reduction in the overall figure from 3.8% to 2.8%.  We believe that is a direct response to our site visits and reports.  It places a pressure.  I will take up the Senator's issue with regard to the councillors, the network and the association behind that because there is a particular skillset within that sector which I believe will be of great benefit to NOAC in how it discharges its functions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1561" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019050900002#F00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  Martina Maloney is a former manager and she is extremely helpful and proactive.  She is one of the best and most dedicated public officials with whom I have had the pleasure of working.  Her wealth of experience, that of the chairperson and the work they do are highly valuable.  I am here to be fair to everybody and I acknowledge the expertise and the good work throughout the country, but I have an issue of concern and I hope NOAC can examine it.  It is about oversight of the way people with disabilities are being dealt with across local government.</p> <p>  It continues to be my concern, and I emphasise that this is no reflection on any individual or local authority, that we are not showing due respect for people with disabilities when we deal with their problems.  For example, a case was brought to my attention this week.  The letter is written to the mother of a disabled child and the person who has the disability is referred to in the third person throughout the letter as "the disabled person" rather than "your son" or "your daughter".  That is disgraceful.  It makes me very angry that people who fight for rights for their children are treated disrespectfully.  That is the reason I raise it here.  It made me angry yesterday because when I arrived here there were two rows of people in wheelchairs outside the door of Leinster House who are not getting the home care packages they need.  That is not the concern of the witnesses but it is my concern.  They were outside in the rain.  It is absolutely unacceptable that people with disabilities who need care and attention are not being treated properly.  Their rights are being disrespected.</p> <p>  The difficulty with the case I have on hand, and this person cannot be recognised from what I intend to say, is that the person has a visual impairment, complex physical and intellectual difficulties and requires percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, PEG, feeding and frequent suctioning.  The person has nursing care at night but requires 24-hour care.  The HSE wrote to the council on behalf of that person asking that the person be given a special bath and hoist because of the significant disabilities.  Where the council refers to the person in the third person, it absolutely ignores the person's needs.  The last line states that the application is hereby refused.  It treats the person with great disrespect.  This is just one case, but it should not be happening.</p> <p>  I ask that the NOAC, as a matter of urgency, examine the language that is used in letters to people with disabilities.  If it is disrespectful, the council should be dealt with severely.  One cannot treat people like that.  Second, if somebody has complex disability needs and has a HSE report from a physiotherapist and doctors stating that the person needs something, it is not good enough for the council, which owns the house, to tell the mother that the council does not install such hoists, to hell with the application and it is closed.  Incidentally, in the last line, it tells the mother that if she wishes to appeal the decision she can do so within 21 days and it provides the address to which the appeal should be made.  That is wrong and I totally reject it.  Much of the work the NOAC does is constructive, but one thing it could do, as a matter of urgency, is examine the letters that are sent by the councils, meet with the officers who deal with them, who I presume are the chief executive officers, and work out a language that is respectful, understanding and takes special care with people with disabilities.</p> <p>  I accept that often the local authority may not have the money to do the work required.  It is the Government's job to ensure the money is provided.  However, within that, there must be far greater emphasis on the rights of people with disabilities and their families.  Never again do I wish to visit a house and hear that a family with a huge issue is being completely ignored and left in a dreadful situation which must be dealt with now.  I am not disrespecting the people who wrote that letter, but they must be trained in appropriate language.  There must be a far more respectful and empathetic relationship.  That is very important.</p> <p>  The other point I wish to make relates to NOAC's reports.  I am not nit-picking but we do not have a particular report to discuss with the witnesses today.  If I understand it correctly, the NOAC has indicated its report will be available later this year.  Perhaps the information I have is incorrect.</p></speech>

I have always believed that if somebody has an issue, he or she should be able to discuss it privately with the local council.  Some councils have rooms available and some do not, but it is very important.  Let us say there are four or five windows where people can ask for assistance.  The person should be able to respectfully say, "I would like to speak to somebody privately about a matter".  Otherwise, it is in a public place and other people can listen to everybody's problems and issues.  Where somebody has a serious matter he or she wishes to discuss it is important that he or she can go into a room and talk to the person concerned.  That is respectful of people.  It is wrong that people should have to stand in line to discuss their business in a public place, where anybody within earshot can hear everything they say.  We should address that.  If it means making more rooms available to the public, we should do that.  It would show respect for the individual at the point of interaction.</p> <p>  I wish to raise another point.  According to the public press, there is a significant problem between the administration and the elected representatives.  I am not referring to a particular place.  Does the NOAC deal with that?  If there are ongoing significant and serious difficulties between a manager of a county and its public representatives and they do not appear to be resolvable, what solutions, if any, can the NOAC offer for that?  Is there a best practice the body could suggest?  Let us say the NOAC is doing its audits of councils.  In those audits it could perhaps review the press commentary for the previous six months to see what is happening and what the issues are.  It might be able to sort out the issues that arise.  There might be cases where senior officials or the senior official will not attend meetings in a particular town.</p><p>There may be good reasons for this.  I do not know because I am not on that particular council, but it happens and it is not acceptable that it should continue to happen.  There should be a way to intervene.  I am not necessarily saying it should be NOAC but somebody should be able to say it is the role of the manager and the council to work together, and, without attributing blame, state a council is dysfunctional if it is not working and then make it work.  It is a serious issue.  I know it may be a rare issue but it is happening and it needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

With regard to the first issue he raised, when I was a Member, I had a similar issue and it happened to be with regard to a local authority.  It was quite a complex housing case.  It did not involve the standard housing application and verification; it was very different and reflective of how fast society changes.  I felt as aggrieved and angry as the Deputy does now regarding the outcome.  It involved a family whose eldest daughter was on the autism spectrum and no additional consideration because of the specific needs was given to the application.  Once it was interrogated it was obvious that it was not a run-of-the-mill case.  To be fair to the local authority, there was nothing in its remit that could have resulted in the case being treated differently.  The local authority was courteous and polite but there was no outcome.  As a result, in 2012 I introduced the first autism-specific legislation in the House, which the Deputy will recall.  It won cross-party political support and I believe it is now being dealt with in the Seanad where Senator Reilly, the former Minister for Health, is pursuing it in all but name.  The Bill would require organs of the State to adopt an autism strategy and, therefore, certain statutory legislative obligations would mean that if the same family went through the system following the enactment of the legislation, there would be a requirement for the local authority to act differently regarding the housing needs of the family because of the autism.</p></speech>

It is stating it does not deal with the problem so the person should go somewhere else.  I did not make this point earlier but the HSE is stating it is a matter for the local authority while the local authority is stating it is a matter for the HSE.  Meanwhile, the poor mother is in a dreadful situation.  I accept and acknowledge it is an exceptional case.  I do not put the blame on any individual but the system is rotten if it cannot deal with it properly.  If everything else is so perfect, why can we not have a process in a case such as this whereby the fundamental training of the individuals concerned in the local authority and health board would mean they pick up the phone to speak to each other about it?  This is not happening.  NOAC should audit this and highlight the need for constructive engagement that is respectful and gets the action that is needed.  I appreciate the good work being done and I am not taking from it.</p></speech>

The description he gave is of a customer service issue and customer service is one of the elements in which NOAC has a remit but we do not deal with individual cases.  We have a remit to review the customer service provided by local authorities.  NOAC has completed two surveys.  One is a tenant survey conducted in December 2015, the outcome of which was quite positive.  The other is the local authority satisfaction survey completed in 2018.  Another survey has been completed with regard to 11 local authorities that will be brought forward this year.  My understanding is that local authorities in general have a strategy for dealing with people with disabilities and each local authority has a strategy.  We could review the case in the context of customer service or with regard to the support provided by local authorities for people with disabilities.  Our role is oversight and not looking at individual cases.</p></speech>

If the answer is "No", there should be further referral in the system to see whether all aspects of the case have been looked at and whether the conclusion is fair and accurate.  This is the type of oversight is essential.</p></speech>

I have a couple of comments and will then ask questions.  I commend NOAC.  I am a big fan and supporter of the work it does.  Those of us on the committee who have spent a lot of time trying to get a read on what exactly is going on in local authorities value NOAC's annual reports and wait for them with anticipation, which probably says we need to get out more often.  It is very valuable information.  Sometimes I think organisations such as NOAC, which put significant time into collating and publishing information, wonder whether anybody is listening or paying attention.  Many members of the committee do so and if we could get more of this type of information more frequently, we would all be much better off.  I genuinely compliment the witnesses on this.</p> <p>  It might be useful to bring NOAC before the committee soon after the 2018 report is out.  Obviously this has been said.  We have started to do this with a number of agencies.  For example, the Environmental Protection Agency publishes important reports and it has given a commitment that when a report is published, it will let us know in advance and we will schedule a meeting with it.  Normally, we schedule two or three months in advance.  If we know the date NOAC intends to publish the 2018 report, we can try to schedule an appearance before the committee as early as possible.  The 2017 report is great but it is a little dated for our purposes.</p> <p>  If we bring NOAC before us to discuss the 2018 report, it would be good to have an opportunity to flag issues that some of us would like to have addressed in the 2019 report.  We are doing this with some of the agencies to see what information we think would be useful to track.  I torture many local authorities with freedom of information requests to get additional information.  For example, I am researching the number of houses being built and in stock that are fully wheelchair accessible.  Most local authorities can tell me how many adapted houses they have but they cannot tell me whether houses are built and designed for people who live in them with wheelchairs.  In fact, some cannot give me any information.  I have some sympathy with what NOAC struggles with.</p><p>My experience is there is a mixed bag of quality in the responses from local authorities to information requests in that some give good quality information and some very poor information.  Is that fair comment?  I do not ask the witnesses to name individual local authorities but is there anything we can do to assist in our engagement with the Department to improve the quality and consistency of information, which is key for NOAC?  In either the 2016 or 2017 report, there was a problem with the return of data on household completions, which meant NOAC did not feel in a position to authoritatively say what was the output of local authority houses.  If the commission cannot do it, nobody else can.  Is there anything we can do to assist in that regard?</p><p> Second, we have been having a conversation inside our party about the audit element of local authorities. For example, the Committee of Public Accounts has significant powers to hold Accounting Officers and Departments to account.  No similar function exists for local authorities in respect of public scrutiny.  Does NOAC have views on how to strengthen not just the oversight role and data publication but also that accountability role?  There are audits of local authorities and they are published on the Department's website but they then just quietly disappear and nobody pays any attention afterwards.  Does NOAC think there is a role for the Oireachtas?  Could there be a stand-alone committee that would have functions similar to the Committee of Public Accounts but specifically looking at local authorities?  Is that something NOAC has thought about or teased out?  Can the commission give those of us who would like to see greater scrutiny advice?  We would like to commend those local authorities that are doing a good job, and there are many doing  good work, but also challenge them where there are some issues.</p><p> My final question concerns a sensitive issue, namely, how we deal with allegations of improper practice or fraud in local authorities.  I will not outline any particular instance but serious allegations have been made against local authorities on planning matters, for example, or on payment of contractors and subcontractors.  My understanding is that in those instances there is a kind of in-house process where the local authority investigates and if those matters then need to be handed on to other appropriate authorities, they are handed on.  Where such allegations are made, does NOAC have views on what is best practice and whether there is need for legislative reform or institutional reform?  There has been a high-profile case in one local authority in the north west, which has been widely reported in the newspapers.  The Department has been investigating this for a number of years and the case was in the High Court.  For somebody who is trying to get to a conclusion of a case like that, it is a very opaque and impenetrable process.  Have the witnesses thoughts they would like to share with the committee in this regard? </p></speech>

I want to deal with the issue regarding the reports and I will then deal specifically with the issue of a Committee of Public Accounts-style audit process, and with the question of planning issues and allegations.  Ms Maloney will deal with the quality of replies and data collection.</p> <p>  It is a very good exercise that we are in front of the joint committee and I had this discussion with Senator Boyhan.  NOAC has a particular challenge to raise the profile of what we are doing.  There is a very good board and a very good mix of skillsets.  Our subgroup on performance indicators is chaired by Ms Maloney and it has burned the midnight oil in putting in the effort to collate the data to present in the reports.  With regard to the Deputy's point on the upcoming 2018 report, I will contact the secretariat and let the Deputy know what chronological stage that is at, so he can tie that in with another visit by NOAC to the joint committee.  It is good that we are having a conversation.  Nonetheless, I take his point on the 2017 report, given we are now in quarter 2 of 2019.</p> <p>  A Committee of Public Accounts-style audit system reflects a number of viewpoints held by those of us in NOAC and those outside it.  I spoke about the commission's functions in my opening statement.  It is very much about scrutinising and the oversight role and there is no direct role in regard to sanctions.  We take a very proactive approach.  In terms of visits to local authorities, we find out what they are doing well.  We know from similar visits that other local authorities are not doing as well and we balance that information in the mix.  Those reports become embedded in the local authorities and we put them up on the website and send them to the local authorities.  This ties in to the challenge we have in terms of our own profile.  The Deputy's question has a lot of merit, in particular in regard to a forum with a Committee of Public Accounts-type focus on that aspect of local authorities and the chief executive's role.</p> <p>  In many ways, NOAC was born out of that kind of discussion in the 2013-14 period.  I had a discussion with the Minister on how we can progress that.  We are at an embryonic stage in terms of a forum that can meet those demands and requirements.  For example, something along the lines of the Policing Authority, which has public sittings that are televised and online, and having that element of oversight and transparency, would be good for the commission and it would also be good in terms of showing the outside world the discussions we are having with the chief executives.  While that is at a conversational stage for the moment, it ties in with other issues and reflects the views of a number of people.  There was a discussion in the Seanad last November where the prospect of such a forum was raised and, as a result, I had a discussion with the Minister along those lines.</p> <p>  We do not have a role in regard to sanctions or allegations.  Suffice to say that the Office of the Planning Regulator has been established in recent times.  I do not even profess to know whether they came within remit role of that office but, again, it is another layer of accountability by which people can pursue that.  I share the Deputy's frustrations.  I was that soldier.  A Deputy puts down a parliamentary question looking for information and is trying to collate the data, but when a reply comes in there is still significant work to be done.  NOAC is very open in terms of its interaction with the joint committee to provide that element of reporting.  A finished report is a very important piece of work for someone like the Deputy who is building that knowledge in that sector and across local authorities.  We work in conjunction with other stakeholders in collating and compiling that data.  We want to be sure this is as widely available and widely read as possible.  As members will be aware, people put a huge effort into putting together a piece of work and it is almost dismissed or ignored, which can be quite frustrating.  With regard to the 2018 report, we will get a note back to the secretariat to give the committee an idea of the chronological stage we are currently at, so we can tie that in with a visit to the joint committee to discuss the report in a timely manner. </p></speech>

I have a certain sympathy for local authorities, which can be working on archaic systems at times.  As the Deputy has identified, the provision of data that are accurate and timely is very important to us.  We have put in place a system over the past four years that is now working quite well.  I am much more confident in regard to the quality of the data we are getting in for the performance indicators.  It has been a journey for us.  The way we approach it is that, every year, we issue guidelines to the local authorities regarding how to calculate the particular indicators we are looking for.  If we have any queries in regard to interpretation, the secretariat deals with them.  We also do a random audit of different local authorities in regard to data gathering.  We select a number of indicators each year and we go to six local authorities to go through the indicators with them to make sure the processes underpinning them are accurate and to verify the data we are getting is accurate.  That has certainly been very beneficial for us in improving the quality of the data.</p> <p>  The issue with the housing data in the 2016 report arose because of the changes associated with the implementation of Rebuilding Ireland, changing requirements and changing definitions.  That is why, when we tried to balance the figures independently against departmental figures, some issues were thrown up for us regarding what category each aspect was in.  It took us a year to resolve that but we are now very satisfied with the robust system we have in place for the gathering of housing data and, hence, they were published in the 2017 report. </p></speech>

This committee would like NOAC to have a higher profile in the debate because of the information it provides.</p><p>A couple of issues for future reports, particularly given some of the new requirements in terms of the nearly zero energy building, nZEB, requirements, is to start providing some data on that and on the BER ratings of the public housing stock.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, does some of that work but it is not necessarily as clear as some of the reporting of the commission.  That would be helpful.  We have the 2018 and the 2020 requirements in terms of public buildings and the nZEB requirements.  I tabled questions to both the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Communications, Climate Action and Environment and both replied that it is not their job to monitor compliance with those legal requirements of the EU legislation.  It is not clear whose job it is to monitor it.  The Department of Housing Planning and Local Government produces the planning guidelines, whereas the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment produces some of the supports, but nobody tracking them.  It might be a useful role for NOAC.</p><p> Likewise, we on this committee have done a great deal of work on the underspend on Traveller accommodation.  Deputy O'Dowd raised disability issues and I referred to wheelchair accessibility.  While the headline figures are important, we need to start tracking those sections of society.  Even as housing output is increasing, although not as fast as many of us would like, groups in society could still get left behind.  The more information we have about those sectors, the better.</p><p> The other major gripe that many of us have is voids.  NOAC produced an important report, published in 2017, which exposed the scandal of long-term voids.  The great aspect of that report was not just the headline figures but NOAC was able to outline a timeline for how long these properties had been void and so on.  We have ended up in a dispute with the Minister over what the Department is now calling voids.  Mr. Brendan Kelly from Dublin City Council came before the joint committee and told us that in last year's housing output figures, no long-term voids were returned to stock, but what they had were standard relets or casual vacancies, some of which came under the &euro;40,000 refurbishment figure.  Others cost more than &euro;40,000, but in his view they were all casual relets.</p><p>  According to the Department's figures, 500 voids were returned to stock.  The important distinction is that a casual relet is not an addition to stock and, therefore, in the annual output figures there is no net increase in casual relets, whereas casual relets are reclassified as voids, they are classified as additions to stock.  When we questioned the Minister on this after Mr. Brendan Kenny's attendance at the joint committee, he said that the Department had given extra funding, and if it had not done so, the units would have become long-term voids.  From a statistical point of view, that is a peculiar way of counting.  I am very clear on this.  For something to be considered a long-term void, it would have had to have fallen out of stock for quite some time and require significant money and work to be brought back into stock.  The value of the NOAC report was that we could see short-term, medium-term and long-term voids.  That is one area where some clear independent data from NOAC would be helpful.  I tabled a number of parliamentary questions asking about the time the units were vacant, because that is a key determinant.  The Department will not give us the data, as it states that it does not collate them at departmental level but it would be useful for NOAC to examine this, if not in the upcoming report, in future reports.</p><p> I am finding an increasing number of anomalies between how local authorities and the Department categorise units.  I will not ask Mr. McCarthy to comment on this but I am clear that at departmental or some other level political considerations are infecting classifications which should be done statistically.  We had it with the house completions.  It was given to the CSO so now we have a good dataset through which we know the annual number of completions in the sector.  There are other streams of housing data in which we need to do that and NOAC is well placed to provide some of that information.</p></speech>

I share his frustration on the voids issue.  We had this discussion earlier.  I agree with the Deputy's definition of a void, which is a property that has been vacant for a long time and has fallen out of stock.  That is my 100% definition of a void.  In a previous incarnation, we had a number of issues in the electoral area that I represented on a local authority at one stage.  It went on for years.  There was no doubt that in the local community one could see the structure, which had not changed in appearance bar its deterioration.  There was lost revenue in terms of the differential rent that should have been collected and a number of tenants or a family were not being housed because of that inertia.  It is particularly good work on the part of NOAC that we have concentrated on the voids issue.  The Deputy knows my definition of a void.  The figure has reduced over a period of years from 3.8% to 2.8%.  That is not the silver bullet but at least it is heading in the right direction.  I want to give a commitment regarding how we progress that work.  We will continue in our data collection to make it easily discernible to other people who are in that space to build a sufficient bank of knowledge on that topic in an objective and accurate manner.</p> <p>  The responses to the parliamentary questions tabled to the Departments of Communication, Climate Action and Environment and Housing, Planning and Local Government are an issue.  Again I was that soldier.  It can be utterly frustrating.  That is a point I will take on board in how we tweak the performance indicators.  As we go forward, the circumstances will change, some issues will become topical and others will become less topical but we are going to tweak and add the performance indicators as we make that journey.</p> <p>  NOAC is here to do the job it has to do.  I am particularly encouraged to see somebody of Deputy &Oacute; Broin's standing as both as a researcher and writer but also as a Deputy who has a very strong interest in building that data reflect what we are doing.  We are available to him in that capacity in any way that can be constructive and that can add to the outcomes in building the data.  We will get that note to the secretariat on where we are at with the 2018 report so that we can get it to the Oireachtas in a more timely fashion.  If one sees a report dated from two years ago, circumstances will have changed in the meantime and there will have been developments.  It is in all our interests to be more timely.</p></speech>

I wish they were acted on more quickly than what they are.  The commission has provided a significant database of information, which we are allowed to access and get a better understanding on the workings of the local authorities.</p> <p>  On the specific area of commercial rates, NOAC states there is an improvement in the commercial rates collection across the country and I ask Mr. McCarthy to elaborate on that.  An issue that has arisen in my county, which recently went through a revaluation process, is a slight anomaly where the utilities are globally valued in the same year and the local authority does not get the benefit of the global revaluation because they cannot increase the revenue generated from the commercial rates.  It is having an effect on us.  Is there a policy that we could look at for the future?</p> <p>  I found out that local authorities report on bad debt provisions differently.  Some local authorities present the commercial rates as the total that is available for collection and then at the end of the year one sees how much one collects compared to that figure, whereas for social housing rent, some local authorities give a figure that has bad provision built in and the collection rate is slightly skewed because the figure that one is presenting in the estimates is net of a bad debt provision whereas in commercial rates in some local authorities it is the full 100% and one can then see the exact figure they are providing for bad debt.  When one looks at collection rates, one sees high social housing rent collection rates but that is because the headline figure includes the bad debt provision.</p> <p>  In the 2017 report, there are variations in how the local authorities recorded the Part V units.  Will Mr. McCarthy expand on that?</p> <p>  I have an issue in respect of the fire certification process.  It states clearly that many local authorities do not deal with the issue within the two-month period.  What happens if it is not dealt with within that timeframe?  Is this because there is no statutory timeframe for dealing with it?  Does it prevent building work commencing?</p><p>What are the implications of it not being dealt with within the two months?  Do we have any figures on that?  Perhaps the witnesses have figures.  Do we have any figures on how many inspections of properties are carried out with regard to fire certification after building has been completed?  That feeds into the other matter of improved planning inspections.  When the witnesses talk about planning inspections, are they referring to building control or planning itself because there are two different parts to that?  Could the witnesses give me an insight into that?  </p><p> I wonder whether compliance with the drinking water regulation should continue to fall within the remit of the local authorities.  It is still in their remit when it should be the responsibility of Irish Water at this stage.  Could the witnesses comment on that?  In its reports, NOAC says that the number of inspections of properties is inadequate and insufficient.  Of those that have been inspected, 79% were non-compliant.  It is staggering to think that we are not inspecting enough properties and 79% of the ones we are inspecting are non-compliant.  Could the witnesses expand on those few points?  </p></speech>

As members are aware, Ms Maloney is chair of our performance indicator subgroup.  She will explain the terms of the indicator and the remit we have around that indicator, for example, in the areas in which we are constrained.  Regarding compliance with the drinking water directive, there is merit in much of what the Vice Chairman said but our role is, again, an oversight one.  While we have a role in terms of the implementation of national policy, that is really an issue for the Minister or Government of the day.  I can see the merit in that.<br/><br/>Before I call on Ms Maloney, who will talk about rates, we did go to one particular local authority, which recorded an improvement in its collection of commercial rates.  It was just after the economic crash.  It was a county that had not done as well during the boom as other counties on the eastern seaboard and down in the south west.  Therefore, when the recession came, it has hit particularly badly.  Many businesses struggled - if they were lucky enough to stay open - while the vast majority of them closed.  The local authority's finance unit met those who were still in business.  Its <i>modus operandi</i>was to keep the doors of the remaining businesses open on the basis that if they closed, there would be a loss to the local area, an economic loss and the outstanding commercial rates would never be collected.  There was a discussion with the finance department, which entered into arrangements with businesses whose accounts had fallen into arrears and which were just about keeping their doors open.  That was at least in part responsible for some of the upturn in the collection of commercial rates in that local authority area.  The point is important.  Across the 31 local authorities, we will see some local authorities doing business very differently from their neighbouring local authority.  The Vice Chairman's experience in Kildare or someone else's experience in Kerry or Galway would vary greatly.  This is why, in collecting the data, we try to understand how they arrive at that.  We present the data in a way that is easily discernible.  We can use those data to improve service provision in other areas.  Again, the role is prescribed in the Act, which prevents us from having certain functions around that other than expressing a point of view.  It is venturing out of our zone.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1587" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Maloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019050900002#K00300"><p>To clarify matters with regard to the collection of commercial rates, the local government sector implemented a comprehensive debt management programme that involved improved processes, alignment of reporting methods and training for staff with regard to the collection of debt because during the recession, a significant amount of debt had built up in the area of rate collection.  To be fair to local authorities, the collection percentage continues to improve.  The 2017 report revealed that 21 out of the 31 local authorities had shown an improvement on previous years.  The mean level of commercial rates collection increased from 82% in 2016 to 83.6% in 2017 so there is evidence of improved performance.  Regarding the position on bad debt and the figures we utilise for this process, we are very clear in the guidelines we issue with regard to how bad debts are utilised in calculating the percentage collection.  Bad debts must be excluded, in other words, they are written off in advance of the calculation we have here.</p> <p>  Regarding the fire certification process, the indicator we have is trying to identify the level of certification that is achieved within two months.  In the event that it is not achieved within two months, there is a statutory provision that allows for an extension of time from the applicant because, on occasion, the local authority will need to go back to the applicant looking for further information.  That accounts for some of the reasons they are not all delivered within the two-month period.  We have no indicator with regard to post-inspection.  After the building is constructed and the fire safety certificate has been issued, we do not have an indicator to measure performance in that area.</p> <p>  Building control was mentioned.  NOAC has highlighted this area in the report in that the level of inspections in some local authorities does not meet the minimum one would hope for.  Certainly the issue raised around the 79% level of non-compliance is significant.  From our interactions with individual local authorities, it has emerged that some non-compliance is relatively minor in nature and is resolved within a reasonable period.  It might be related to the absence of smoke alarms or fire extinguishers.  The inspection brings what needs to be done to the attention of the owner of the property.  According to the information we have been given in interactions with the local authorities, the issues tend to get addressed.    </p> <p>  As the drinking water performance indicator is for the schemes that have not transferred to Irish Water, it involves the group schemes, which remain the responsibility of the local authority.  </p></speech>

If, however, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Ms Larkin to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

The LGAS audits the annual financial statements of local authorities, including regional authorities, motor taxation offices and other bodies.<br/><br/>The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government appoints auditors, known as local government auditors, to carry out or assist in the carrying out of audits of local authorities and other bodies.  All local government auditors are qualified accountants and recruited following open public competitions.  Each local government auditor is assigned an audit district under warrant of authority from the director of audit.  Local government auditors are independent of the Department when discharging their professional functions.  This independence is protected in legislation in accordance with section 116(2) of the Local Government Act 2001.  The Act sets out the primary duties of the local government auditor as follows: </p> <blockquote> 	In the course of the audit of accounts of the local authority or other body, the local government auditor shall carry out such audit tests as he or she considers appropriate in order to be satisfied as to&mdash;  	(a) whether the annual financial statement is prepared in accordance with section 107 or with the accounting requirements otherwise applicable to the body concerned,<br /><br />(b) whether the annual financial statement presents fairly the financial position of the authority or other body and of its income and expenditure for the period in question,<br /><br />(c) whether the transactions of the audited body conform with the statutory or other authorisation under which they purport to have been carried out.  </blockquote> <p>There are a number of outputs from the audit.  Following the audit, each local government auditor issues an audit opinion, an audit report and a management letter to the chief executive of the local authority.  It is the local government auditor's main statutory duty, following completion of the financial audit, to give his or her independent audit opinion on the annual financial statement of the audited body as to whether it presents fairly the financial position of the audited body and of its income and expenditure for the period under audit.<br/><br/>In addition to the audit opinion, it is custom and practice to issue statutory audit reports covering any matter or matters that the auditor considers should be reported.  The chief executive of a local authority is required to respond to this report and his or her comments shall be included, if of material significance, as part of the final report.  This procedure has enhanced public scrutiny of local government as management responses to address the issues raised at audit now form part of the published audit reports. <br/><br/>In accordance with international standards on auditing, an auditor may issue a management letter drawing attention to any weaknesses in financial procedures and-or internal controls identified during audit and make appropriate recommendations.  <br/><br/>This report provides an overview of the work of the Local Government Audit Service in delivering on its statutory remit of providing the external audit of local government, in accordance with sections 114 to 126 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  The report is divided into three sections.  Section 1 covers the role of the Local Government Audit Service and the legislation that governs it.  It details the various relationships the Local Government Audit Service has with other bodies, including local authorities, their audit committees, the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It also highlights the role the value for money unit plays in assisting local authorities to learn from best practice.  <br/><br/>Section 2 summarises the financial performance of the 31 local authorities audited for the year ended 31 December 2017.  It details the main sources of both revenue and capital income and expenditure, together with historic data, so that comparisons can be made.  It details the value of assets under the control of local authorities and the liabilities that they face in both the short and long term.<br/><br/>Section 3 outlines some of the findings included in some of the local government auditors' audit reports and opinions.  The findings are set out under the following headings for the purpose of the overview report: financial standing; income collection; unfunded capital balances; capital projects; loans payable; development contributions; fixed assets; transfer of assets to Irish Water; procurement and purchasing; local authority companies; and governance, internal audit and audit committee.  The findings included in the overview report are not an exhaustive list of all findings but a summary of the main areas.  The audit reports for each local authority deal with the findings in detail.  Auditors continue to issue unqualified audit opinions on local authorities' audited financial statements, with one report, concerning 2017, containing an emphasis of matter.  Our primary sources of information for the overview report are local authority audited financial statements and the annual audit reports.<br/><br/>I hope this overview report gives an insight into the work carried out annually by the Local Government Audit Service.  I look forward to discussing it with members in detail.  As director of audit, I thank the committee for inviting me and my colleague, Mr. Richard Murphy, to today's meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1593" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019050900002#L00400"><p>I apologise in advance because I will have to leave to go to another meeting at 11.30 a.m.  I welcome the auditors and their work, which is important.  The auditors keep a proper, professional eye on the activities and functions of local government to make sure there is total transparency and accountability, books are kept properly and well and any issues that arise are brought to the attention of the individuals and councils concerned.  Everybody benefits as a result.</p><p> I made a query to the Local Government Audit Service last year or perhaps it was the year before in respect of a former student of mine who claimed he had been defrauded.  I am not naming names or even the council concerned; I want to be very clear on that point.  There was a court case and a person was deemed to have committed a criminal act and suffered penalties as a result.  The issue that arose was how the county council found itself in the position that it did.  There is a question in regard to what due diligence was done on the contract to ensure the company which was awarded the contract was actually the same company that had secured it previously.  Part of the issue was that the same notepaper and letterhead were used in both cases.  The basic detail is that a person was defrauded of money and the criminal justice system dealt with the matter.  How did the Local Government Audit Service deal with the case, however?  As it took place in 2009, I acknowledge that it was not a recent audit.  However, it was the outcome of a criminal case.  I do not expect the witnesses to comment on any criminal issues or matters that could impinge on someone's rights were any such things to happen in the future.  Having said that, how was that case dealt with?  </p></speech>

At the start of each audit, we meet the chief executive and each of the directors of services and go through anything that has happened during the year.  We go through all of the minutes of senior team management meetings and the council.  We would, therefore, be aware of any matter arising.  We also specifically ask the chief executive if there has been any fraud in the local authority during the year.  We deal with this issue under the remit of fraud.  We also speak to people such as the head of internal audit and head of finance about fraud.  If there was an incident of fraud, or a case like that, the local authority would, therefore, bring it to our attention.</p></speech>

I am a great supporter of the Local Government Audit Service.  It carries out an amazing function.  During the engagement with Deputy O'Dowd, I heard mentioned that the Local Government Audit Service reviews the minutes of councils.  This is the first I have heard of that and it is an important message to disseminate because councils will raise many issues in any particular year.  I was a councillor in D&uacute;n Laoghaire for many years.  I used to raise issues and wonder if I was mad for doing so.  I derive great comfort from hearing Ms Larkin state council minutes are examined as part of the audit process.  I state that because there are diligent councillors and some will always be involved in specific areas.  As was said to me, there will always be a small group of councillors who want to get under the bonnet.  I refer to those who want to know about governance issues and the really important issues that the public will not necessarily know much about.  They will always be a cohort of people interested in that-----</p></speech>

I looked at the report, which is excellent, and the combined report, which I downloaded from the website.  Then, as auditors do, I looked at ten local authority reports at random.  A few issues kept jumping out of the pages.  Before I delve into those in more detail, I have a general comment that might be taken on board.  The timelines for public engagement with the auditing process are very tight.  Ms Larkin will be aware that statutory notices are placed in most of the national and provincial newspapers informing people when an audit is taking place.  It could be next Monday, for instance.  I saw one such notice last week - I think it was in the <i>Meath Chronicle</i>- which stated that due notice was being given that an audit was taking place and that it would commence the following Monday.</p><p>That newspaper came out on the Thursday.  There was a ten day period, which is far too tight.  I ask that the witnesses look at this again.  People may buy a weekly provincial newspaper, such as the <i>Wicklow Times</i>, which will tell them on a Saturday that on Monday one can go in, within a very tight timeframe, pay a few euro and look at the accounts.  Most people, however, would not quite understand the whole thing.  Perhaps the witnesses might send a message to look again at this.  If we are serious about public engagement, about engagement with the finances and the corporate governance of authorities around transparency and about seeking the public's opinions and views, which is all very positive, then we must assist them.  Many of these people are lay people.  They are not financial experts.  I have heard where people have presented to the council and copies have not been made available, or the person asking for it is made to feel a bit of a nuisance.  It is not encouraged, which is a pity.  I would ask the representatives to look at this.<br/><br/>Reference was made to the management letters and I picked up on this from Deputy O'Dowd's engagement with the witnesses.  Every local authority gets an audit report, but does every local authority get a management letter?  It does.  The witness confirmed that.  Are these management letters sent directly to the councillors?  We are aware from the audit reports that they are usually sent to the chief executive or the cathaoirleach of the local authority but are not sent to the local authority members.  The chief executive invariably will tell the local authority members that it cannot be made public until he or she has discussed it with the audit committee.  In many cases, their audit committees only meet four times a year so if, for example, it is not to meet for another three months, there is a situation where it is running late and councillors are looking at 2017 audit reports in 2019.  I am aware it does not take two years but it takes some 15 months and there can be another deferral.  There is not a proactive response.  Some local authorities do not like engagement.<br/><br/>I was informed about two councils and I took the time to look at the webcasts of the meetings where the councils only discussed these reports briefly, sometimes just for ten minutes.  We need to look at the situation of how the audit reports are circulated.  I want the witnesses to confirm this to me.  I see no reason, when the Local Government Audit Service<b></b>sends the report to the<b></b>chief executive and the cathaoirleach or the mayor of the council, that all the councillors should not have it also.  At that stage, it is all done.  The audit committee cannot adjust or tweak any element of the audit report so there is no good reason all elected members of the council could not have the report.  I ask the representatives to consider this and take it on board.  It is feedback.<br/><br/>I now turn to the issue of the fixed asset register.  I will give an example of some comments that are in some of the audit reports.  I will not identify the councils because it would be unfair.  A review of one council's fixed asset register of lands and buildings indicates that it has not been properly maintained.  The report identifies that council assets have been incorrectly registered to a third party rather than to that particular council or were never registered in the names of the council.  The Local Government Audit Service stated that a council needed to:</p><blockquote>	Review its historic assets, as issues highlighted above identify assets that were either unregistered or registered to an incorrect party.  The Council must ensure that it has recorded appropriate title to all its assets. [This had not happened] Identify all way leaves or permissions pertaining to these assets, and record and register all its assets with the Property Interest Register [which were incomplete]. </blockquote><p>Another report said that a council should &quot;Complete the process of transferring title to IW [Irish Water] for assets removed from the books of the Council totalling &euro;300m.&quot;  This is in a Local Government Audit Service report and is common in relation to the transfer of assets to Irish Water.  Another report says that a council must ensure that &quot;the insurance register needs to be reconciled with fixed assets&quot;, which is not happening in some cases.  This is to ensure that all the assets are properly insured at year end.  The report on corporate estate governance and management of local authorities shows that a number of local authorities are not carrying through on those audits.  The audit service said that the follow up progress reports identified by a certain number of councils did not have such plans in place but would commence and have given an undertaking that they would do so.  The standard chief executive response in all the audit reports I read was that they had a resource problem.  We cannot have a situation where chief executives tell the audit service that the local authority has a resource issue.  Millions of euro of real estate should be properly registered.<br/><br/>I commend the Local Government Audit Service on its work.  It has identified that assets are not on insurance registers and are not on proper asset registers of local authorities.  This has been going on for years.  I am not going to ask the witnesses more about this because the audit service accepts this and knows it to be the case, a true account of which it has given in its reports.  It is, however, an area that I would ask about.  The audits are not one of my functions and I am only giving the feedback but we need a real focus on this.  We need more training, more assistance and more IT skills.  The mapping of our real estate is very important across the 31 local authorities.<br/><br/>This brings me back to Rebuilding Ireland, the land development agency, and all the various agencies that are now challenged with tapping into the potential of the State's real estate.  Clearly, the remit of the Local Government Audit Service is the local authorities but there are also Irish Rail properties, the ports and many other places.  There are vast tracts of land.  In the case of my own local authority there are parklands that are not even registered.  No one even seems to know them.  There is a massive amount of work to be done.<br/><br/>Another area that needs to be looked at is the issue of companies associated with the councils.  We aware that many local authorities have wholly owned subsidiary companies, of which the local authority is the sole shareholder.  Substantial money is involved.  The chief executives of those local authorities act as the agents on behalf of the shareholders.  The companies are wholly owned by the local authorities and deal in millions of euro of real estate, yet we do not seem to know how the agent is accountable to the shareholder.  This is a real challenge for local government auditing.  There is now a situation where vast numbers of assets and properties are being put at arm's length away from the elected members.  The witnesses will be familiar with section 83 and how we can dispose of properties.  We cannot altogether blame the councils because the councillors themselves do not always have the expertise.  They have the willingness and the desire to keep control as part of their elected mandated, but now we have these companies that are at arm's length and where the council executive is making the decisions unknown to the elected members of the council.  The executives propose to dispose of the assets of these companies and in some cases are disposing of assets that are zoned for residential purposes or potentially for residential development.  There is an issue there.  Is the Local Government Audit Service planning to look at this?  I would suggest that this is an area of focus, perhaps in a future audit, for the Local Government Audit Service and that it would look at these wholly owned subsidiaries and companies.  I note in every audit report that the Local Government Audit Service has a section in the back.  This goes from sports and leisure companies to arts, theatres and so on.  There are a lot of problems around these issues with accountability and good governance.  This is not to suggest that there is any other thing wrong, although the audit service has mentioned that.  I do not want to get into those specifics here.<br/><br/>Does the Local Government Audit Service believe it has sufficient resources to carry out what is a very onerous task?  Much work is required and the witnesses might want to comment on that.  Do the witnesses have a view on the Committee of Public Accounts?  Perhaps they have a view and do not want to share it, which I understand.  Is there some format in which we can bring the Accounting Officers to account?  It is all about accountability.  From the Local Government Audit Service audit reports over the years, I have picked up that the service is doing excellent work and it is identifying weaknesses, but it is getting the usual old message from the chief executives saying &quot;We do not have the resources.&quot;  I do not believe the Local Government Audit Service has enough teeth to sanction.  While the service can identify the problems and weaknesses, somehow this is about accountability also.  The chief executives are very well paid and they have an onerous task, but they do not take personal responsibility.  They are not personally held accountable for issues around this whole area.  In private sector business they would be held accountable because there are consequences when people fail in the private sector.  I am not convinced there are sufficient consequences for chief executives for failures that may be found, having gone through due process - I am not judging anyone.  Would the Committee of Public Accounts or the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General be the format?  I would be very interested to hear the relationship the Local Government Audit Service has with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.+</p><p>Is there a mechanism with which we can elevate the Local Government Audit Service's work?  I am thinking of a means to bring chief executives to a public forum and hold them to account on the key issues, the recommendations the service makes and the areas it deals with.  Indeed I would suggest going beyond that.  I would be really interested in helping.  I congratulate Ms Larkin on her agency's really important work.  My concern is with following up on it and holding the right people to account on behalf of the public.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1647" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh Larkin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019050900002#O00200"><p>I will take each of those points in sequence.  I have raised the issue of the circulation of our audit reports.  We work under a very tight deadline to have all our audits finished by 31 October each year.  The audits for 31 December 2018 are now ongoing.  They are all expected to be finished by 31 October.  We work under a very tight schedule to achieve those deadlines and get those reports out.  As the Senator notes, we have a mechanism whereby we send them to the chief executive and the head of finance of the local authority involved.  Different local authorities follow very different plans after that.  Some local authorities put the audit report on their own website the minute we send it to them, give us permission to post it on the Department's website and circulate it to the council in the next council pack.  Other local authorities, as was said, wait until the report goes to the audit committee.  Then there is a time delay because the audit committee has to prepare a report which must go back to the council.  That is not satisfactory for us because then we are looking at accounts for December 2017 in December 2019.  They are too far out of date.  The issues have become dated for the councillors.  Ideally, we would like to see it circulated.</p> <p>  There are two pieces of legislation that cover the issuance of our audit reports.  Legislation requires us to send our audit report to the chief executive.  There is also legislation under which the audit committee must consider our report.  The problem is that the two pieces of legislation each stand alone.  They do not outline a sequence which local authorities must follow.  To resolve this issue, I have raised it with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, and the heads of finance.  The Department is now looking to put together some guidance for local authorities on what should happen on receipt of our audit reports.  Ideally, I would like for the report to be circulated within a very short time of us issuing it so that the issues can be actioned in a timely manner. </p> <p>  The second point the Senator raised concerned the management letters.  When an issue is raised as part of the audit, it either ends up in the audit report or the management letter.  We decide where it ends up based on the priority rating we assign it.  We rate all our issues as high, medium or low priority.  We also rank them.  The most important issues end up in the audit report and the other issues end up in the management letter.  The format of the management letter is such that we set out the issue, its implications and our recommendation on it.  We rank that issue and then ask management for a response and a timeframe within which it will address the issue.  We then follow up on that timeframe in the next audit.  I know that a lot of the audit committees receive the management letter.  From speaking to the audit committees, I know that they use our issues, put them into a template and track them as part of their audit committee meetings.  Some audit committees now call in members of the senior management team to talk about issues in our audit report or management letter and see what progress has been made.  We welcome that.  That is another means of looking at the issue in order to resolve it. </p> <p>  Fixed assets are an area we would look at.  As the Senator said, a lot of value is contained in assets.  Some of the fixed assets consist of things like roads and parks, but our main concern is land and buildings.  Those are the areas on which we concentrate.  All the issues are listed on page 39 of our summary report.  It is important to note that while some of the issues come up year after year, some progress is being made on them.  This progress can be seen in audit reports as well and it is summarised on page 39.  The problem is that many of these are legacy issues.  As the Senator said, there is a legal issue.  The local authority must find a legal title and map the site.  Many local authorities are using things like geographic information systems, GIS, and technology to help make progress on that, but there is still a lot of work to be done in that area.  We welcome any progress local authorities can make in that area. </p> <p>  The Senator's fourth point concerned companies.  This comes up every year.  There is a separate appendix at the back of the annual financial statement, AFS, appendix 8, in which the local authority has to list all the relevant companies.  We audit that as part of the process.  We ask for the audited accounts of those local authorities.  We look at the audit report and any guarantees given by the council.  We have raised all those issues and obviously we have several concerns about those companies.  As the Senator said, there is sometimes a lack of governance or control where these companies are concerned.  They may be operating at deficits in situations where the council has guaranteed their funding, or they may owe large amounts to councils.  We have concerns, which we raise.  Some of these are small companies that might be set up to run a swimming pool, for example.  Some are very substantial companies that hold real estate.  In those cases we do a lot more work on the figures behind the accounts.  The auditors sometimes meet with the boards of those companies and look at board minutes to make sure that any concerns are reflected in our audit reports. </p> <p>  The Senator asked about our resources.  We have 32 members of staff at the moment.  We are currently running four or five vacancies.  We find it difficult to attract staff because of the economic conditions in the major cities.  We faced this problem last year and this year.  We deal with it through the use of seconded staff from accountancy firms.  However, that is not something we want to continue and we are working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to address those shortfalls.  Our priority is audit, so our focus each year is on ensuring that all the audited financial statements are completed by 31 October.  If we have extra days we use them to examine value for money.  If we do not have enough staff we do not undertake as much value for money work as we would in years when we have a full complement of staff.  </p> <p>  The Senator asked about accountability.  I know the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, also spoke about having more oversight and accountability.  There are mechanisms that work, such as the audit committees, which have been up and running for a few years.  I refer particularly to their approach to tracking the issues in the last two or three years.  We are very closely linked with the NOAC.  We agree our programme of work on value for money in advance with NOAC and it informs us of the areas it is looking at.  We undertook four reports last year on what we consider to be audit issues.  We looked at unfunded balances, rates, loans and the cost of pensions to local authorities.  We consulted with the NOAC on areas it wished to focus on and on audit issues we had seen coming up.  We ask for input into our planning for work on value for money issues. </p> <p>  In regard to our relationship with the Comptroller and Auditor General, I note that we are part of a group called the Public Audit Forum, PAF.  It is made up of audit bodies in the UK, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We get together and share thinking on emerging trends such as data analytics.  We look at best practice in our areas of work.  On top of that, I meet periodically with one of the directors from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to talk about things like training and work practices.</p></speech>

To wrap up, I would like to suggest three things that her agency might consider in its next audit.  These are only suggestions, because I have no statutory function in all of this.  The value and cost of pensions to local authorities is a ticking bomb.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1649" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>That is something on which a special report is needed.  I refer secondly to the issue of the lands and assets register and whether there is a need for additional training and resources.  It is a specialist area and technology will crack it in time to a great extent.  There are multiple agencies doing this work and it is an area which needs a special report.  I refer also to the issue of these wholly-owned private companies associated with local authorities in terms of their governance and accountability to the elected members who are ultimately charged with responsibility.  Having read many of the service's audit reports, those are three areas which jump off the pages as areas in which alarm bells should be rung.  While it is a matter for the audit service as to how it does its work, those are three areas I would like to look at again.  Certainly, I will keep a keen eye on the next reports.  They are three areas on which we need work and, perhaps, special reports.  The audit service does special reports and in that context, these are areas it might consider.  In any event, I say "Well done" and thank the witnesses for coming in.</p></speech>

I can send the Senator a copy.  It looked at the number of pensioners, the sums paid out each year in pensions and the actuarial review carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for local authorities as to overall viability.  We have done a very detailed report on pensions and the pensions gap in local authorities regarding income and expenditure.  Land and asset registers and local authority companies are areas we are already looking at as part of the 2018 audit and they will appear again for 2019.</p></speech>

Having served on an audit committee in Wicklow, I confirm that we were always shown the management letter from the auditors.  In fairness, it gave one a greater insight into what the thinking behind the report was.  It was always a valuable piece of information.  Pensions have been mentioned.  The cost of pensions is a recurring issue in every budgetary process in every local authority.  I have not read the report referred to and I look forward to doing so.</p> <p>  When one looks at the report before the committee, there is not much of concern that is not covered.  It covers almost everything from unfunded capital balances to capital projects, loans payable, development contributions and so on.  Is there a trend whereby one or two of these issues arise across all local authorities or is each authority unique?  Are there specific areas of concern on which the committee should focus?  Having gone through 12 Estimates processes - it is in late November since the property tax has come in - I note that we still sit during the last week waiting for the phone call from the Department to say the local government fund will be in or about the same as last year.  The huge area that local authorities take a gamble on relates to grants, whether for roads or whatever.  We always take a punt on that and think we will get what we got last year or budget for a 5% increase in the hope that we get it.  Is that the right way to do business?  Is there a more transparent way to deal with that issue?</p> <p>  I have a concern that once again we have kicked the local property tax review down the road.  Wicklow is currently going through a rates review for the first time in 40 years.  The implications for some businesses are unbelievable.  We have not carried out a local property tax review for more than five years and seem to be going the same way in that regard.  There are thousands of properties which pay absolutely nothing in property taxes which could help to fund local authorities.  Can Ms Larkin give a view on those few items?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1654" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh Larkin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019050900002#P00600"><p>On issues that arise in each local authority, we ask that local government auditors comment on certain things in each audit report.  We always ask that financial standing is commented on and we always ask that income collection is commented on.  Those are massive areas in a local authority.  The transfer to Irish Water is another and then we ask for consideration of governance arrangements around internal audit, audit committees and local authority companies.  Outside those areas, the local government auditor can deal with the issues he or she feels are relevant.  There are items that occur in many local authorities, simply by virtue of their nature.  For example, fixed assets, procurement and purchasing will usually appear.  Usually, there is something in the area of unfunded balances or development contributions.  One sees those in the majority of audit reports.  That is simply the nature of the topics.</p> <p>  I was asked about budgeting.  We look at the budgets local authorities prepare each year and then we look at the actual turn out compared to budget.  Looking at how local authorities go about preparing their budgets is outside our remit.  However, I would have thought finance would have built up a great deal of knowledge on what comes in.  Those people are working with the different Departments that award the grants and would have a history there.</p> <p>  While it was not in the area of LPT, one of the special reports we prepared was on properties not being captured for rates, to which the Vice Chairman has just referred.  There are properties also awaiting valuation, which means there is a loss of income to the local authority.  We looked at that area.  LPT is a policy matter and we only look at how accurately it is reflected in the financial statements.  On LPT and properties being revalued, we look only at how the policy is implemented.</p></speech>

Before we start, I remind members and witnesses to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off.  This is important as they cause serious problems for the broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.</p> <p>  I am delighted that today we have engagement on Europe Day.  We have a presentation by the students on the challenges facing the European Union and we are all very much looking forward to that.</p> <p>  I welcome all the witnesses to this special meeting of the joint committees on Europe Day.</p><p>On this day in 1950 Robert Schuman outlined his vision for Europe of peace and co-operation between nations.  That was nearly 70 years ago, but it laid the foundations for the European Union we know today.  It is a strong partnership of nations that are working together to achieve the common goals of peace and prosperity.  Ireland joined the European Economic Community, EEC, now the European Union, in 1973 and has been a proud participant in European institutions for more than 45 years.  Citizens of Ireland tend to be very positive about our EU membership.  The results of a recent poll carried out by Red C Research and Marketing for the European Movement of Ireland showed that 93% of Irish people supported remaining in the European Union.  This shows the success of the European project and the benefits the European Union has brought to the country.<br/><br/>For Ireland, membership of international rules-based organisations is the best way to build relationships and alliances and for countries to support each other.  Europe Day is a great opportunity for us all to reflect on where we are and what we have achieved.  Importantly, it is also an opportunity to discuss the challenges ahead for all of us and how we can work together to find solutions to them.  In the context of Brexit and all of the implications that stem from it, it is more important than ever before for politicians, of all political allegiances and none, to work together and show a united front when it comes to doing our job and ensuring a good team effort across the political divide.  I sincerely believe it is terribly important for us to do so.  <br/><br/>Elections to the European Parliament will be held across the European Union in a few weeks' time.  The results of the same poll to which I referred showed that younger cohorts who were the most positive towards the European Union and many of its policies and who certainly had views on the issues at stake were also the least likely group to vote on 24 May.  It is important that we find ways to engage with each other and hear from experts emerging in their fields.  It is especially important that we hear the views of young people on the issues that will affect the future of the European Union.  I am passionate about this issue.  When I look at young people, I see them as the future.  In the years to come they will be the politicians and employers.  Every one of us is on a wheel and our time in our different roles comes and then finishes.  It will then be the turn of the young people who are before me.  When I go into schools, national and secondary, all I think of is that they are the future.  They are the ones who will be running the country, the Europe Union and the world in the years ahead.  I am very conscious of this, as we all should be.  <br/><br/>I do not think we have ever held a meeting of five joint committees before.  Today's event shows a new approach and how important it is that we take a cross-sectoral approach to such broad issues.  I welcome our guests, the students and young people from Queens University Belfast, QUB; Ulster University, UU; Teagasc; University College Dublin, UCD; Dublin City University, DCU; National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG; National University of Ireland, Maynooth, NUIM; and our neighbours in University College Cork, UCC.  <br/><br/>The meeting will be divided into four sessions and the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the relevant committee will chair its session.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. <br/><br/>I ask the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Deering, to lead us in the discussion on the reform of the Common Agriculture Policy.</p></speech>

In this session we will deal with the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which has served the country well in recent years.  In our discussion we are going to hear about where it is going to go in the months and years ahead.  The discussion will include the environmental and budgetary aspects of the CAP.  Budgets are very important, as nothing can be done without them.  We will also hear about reform, subsidiarity and flexibility.  We would like to hear about all of these elements.  Whenever there is a discussion about the CAP, we hear about the need to make it more simplified.  "Simplification" is a big word, but the CAP always seems to come out more bureaucratic.  We are looking forward to the discussion on the next CAP taking place and being concluded in the next year or so to finally have a more simplified programme.  I am delighted that we are joined by Mr. Daniel Bakker from Queens University Belfast, Dr. Sin&eacute;ad Furey and Dr. Lynsey Hollywood from Ulster University, Dr. Sin&eacute;ad McCarthy from Teagasc and Ms Si&uacute;n M&aacute;ire Riordan from University College Cork.

I will speak about the CAP for a few minutes.  </p> <p>  In June 2018 the European Commission put forward its legislative proposals for the future of the CAP post 2020.  Previous reforms of the CAP had been driven by political and economic change.  It is important, therefore, for all concerned to look at the political challenges facing the European Union and what the future of the CAP might look like.</p> <p>  The European Union is facing the challenges of UK withdrawal, the rise of a Eurosceptic tide across member states, global market instability, particularly in agricultural prices, and greater pressure to respond and adapt to climate change.  The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union is crucial because it has contributed significantly to a forecasted reduction in the CAP budget for the period 2021 to 2027.  The cut proposed is 5%, but it will be around 12% in real terms.  As the CAP is one of the cornerstones of European integration, it is important that the Commission&rsquo;s proposals be considered and scrutinised.</p> <p>  The proposed legislation retains the current two-pillar structure of direct payments and rural development but allows much greater flexibility for member states to choose where their allocation of funds will go.  The Commission&rsquo;s rationale is to streamline the CAP and increase overall efficiency.  Member states will be better able to target their interventions to suit their specific contexts.  The proposals also have revised greening architecture for pillar 1 payments and put strong emphasis on the CAP&rsquo;s commitment to environmental sustainability.</p> <p>  Member states will be responsible for drawing up strategic plans which will then be approved by the Commission to ensure they stay within the CAP&rsquo;s overall objectives.  Some see this as a step in the right direction, but others, including some member states, have raised concerns as strategic plans might place a further administrative burden on national governments.  Many agricultural stakeholders have criticised the idea as it could potentially lead to an undermining of the Single Market and compromise a level playing field for farmers.  Some fear the proposals amount to a renationalisation of agriculture and will increase bureaucracy and market distortions, resulting from differences in implementation across the European Union.  Affording member states too much flexibility has also been criticised by environmentalists.  As well as criticising the continuation of "perverse subsidies", environmentalists argue that flexibility with no real incentives to have ambitious targets could lead to declining environmental standards across the European Union.  The proposed "enhanced conditionality" clause in the new legislative proposals has been viewed as more greenwashing of the CAP, without sufficient accountability mechanisms to ensure adherence to environmental regulations.</p> <p>  It is important to stress that the proposals are in their very early stages.</p><p>As we saw with the previous CAP reform in 2013, nothing is likely to be passed until the EU budget is agreed.  There will be a new European Parliament and perhaps a new European Commissioner by the time the legislation enters into force, but as the proposal stands, there are several steps that could be taken to ensure a successful CAP.</p><p> There could be greater promotion of dialogue between environmentalist organisations and agricultural stakeholders.  At least since the 1992 reform of CAP, we have seen the struggle to merge agricultural production with environmental protection, which, unfortunately, sometimes leads to conflicting and contradictory interests.  Helping to promote common ground at EU and national levels could result in a more coherent policy.  The approval process for strategic plans needs to be transparent and as strong as possible, as this is essentially the only mechanism for ensuring that national priorities do not conflict with EU-wide objectives.  Maintaining the common aspect of the CAP is essential.  Furthermore, the proposals allow for only the Commission to approve strategic plans, but to improve accountability, that process could be based formally on widespread consultation and should involve input from the co-legislators and various stakeholders.  What happens if there is an impasse between national priorities and CAP objectives should be spelled out by the Commission.  As the Commission views the next CAP as a move towards evidence-based policy, which prioritises results over compliance, it is important the data sources are to an appropriate standard and that national Governments have the technical capacity to construct and defend a strategic plan.  This might involve greater investment in technical assistance and upgrading of skills, which will be difficult if the current budget predictions are accurate.</p><p> The period for the next CAP is one of learning for the European Union as it experiments with this new delivery model.  It is important for all concerned that there be awareness of the challenges facing the upcoming reform, which will be shaped by competing interests among stakeholders within a potentially reduced budget.  It is important to stress the crucial role of dialogue and consultation to ensure an efficient and coherent CAP.</p></speech>

I will present a joint perspective on behalf of myself and my colleague from Ulster University business school, Dr. Lynsey Hollywood.  We very much welcome the opportunity to discuss our perspective on the future and ongoing reform of the CAP.  It is entirely appropriate that such a collaborative and open approach is used because it is in this capacity as stakeholders that farmers and wider stakeholders have an important opinion in this area.</p> <p>  Our presentation will focus on four main priorities we believe that any ongoing CAP reform should include.  The first is to address the volatility or instability of our agricultural markets because we consider primary food production a special case.  The exceptionalism of food means that a political and social importance is attached to it, and it is entirely appropriate to give meaningful support to farmers in recognition of their contribution to this important primary production.  It is also important to consider the issue of cross-compliance, but without subsidising or supporting any lack of competitiveness or inefficiencies within agriculture.  It is also entirely appropriate that the support is directed towards farmers in less favourable farming areas.  Any income support or resilience payment should not be allowed to become a surrogate for income support, nor a means of indefinitely maintaining uneconomical farming units.  There should continue to be a focus on the full decoupling of primary production from income support, without any regression to coupling food production with any kind of payment.  This will allow any agrifood industry ultimately to become more responsive, which is an important future direction to be consumer orientated and market led.</p> <p>  The lack of collaboration in the farming community and, more widely, agrifood is an issue.  Government intervention could usefully foster greater collaboration, although that will need careful consideration through, for example, appropriate incentivisation.  A better understanding of market requirements would enable farmers to move from a production mentality to a more marketing mindset.  Any support could usefully be focused on support for know-how of marketing aspects.  Identifying that market need or niche in the market and how to differentiate one's product offering would help create diversification, support farmers in that mentality and allow us to look towards a strong, value-added market with strong export potential.  In the light of agricultural exceptionalism, some mechanism needs to be in place to ensure a secure, sustainable, healthy environment, and to prevent instability of the agricultural market, erratic food prices and market distortion.  It is important that any solution does not serve to increase food prices for the end consumer.</p> <p>  That brings me to the second priority, namely, food security, which covers the continuity of supply, health and food poverty.  The security of supply is especially important in the context of Europe and globally, given the increasing population and the need to feed more people and produce more food for more people.  The world's population is predicted to be 9 billion by 2050.  It would be appropriate for any ongoing and future reform of the CAP or agricultural framework to consider health, simply because of the relationship between food choice, nutrition and health.  These policies should usefully complement one another.  We need our industry to encourage production of food consistent with guidelines for healthy eating and for population nutrition.  That leaves us a space in food innovation to ensure we meet that market nee, although it cannot be at the expense of the twin objectives of productivity alongside environmental sustainability.  As for unnecessary costs being accrued to the consumer, paradoxically, those consumers who stand to benefit most from a healthy diet are those who can least afford it.  Consumers, therefore, must not be disadvantaged by a two-tier pricing policy or as a consequence of their reality.  They must be able to access, afford and avail of healthy food.</p> <p>  Our third priority is ensuring that food and farming are public goods, which we hinted at earlier in the context of environmental production.  We need to consider and continue the emphasis on the active management of land, which should be rewarded in a way that respects cross-compliance.  Farming is more than its principal purpose of primary production and, therefore, any payment schedule made to farmers must be conditional upon food safety, food quality, environmental and animal welfare, and occupational health and safety standards.  We need to consider the pivotal role that farming can play in preserving and enhancing the rural and natural environments, the importance of which we should not diminish.  Our farming counterparts are the custodians of our natural environment and it is important to respect the amenity value of the countryside.  Any future agricultural framework and policy should aim to preserve and enhance the amenity and recreational value of our land, and to reward landowners for conducting that public good on society's behalf.</p> <p>  Our final priority is the maintenance of the rural population and rural development.  Agriculture requires generational renewal of active farmers.  As we hinted at in the context of incentivisation, one might expect us, from a university perspective, to suggest that continuing professional development, short courses and educational attainment in this regard are also important.  Universities and the higher education sector have a role to play in providing access to increasing professional educational attainment in this area, and in allowing farmers to have that marketing mindset and the export potential to be exploited.  We welcome a multi-actor approach to science and innovation, involving support agencies and research institutions.</p> <p>  In conclusions, further reform of the CAP is to be welcomed.  We recommend that policy makers continue to pursue aggressively the decoupling of food production from payments to exploit that truly market-orientated, consumer-led approach and to allow for complementary agrifood and health policies in a way that is mutually supportive of people, the planet and profit.</p></speech>

I will comment on the sustainability of the Irish diet from the point of view of carbon footprint, its implications for policy, including policy from the point of view of the end user and the end of the food supply chain, and accounting for consumer food behaviour.  The contribution of food consumption towards climate change has received increasing attention in recent years, especially recently with the launch of the EAT-<i>Lancet</i>report.  In its present form, food consumption is responsible for as much as 30% of EU greenhouse gas emissions, GHGs.  Therefore, we need to look at food choices and food behaviour and see how we can alter them to influence health and the environment.<br/><br/>Are there any food choice behaviours that are sustainable as a diet and nutritionally acceptable?  Can the two areas meet?  The UN Food and Agriculture Organization defines sustainable diets as those &quot;with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations.  Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy&quot;. <br/><br/>The &quot;economically fair&quot; aspect of this is very important as the agriculture industry is the largest indigenous industry in Ireland.  GHGs associated with food production are measured in carbon equivalents to produce a carbon footprint for the food we consume.  In general, plant-based foods are low in GHG emissions, whereas foods from animal sources are higher, especially those from ruminant animals.  The European Commission has found that Ireland has one of the lowest carbon footprints of animal products in Europe because of the system we use to produce meat.  Foods from animal sources provide many essential nutrients necessary for good health and, therefore, are an important part of a healthy diet.  Certain nutrients can only be found in meat products and are not available in plant products.  Environmental and human health issues should be considered together to ensure socially and nutritionally optimal outcomes for both.<br/><br/>Research is ongoing in Teagasc, in conjunction with University College Cork, to examine the carbon footprint of the Irish diet and food consumption behaviours which result in a more or less sustainable and health diet.  The aim is to determine the quantity of GHG emissions associated with food consumption patterns in Irish adults and to determine what patterns of food consumption are associated with sustainability and health.  We use the best publicly available data to do the national adult nutrition survey funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine through its fair funding measure.  Each food consumed was converted into carbon equivalents and the carbon produced by consuming these foods was measured, instead of looking at nutrients as is traditionally done.  It is no surprise that meat, in particular ruminant meat, made the highest contribution to carbon in the Irish diet as a result of the high conversion factor associated with meat and dairy, while plant sourced foods had the lowest CO<sub>2</sub>in the diet.<br/><br/>It is important to eat a varied diet and not just one particular food group.  Consumers who followed a cultural pattern traditional to the Irish diet, with high meat, fruit and vegetable consumption, had the lowest CO<sub>2</sub>footprint of all consumers, showing that meat plays a very important role in health and a sustainable diet.  We also found that food consumption and energy intake beyond our nutritional requirements contributed to the public health epidemic of obesity, as well as food waste.  Promoting a healthier diet and lifestyle, which reduces food consumption, also helps from an environmental perspective.  The findings from this research support the notion that any policy measures should be evidence based and should consider the prevailing cultural food consumption patterns of a population.  CAP reform, and any associated food policy instruments developed for sustainability reasons, should be holistic in nature and take other parameters such as health and nutrition into consideration, rather than concentrating on one food group.  It should reward more sustainable production and meet our consumer demands. </p></speech>

I welcome their engagement with younger citizens.  I am a second year European studies student in University College Cork.<br/><br/>As a young person growing up in rural Ireland, I have seen the importance of the agricultural industry and the difference the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, makes in Ireland.  One of the leading incentives behind Ireland&rsquo;s decision to apply for European Union membership was the opportunity of gaining support from the CAP.  When the CAP was introduced under the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the objectives were to improve and stabilise the incomes of those engaged in the farm sector, largely through market support mechanisms but with some activities oriented towards improving farming productivity and structural adjustments within the farm sector.  As the EU now discusses the future of the CAP post 2020, it is important to recall how beneficial this policy is and has been for Ireland.<br/><br/>One of the aspects of the CAP that has had the greatest impact on the lives of farmers across the EU has been the payment schemes.  Farmers are given money for maintaining their land and young farmers are given payments to encourage them to start farming.  They are given grants or loans to help start up and farmers can receive the green direct payments for reaching environment objectives.  The objective of the CAP is to give farmers and other agricultural workers a decent standard of living.  While the CAP is not always fairly divided among all recipients, it has still improved the income for thousands of farmers across Ireland and the EU.  The CAP&rsquo;s direct payment schemes help protect farmers from the uncertainty of the market.  At the moment, the CAP has a small farmers' scheme which is aimed at supporting smaller farmers in Europe.  However, this only operates in 15 EU countries and<i></i>Ireland is not among them.  This is unfortunate because if this policy were introduced in Ireland, it would aid many more in the agricultural industry.  Many Irish farmers are small farmers and the CAP currently does not have a big an impact on their lives.<br/><br/>The CAP encourages green, sustainable farming.  Part of the direct payment is given to farmers who strive for greener, more environment friendly agricultural production.  In theory, this should help Ireland improve its carbon footprint and reach its climate change objectives.  Farmers gain more by diversifying their crop and meeting environmental goals.  This is important for farmers as it gives them the opportunity to receive more from the CAP schemes while also encouraging them to be more environmentally conscious.  The CAP may be more known for its payments to farmers but it is also very focused on rural development and sustainability.  The CAP has helped many local, rural regions around Ireland.  Between 2007 and 2013, &euro;4.3 billion in funding was given to help agricultural production that would benefit rural areas.<br/><br/>The CAP also helps non-agricultural activities, such as small-scale manufacturing and food processing.  Such activities encourage businesses to set up in rural areas, focusing on the development of the local food sector.  This is important as it brings employment to rural regions and allows small, rural, agricultural communities to prosper and to use their large agricultural sector to develop compatible businesses.  When rural areas are developed, this development attracts more people to the area, offers more employment and can increase tourism.  The increase in employment is especially important as many farmers who operate small farms must get jobs outside the farm to supplement their household income.  This is made easier when the region around them is more developed, giving them a greater opportunity to find employment.  The development of these areas is vital to encourage people to stay and continue, or even start, farming in these rural areas.  The continuance of CAP ensures the development of Irish rural areas and gives further aid to the agricultural workers here.<br/><br/>The Agriculture and Fisheries Council will meet next week and I will follow its discussions about the future of the CAP post 2020 very closely.  At the most recent meeting in April, I was stuck by the emphasis by the Romanian Presidency on the environmental ambition of the CAP.  I agree that this is a major feature of CAP reform.  It will be advantageous not only to EU farmers but to every single EU citizen.  As a young citizen, I value sustainable development and want a green future for Ireland.  I know that Ministers have been discussing climate, biodiversity and water quality, to name just a few issues.  I hope to see a future in which we can enjoy sustainable food security and see an improvement in the environmental issues that exist today.</p></speech>

The CAP and CAP reform are a key part of our body of work at committee level and we have already made a number of submissions to Europe.</p><p>We attended several Council meetings around Europe, including in Croatia and Romania in recent months.  Members of the committee made a presentation at the European Parliament's agriculture committee approximately a year ago.  It is a priority matter for the committee and a significant issue for agriculture in Ireland, as all present are aware.  It is important that we keep engaging with this process.  Agriculture is our largest indigenous industry but it does not get its fair share of media coverage when it needs it.  It is great to have this opportunity to discuss the matter.  I am joined by some members of the committee and I would like to have engagement with them and the witnesses over the next ten or 15 minutes.  We will take a couple of questions together if that is acceptable to the witnesses.</p></speech>

Has research been conducted on what will happen in the advent of Brexit for the farmers in Northern Ireland in terms of their current income?  That question is for Mr. Bakker and Dr. Furey.  Does Dr. McCarthy know whether Teagasc has conducted research on our capacity to sustainably provide sufficient plant-based food for this country and some for export, in addition to a certain amount of meat production and land being used to plant forestry, in the case of increased demand for a plant-based diet?</p></speech>

Dr. Furey mentioned that we should move away from coupling and towards decoupling.  How can the vulnerable sectors be supported to ensure a sustainable future for them?  On suckler beef farmers, who are a key part of the industry in the west of Ireland, if that industry goes into decline, large parts of that region may be depopulated, which would have a significantly negative effect on rural Ireland.  How could the next CAP protect the vulnerable sectors of the agriculture industry?</p></speech>

We have a very busy schedule today and there is a significant amount of work relating to this meeting.  It is a momentous day and it is great to be able to record our participation in the European Union and celebrate Europe Day.</p> <p>  Agriculture accounts for a large part of our portfolio and work.  There has been a significant shift in recent years to larger dairy and crop farmers.  Similarly, larger dry stock farmers seem to be more prevalent.  The days of the part-time farmer who may have a second job and tend 40 acres or 50 acres may be numbered.  From the perspective of Dr. McCarthy and Teagasc, in ten or 15 years, will part-time farming be a thing of the past?  While canvassing for the local and European elections, as all politicians have been doing, I noted the number of unoccupied smaller farm holdings which are being subsumed by larger farmholders.  Does Dr. McCarthy anticipate a massive change in our model of farming?  That seems to have happened in recent years.</p></speech>

From which countries are these products coming?  The products at which I have looked are not produced in Ireland.  I am specifically referring to plant-based protein foods for human consumption.  Is there a desire or ability to grow them in Ireland?  I know there are issues around soya beans in that regard.  I understand that many types of beans come from the tropics and are more suited to such climates, which obviously means there is a carbon footprint involved in bringing them here.  In many parts of the tropics, people do not have enough food or their diet is not as good as it should be.  I direct my questions particularly at Dr. McCarthy.</p></speech>

I offer their apologies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1684" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sin&eacute;ad McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019050900002#E00900"><p>I will roll two responses into one.  On the issue of from where plant-based foods are coming and whether there is a way to combine animal and plant-based production in Ireland, certain climates and agricultural environments lend themselves better to certain types of food production.  For example, producing meat and dairy in Ireland is very suited to our climate as we get a lot of rain and do not solely rely on the water supply for agriculture.  Many of our animals are grass fed for more than 300 days per year and when they are kept in during the winter months they are fed from silage.  Very little animal feed is given to them.</p> <p>  On beef production, meat and dairy very efficiently convert food such as grass that humans cannot consume to protein which they can.  If we were to change that production type to more plant-based production, it might not be as successful because the land that we currently use for producing meat and dairy is not necessarily suitable for plant production.  There is also an issue in terms of the amount of carbon that is kept as a sink in the ground or soil and which would be released if the land was ploughed to plant alternative food sources.</p> <p>  My answer to Deputy Corcoran-Kennedy's question is yes and no.  There is a possibility to produce both but we need to be careful regarding the land we choose to use differently.  It would not necessarily result in a lower carbon footprint.  Some research indicates that as a result of the higher inputs of fertiliser and so on that are required to produce plant-based crops, there may be, at best, a 10% to 12% reduction in carbon footprint.  It is not a direct swap of one for the other as there are other challenges in changing farming practices and the resultant dietary CO2.</p> <p>  Many plant-based proteins, such as beans and legumes, are imported and have many associated food miles.  It is not always possible to recommend a plant-based diet to certain vulnerable groups in the community.  For example, older adults naturally consume less food but need a higher protein intake.  The best source of protein for older consumers to maintain muscle mass and prevent falls and frailty is animal protein.  They would need to eat four to five times the amount of lentils or beans to get the same amount of protein and it would not be possible for them to eat that much food.  There is a role for both plant and animal protein in diet and it is about getting the balance right in terms of achieving concordant measures of health and sustainability.  One must not focus solely on the carbon footprint of the diet without taking account of the nutrition and health outcomes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1685" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sin&eacute;ad Furey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019050900002#F00100"><p>To respond to Deputy Corcoran Kennedy's question, unfortunately I am not aware of the likely effects of Brexit on farming incomes in Northern Ireland.  Ulster University is not actively involved in farming research but we are most certainly involved in more general research on food poverty and food insecurity.  If it satisfies members, I will speak more generally on that point.  It is anticipated that Brexit will create an additional cost of &pound;25 per week on the average household's food bill.  For citizens who are already squeezed, impoverished or vulnerable, this will create an additional burden and we are worried about that.  Ulster University is very active in the food poverty research agenda.  We are developing an at-risk of food poverty index that will consider low income and rurality in identifying where such consumers are located to enable more targeted interventions.</p> <p>  More specifically, there area also concerns regarding rural dwellers and agricultural smallholders.  Given that the average age of smallholders in Northern Ireland and Great Britain is approximately 60 years, we are concerned about generational renewal and the need for young farmers.  It was for this reason that we addressed the point of diversification and the need to add value.  We will be actively involved in the food innovation effort to try to complement agriculture, food availability and health.  We need to be concerned about the departure of farmers from farming because it has become unprofitable.</p> <p>  There is an opportunity to educate and engage with consumers on the more general point of the importance of eating locally and seasonally so that we can celebrate our local and indigenous foods.  We must showcase indigenous produce so that we are not reliant on alternative protein sources from other countries.</p> <p>  We are working with policymakers in Northern Ireland in a collaborative effort on agrifood and food policy generally.  Brexit has caused concerns about food affordability and availability and the possibility that access to a fresh and varied diet may become more problematic for Northern Ireland consumers.</p></speech>

The raw materials may move from the North to the South to be processed, return to the North to be packaged and, finally, be sold in the South.  It is great that the common travel area is secure but much more could be done in terms of regulatory alignment between the market in the North and the South to minimise disruption to goods moving across the Border.  If the Assembly in the North gets up and running, the North-South Ministerial Council would be a good forum to promote more alignment on agrifood and minimise disruption.</p></speech>

As members will probably expect me to say, I believe a joint collaborative effort by university and other research and educational institutions could be useful in providing such an incentivisation.  This would not necessarily have to be economic.  One way forward could be to subsidise educational attainment efforts or repurpose farmers, as it were, to enable them to move into more diverse food processing areas.</p></speech>

When one considers the food supply chain from a carbon footprint perspective, between 80% and 85% of the carbon footprint is generated before the food leaves the farmyard.  It is very important that we put measures in place from a sustainability perspective to reduce the carbon footprint of food as it is being produced and support smaller farmers to produce food more sustainably.  Farming should not be only large-scale and intensive.  CAP could address this by implementing more sustainable practices at farm level.  A great deal of research has been done in Europe.  I am involved in a circular agricultural economics research project in the European Union, which has 20 partners across Europe.  We are looking at more sustainable farming practices and how acceptable they would be to consumers at the end of the food chain.  We need to develop a more circular economy and maintain better sustainability at farm level.  This would help to maintain smaller farms and keep European farmers in the farming industry.</p></speech>

When I was asked to speak about the European common security and defence policy on the occasion of Europe Day the first topic to come to mind was the role of Irish neutrality.  The debate is probably as old as the country itself but has surely not lost its intensity since then.  I finally decided to address the issue because recent developments in the area of European common and security policy make neutrality very topical again.  I draw attention to a couple of developments that place neutrality back on the agenda and demand urgent discussion of its meaning and implications.</p> <p>  The first of these is Brexit.</p><p>The loss of the major Atlanticist power within the European Union has serious consequences for the further development of the European Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP.  Having always tried to prevent or at least slow down integration in this policy field, the United Kingdom has been a kind of natural ally to Ireland in trying to keep security issues out of European integration.  The consequences of this development are already visible.  Not long after the Brexit vote, the President of the EU Commission, the French President and later the German Chancellor were calling for the creation of an EU army.  Although for the time being this is not much more than a blurry vision, it became obvious where integration in the European Common Security and Defence Policy field is heading.<br/><br/>Already in 2018 permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, was launched, marking a huge step in integrating security and defence co-operation towards a military alliance.  Causing a lively discussion in Ireland, its participation was finally backed by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, denying a conflict between Irish neutrality and participation in PESCO.  Of all the other neutral member states of the EU only Malta opted out, choosing to first observe if PESCO and neutrality are compatible.  Especially in Finland and Sweden, former neutral states, a consensus has been reached to the effect that EU membership in general is not logically compatible with the traditional notion of neutrality.  In practice these EU member states have thus given up their neutrality to a large extent.  In Ireland, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a Bill to enshrine Irish neutrality in the Constitution.  After a lively debate, in which European politicians were even called warmongers, the Bill was eventually rejected in the D&aacute;il.<br/><br/>Finally, I draw members' attention to a poll by Red C for the European Movement Ireland, published just last week.  Apart from an overwhelming support for EU membership in general, the poll revealed that a majority of 58% of the Irish people think that Ireland should be part of intensified EU security and defence co-operation and that PESCO does not pose a threat to Irish neutrality.  Approval is even stronger amongst young Irish people.<br/><br/>For me as a German citizen, the whole discussion about neutrality is new.  Despite the <i>tabula rasa </i>after the Second World War, Germany did not have the chance to have its own discussion about this, having to align itself to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, in the face of an expansionist Soviet Union.  While living in Ireland for one year and studying at University College Dublin it is very interesting to follow the public debate about neutrality and discuss it with my Irish and non-Irish fellow students.  This brings insights into this very politicised topic and the fact that Irish neutrality is loaded with different meanings and historical resonances.  Various narratives are contesting the nature of Irish foreign and security policy and its expression in Europe's contemporary security architecture.  While there seems to be a broad consensus that Ireland can and should make a contribution to global peace and security, this is not the case for the question as to which institutional framework should be used to achieve this.<br/><br/>Due to the aforementioned recent developments, however, Ireland seems to be forced to take a decision.  The departure of the major damper of integration in the area of foreign and security policy and the concomitant developments, such as PESCO and discussions of an EU army, make it an urgent topic.  For Ireland's European partners, and therefore also for me in this case, it is essential to know where Ireland is coming from in order to fully understand the significance and the implications of neutrality for Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1704" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cornelia-Adriana Baciu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019050900002#G00200"><p>My name is Ms Cornelia-Adriana Baciu.  I am studying at the School of Law and Government at Dublin City University.  Today I will address four key challenges facing the Common Security and Defence Policy.  The first is related to strategic coherence and internal cohesion.  In the counterfactual scenario in which the EU is not able to manage internal cracks such as the rise of nationalism, so-called <i>souvereignism</i>or major differences in member states' strategic cultures, future risks and challenges to CSDP might be endogenous.  A failure to co-ordinate efforts on the CSDP might draw Europe back to the US.  Some researchers argue it might return the European security landscape to the 1950s.  The EU will thus need to find innovative ways to solve the crises of sovereignty of borders and of defence.  What Europe wants is not easy to operationalise because of increasing polarisation or even fragmentation of European integration.<br/><br/>The CSDP is a domain in which some argue differentiated integration might work better.  This is because states' national strategies are driven by different threat perceptions, strategic environments, capabilities and strategic interests.  My research suggests that differentiated integration in the form of a role-player model in the CSDP could enhance strategic knowledge production and capability development.  Security and defence collaborative regimes such as the CSDP can have an empowering effect on member states.  However, an unintended consequence of the role-player model could be a &quot;Europe <i>&agrave; la carte</i>&quot; in which members would only support the policies in which they see a benefit for their own national interests.<br/><br/>I will now refer to Brexit.  The anticipated withdrawal of the UK from the European Union is forecasted to strain the CSDP budget.  In 2018 the UK accounted for approximately 16% of the CSDP budget.  To compensate for this an increase in member states' investments in security and defence can be expected.  A series of peace and defence co-operation mechanisms were adopted after Brexit.  The major examples are PESCO, the European Defence Fund, EDF, the co-ordinated annual review on defence, CARD, the European peace facility and the European intervention initiative.  For the new instruments to be effective it is important for the EU to manage member states' expectations and ensure they will enable the achievement of strategic objectives.<br/><br/>I will now address the external strategic environment and external sources of instability.  A particular tendency in US leadership and what some have termed a US strategy underpinned by a logic of &quot;retreat&quot; and &quot;systemic competition&quot; with China have pushed the EU to think more seriously about the scenario of US abandonment.  Some researchers argue that strategic autonomy would allow the EU to gain an element of independence from US decision-making and pursue an agenda of international peace and security based on its own normative vision with mediation, diplomacy, trade co-operation, peace missions and global justice at its core.  Some argue that the road to strategic autonomy might lie in a merger between the CSDP and NATO, that is, the Europeanisation of NATO.  Multipolarity and great power competition represent another challenge with implications for the CSDP.  In the future, the EU is expected to aim at having good relationships with all countries and avoid a return to bipolarity.  This is because a bipolar logic might push countries to choose and some of them might choose China for economic reasons.<br/><br/>My last point is related to new security technologies.  Future and emerging technologies such as autonomous robotics and artificial intelligence can have a disruptive and transformative impact in the security and defence domain.  If the EU invests sufficiently in research and development, it might be in a position to harness the benefits of new security technologies.  New funding of transnational and interdisciplinary research, under the European Defence Fund <i>inter alia </i>, will have the potential to address capability shortcomings and technological and industrial weaknesses to a certain extent.  The EU could establish a new area of competence in dual-use technology, that is, technologies which can be attributed to both civilian and military purposes.</p></speech>

On this day it is particularly important to recall why the EU was initially established: to end frequent and bloody wars between neighbours and to unite European countries both economically and politically to secure lasting peace across the Continent.  We can largely say that this has been successful.  At the moment, however, huge challenges are ahead for the EU in the area of common security and defence.  As is true for most of the challenges the EU faces, Brexit crops up in this area.  The greatest challenge is the development of a common policy on security and defence that includes a cohesive development of policies with third countries in future missions, especially the UK once it leaves.  This policy must simultaneously protect the integrity of the European Union and the sovereignty of member states.  It is very important that there is a balance between these three concerns.  The greatest challenge lies in finding this balance.</p> <p>  Different visions of the CSDP proposed by the initial "big three" member states, Germany, the UK and France, have long created space for smaller member states like Ireland to avoid hard choices concerning issues of security and defence.  A more cohesive EU in the post-Brexit future presents significant challenges for all states that have long thrived in the murky waters of strategic ambiguity.</p><p>Indeed, it could be argued that the United Kingdom leaving removes a significant stumbling block for European defence co-operation.  British scepticism has previously allowed others such as Denmark and central European states to avoid hard questions on tensions between formal military non-alignment and the realities of being part of a deeply integrated organisation because NATO has long provided what they have seen to be the primary security provider in the European theatre. </p><p> The UK&rsquo;s absence from future Common Security and Defence Policy debates after Brexit will likely push these states into the limelight in terms of blocking or opting out from security co-operation.  Our greatest challenge is how we deal with this.  While the EU must grapple with the loss of its transatlantic alliance partner, it is imperative that it now attempts to balance a bilateral agreement on Common Security and Defence Policy with the UK that also complements a type of unified EU approach to issues of security and defence, encompassing the considerations of small states, such as Ireland, and big states such as France and Germany.</p><p> That is not to say that the EU has not taken any steps thus far.  If we look at the decision taken by the High Representative, Ms Mogherini, to forge ahead with the publication of the EU&rsquo;s new global strategy in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum in June 2016, it is apparent that some attempts have been made by the EU to push ahead with CSDP.  Although faced with something of an existential crisis, the EU found a response in building a security architecture to reinvigorate EU institutions and to reunite the remaining 27 member states.  This provided a common ground for co-operation without reopening a Pandora&rsquo;s box of institutional reform that would be required to deal with more traditional areas of European co-operation such as market regulation.  </p><p> The Common Security and Defence Policy may not have always been high on Ireland&rsquo;s agenda but the aftermath of the Brexit vote has been particularly challenging for us all.  We now must strongly reconsider our own security and defence policy, in addition to that of our position in the wider EU CSDP.  Brexit has uncovered a number of political and constitutional fault lines, none more serious than its potential impacts on the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government deserves credit for the way in which it has managed the Brexit negotiations to date, particularly in securing support from our European partners concerning Ireland&rsquo;s position on the Border.  However, what price will we pay for this in future negotiations on matters such as common security and defence?  </p><p> The reduced room for manoeuvre on common security and defence for small states, such as ourselves, in an EU that will be more dominated by France and Germany than before, must be taken into account.  In a Franco-German EU, the space for constructive ambiguity is likely to be greatly reduced.  Ireland&rsquo;s hesitancy and ambivalence on this matter may no longer be sustainable.  Irish attitudes to European security and defence might best be characterised by paraphrasing Winston Churchill, in that Ireland is with common security and defence policy, but not of it.  We are linked, but not compromised.  We are interested and associated, but not absorbed.  It is perhaps time that we do become absorbed in greater co-operation with the EU on issues of common security and defence that extend beyond PESCO, as others here have noted, as we lose the shelter of the UK in future debates.  </p><p> The threats of a no-deal Brexit and the medium to longer-term security threats posed by any kind of withdrawal have yet to be provided for.  Both the Irish State and the EU as a whole faces profound challenges in this regard and are there, as of yet, no signs that neither it nor the EU is prepared to address them. </p></speech>

I compliment all the witnesses whom I have heard so far this morning on the quality and depth of their submissions and the knowledge and research that went into them.  They are all to be complimented on the even-handed and balanced way in which  they went about their business.</p><p>I raise a question about the Common Security and Defence Policy.  It is an issue which has been with us for a very long time.  Over time, different emphases occur.  It is important to note that we are a neutral country.  There is nothing incompatible between our neutrality and our membership of the European Union or certain associations in the peacekeeping and defence areas.  In the past, we have excelled in peacekeeping and have shown ourselves to be international leaders in that area.  We have a useful influence and role to play in the European context.  I note modern terrorism has no boundaries and can reach far into neutral countries, peacekeeping countries and so on.  Do the witnesses see a space in which Ireland might be expected to defend itself in such a situation?</p><p>I refer to the question of whether something in this area will be attached to the discussion on Brexit and if a <i>quid pro quo </i>will be sought.  I do not think that will be the case.  We are very strong members of the European Union with a strong commitment to its ideals, which have existed from the beginning and get stronger over time.  It is not likely that we would be expected to concede one for another in this context.  I think that because the European Union must prevail.  If it does not and it fragments, going in different directions, and if demands are made within itself, of itself, by itself or by single member states, then there is a grave danger that the European Union will cease to be.  If that happens there will be great political, military and economic implications for the entire Continent of Europe and outside.  I do not need to tell our witnesses this; they are experts on this area, but the question arises as to whether we want to go back to where we were.  Some member states refer to the good old days, which presumably was the first half of the 20th century.  My question to young people is whether they want to go back to those much-referred-to good old days when almost 70 million people died in the conflict which followed when Europe turned upon itself.  All these things relate to military matters and peace.  We should remember that the EU was the single most important peace agreement that the world has ever known.  For all those years we have been peaceful.  There can come times of turbulence occasionally and in times of economic difficulty, someone is always sought to blame.  I encourage our guests to focus on the alternatives, because they are not good, and they can proceed to work in an equitable manner, to be fair to all people including refugees from outside.  As we know, some of the people of Europe were themselves refugees in the not too-distant past.</p></speech>

This is very timely.  There are debates at the moment relating to plans for an EU army.  It is clear from this morning's contributions that despite the denials from some on the political right that an advanced conversation on this is taking place.  The contributions here have been challenging.  While I acknowledge the poll undertaken by the European Movement, which would be very much in favour of changing our policy, we should recall that a Red C poll last year also showed tremendous support in Ireland for Irish neutrality.  I ask if Irish people would really support what PESCO is doing off the coast of Libya, for example, if they knew.</p><p>If they followed the reports of Sally Hayden, the Irish journalist, they would have noted she has highlighted EU support, including Irish financial support, for funding death camps in Libya.  That funding was confirmed to me by the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, just a few weeks ago in the Seanad.  These are camps in which people are tortured, raped, mutilated and killed.  This is the reality of PESCO as it operates right now.  One does not have to take my word for it.  Sally Hayden has documented and continues to document it in an effort to bring attention to the realities, unfortunately, of what PESCO is doing.  Do we think the Irish people would support funding of &euro;13 billion in research subsidies for the defence industries of Europe as set out in the next financial plan for Europe?  That is a reality of PESCO.  The final question I ask is as follows.  Surely, the best people to decide our future neutrality are the people of Ireland.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in was right to pursue the Bill.  As democrats, the best way forward in this debate is to support that call for a referendum.  Let us have a full debate on the future of Irish neutrality.  I thank the witnesses for their thoughtful contributions today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1711" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019050900002#J00200"><p>I apologise for having had to leave for a meeting of the Business Committee.  I am delighted to welcome the witnesses and thank them for their contributions.  We are at an important crossroads in Europe.  Certainly, I have concerns about some activities taking place under the flag of and with the financial support of the European Union.  We need to be more awake, engaged and vocal and to scrutinise more deeply legislation that comes before us on PESCO and other situations.  Europe as a project must be preserved.  We must work at that and learn from it.  A recent report I intend to raise on Leaders' Questions today is on the future of farming in Europe.  It states that 1,000 farmers and farm families are leaving farming every week right across the EU.  That is leading to the degeneration, neglect and slippage of rural Ireland at a time when we are talking about rolling broadband out to rural areas.  If we do not maintain sustainable farm families in rural Ireland, North and South, and across Europe, it will lead to more factory farms and large conglomerates buying up land, which is not good.  In my own county of Tipperary, we have an equine company purchasing every square perch of land that becomes available.  It has amassed almost 28,000 acres.  While it provides employment and has great prowess in the equine industry, it is disgraceful that we do not have a land commission or other land agency to monitor and curtail what is happening.  The family farm is the lifeblood of Ireland.  In the two previous recessions to the one we have just come out of, it was agriculture that led us back to growth with, I might add, the support of the EU.  People were always there on family farms and working the land in parishes and communities nationally.  Every euro that goes into agriculture is spent locally.  Farm families support schools, sports clubs, the tourism industry and everything else.  It is therefore timely to have this discussion.  I thank our visitors for attending today.  It is my first time speaking in this new Chamber.  I am delighted.  It is an honour to be here.</p></speech>

The situation around security events is not a stark one.  It is more the case that there are real choices and priorities to address.  It is true that Europe came out of a project of peace.  The wonderful thing about Europe was that after literally thousands of years of conflict, countries which had experienced in some cases hundreds of years of war against each other decided to come together to determine how to live together more peacefully and constructively.  That is absolutely true.  However, while there is an incredible legacy of peace in the European project, being European and being part of the European project means thinking about that constant question of how we live together.  It is about being critically present and asking critical questions, as the witnesses have.  That is part of being pro-European.  It is about caring enough about Europe to care about the decisions it makes.</p> <p>  There are very important decisions being made and there are priorities and concerns.  It was a decision for Ireland to opt into PESCO.  Ireland was not required to opt in, rather it chose to do so.  PESCO moved us further away by involving us, for example, in joint purchases of military equipment.  Ireland has an incredibly strong tradition of peace and neutrality and of leading disarmament.  One of the most moving things I have ever been involved with was the global ban on cluster bombs, which are basically like landmines.  The global ban was negotiated here in Ireland because Ireland was free from some of the military-industrial pressures experienced by other countries and was able to lead the way.  It is not a choice between Ireland and our neutrality and Europe.  It is about Ireland being a voice for peace, neutrality and disarmament within Europe.  That is a key point.  It is a service we provide.  It was Eamon Gilmore, a former Irish parliamentarian, who represented the European Commission in Colombia to negotiate the peace deal.  That is because Ireland's neutrality allowed us to have that strong voice.</p> <p>  We cannot turn a blind eye to militarisation.  It is a disservice to Ireland and Europe if we do.  It was very concerning that, just two weeks ago, the European Parliament voted against having oversight of the &euro;13 billion European Defence Fund.  That is the European Parliament choosing not to scrutinise what that fund is spent on.  Will it be on autonomous weapons?  How does it relate to UN mandates?  We must question constantly.  When we have global challenges for Europe and the world like climate change, which we will discuss later, we must ask whether we should be spending &euro;13 billion on European defence.  I do not think so.  Peace and security are put together.  Peace is work.  We know that from the Good Friday Agreement.  The work of peace is about investment in community building, understanding and social exchange.  If we spent some of that &euro;13 billion to build understanding between communities, not just here in Ireland but across the Balkan states which have come out of an experience of war as recently as the 1990s, that would deliver far more than to ramp up military spending on our borders and invest huge amounts in Frontex.  As was mentioned, it is a real concern to see these immigration control deals whereby we are funding border police and military actions in places like Sudan and Libya.  Those are things we need to look to.  These are very important choices.</p> <p>  It is important to note that the current Commission is an outgoing one.  We will have a new European Commission soon and it needs to hear from the witnesses about their priorities.  Among the priorities the outgoing Juncker Commission has brought to today's European Council meeting on the future of Europe, what it calls "protective Europe" is number one.  That means a European defence union.  We must be very clear that there are high-level people in Europe who want a European army.  However, that is not the same thing as saying Europe wants a European army.  There are also brilliant parliamentarians and passionate Europeans from every member state of the EU 27 who want to work together on peace.  That is the narrative we can push and strengthen.  I would love to hear in response what the witnesses think the work of peace should be.  It is not just about saying we do not want militarisation.  What is the work of peace?  That is the work from Good Friday and the work we have seen across the world.  How does Ireland lead the work of peace within Europe to make Europe a champion on human rights and peace?  It is a real choice.  We cannot do that while also spending &euro;13 billion on a European Defence Fund which we do not scrutinise.  We must all challenge these issues because we want Europe to live up to its brilliant and historic past and to shape a better future.  The following point is very important.  In the initial PESCO agreement, the words "peace" and "peacekeeping" were not even used once.  We need something that is not the PESCO agreement but which is rather a European mandate on peace work.  That should be the centrepiece of Europe's next five-year strategy.  I would love to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that work of peace.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1714" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cornelia-Adriana Baciu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019050900002#K00200"><p>I will try to address the many interesting questions posed.  On defending ourselves, territorial defence is mandated to NATO.  One of the issues on the agenda for discussion is to what extent EU member states should start thinking more seriously about gaining an element of strategic autonomy and independence from US decision-making.  Territorial defence, leadership and nuclear weapons are some of the points linked with this debate, but many states have been silent on this particular aspect.  There is also the scenario of the US abandonment, which I addressed in my opening statement.  The United States has withdrawn from several multilateral or bilateral agreements.  The US foreign policy narrative might in the future be linked with developments in the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea.  In the case of US inability to provide security guarantees in Europe, the EU should have a plan B and give serious consideration to the territorial defence aspect.</p> <p>  From a rational choice perspective, into the future, the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, for member states will be, probably, a trade-off between utility and strategic choice.  It is important to emphasise that security is a prerequisite and will remain a prerequisite for the other benefits of EU membership, including economic and political benefits.  It is a precondition of other benefits as well.  The major challenges to CSDP in the future will probably be linked to member states' commitment and the robustness of CSDP institutions.  I mentioned the new strategic instruments that are likely to generate new assets and perhaps increase the value of defence co-operation in Europe.</p> <p>  In regard to Irish neutrality, last year I wrote an article on security, multilateralism and Irish neutrality based on debates in the Irish Parliament from 1998 to 2018, which is available online.  One of my key findings was that the concept of Irish neutrality is multifaceted.  I found different concepts associated with it, including positive neutrality, negative neutrality, total neutrality and so on.  Every time there is a debate in Brussels related to security implications, there are intensive debates in the Irish Parliament on the implications for Irish neutrality.  There is informed decision-making on a case-by-case basis.  Surprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, Irish neutrality was found to be strongly linked with UN peacekeeping and stabilisation missions.  From this we could infer that there is a compatibility between the Irish foreign policy and EU foreign policy narrative.  The EU global strategy has been focused on peace and stabilisation missions in fragile states.  Recent statistics show an increase in the support of Irish people for the CSDP.  One explanation for this might be that the Common Security and Defence Policy works at intergovernmental level and it is likely to remain so into the future.  Security might be an area in which intergovernmental co-operation is more effective.  Sovereignty is not transferred at supranational level.  Any change in this regard will require a change in the EU treaty.</p> <p>  On the value added of PESCO, for Ireland the value added is that the capabilities developed under PESCO remain in the possession of member states.  For Ireland this means that capabilities developed under PESCO can be utilised in UN peacekeeping missions and other missions.  As far as I am aware, Ireland has been active in providing personnel and staff to EU and international civilian and military missions since it joined the European Union in 1973.  As of December 2018, there were approximately 650 Irish personnel deployed to such missions.</p> <p>  On Brexit, much of my research recently has been focused on the implications of Brexit.  I recently co-authored a book with my supervisor, Professor John Doyle from DCU, on this subject.  Brexit will transform relationships between the UK and the EU from multilateral to bilateral.  This will have implications for the European Union evolutionary stable equilibrium.  The EU will need to find a way to address this equilibrium to remain stable over time and to be able to cope with so-called atypical sequences or shocks, of which Brexit could be one.  The literature argues that continual change is the prerequisite to remain relevant and competitive.  The implication or consequence of this would be geopolitical adaptation of the EU.  This will have further implications for future transatlantic relations, the EU global strategy and international security as a collective good.</p> <p>  It was mentioned earlier that peace is work.  Modern peace is based on anticipation, resilience and integration of aspects of daily life.  One could imagine modern peace at the intersection of three epistemological debates, international - liberal values; national - nationalist sometimes as a destructive force; and, everyday life level - daily interactions and power relations between people.  We have to see all three sides as knowledge production sides.  Knowledge is very important for concepts such as peace, order, justice, security and so on.  This is, perhaps, a matter we should further address in our research.</p></speech>

Cultural values were disregarded.  Questions were posed in regard to neutrality, PESCO and peace.</p><p>If we look at the culture of all European states, it comprises the cultures of 28 different states, soon to be 27.  These have very different cultural values.  After 70 years of this project, it is time to introduce new ways of looking at things.  It is not always driven by politics and economics, although we are in a political chamber.  It is very important that we look towards cultures.  I am sure most Irish people would not be impressed to hear that we are supporting PESCO.  Claims were made that money we pay into the European budget for defence goes to camps in Libya and so on.  That is not what we anticipated our tax money would be used for.  There are also cultures within Europe that really promote a strong, hard-line defence policy, which we do not.  We are more focused on peacekeeping and neutrality.  There needs to be a balance in how we look at cultures and cultural values.  Only in that way can we address all of the issues that have been brought up.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be here this morning to chair what is a very important session.  I thank all the witnesses for coming before us for what has been a very informative engagement.  I am Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.  This committee was set up to consider the Citizens' Assembly report.  We published a cross-party report on 16 April, which I believe is the beginning of a new era for policy direction with regard to how the State deals with climate change.  As the witnesses will know, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is working on an all-of-Government action plan with regard to rolling out these policy changes, which will be critical for this and future generations.  I will not delay because I know the clock is ticking and my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, is waiting to step in to chair the next session.</p> <p>  Our first speaker is Mr. P&aacute;draig Flattery from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.  We also have Mr. Axel Leahy from the National University of Ireland, Galway, Ms Louise Fitzgerald from University College Dublin, Mr. Connor McGookin from University College Cork, and Ms Caroline Moran from Dublin City University.</p></speech>

I am a PhD student in the ICARUS climate research unit at the Maynooth University department of geography.  My work is a drop in the ocean of climate change research being undertaken around the world every day, all of which bolsters the consensus that climate change is happening, that it is urgent, and that human activities are responsible.<br/><br/>I have been asked to speak today on the topic of climate action and sustainable development.  When I first read the title of this topic, I immediately thought of speeches made by the young Swedish climate activist, Greta Thunberg, who has helped mobilise a generation against the actions of their governments by holding weekly school strikes.  At her recent speeches to the World Economic Forum and the United Nations she told the delegates, &quot;I want you to panic&quot;.  In the brief time I have I will try to explain the scientific basis behind why she wants people to panic, and how climate action and sustainable development must be embraced to create a sustainable future for the next generations.<br/><br/>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, states that we must keep global warming to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change.  Warming of more than 1.5&deg;C increases the likelihood of climate tipping points being triggered.  These tipping points are thresholds that, if exceeded, can fundamentally alter the state of the climate system.  To provide members with an example, one possible consequence of warming above 1.5&deg;C is the thawing of permafrost in the Arctic, a process which is already under way and which releases vast amounts of methane, which is more than 25 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2</sub>, which will result in significant irreversible warming and is likely to trigger the collapse of other systems, including the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.  This ice sheet is already melting more and more each year.  If temperatures increase and the ice sheet reaches a point where it will melt entirely, we will be committed as a planet to a sea level rise of 6 m.  If we allow this to happen, there will be unimaginable global consequences which pose a genuine existential threat to humanity.<br/><br/>When people hear climate scientists speaking about these changes in the Arctic and Greenland, they wonder how it relates to us here in Ireland, but these sea level changes will be felt on a local as well as a global scale and our coastal cities will be threatened.  If we do not take action to prevent this happening, it will not matter which country did not meet its targets or which national interest was prioritised.  We have already warmed by around 1&deg;C, and will reach 1.5&deg;C warming somewhere between 2030 and 2052, meaning we have a decade to make radical changes to our economy and way of life.<br/><br/>The reality is clear.  As members of the EU we are committed to reducing our emissions by 40% compared with 1990 levels by the year 2030, just 11 years from now.  The EU has set the goal of an 80% to 95% reduction in emissions by 2050.  Current Irish policies are not aligned with our goals.  While the EU as a whole will achieve its 2020 emissions target, Ireland will significantly overshoot ours.  This sets us up to fail at achieving our future targets, and the longer we wait, the more difficult it becomes.  We need to encourage sustainable development and ensure all members of society can reduce their carbon footprints by decarbonising public transportation, energy generation and agriculture to give everyone the opportunity to make the right choices regarding their emissions.  While grants for new electric cars are encouraging, how many people can realistically avail of them? The importance of a holistic approach to adaptation is emphasised by a 2018 statement from the IPCC:</p> <blockquote> 	If poorly designed or implemented, adaptation projects in a range of sectors can increase greenhouse gas emissions and water use, increase gender and social inequality, undermine health conditions, and encroach on natural ecosystems [...] These trade-offs can be reduced by adaptations that include attention to poverty and sustainable development  </blockquote> <p>The joint committee&rsquo;s report on climate change and cross-party action echoes this sentiment in its call for a just transition to a green economy. <br/><br/>We need to safeguard the lives of all our future citizens.  We are the first generation to feel the effects of climate change and the last generation who will be able to do anything about it.  Individuals can and do take action, but the onus is on politicians to find solutions, create dialogue, and work towards our common goal of creating a better world for us all.  Sustainable development is not only possible, it is essential if Ireland is to maintain our green reputation on the world stage.  As shown by the committee&rsquo;s recent report, the transition to a green economy is an opportunity for economic growth and job creation in rural and urban Ireland, and ought to be embraced for the benefits it will bring.  The recommendations of the report are far-reaching and inspiring and must be implemented urgently.  They range from citizen-scale efforts to retrofit homes to renewable energy generation to a national push for offshore wind generation and decarbonisation of our economy.<br/><br/>As a direct result of protests by the Extinction Rebellion group, the UK declared a national climate change emergency just last week.  This was closely followed by Wicklow County Council which announced a climate and biodiversity emergency last week.  This shows us that there is hope, but time is running out.</p></speech>

I know members will fully understand my French accent, so it will not disturb them too much.  Climate change is urging us to take actions and to change our way of life radically.  Such actions and policies will require unprecedented levels of collaborative decision-making between all actors in society, including the public.  Yet, voices of local communities are still, in 2019, facing brick walls.  As European citizens, we need to be given the opportunity to participate actively and to have a real input on decisions that have effects on our daily life.</p> <p>  We know the positive effects that public participation can have.  We know, for instance, that local communities can substantially enhance the quality of decisions with locally grounded and value-based knowledge.  We should not see decisions tailored to reduce our vulnerability to climate change as purely technical.  This is not to say that experts should not contribute - their role is crucial - but common technical approaches to decision-making, such as cost-benefit analyses, cannot be the sole remedy to our problems.  Often, the real value of assets and landscapes can hardly be monetised and summarised into graphics, as they will have a deeper value and a deeper meaning to local communities.  Moreover, we should not forget that local communities are situated at the forefront of climate change, being the first to experience damage from storms, flooding, erosion or biodiversity losses.  Why should they then be kept silent?  Public participation is, after all, a democratic right.</p> <p>  The problem is that today's conventional forms of public participation do not work.  First, uploading a document on a website and then asking people to submit comments or suggestions does not guarantee that these submissions will have any effect on the decision.</p><p>Second, and most important, these forms of engagement do not resonate with most people.  Do Members of the Oireachtas believe that people of my age regularly check the websites of their local authorities?  This is the core of the problem.  There is a gap between our decision makers and the public.  This criticism demands that new mediums of participation need to be established in Ireland.  The Citizens' Assembly is a fantastic example that we can build on, but it cannot be limited to that.  Most decisions that affect our everyday lives take place in our communities at a local level.  Should every local authority have its owns citizens' assembly?  Why not?  There are countless examples of successful forms of active participation.  Citizen panels, citizen juries, citizen advisory committees, participatory budgeting, participatory planning, participatory mapping, e-participation and citizen science are forms of active public participation that have proven to be successful around the world.  Why should we limit those examples as isolated case studies rather than trying to make them the common practice?<br/><br/>The ball is in the court of those who represent us.  As we saw recently with the school strikes for climate, many people, especially those from the younger generation, are willing to engage in climate actions.  Strong and ambitious policies need to be implemented at national level to create nationwide structures for public participation and incite local decision makers to abandon the <i>status quo</i>and find innovative ways of engaging directly with their constituents.  Climate change represents one of the greatest challenges of our century.  We desperately need to reduce our carbon emissions and adapt to present and forthcoming impacts of climate change.  Decisions aiming at driving these societal changes cannot take place behind closed doors.  We need to seize climate change as an opportunity to change profoundly the way our democracy works in Ireland and in Europe.</p></speech>

This is why I have dedicated the last four years of my life to researching how we can develop effective and successful policies to deal with our climate and sustainable development challenges.  My presentation is based on cutting-edge research within political science as well as dozens of research interviews I have conducted in Germany in an attempt to understand the factors that have helped to underpin the success of Germany's historic energy transition.  I am looking at the factors that help to create policy that is politically and socially acceptable.  This is really the Holy Grail.  I hope to demonstrate how we can make stringent policy without facing electoral penalties.</p> <p>  I will mention a few insights and factors that have the potential to help us in our work.  The first of them underpins what has been said about the importance of citizen-centred energy and green industrial supports.  The key causal mechanism here is something called coalition building, which is essentially about the development of policy that seeks specifically to build coalitions of support for a green policy that allows policy measures to be ratcheted up over time.  The provision of direct industrial incentives to support the growth of particular green industries, such as renewables, is an effective way to build these new coalitions.  This has been borne out in the case of Germany, where it was a main driver of the energy transition.  The expansion of green industrial supports gave citizens access to the energy grid.  A payment for the energy fed into the grid supported the development of citizen-centred and community-centred renewable energies.  This solidified the societal acceptance of energy transitions, which is a key factor in determining our success as we go forward.</p> <p>  A second insight is that carbon-pricing approaches can face significant barriers to effective implementation.  An understanding of the dynamics of the political landscape is necessary in this context.  Carbon pricing incentivises regulatory losers, those who are going to lose out as a result of certain policies, to organise politically to prevent such policies from being implemented, thereby rendering measures difficult to implement and making them no more than marginally effective in the short and medium term.  It can be costly and time-consuming to tweak proposed instruments in order that they can be implemented in any form.  The EU emissions trading system and its related offset schemes have faced significant challenges.  Research indicates that switching to green industrial supports and focusing on such supports as well as on citizen-centred energy faces fewer political barriers and is more conducive to effective and sustainable policymaking.</p> <p>  Clear action on decarbonisation can have a powerful signalling effect and can create a facilitative framework.  Conversely, any moves to build new fossil fuel infrastructure can have lock-in impacts that undermine and derail sustainability transitions.  It is important to note that natural gas infrastructure projects that are planned within the EU's list of projects of common interest, including the planned Shannon liquified natural gas terminal, categorically impede our ability to decarbonise in a timely manner.  Alternatively, research has started to show that supply side policies, such as bans and moratoriums, have significant economic and political advantages compared with demand side policies.  The political advantages of such an approach include superior potential to mobilise public support, including within fossil fuel industries, as well as low administrative and transactional costs.</p> <p>  The EU can provide a framework for developing effective and just pathways to sustainable development and successful climate action.  Countries as small as Ireland can have a substantial impact within this framework.  Much of the work that is being done now involves the development of new norms of behaviour.  This has a powerful contagion effect.  We have an opportunity to implement a dynamic policy for effective climate action and sustainable development, but the window is closing fast.  Climate and ecological breakdown are hitting us faster than was ever predicted.  On our current path, a safe planet for human life will disappear before today's children reach the age of those we are addressing this morning.</p> <p>  No financial argument makes any sense when faced with these facts, regardless of whether it is hedged in terms of budget speak, bureaucratic processes, profits or vested interests.  The survival of all of us and all of those we care about is directly threatened by climate change.  This is not political.  It is a scientific fact that is based on science, physics and the laws of nature.  All Members of the Oireachtas will face important decisions in the coming weeks and months.  I want them to understand that everything they care about will be touched by climate and ecological breakdown.  They need to think about that and act from a place of love when they are making decisions.  Young people are asking politicians to give them a chance to live a dignified life and to have a safe world in which to live.  We are asking them to let us hope.  This is not about us versus them or young people versus politicians.  That is old thinking.  This is about the shared fate of all of us who are interconnected on this planet.  We are in this together for better or for worse, so let us make it better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1725" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Connor McGookin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019050900002#M00300"><p>I thank the committees for the opportunity to speak.  I have three brief points to make.  I will probably echo much of the frustration we heard in the previous statements.  First, climate change policy must be stepped up ambitiously.  Second, there is growing public appetite for climate action.  We have heard about Greta Thunberg.  Third, local actions must be adequately supported.  This should not just be about high-level ambition.  As Deputies and Senators are probably aware, European leaders are meeting in Romania today to discuss the future of Europe.  At this summit, eight countries and 210 cities are urging national leaders and the European Council to adopt a zero emissions target for 2050.  Last November, a report produced by the European Commission set out a number of pathways for achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  This commitment is essential if we are to avoid the apocalyptic narratives of climate change.  It is up to the EU 27 to lead the way.</p> <p>  I would like to mention one example of how Ireland is failing miserably to meet this responsibility.  Last October, a stark warning in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gave us just 11 years to make a meaningful difference.  Embarrassingly, this was followed by a failure to provide in the budget for an increase in carbon tax.  This reflects the lack of political leadership that has slowed the progress of climate policy across the world.  Thanks to a young Swedish girl, a growing movement throughout Europe is now demanding greater government ambition and moving climate policy onto the agenda.  The recent report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which achieved cross-party consensus, was a significant milestone.  The all-of-Government action plan that is being prepared is another important step in the right direction.  The achievement of political consensus is not the final hurdle, however.  We must build from here to secure social consensus.</p> <p>  While high-level ambition is essential, many of us have a lot to learn if we are to understand what this means at local level.  This is the focus of my own research.  I have explored new approaches to energy system modelling and planning that account for local values and perceptions.  As Mr. Leahy pointed out, there is a need to address some of the flaws in the planning and decision-making processes that can lead to opposition to infrastructural projects like large-scale wind developments and overhead pylons.  In 2015, the White Paper on energy mentioned that there was an "increasing recognition of the value that effective communication and a participative approach between developer, local community and local authority can bring to the development of energy infrastructure".</p><p>This has been echoed in recent policy with repeated references to phrases like "energy citizen" or "community engagement".  I imagine we can all agree this is a welcome narrative and is undoubtedly important for the energy transition.</p><p> However, within communities, several constraints are hindering meaningful progress.  I will list some of the key challenges and opportunities.  These have been compiled from my personal research and that of some of my colleagues.  First, volunteers are required, but depending on them will not be adequate.  As local champions these people are often part of several community groups and are already stretched.  The existing community networks represent a major opportunity but must be engaged in a respectful manner.  Second, I reiterate that core funding is needed.  Regular funding must be made available for the administration and co-ordination of community energy groups if they are to function effectively.  Third, until policy barriers in the form of tariffs, planning, finance and grid access are addressed, it will be unhelpful and perhaps counterproductive to continuously talk up community ownership of energy.  The final point is closest to my heart.  Community energy does not guarantee community acceptance but a more transparent and inclusive decision-making processes can help ease tensions and inspire positive action.</p><p> I will summarise my contribution.  I have noted the need for European leadership in stepping up ambition.  I touched on the noticeable growth in public appetite for meaningful climate action.  National leadership, extensive local engagement and clear benefits for communities are essential in driving the energy transition.</p></speech>

Last September, I began studying in DCU on the climate change masters programme.  I have always been interested in reading up on environmental news and over several years I have become increasingly concerned about climate change and environmental degradation.  Since beginning the course two things have happened.  I have realised how bad the situation is, but also that there is still hope.  It has hit home for me that there needs to be a fundamental change in our society if we are to tackle this problem in the short time there is left to effectively halt the worst of what could happen.<br/><br/>Ireland is rightly seen to be at the back of the pack.  However, the recent report from the Joint Committee on Climate Action is a welcome step in the right direction.  We can learn much from our European counterparts about what has worked and what has not.  We can build on these in an Irish context.<br/><br/>Effectively communicating the challenges and opportunities to citizens is the most important step.  There is a lot of fear and misunderstanding regarding climate change.  Public debate on what must happen to transition to a low-carbon economy is essential.  We need to have open conversations in the media and at the dinner table about how we must change the <i>status quo</i>and the best ways to do this for our local communities and large-scale industries.<br/><br/>I look forward to an all-of-Government action plan, as I believe it will help drive the public debate in a meaningful way to give the general public clear guidance on what is being proposed and how it will affect them personally and society as a whole.<br/><br/>The announcement by Bord na M&oacute;na last October of the loss of more than 400 jobs in the midlands shows the need for extensive planning and programmes to retrain workers or aid in job replacement schemes for those who will be most affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy.  Last October, the Spanish Government and coal miner unions reached a transition deal.  It offered early retirement or retraining for coal miners who are to lose their jobs as the industry is scaled back.  This is an example of good practice that can be repeated in an Irish context.  Some industries will be disproportionately affected, such as agriculture and peat production, while there will be more opportunities for green jobs elsewhere and these must be embraced.  Workers who believe their livelihoods are being threatened need to be engaged in what happens but at a community level there must be a discussion as well.  The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, campaigning on a green new deal platform, won the recent Spanish elections with up to 50% of the vote in some mining towns.  The party had worked with the coal miners unions previously.<br/><br/>Recently, there has been a surge in social activism around climate change, such as the school strikes for climate and the extinction rebellion.  I went to the two events held in Dublin.  As a former teacher, I know how hard it can be to motivate teenagers, but at the school strike, I was moved by the enthusiasm students showed that day.  At the extinction rebellion protest, I was inspired by the diversity of participants who showed up.  These movements show that the public are becoming increasingly aware of climate change, biodiversity loss and the general destruction of the natural world that is occurring at an unprecedented rate.  There has never been a better time to engage the public on the urgency of the crisis facing our planet.  Small-scale actions that individuals can take will not be enough without large-scale actions and policies by governments.  The EU, Ireland included, must lead the way and take bold unmitigated action now, with engaged citizens at the core of this transition.  The release earlier this week of the global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services is another stark reminder that our current system is failing and putting life on earth at risk.  The technology to make the shift is in place.  The financial risk will lessen the sooner we take action.  The public will to act has never been stronger.  It is time to change.</p></speech>

I will go to my colleagues with questions.  The witnesses might note the questions and then whoever wants to come in can answer them.  Is it okay if we proceed that way?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The witnesses have raised some important and key issues that the Joint Committee on Climate Action has been considering during the past seven months.  Ms Fitzgerald mentioned one of our key concerns, which is the price of carbon.  Although it was only a small part of our work, it was a key concern in respect of protecting the most vulnerable.  We considered the need to be politically palatable in bringing people with us and not making the mistakes we have made in other areas in engagement in with the community and bringing people on board.  That is why these conversations are important for us.  We have a body of work to complete and we can see that.  This is only the start.  Community engagement and how we communicate to the citizen are important.  We must protect the most vulnerable and those facing fuel poverty.  Key sectors will find the transition hardest, including the peat industry, the farming community and rural communities.  These are key areas that we have to work on as well.</p> <p>  I am keen to hear of any of the witnesses want to expand on what we can do in respect of the price of carbon.  They will have seen from our report how we are conscious of protecting those affected and the need to have a short, sharp engagement on the issue of the price of carbon and the key sectors that will be affected.  What else needs to be done on the regulatory and policy side?  What is the nature of the regulatory and policy mix needed for that to be a success?  That is one key component.</p> <p>  There was a major emphasis in all the contributions on new mediums of participation.  Mr. Leahy mentioned this and the question of community engagement.  This again is a whole-of-society approach.  The Government has a role to play but we cannot do it all; it has to be within the community as well.  One issue we have faced as elected representatives is that when we want to put in place renewable energy projects there is local opposition.  We talk about communities coming together feeding into the grid, tapping into the grid and selling their own electricity back into the grid.  We need to unlock the planning regulations.  The issues goes beyond acceptance.  If the witnesses have any more insights, I would be grateful to hear them.</p> <p>  I will bring in my colleagues now.  Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy and Senator M&aacute;ire Devine are first.  We will then hear from Deputy Tom Neville.</p></speech>

They will not find any argument from this side in respect of the challenge facing us all nationally and globally in terms of trying to halt global warming.</p> <p>  Mr. McGookin talked about reaching into local communities.  I wonder if he has looked at whether public participation networks are a good starting point.  I attended an event recently in my county of Offaly.  The public participation network there established Green Offaly, which is a great initiative.  Should initiatives like this be happening throughout the country?  It is something the Joint Committee on Climate Action discussed and recommended.</p> <p>  Ms Caroline Moran referred to Bord na M&oacute;na.  I am from Offaly.  A just transition is something that we are anxious to ensure.  Has she been keeping track of the efforts Offaly County Council has made recognising the challenges to the communities involved and the workers?  We need to bring together all the stakeholders to ensure that the workers involved are aware of all the benefits for them in terms of social protection as well as the opportunities for retraining and upskilling.  An event is being planned for the week after next.  It is a job-matching initiative in which local companies will come together with the workers who are taking voluntary redundancy.</p><p>There are many positives.  Other areas could learn from it.  Is Ms Moran keeping track of this?  It is important that we be aware of such efforts.</p></speech>

I am still a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  We were the black sheep of the committee when we voted against the carbon tax.  The committee has done 90% of its work collaboratively, but we were concerned about the just transition and the tax's imposition on less fortunate people who are struggling.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to expand on another point.  There is an emergency in our public health system because of climate change, and it will be even more harmful for communities tomorrow.  This is about communicating with communities not only about heatwaves, floods, storms and the resultant deaths, but about the day in, day out worldwide epidemic of asthma, respiratory tract infections and diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD.  Many of these have to do with pollution, for example, the quality of the water that we drink.  According to the World Health Organization, WHO, this threat costs many billions of dollars and causes millions of deaths per year.  The WHO believes that will only increase.  Should we declare this an emergency alongside climate change?</p> <p>  We have received representations from the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA.  It made an important statement that has stuck with me, namely, that we must rethink how we feed the world.  In the 1960s and 1970s, we did not have meat with every meal.  We could not afford it, as it was a luxury.  However, it has become so commonplace now that we expect it even though it is responsible for much of the destruction of the environment and our bodies' health.</p> <p>  When one sits down in a canteen, bistro or caf&eacute;, everything is packaged.  When did we stop being communal and sharing sugar bowls and milk jugs?  These simple points seem stupid, but they are down to hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, legislation.  We must revisit it, as it is so clinical and clean that it is damaging us, in that we are not being exposed to stuff and material is being wasted.  It is nonsensical that we all just sit around with sachets that we tear apart, adding to the destruction.  The global scale is larger, but I am interested in this matter.</p></speech>

I sat on the Joint Committee on Climate Action and, hopefully, will sit on a permanent version chaired by the Co-Chairman, Deputy Naughton.</p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses' presentations.  I went on a great journey of discovery during the eight months that I sat on the committee.  My knowledge of the parameters and facets of this issue was minuscule.  The witnesses are preaching to the converted as regards the necessary timelines and actions.</p> <p>  I was struck by the question of consultation and building coalitions raised in one of the presentations.  That is paramount to our success.  If we do not build a coalition and agreement across all parties and sectors of society, there will be a knee-jerk kickback.  Be it political or something else, it will be a "Them" and "Us" response that could set us back ten or 15 years or even a generation.  We do not want that.</p> <p>  Our committee viewed public consultation as paramount.  I was interested to hear about how an industry coalition was built on the ground in Germany, but Ireland needs to go to an even more micro level.  Since we have a smaller population, we are a more integrated society.  For example, managing directors of companies have siblings who are farmers or teachers.  As such, we wanted to propose town hall-type meetings that would involve peer-to-peer and community learning involving people from all sectors of society - young and old, farmers and doctors, unemployed people, those in receipt of disability payments and so on.  They would educate one another from the bottom up or at the same level.  Politicians taking a top-down approach will not work.  Europe and America have kicked back at such an approach.  We must alter our communication style.  That will be paramount in coalition building.  It will require maturity, not only from people, but also from political parties.  The latter must take a step back from the politics and build a coalition of consensus to drive this through.  I would be interested in hearing more about the coalition building that happened in Germany.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1737" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019050900002#O00700"><p>I welcome our guests, who have spoken passionately.  These are issues that we considered in significant depth in writing our report.  Action is needed.  The requirement that we live more sustainably, which we have not been doing for years, is at the heart of this.  It is the fallout of industrialisation and so on.  If people were surveyed, everyone would agree with the targets under the Paris Agreement.  It is only when one starts to drill down into who will take the pain and cost that a problem arises.  That is what we must address if we want to see action.  As Deputy Neville stated, though, there must be a consensus.</p> <p>  Recently, I attended a climate action forum of secondary schools in my county of Mayo that was facilitated by the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, the county council and the latter's climate action officer.  We were sitting around a table and one of the issues debated was that of cost.  In terms of transport, for example, we talked about how, if the pupils' parents had to get electric vehicles, it would cost them money regardless of how large a grant the State provided.  The same would be the case with heating systems.  When I asked them if they believed that would be acceptable, they could not say that it would be.</p> <p>  There is another political reality.  No matter what people say in the abstract about targets and the need to take action, the experience in Canada, Australia, Finland, France and Germany has been that, when politicians take political action, a large number of people do not agree with doing so.  It does not mean that we should balk at trying to do the right thing, as we cannot continue taking from the Earth something that will not be replenished and will cause greenhouse gas emissions.  We are smarter now and have more technology.  We must be smarter and live more smartly.  However, the idea that everyone is in agreement is incorrect.  It is not even that they do not believe that there is climate change.  Rather, they are more concerned with living in the here and now than with taking on additional pressures.  If someone is in receipt of social welfare payments, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, can fund 100% of certain energy efficiency works on his or her house.  If someone is earning a low income and, accordingly, will only receive partial supports, he or she will be under pressure.  These are the people who will be financing their children going to college.  From where will that money come?  The bill will be significant.  That is even evident from our social housing programme, given the additional cost of building houses.  People are revolting against costs.  That does not take from the witnesses' message, but we must refine our discussion to listening to people's concerns.</p> <p>  I have raised an issue previously and, while I do not want to labour the point, it must be borne in mind that when the witnesses refer to the measures that are necessary to tackle climate change, they are asking for more to be done by people living in rural areas.  They are asking rural areas to take wind farms and grid infrastructure.  They are asking for peat-burning power stations to be shut down.  Where I am from, such a station closed a number of years ago.  The area is only a shadow of its former itself economically.</p><p>The issue of community gain is very relevant there.</p><p> There is also the issue of farming and the speaker from Teagasc earlier made a sensible proposition.  We are very well suited to producing protein from dairy and beef.  It does not mean that we continue exactly in the same vein but this is not discussed.  There is now a situation where farmers are saying they have been doing all of this.  The national herd has increased and that is why our greenhouse gases and emissions of methane have increased but farmers are farming more efficiently than ever before.  They are put to the pin of their collars by payments on environmental measures, water quality and biodiversity.  They have an appetite to do more but feel persecuted.  People are disengaging.</p><p> I will say one final thing.  The generation coming after us ask us to look at what we are doing.  The reality is that the parents of the children I was talking to would give their left arms for their children.  Their grandparents would do the same.  The generations that have come before are trying to cope and do their best.  They care and want to be given credit for that.  We have to get realistic solutions which balance idealism with the reality to achieve them and not crush people in the process.  </p><p> We will have a revolution.  It will not be like those revolting in London who are from more middle class backgrounds and have time on their hands.  The ordinary person will revolt which will create another set of problems that will set us back economically.  We cannot take from the advances and lifestyles we enjoy.  We must find technology to match that.</p><p> The last speaker on the environment was positive and hopeful, as I am.  Human beings have great capacity to innovate and, although there will always be issues and problems, there can be business opportunities here.  We see a lot of signals sent out by China and India, major emerging economies, that they have to go to green technology and transport, etc.  Ireland has to take these signals if it wants to participate in the global economy.  We must also be clever.   It is not only about misery, it is about opportunities and living in a different way.</p></speech>

I will come to Senator Higgins.  I am conscious of letting our speakers come back to respond.</p></speech>

I campaigned with Tr&oacute;caire on climate change in 2008 when a group of young activists, who are no longer young, were demanding action.  Even then, climate change was not new and there were huge impacts on many parts of the world and many communities were seeing their futures destroyed.</p><p>It is good that there is momentum now and climate change is centre stage in discussions.  Europe Day is about Europe and the real test will be if Europe will place the sustainable development goals and climate change actions at the centre of the new five-year European strategy.  Will they also be at the centre of the multiannual financial framework, the European budget?  Simply putting climate action front and centre for photos at the moment will not be enough.  </p><p>The European Investment Bank put &euro;11 billion into fossil fuels between 2007 and 2013.  The European climate action fund is proposed to be &euro;5 billion.  I want people to discuss the balance between where we invest and how we can stop taking backward steps.</p><p>One of the speakers mentioned the LNG terminal which is an example of something that was funded by European investment funding.  How do we get that joined up?  It comes down to public participation.  </p><p>I am passionate about new forms of participation and we need them.  I like the idea of town hall meetings, I think they are important, and I also think people should be looking at their local authority's development plans and putting in opinions.  That is important.  It is crucial to ask how we ensure the public discussion does not stay in a silo as a separate discussion on climate, but rather bring climate action into the economic discussion around budgets.  We need to ensure that closed-door economic decisions such as trade agreements and procurement are joined up and informed by climate considerations.  We need not to have any backward steps.  I would like to hear the comments of the speakers on that matter.</p><p>Another consideration is the comparative roles of the public and private sectors which was touched on by some of the speakers.  For example, it might be tempting to support the electric car industry because it has the potential to make profit whereas public transport might not, but public transport might lead us to make much greater progress much more quickly.  There will be things that will cost money and will not necessarily be profitable but, if we do not take the action now, the cost will be borne elsewhere in the world and by those most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>That brings us to the question of carbon pricing.  I am on the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection and am very passionate about just transition.  We must not wait for people to become redundant from sectors that are no longer sustainable but need to talk to them while they are still employed about their plans for the future.  I have been arguing for that in the context of just transition.  We must manage the pragmatic issues around just transition in Ireland and look to climate justice on a global level so we not only address the concerns in Ireland but look to climate justice for other parts of the world.</p><p>The price of carbon is artificially low and needs to be higher.  The price has driven an unsustainable global development model.  Do we make social protection payments?  Fuel poverty payments will get us to a certain level but, as was rightly said, many people on low incomes will not be caught by the fuel supplement.  How do we recognise and ensure that industry is reflecting the price of carbon and does not have artificially deflated prices because of artificially deflated carbon costs while ensuring that individuals are not taking the worst of the impacts?  Those are the key questions.  Perhaps we should look at bans, moratoriums and levies on sectors.</p><p>I will conclude because I want to hear the responses of the speakers.  It comes back to the question of business as usual.  Where do we frontload?  Can we, and should we, balance keeping interests aligned while ensuring that we do not wait for certain climate actions to become profitable?<b></b>We have to frontload it.  All of the speakers had practical thoughts on how we do that.  </p><p>My key questions relate to climate justice, just transition, the public and private spheres and how to ensure this is an economic transformation as well as a social movement.</p></speech>

There is a great deal we can do on climate change in a relatively short time.  We are supposed to achieve certain targets within ten years and it is well within our capacity to achieve them in that time period even though we are late starters.</p> <p>  The first thing we had to do was to convince people of the necessity to change and become less reliant on fossil fuels.  As we do that, we must also become less reliant on the electricity generated from fossil fuels.  Once we have crossed that part of the divide, the rest will follow readily.  There is serious interest in electric cars this year where there was no such interest in the past.</p> <p>  Some of us have, over the past number of years, tried to sell the idea of alternative energy and the renewable energy sector and been publicly criticised and ridiculed for it.  That is part of the battle we must face into.  We must balance our approach, try to ensure that we do not target part of our community, or be seen to do so, in our journey towards achieving the necessary change.  We have the capacity to do that, provided we do it right, and avoid the possibility of postponing forever something we need to start doing now.</p></speech>

The first point made was about carbon tax and we looked at that and what it would mean to raise the weekly allowance in order to offset the extra &euro;10.</p><p>It was something like &euro;4 in the winter and &euro;2 in the summer.  We will revert to the committee as we have some figures on that.  It would not hit the people in fuel poverty.  Much of what comes from our research must account for fuel poverty.</p><p> Climate change is a cross-cutting matter and there were questions as to how to overcome the problems.  There are significant benefits to dealing with climate change, particularly in the rural sector, and I hope dealing with climate change would address many of the problems of rural degradation and help to revive many rural areas.  It would help farmers through diversification of income by generating electricity, growing other crops or being paid for the carbon captured in their forests.  Reforestation would be a major part of achieving carbon neutrality, along with restoring wetlands.</p><p> Public participation networks were a recommendation in the report from the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which is why I left them out of my bullet points.  I certainly agree that we need such town hall meetings and there is an attempt to achieve this with the national dialogue on climate change.  It is important to capacity building in communities to have access to impartial experts who can point to the facts and challenges being faced.  It is about open discussion.  My research in the Dingle peninsula relates to this if the members are interested.</p><p> Somebody mentioned going through the local authority and we thought that if we could follow the example of the UK and Wicklow in declaring a climate emergency, local authorities should have it as a top priority to have a climate change officer who would be able to advise homeowners or community groups.  It is an important element in building capacity, which has been mentioned quite often.  There was mention of the middle class accessing grants.  It is a major problem.  I know in Australia, poorer people were basically subsidising richer people getting solar panels put on their homes.  We must be careful to avoid such things.</p></speech>

As has been mentioned, it is really important that there should be plans in place before peat production is closed so workers can have options in what they do afterwards.  If there is to be a change, those workers need different options and time to think.  At a community level there must be thought on what new industries can be brought in to benefit the entire community.</p> <p>  There was mention of carbon tax and feed-in tariffs for solar photovoltaic equipment, which is really important.  The uptake of solar photovoltaic technology in countries with feed-in tariffs has been huge.  If there is fuel poverty or people have low incomes without supplements, they could get profits from a feed-in tariff rather than just a grant.  Retired people in their homes during the day may use electricity while it is generated and therefore it would cut their costs.  Conversely, if people are at work all day they do not get the benefit of energy that is being produced but they would see a benefit through a feed-in tariff.  They would get the money back.  Such a process could work, especially in rural communities.  We have spoken much about farmers and if they are leaving land spare, there could be large-scale solar photovoltaic installations to generate income as well.  We need to be creative in what we do.</p></speech>

This goes beyond just public consultation, which is also a good step.  This is also about what policy choices we make and the outcomes and effects they have.  To underline what has already been said, feed-in tariffs, for example, have the effect of building powerful coalitions.  In Germany there were all sorts of actors who became supportive of the policy and really tried to protect it, including people who may not necessarily have been green-minded.  They support it being ratcheted up.</p> <p>  It is really important to note the social dimension.  We have seen the yellow vest movement in France and what happens when we do not have this lens in implementing the decarbonisation policy.  There was mention of a just transition and this should not be about climate action versus farmers or peat workers.  Farmers are on the front line of climate change and they are already experiencing it.  We have seen that with the fodder crisis.  The fossil fuel age is collapsing and one way or another, peat workers will see an impact from climate change policy.  We must achieve this in a just way.</p> <p>  I will speak briefly to carbon pricing.  As I stated, I am drawing on an understanding of policy dynamics.  Carbon pricing should be seen as one of many tools in a policy mix.  One of the issues is the need to build alternatives and allow people to have alternatives through something like a feed-in tariff.  To draw on a German case, there was a delay in trying to implement carbon pricing through the emissions trading system and, essentially, there was neglect of the areas of transport, heating and the idea of a more systemic just transition.  Now the country is facing the consequences, so we would do well to learn from their mistakes and not have this happen with carbon price implementation in Ireland.  Green industrial support, citizen energy, bans and moratoriums can be used.  The paper I quoted was by Mr. Fergus Green and Dr. Richard Denniss from 2017 and it is available online.  They argue that supply-side bans have a host of advantages and gain much support, including from actors like the fossil fuel industry, which we might not expect.</p> <p>  Citizen energy feeds into the transformative elements and resilience in communities and globally.  It builds more community resilience and this enables communities to face climate change issues.  That work comes from people like Mr. Craig Morris.  There is a need to look locally but also globally at what is coming.  People in Mozambique are panicking, for example, and people across the global South already facing the impact of climate change are panicking.  We would do well to respond right now to what we are all facing.</p></speech>

We could speak about this for hours and all the information has almost given me a headache.  There is one point that has been mentioned a few times and it relates to consultation.  It is one type of participation but this cannot just be about consultation.  According to my research, many different authors and academics have stated that typical formal consultation does not work.  Submissions may not be taken into account with a final decision and there is also the question of when consultation happens.  Does it happen when all the options are closed and if so, how efficient can that be?  There is the question of timing in participation.</p> <p>  I can give a brief example.  Last year the national adaptation framework was published in January and it marked the first step in a process of building national adaptation for different sectors and local authorities.  It was put out for consultation in September 2017 and there were 27 or 28 submissions.  It was not a very high number.  The submissions are available online and only four were submitted by private individuals not representing an organisation or State agency.  This demonstrates a problem.  Is the general public just not interested in those policies or is there a lack of communication in advertising those formal consultation processes?  It is something we must be aware of and we probably need to go a step further than just consultation.  It would amount to considerable responsibility for local authorities but this needs to happen at a local level.</p></speech>

There is certainly a need to panic as we are missing our targets for 2020 and we are set up to miss the 2030 targets.  If by 2050 we are to be carbon-neutral or reduce our emissions by 80% or 100%, we are not on track to do it, even if we implement many of the recommendations of the report.</p> <p>  To focus on agriculture, my research was on soils and soil carbon in Ireland, taking into account the effect of extreme weather on those soils.  Our natural grasslands are carbon sinks because they are grazed by cattle and they provide minerals for the soil.  Those soils are carbon sinks in the same way that our untouched peatlands are.  There are 7 million cows in Ireland producing methane.</p><p>I do not understand how we square getting to carbon neutrality by 2050 with retaining that number of cows.  We need also to recognise the benefit the cows have to the soil.  These are complex issues and communicating their complexity is very important, especially if we do not want an "us versus them" strategy coming out.  Farmers are certainly looking after their land to the best of their ability as they want to pass it on to future generations.  Focusing on the complexities of the issue is important but so is recognising the limitations of our current actions.  </p></speech>

I especially welcome the three speakers for this section, Ms Sara Thompson from UCD, Ms Laura Bartley from DCU and Ms Maeve Richardson from UCC.  It has been a very interesting and illuminating morning for the members listening to all of the witnesses' contributions.  I also welcome the presence of an ever-depleting number of my colleagues from the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  Such is the draw on all our time here in the Houses.  I represent two Ulster counties, Cavan and Monaghan, and have been Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality since 2016.</p> <p>  Migration is the final topic of today's session marking Europe Day 2019.  This is a very important topic, especially on this day, for as Europeans we have known the reality of migration, most often forced migration due to war, conflict, famine, disease and escape from poverty across the centuries.  It is beyond dispute that the people of Ireland have known migration and its causes like few others across the Continent.  This generational awareness, experience and knowledge should contribute to our being a truly welcoming people, giving truth to the claim that this is an Ireland of the welcomes.  Sadly, of course, this is not always the case.  </p> <p>  While we have some time issues, there will be no restriction in respect of the three speakers.  If I have to restrict anybody it will be my colleague, Senator Devine.  I call on Ms Thompson to address us.</p></speech>

I will present some facts and numbers and some challenges that the EU is facing in respect of migration.  The 2015 migration crisis became a starting point to a wider debate on migration in the European Union but also on burden sharing and the member states' responsibilities.  The lack of joint action between the member states has shown that in 2015 the EU was unprepared to handle this issue, which resulted in disorderly migration, human trafficking and tragedy.  In respect of the numbers, 2.5 million immigrants entered the EU from non-EU countries in 2017; and 4.4% of people living in the EU on 1 January 2018 were non-EU citizens, which is 22 million people out of a total of 512 million.  The European agency for human rights has pointed out that the number of irregular migrants crossing the borders dropped in 2017, when 200,000 people crossed the EU borders, in comparison to approximately 500,000 in 2016.  The number of deaths at sea has also dropped; however, the emergency remains as the deaths are continuing, mainly in the central Mediterranean.</p> <p>  Also concerning is the fact that migrants arriving within EU borders have been mistreated.  This mistreatment worsened in 2017 with Bulgaria, Hungary and Croatia as the leading countries of migrant mistreatment.  Another issue is the relocation of immigrants and the problem of overcrowding.  This has been critical in numerous locations, especially in Greece, France and Italy.  Providing adequate housing remains a challenge and the lack of co-operation between member states has a significant impact on how immigration is handled in the EU.  The European Council established a temporary relocation scheme with a plan to relocate 160,000 people in need.  This was not accomplished due to lack of co-operation from the member states.  President Antonio Tajani has stated that migration is our biggest challenge and that it is putting at risk the very future of the European Union.  As a result of intense migration within the EU in recent years, EU internal borders have been subject to additional border controls, which is putting the free movement of EU citizens at risk.  There is a need for better co-operation between member states with regard to border management as the migration crisis has put major pressure on the member states' border authorities.  The European institutions responded with a call for strengthening the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, however this remains a work in progress, with a plan of giving the agency a standing corps of 10,000 border guards by 2027, which is a bit far away.  A Eurobarometer survey has reported that 73% of European citizens want the EU to do more on the issue of migration and 58% described EU action on migration as inadequate.  There is a need to do more on the part of both member states and the EU as a whole.  Reaching agreement on migrant issues has been a challenge for the European Union.  It is a sensitive issue and member states have different views and policies on migration, making it difficult to negotiate co-ordinated common positions.  The migration crisis in 2015 showed that the EU was not prepared to handle a humanitarian crisis.  Plans to relocate migrants, strengthen the borders, integrate refugees and much more are still a work in progress.</p> <p>  Member states and their representatives have to become aware of the next upcoming crisis, which is climate displacement.  This crisis is not spoken about or understood by many.  It is not defined or backed by international law.  It is true that civil war and unrest in Syria, Libya and the Middle East are reasons for the migrant crisis but there are deeper reasons for current migration from these places.  These areas are experiencing rainfall patterns, unbearably high temperatures, floods, droughts and all sorts of natural disasters which lead to major changes in farming, fishing and herding, causing migration from these areas to more developed ones.  Reports on climate displacement presented by the EU are often very generalised and do not provide clear solutions to the problem.  Following the 2015 migration crisis, it is clear that member states are not united with regard to burden sharing and this has to be addressed in order to prepare Europe and help those in need.  </p> <p>  I will present a couple of recommendations made by the Mary Robinson Foundation on Climate Justice in its 2016 position paper.  Above EU national level, the rights of climate displaced people have to be respected in the same way as human rights in general.  The burdens in respect of dealing with climate migration have to be addressed together as a Union.  There is a need for engagement with already displaced people but also with those who are vulnerable to climate displacement, in order to protect the rights of people who are at risk of climate displacement.  The most important action the countries can take is to reduce the impact of climate change at all costs.  This will reduce the threats in areas at risk.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1759" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Bartley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019050900002#R00500"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it.  As a younger citizen, I am particularly grateful for this opportunity to engage on such a timely policy issue.  My knowledge is based on my European-funded research at Dublin City University, the University of Glasgow and Charles University, Prague.  My research focuses on migration to Europe, specifically the power of the media and policy makers to shape public opinion.  My current research examines the ways in which migration has been constructed as a threat and questions the dominance of this threat-centric approach.</p> <p>  It is without doubt that international migration and issues surrounding migrants, refugees and asylum seekers can be seen as defining characteristics of the 21st century in an era of globalisation.  In the context of conflict and growing inequalities, the IOM's 2018 report estimates that there are 258 million international migrants globally.  Ireland's strong cultural memory and historic trend to emigration mean that we are acutely aware of the realities of migration and displacement.</p><p>Yet more recently, Ireland has experienced increased inward migration and has become an increasingly diverse society with the 2016 census indicating that the 535,000 non-Irish nationals living in Ireland originate from 200 different nations.  Such figures illustrate the increased diversity and prompt the need to examine political and societal attitudes to immigrants, and explore different ways to support integration and social cohesion within Irish and European society.</p><p> The first challenge I will address relates to the power of language and narrative.  Migration has remained one of the most divisive issues for the public in recent years and this is reflected in the polarised narratives and language which frame discussions.  Past decades have seen a language shift from emigrant and immigrant to the use of the word "migrant" which has effect of de-contextualising the experience of these people by removing their home location and their destination.  There is also selectivity in respect of those to whom we apply these terms which often indicates a hierarchy of worthiness, suggesting that we have "good" versus "bad" migrants.</p><p> The language we use matters.  It has power to reinforce negative stereotypes and racial hierarchies which permeate to every level of society.  As such we must recognise and challenge harmful, polarising language and myths regarding migration.  We must refrain from using terms such as "illegal migrant" in any forum of discussion and instead use "irregular" or "undocumented".  We must commit to increased engagement in order to confront the myths of migration at local, national and EU levels.</p><p> There is a need to engage in difficult discussions regarding migration for policy makers, journalists and activists to maintain credibility.  We must create a space where communication of the perceived and actual challenges of migration is possible, but not in a way which stigmatises or alienates communities.  The creation of action plans and strategies by Government and local authorities, such as the migrant integration strategy or even the UN migration pact convey effective messages which are honest, fair and accessible.</p><p> The second challenge I wish to address is promoting integration in communities.  There is increasing recognition of the inherent potential of diverse society.  There is also an awareness of the difficulties associated with integration policies and programmes.  The dilemma often relates to how to prioritise integration without fuelling unfairness among certain groups that feel left behind.  Research has shown that encounters with the reality of migration foster a more tolerant mindset within host communities, which needs to be looked at further.</p><p> In discussions on the topic of integration, it is often said that the process is a two-way street involving the host community and the newcomer.  However, we need to move away from this binary give-and-take view of integration, as it does not always capture the complex, multifaceted and dynamic process which involves a network of actors and interactions.  As such we must disrupt the preconceptions that contribute to a gap between the expectation and reality of migration.  We must do this through promoting intercultural competency and integration programmes, such as arts and language acquisition, for all members of society.  We must aim to equip all citizens with the education to gain empathy and perspective-taking skills.</p><p> We must view the integration process in the context of the whole of society and facilitate the undoing of the notion of "us" versus "them".  We must broaden the view of immigration beyond simply contributing to GDP or market growth.  It is not just about financially benefiting from migration, but about the overall health of our societies over the next generation.  In addition we need to carry out further research into attitudes towards diversity and integration within Irish and European society, such as the recent ERSI study.</p><p> With the immense challenges facing European and Irish society, such as changing demographics, political fragmentation, labour market changes and the pace of political and social changes, we need to have broader perspectives on the challenges we are facing and also an ambitious vision of what our future communities may look like.</p><p> We should not think of integration as an endpoint, but to understand it as an ongoing, inclusive process which provides opportunities and builds resilience in communities to confront the growing range of future challenges, not just in respect of migration.</p><p> I look forward to hearing the committee's views.</p></speech>

I am honoured to be addressing the committee today.  I am a BSc student in University College Cork in the second year of my undergraduate studies.  Appropriately we are speaking on Europe Day about a month before the European Parliament elections.  Given the changes in the political climate, it is now more important than ever to use the ballot box to have our voices heard in Europe.</p> <p>  The Treaty of Rome established the freedom of movement in respect of goods, services, capital and, what seems to be getting most attention lately, the movement of people, as we have seen from our colleagues in the European Union.  Migration has many different definitions and comes in many types, including economic migrants, refugees and ex-pats.  The perception of migration is intriguing as to whether it is harmful or positive, and what are its economic effects and difficulties.  Many people see the advantages of labour gaps being filled and society becoming more diverse.  We also see the negativity that jobs are being take away by members of the migrant community or that there is a social pressure on civic services along with an increase in racism and discrimination.</p> <p>  The cross-national Role of European Mobility and its Impacts in Narratives, Debates and EU Reforms, REMINDER, study shows that more than half of EU citizens regard the freedom of movement as positive for Europe despite an increase in support for far-right parties which has the effect of making mainstream parties take tougher stances on immigration.  European countries tend to view the effects of migrants in two ways - cultural and economic.  More recently we are starting to think about safety and terrorism.  The REMINDER study took place across seven countries in western Europe.  Apart from the UK, most countries showed more than 50% in favour of the freedom of movement.  These viewed most immigrants to western European as beneficial and not an economic or cultural threat.  Africans were viewed as most threatening to the economy while Middle Eastern migrants were considered the most threatening to safety and culture.  This has been as a result of the image of migrants portrayed in our media.</p> <p>  Europeans perceive that migrants from outside Europe make up 16.7% of the EU population.  The reality is that it is about 4.4% as of January 2018.  The representation of migrants in the media has had a profound effect on how we view our migrants.  The media provide both a human face in the form of refugees but also a mild terror attack in the form of big news headlines which terrify us.</p> <p>  Migration is an important topic for us all.  It has been shown to be a top priority for countries in the southern coastal part of Europe, namely in Croatia, Italy and Greece.  It is not so much of an issue in Ireland and is not a voter priority.  This is mainly due to the fact in the late 2010s it is shown that the majority of non-EU migrants arrive by sea.</p> <p>  Our landscape is changing through climate change and we need to become proactive rather than reactive if we are to prepare for another migrant crisis such as we saw in 2015.  We need to make sure that with the coming of an EU army we are not creating a fortress Europe but rather creating a Europe that is open to all and not just Europeans.</p></speech>

This is not my area of expertise.  The Seanad has a public consultation committee.  In the autumn I plan on opening a conversation by inviting representatives from the direct provision system, which is a shame and stain on our country.  I would like to invite the three witnesses present to come to talk about migration and how people get to that point of desperation.  We are displaying inhumanity to people who need embracing, care and love and a shelter from the horrific circumstances they left behind.</p> <p>  The witnesses talked about climate displacement - which could have been appropriate to the previous speakers - the greed of the developed world and our destructive impact on those less fortunate.</p><p>Our objective in having a public consultation in the autumn will be to challenge perceptions in this country and reach out to the 40% of people who feel afraid of and unsure about migration.  It is about getting the media to respond and to counteract some of the hysterical and hateful headlines we have seen.  The witnesses noted that voters in several European countries have elected more delegates from right-wing, fortress Europe parties.  My colleague, Senator Gavan, was in Hungary recently and may speak about what he saw there.  I will be happy to extend an invitation to the witnesses, who have made an excellent contribution to this debate, to attend the public consultation later this year.</p></speech>

We have had very impressive contributions from all the witnesses.  As part of my work as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I have witnessed teenagers the same age as my own children being kept in cages for more than six months in one case.  That is what is happening in parts of Europe to migrant children.  The witnesses have played their part today in seeking to break the shameful silence around this issue.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on the EU's deal on migration with Turkey, which is deemed a third country of safe origin.  It is no such thing but is, in fact, a dictatorship in which horrendous human rights abuses are taking place.  It suits the EU to do that deal, however, because it keeps people out and there is apparently little interest in how migrants are being treated in Turkey.  It is an appalling human rights situation and the EU is utterly complicit in it.  It is a situation that must be ended.  I thank all the speakers for their contributions.</p></speech>

However, compared with countries like Hungary and Turkey, there are ways in which we can seek to integrate people into our society as much as possible.  We have seen great projects, for example, from Scouting Ireland and the Irish Second-Level Students Union.  However, if we remain silent on what is happening in other countries, what is the point of any such efforts?  We should be taking the lead by saying we will not stand for this.  We are a Europe of peace but there is no point if we are not working to keep the peace between people internally in our member countries.</p></speech>

It is timely, therefore, to have a public consultation on the issue.  I agree that the EU seems to be outsourcing many of our problems with migration to a neighbourhood comprising Libya, Morocco and Turkey.  There needs to be a re-engagement across European society on the values we are meant to uphold, such as strength in diversity.  The actions being taken in the EU at a high political level do not reflect those principles.  Likewise in Ireland, the refugee programme has reached only half its quota.  We need to reflect on our claim to be the island of c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.  A public consultation will be very helpful in that regard.</p></speech>

On burden sharing, as long as countries do not take responsibility for that at European level, nothing will change.  As it stands, burden sharing is voluntary.  We must push at European level to make such commitments binding and ensure we take responsibility for the care of migrants.  In the context of climate displacement, we in Europe are the lucky ones who are safe for now, but we must take responsibility for the damage we are doing to the planet and to the people who will be displaced by climate change.</p></speech>

Ms Thompson clearly linked increased migration with the climate crisis, especially as it affects less developed and impoverished parts of the globe.  Ms Bartley spoke about the importance of language and how "illegal migrant" is an inappropriate and stigmatising term and one we should not use.  I thank her for that strong message.  She spoke, too, about how an "us and them" outlook is blinkered and serves to feed prejudice and racism.  Ms Richardson noted that the free movement of people is one of the key principles of the European Union and, like her colleague, linked migration to the importance of addressing the climate crisis.</p> <p>  In the absence of my Co-Chairman, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, it falls to me to draw the meeting to a close.  The witnesses have distinguished themselves and their respective colleges and organisations.  It is a great pleasure for us as Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to welcome young, focused and enthusiastic voices from across the length and breadth of the island of Ireland.  That has been an important feature of today's discussion.  I especially welcome the fellow voices from Ulster, which makes me feel at home.  Every time I cross the Boyne Valley Bridge, I let out a small cheer that I am heading there again.  I thank colleagues for their part in marking Europe Day so well as we have done.  I hope it will be the first of many years of interesting engagement between ourselves and witnesses like those we have heard from today.</p></speech>

I am speaking on behalf of the Pensions Council, the sole function of which is to advise the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection on pensions generally.  As my opening statement sets out, the members of the council work voluntarily, in effect.  No payment is made to members in respect of most of their work.  We do not have a secretariat, as such.  We get some support on an administrative level.<br/><br/>We would not usually look at something as specific as the Pensions Amendment (No. 2) Bill 2017.  Instead, we would put forward some general ideas.  Having been invited to consider the text of the Bill, the council did so at its April meeting.  The Bill is one of a number of efforts to improve protections for members of defined benefit and other schemes.  Such efforts are needed, if I may say so.  We very much welcome the objective of the Bill.  We assume that the first section, which relates to the matter of so-called equity between the different kinds of pensioners, does not apply to the wind-up of insolvent schemes because the allocation in such circumstances is already specified by statute.  Overall, we feel that the best starting point in dealing with the issues raised here is the principle that defined benefit fund deficits should be treated as a debt on the sponsoring employer.  We do not suggest that this should be applied in every single instance, because there is sometimes a need to adapt to particular cases.  We feel that it is the best starting point for considering all the issues in this area.  The proposed Bill would certainly create a debt on the employer in relation to fund deficits in certain cases.  While it should be commended on that basis, it does not fully embrace the approach we propose.<br/><br/>There are some legal and practical problems with the Bill, as drafted.  It may or may not be the case that they are capable of being fixed.  I remind the committee that with the possible exception of the chairman, the Pensions Council is a group of the most experienced experts on pensions and pension policy in the country.  There are three groups within the membership of a pension scheme - the pensioners, the active members who are still in employment, and the deferred members who will eventually have some rights when they reach retirement but are not accruing benefits in the normal way.  When we looked at section 2, which introduces the new section 48C, we asked whether this provision will apply to one of those groups or to all three.  The number of deferred benefit pensioners is very much higher than the number of active members and pensioner members combined.  It is a very large number.  Some of them may have been dispersed to the four corners of the earth.  Therefore, there may well be problems in securing a majority of members of a pension scheme.<br/><br/>We may assume that the only people who could object to the way the funds are allocated are the pensioners.  If they make an objection in accordance with the scheme of the Bill, they will be appealing for reallocation of what, in most cases, will be a fixed amount of money.  Any group that is appealing will be asking for money to be taken from another group and given to it.  The problem is that the other groups would then have to be heard.  I remind the committee that what is equitable for a pensioner may not be equitable for an active member and may not be equitable for a deferred member.  The potential exists for three groups of people to make arguments that will probably be perfectly plausible and equitable from their perspective.  The non-pensioner group might point out that the overwhelming balance of any money in a fund is paid to the pensioners.  The <i>per capita</i>payment made to pensioners in such cases is far higher - it is either six or 12 times higher - then the <i>per capita</i>amount paid to active members or deferred members.  We do not think that in this case, the Pensions Authority could act like Solomon and say this is exactly how it should be and so on and so forth.  We certainly could not do so without the risk of legal challenge.  The point I am making is that when we tried to figure it out, it just was not clear how it would work in practice.</p><p>Section 3 proposes to amend the principal Act by inserting a new section 50D after section 50, and it meets part of the general principle that we like, which is that the deficit should be a debt on the employer, but only in part.  We think it may pose practical problems or difficulties for the Pensions Authority which would have to decide in a very public way and declare a fund solvent or insolvent, with the possible consequences so far as that is concerned.  We believe that the existing section 50 of the Pensions Act 1990, which provides for what I would best describe as an overall review or check by the Pensions Authority on how a scheme is to be restructured, is probably the best way forward, although it has to be said that the main concern of the authority, perhaps rightly, is to ensure that there is enough funding left to fund whatever has been decided in terms of restructuring.<br/><br/>I cannot emphasise enough, and we considered this at one meeting in a very general way, that there are many details that would have to be filled in in terms of applying this system, particularly for monthly employer schemes and the like.  Certain procedural rules for wind-up would need to be required and improved.  For example, there should be a clear period of notice so that, in effect, there would be an opportunity for the different partners or the different members to make their views known and time for the informal dispute resolution system that is there to be triggered in proper cases where there is a dispute between the trustees and the employers.  Of course, in all of this, everything has to be looked at in terms of the fact that a pension scheme is a private contract between the trustee and the employer.  While there is regulation applied by the authority, that is it in essence.  Could the authority in those circumstances for whatever good argument insist that an employer should continue to pay into the scheme <i>ad infinitum,</i>so to speak, in what is a private commitment?  There may be things in the trust deed that impose certain duties on the employer, but that is specific to the particular trust deed.  To give an authority the power to insist that somebody should honour a contract <i>ad infinitum </i>will certain pose difficulties.  We do not know what exactly the situation will be.<br/><br/>I will end by repeating the point that we have looked at this in a general way.  We believe the idea of starting with the deficit as a debt on the employer, and within that dealing with specific hardship cases or especially difficult cases, would be the best approach to this, although a great deal of work would remain to be done on it.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

The last time on which we provided an input to the committee on defined benefit, DB, pension schemes was on the heads of the Government&rsquo;s Bill in June 2017.  Our concerns with that draft Bill and the Pensions (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2017 under consideration today are broadly similar.  These concerns principally relate to the unintended consequences, potential risks and practical considerations arising from section 3 of the Bill.  This proposes that it would be illegal for a solvent company to wind up a DB pension scheme without the consent of the Pensions Authority, the so-called employer debt.</p> <p>  Before looking at the practical implications of this, and Mr. Murray, the chairman of the Pensions Council has highlighted some of these, it is worth remembering that most DB pension schemes are established under a trust deed.  The employer voluntarily undertakes to be bound by the rules of the scheme and to meet certain duties and liabilities.  There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to a DB pension scheme nor to accept liability for any deficits.  This Bill will turn a voluntary contribution into a mandatory obligation and potentially jeopardise the viability of businesses which are unable to absorb this extra cost.</p> <p>  I was struck by some witness inputs on employer debt during the previous session of the joint committee meeting on 11 April.  To paraphrase, they suggested that schemes have had many opportunities to close or wind up, that this type of legislation has been under consideration for two years with no evidence of that happening, and that schemes that now remain have decided they are in it for the long term.  I tend to agree with that as a generality.  However, while this point was being used to support the argument we would make that the risk to employment and business viability is exaggerated, I would then ask what problem the Bill is trying to solve.</p> <p>  The Bill proposes an unfair burden on long-established and highly reputable employers who voluntarily set up defined benefit pension schemes and invested significant sums to maintain them through very difficult times.  There would be no corresponding obligation on employers who have set up defined contribution schemes or the vast majority of smaller businesses, particularly, which have no pension scheme at all.  I will give members some insight into the size of the cost and competitiveness implications.  I refer to recent research by Roma Burke of LCP and Tony Gilhawley which suggests that employer funding for defined contribution, DC, members averages 7% of salary compared with 22% for DB scheme members.  That raises issues of equity within companies between different categories of employees in the same company.</p> <p>  IBEC shares the ambitions of committee members to protect scheme members, to encourage employers to ensure that schemes are well funded, and to prevent employers who will not pay or who will not propose an equitable alternative arrangement, as opposed to those who cannot pay, from walking away from the schemes they sponsor.  Advocates of employer debt ignore the reality of business risk.  They are asking companies to assume responsibility for factors that have undermined the DB pension model and are outside their control, such as volatility in stock markets, demographic pressures of increasing life expectancy, falling bond yields and regulatory requirements.  As a small open economy, Ireland is especially vulnerable to uncertainty, global economic slowdown and turbulent international trading conditions.  We can ill-afford to add unnecessary risks to our companies&rsquo; balance sheets.</p> <p>  Committee members will have seen in the Oireachtas Library and Research Service's briefing paper the figures on the long-term decline in the number of DB schemes in Ireland.  We are, in effect, moving towards a long run-off phase for increasingly maturing DB schemes and we should be trying to nurse them through this process.  This will only be achieved by addressing the rules surrounding the funding standard and not by additional regulation.  In that regard, we welcome the proposal in section 4 of the Bill that the Pensions Authority should prepare a report on the feasibility of changing the way in which the funding standard is calculated.  I would question, however, whether we require legislation to mandate this.</p> <p>  The experience of recent years has demonstrated that DB schemes are best managed through discussion and negotiation between trustees, employers and members, and where efforts are made to reach agreement on the steps required to secure scheme viability.</p><p>As we have argued previously, these steps may include a mix of measures such as increased employer-member contributions, longer working and amended benefits.</p><p> The painstaking process of supporting schemes to move gradually to a more appropriate funding level may not attract the same media attention as a small number of high-profile scheme closures.  However, it is more likely to secure sustainable member benefits than additional regulation.  The fact that almost 80% of DB schemes now meet the regulator's funding standards is testament to the progress that has been made.  It is estimated that just 20% met this standard ten years ago.</p><p> While most of my comments have been from an employer's perspective, we should not forget that this type of proposal could result in a far worse outcome for some scheme members, particularly younger ones.  In some cases, preventing an insolvent scheme from winding up can result in its ongoing deterioration before inevitable closure, with older members using up the assets before younger members retire.  This point was acknowledged in the research service's briefing paper.</p><p> We believe that the Bill would be unfair on employers who, unlike many of their competitors, had voluntarily set up DB pension schemes and invested significant sums in maintaining them.  The proposed legislation would destabilise the future efforts of many employers and trustees to support and deliver on the pension promises made to scheme members.  The pensions liabilities and investment risk assumed could be too big for companies to support in what can be a very uncertain business environment, and could jeopardise the viability of the business and jobs of those employed.  If implemented, the Bill would result in a far worse outcome for some scheme members, particularly younger ones, whose assets could be used up before they retire by older members.</p><p> I thank the committee members for their attention and look forward to answering their questions.</p></speech>

I am not being flippant in that regard.  The committee has received a variety of witnesses who represent the views of different people.  We acknowledge that that is Mr. Donohoe's role today.

Regarding Mr. Murray's remarks on section 2, he will be aware that, in a restructuring situation, the pensioners have no say.  Consistent representations have been made to us about the unfairness of that.  We are trying to give them a say.  The wording might need some amendment.  Mr. Murray mentioned detailed rules, notices, etc.  I would envisage all of those matters being dealt with by way of regulation.</p> <p>  I take the point about the possibility of deferred pensioners being scattered all over the world.  We have an election in a couple of weeks' time and some people might not be available to vote, but the result will come from those who do vote.</p> <p>  Mr. Donohoe's statement echoes the submissions that IBEC has already made on this issue.  I understand his points.  Of course there is no legal compulsion to provide for workers who have retired by way of a defined benefit scheme.  By definition, an employer who opts to have a defined benefit scheme will be at a competitive disadvantage compared with an employer who has no scheme at all or a defined contribution scheme.  We are trying to address the fact that solvent employers, which can afford to continue their contributions to defined benefit pension schemes, can walk away without let or hindrance.  Employees join firms on the basis of a signed contract, a salary, a defined benefit scheme, the employer paying into that scheme, etc.  Suddenly, the whole thing can be terminated at the sole discretion of the employer.  That is unfair.  If it was not unfair or something that needed to be dealt with, there would not be legislation such as that in the United Kingdom.  As the Chairman stated, not only have previous witnesses supported the Bill, but they have urged us to get on with this as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  I take Mr. Donohoe's point about solvency and a risk to the balance sheet.  I have tried to draft the Bill in such a way that solvency would be protected.  For example, it could be spun out over a period of time.  It may be that further adjustment is required.  As Mr. Donohoe knows, we are providing for an ultimate appeal to the High Court.  Perhaps it is in the High Court that the overall threat to solvency of applying the legislation in a particular case could be considered.</p> <p>  Regarding the risk to the balance sheet, if an employer has a defined benefit pension scheme, does it not have to provide for that on the balance sheet anyway?  It is a contingent liability.</p></speech>

One has to show it on the balance sheet but it would be recognised as a particular type of contingent liability by funders and so on if one was trying to raise capital.</p></speech>

I take Mr. Donohoe's point that a situation might arise where the scheme fails and younger members could be at a disadvantage, as it would have been better for them had the closure not been delayed.  If all of the younger members of defined benefit pension schemes were polled, though, I imagine that they would prefer to have some type of protection in place.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for attending.  I welcome Mr. Murray and Mr. Donohoe's points.  This is a pre-legislative session, which means that the next Stage will see the Bill undergoing detailed committee consideration.  I do not doubt that there will be amendments in the course of that.  We will take into account what the witnesses have stated.  Other parties will table amendments and we will consider any that is reasonable.  Our intention is not to drive any company into insolvency and create unemployment for their employees.  We will ensure that the final product is carefully drafted to safeguard against that.</p></speech>

Schemes are governed by trust deeds, which impose rigorous requirements on the trustees and a commitment from employers.  It is not often done in the courts, but the latter can sometimes be exercised by making a contribution demand on the employer.  That can be written into the trust deed.  I will invite my colleague, Ms McElwee, to discuss some of the realities on the ground but such situations are normally handled through a process of negotiation.  It is a sensitive process with many moving parts and we do not want something that would destabilise it.</p> <p>  DB schemes are set up to have a lifetime.  While I have seen various figures, this is shown by the fact that between 70% and 90% of DB schemes are not taking in new entrants any more.  There is no new money coming into them.  I have seen one scheme at relatively close quarters where the younger members were pushing for the scheme to be closed because they could see where it was going.  Younger people also tend to move around between different employments now and would prefer to have that control over their own pension pots.  To put it bluntly, they felt that they were subsidising the significant pensioner liabilities on the scheme.</p><p>They viewed it as inequitable.</p><p> I will take this opportunity to make a related comment.  The most important obligation in the complexity of pensions legislation is to do no harm and minimise the unintended consequences.  There are business consequences in this regard, given what are huge liabilities in some schemes.  Some companies look more like a pension fund with a company attached to it than a company with a pension fund.  Were this debt to be brought in, what might look like a solvent company would very quickly become insolvent.  The only way to negotiate out of that situation - I have cited some examples concerning retirement ages and member benefits - is to let time take care of it.  Often, the remedy is a ten-year process.  It is difficult to know how any agency - in this case, it is suggested that that be the Pensions Authority - would be able to take a view on the solvency of a company ten years hence.  It could take a view in the immediate term, but that is rarely relevant to pensions discussions.</p><p> The Taoiseach raised an issue in a statement in the D&aacute;il in response to questions.  There are other unintended consequences.  For example, I would be interested in knowing how the Bill might apply to semi-State companies.  While it might not put such a company out of business, the legislation would make its debt so high that it would be unable to invest any more.  That would have a serious impact on the public good, as large State-owned enterprises need to be able to borrow in order to invest in infrastructure.  If the company cannot do that because of the pension scheme deficit on its balance sheet, that would create societal problems.  I make this point just to show the Bill's potential unintended consequences.</p><p> If the Chairman does not mind, I will invite my colleague, Ms McElwee, who works with companies that are trying to go through this process, to reflect on the realities involved.</p></speech>

Organisations with defined benefit pension schemes were employers of choice.  They have put in place significant benefit schemes.  I will pick up on the Deputy's use of the word "opts", as he should actually have used its past tense.  They opted for these schemes many years ago at a time when we were in a different situation.  We could not foresee the future and the challenges being faced now.  Many companies have no new entrants into their schemes.  They are in a negotiated situation.  It is a very sensitive employer relations issue.  Where a company made the decision many years ago to be that employer of choice and put in place the best benefits that it could in good faith, it is in every circumstance where feasible and possible going to negotiate with its trustees and undertake a significant programme of negotiation with its staff in respect of the changes, amendments or closure that must come about based on the financial situation of the pension scheme as it stands.</p> <p>  We must recognise that the world of work changes all of the time.  It is a private contract entered into freely and at a cost to the employer.  However, all contracts change over time.  In every other aspect of employment contracts, changes come about.  They need to be open to negotiation relative to the position of an organisation at any time.  We see that as it comes through.</p> <p>  I appreciate the comments about the need to consider hard cases, but the question is how will they be determined and how will any organisation entering into these types of discussion be in a position to determine in advance that they would be considered a hard case and, consequently, given that opportunity to negotiate.  The challenges of trying to differentiate between one and the other are significant for businesses.</p> <p>  Mr. Donohoe referred to younger members.  The Chairman mentioned that IBEC was present to represent employers, which is the case.  In my direct engagement with organisations' human resources directors, however, the issue of internal equity between different cohorts of staff arises constantly.  They feel, and we feel in advising them, a considerable responsibility for managing some of the challenges posed by the differences in the terms and conditions applicable for people with significant DB and contribution pensions and newer staff who have not been able to access schemes that are now closed.  Employers are concerned for their staff in this regard.  In particular, they are concerned about younger and newer employees being at a disadvantage and the challenges it presents to good, stable and harmonious industrial relations within their businesses.</p></speech>

I will refer him to a report last year from the UK's Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association.  Some 11 million people in the UK expect to receive benefits from a DB scheme.  According to the report, 3 million of them have only a 50% chance of receiving that benefit.  The UK has experienced employer debts, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, but its legislation has not solved the problem.  The flight from DB to DC has accelerated and there are serious concerns that the pensions protection fund will not have anywhere near the resources - and one should recall that it is a much larger economy than ours - to meet those liabilities.  The UK has gone down this route but has probably not got the results it was seeking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1797" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Murray" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019050900002#F00700"><p>As to pensioners having no say in restructuring, that is true strictly speaking if the Deputy means that they do not have a certain established right in law or something like that.  In practice, however, time is of the essence.  It must not be possible under any circumstance for an employer to close a scheme overnight before anyone has a chance to offer an opinion.  The Pensions Council would concur with much of what Mr. Donohoe stated about the parties to the contract being the ones who should play a part through the trustees, who are supposed to be looking after all of the parties in the scheme.  Often, pensioners are a very organised and vocal group, which they are perfectly entitled to be and there is no problem with that.  The Pensions Council would feel that it would not be quite correct to say without qualification that pensioners had no rights.</p> <p>  Regarding younger members, I should expect that the council is well aware of the general arguments against many of the points that it is for.  It was not entirely convinced by the argument that, when combined with a funding proposal, which would be an element, an extension would necessarily be adverse to the younger members.  This issue would arise in the context of any restructuring scheme.  The younger members will be well able to make their thoughts known, as most of them will probably be active members.  Actually, we do not know.  The number of deferred members is high at 400,000 or thereabouts.  I will have to get my figures right.</p></speech>

I suspected I should not say "millions", and of course not.</p><p>There are 400,000 deferred members, 100,000 plus or minus active members and 100,000 plus or minus pensioners so there are twice as many deferred members as the other set of members combined.  Again, the question of whether a continuation of the scheme is very much to the detriment of the younger members depends on the case.  The Pensions Council certainly did not think it was something that would always have to be applied.  Depending on the case, the parties will have plenty to say for each other perhaps.  When the Pensions Authority comes to review any scheme under Article 50, the only thing it must ensure is that any restructured scheme is sustainable and that there are enough funds or enough of a prospect of funds to continue it.  </p><p> What Deputy O'Dea said about elections is true but these always have an influence.  Without in any way appearing to suggest that pensioners are well off because they are clearly not, we must go back to the point that 100,000 pensioners, which is about 16% of the total number of members, share 59% or 60% of the funds available.  The other 500,000 pensioners between them have about &euro;20 billion in terms of liabilities so there is a significant loss, particularly to active members, when a scheme is closed down.  Usually, there is a loss to pensioners but the loss of prospects for the younger members needs to be taken very seriously.  I am not trying to pit young against old but from the point of view of a legislator or Government, one must look at the overall situation.  One would need to start on the basis that all three sets of members of pension schemes believe they are hard done by.  It would be a natural enough sentiment to have but a Government or a law and the trustees must look at the overall situation.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1801" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019050900002#G00200"><p>I will be fairly brief because a lot has been covered at this stage.  I have a few questions, which are mainly directed at IBEC.  I am not sure whether it is being done purposely but listening to some of the comments about the Bill and companies being unable to look into the distance when these contracts, which is essentially what they are, are signed off on, this Bill has come forward, although it is not the only Bill.  There are a number of Bills.  I have brought forward one, as has the Labour Party.  Indeed the Government was looking at heads of Bill as well so there are serious concerns here, which is why it needs to be addressed.  We are all very aware of the high-profile companies, all of which are highly profitable, in the recent past that have shifted defined benefit to defined contribution schemes.  Even looking into the future, I am sure those profits are fairly secure.</p> <p>  I do not know whether Mr. Donohoe is deliberately trying to muddy the waters but there is no attempt to force employers to establish or pay into a defined benefit scheme through this Bill.  Employers establish and pay into defined benefit schemes through their own will and this Bill will not change that.  This is about solvent companies that are choosing to renege on their pension commitments to employees not because of financial difficulties but, essentially, to remove the risk from their own books.  That is the issue this Bill is trying to address.  The other legislative items that have been brought forward have also tried to address it.  I think IBEC is deliberately trying to mislead people on this matter.  What is IBEC's view about highly profitable companies that have wound down their schemes?  They include some very high-profile companies.  What is IBEC's position regarding those companies shutting down those schemes?  I will not delay things.  All the points I wanted to raise have essentially been covered.  What is IBEC's position on highly profitable companies shutting down defined benefit schemes?  The witnesses from IBEC say there is no need for legislation and that the protections there.  Clearly, this is not the case and legislation is needed.  What is Mr. Donohoe's view on that?  </p></speech>

His question contains an assumption that defined benefit is good and defined contribution is bad, which is not the reality.  Defined benefit as a model has been shown to be unsustainable.  As I said in my opening comments, we must nurse its long-term demise in the most sensitive and fair way possible.  When there are no entrants to a defined benefit scheme, there are no new funds coming into it and by definition, it cannot carry on.  At some stage in the future, there will be no new members and the last pensioner passes off this planet.  It is an unsustainable model.</p> <p>  Deputy Brady used the word "risk", which is the most important word in this regard.  Highly profitable companies removing risk is a legitimate business action because they want to maintain their profitability and, more importantly, their sustainability.  This is apart from the issues of internal equity.  In most of these companies, there are two groups of workers, one of which is on defined benefit while the other is on defined contribution, and the companies are trying to manage that.  It is perfectly understandable that companies would try to remove that risk and they should be supported in doing so.  That is not to say that companies should be walking away from their commitments.  I will not comment on any particular companies but we look at some of these highly profitable high-profile cases, we will see that in these negotiations, nobody is walking away from anything.  These negotiations literally went on for years in some cases.  I would argue that in other cases, the outcome was much better for the workers.  I can think of one company whose contribution to a defined contribution scheme was higher than what it paid into the defined benefit scheme but it wanted to remove the risk.  The risk is the most important thing.  There is nothing wrong with that but that is not the same as saying companies can walk away from their commitments without putting a viable and equitable alternative in place.  </p> <p>  Defined contribution is the way of the world.  This is not just an Irish phenomenon but one that is happening across the globe.  Some countries such as Australia have had defined contribution funds as part of their pensions structure paying very good pensions for three decades.  I question the assumption that defined contribution is necessarily inferior, whatever about the risk element of it.  I would also argue that it is a more realistic option in this new world of work where people go through multiple careers.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1803" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019050900002#G00400"><p>In response to Deputy Brady, Mr. Donohoe said he could understand why companies want to remove risk but it is not a question of taking risk and sending it out into orbit.</p><p>What one is doing is moving the risk from the company or the pension fund to the employee.  People can argue back and forth about whether that is a good thing in an overall context.</p><p> The witnesses mentioned that solvent employers who can perfectly well afford to keep a defined benefit pension scheme in operation are sometimes constrained by the trust deeds.  That is sometimes the case but it varies from company to company.  Having read many of them in my time, I know that every trust deed is different  Some of them clearly are not constrained but it has happened.  There have been some negotiations but it has happened.  Companies have unilaterally changed over to defined contribution schemes where the entire risk is on the back of the employee who depends on the success of those who invest the money in bonds or on the stock market.  We have a lot of examples of spectacularly unsuccessful investments and ordinary people are, as we speak, bearing the consequences of that.  </p><p> This discussion is taking place in the context of an obligation we are seeking to place on the Government.  The witnesses have said that it does not require legislation to set the minimum funding requirement but I believe that it does.  If legislation was not required, we would have introduced it.  We have been beating this drum for the past five years and there is no sign of the Government doing anything about it.  The only way to make the Government do something about it is to put it into legislation and compel it to act.  The witnesses will agree that the way liabilities are measured at the moment is daft.  One can talk about large debts overhanging companies and pension funds but it very much depends on how one calculates the liability.  If it is calculated in such a way that is grossly exaggerated, then naturally there will be a continuing problem.</p><p> I also accept the point made about the situation in the UK, which I have been following closely.  The witnesses have said that it has not solved the problem there.  Of course, it has not solved every problem in the UK and the legislation put forward by Deputy Brady or whatever legislation ultimately becomes law here will not solve the problem entirely either.  There will be situations were companies will be found to be not solvent, the risk will be too great or companies will not be able to make up the difference because of profit flows in the future.  If we had the guy in here who drafted the ten commandments, he would not be able to draft legislation that would solve every problem in every instance.  What we are trying to do here is solve a particular problem, namely, that companies that can well afford to keep a defined benefit pension scheme going are deciding that it is better for their shareholders and for their profitability to just walk away from it and replace it with a defined contribution scheme, under which the employee carries all of the risk.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-09a.1805" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019050900002#H00200"><p>I will take the point on a minimum funding standard first.  I bow to the Deputy's judgment on whether legislation is required but I agree fully that it should be reviewed.  The OECD has commented to the effect that it should reflect the long-term cost of the scheme rather than a snapshot at a particular time, which does not reflect the reality of buying annuities in the event of a wind-up.  The risk reserve calculations do not make sense either and one needs flexibility on valuation dates as well.  This is a fairly technical work but it seems strange that a pension fund might not look too bad in February but by June it looks shocking because of the way the bond markets have moved.  The fluctuations are significant.</p> <p>  I still take exception to the idea that employers can just walk away from schemes and that there are no constraints on them.  The Deputy may know of companies that have done so in the past but the rate of wind-ups has declined significantly since 2014.  In that year, there were 41 wind-ups but by 2017, there were only 16 and I suspect there were even fewer in 2018.  Companies that were going to walk away from this less altruistically would have done so a long time ago.  There were 1,200 schemes 12 years ago and now there are 611 schemes, according to the latest data.  Most of these companies have gone.  They have moved out and those that remain are generally very well established, reputable companies.  They are companies of a sort and scale that they could not just treat their employees flippantly.  </p> <p>  The notion that defined benefit schemes are without risk is false.  As we have seen, they are very risky.  We have seen what happened with wind-ups where active members saw their pension promise completely decimated.  That was a risk.  The risk on the individual is more manageable.  At least the individual can manage his or her own risk.  However, he or she must be educated and advised on how to address this.  This relates to another issue which I hope this committee will get a chance to deliberate on, namely auto-enrolment.  Hopefully, we will see a lot more employees with their defined contribution pots accumulating.  How that is going to be managed is important, especially as 65% of private sector workers do not have a pension at all.  There will be issues relating to education, the cost of advice and a range of other matters in the context of mitigating individual risks and making sure that people are informed.</p></speech>
