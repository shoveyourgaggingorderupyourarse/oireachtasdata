Apologies have been received from Deputy MacSharry.  I welcome members to our online meeting.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.</p> <p>  I ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure we are adhering to this constitutional requirement.  We are also joined remotely by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee.  I ask all those in attendance to mute themselves when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  I also ask that members use the button to raise their hands when they wish to contribute and to take it down again when they have done so.  As usual, I ask members to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The business before us today is as follows: minutes; accounts and statements; correspondence; the draft work programme; and any other business.</p> <p>  The first items of business are the minutes of the meetings of 31 March, 20 April and 21 April, which have been circulated to members.  Do Members wish to raise any matters relating to the minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee&rsquo;s web page. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#A00500"><p>The next item is accounts and financial statements.  The following six sets of financial statements and accounts were laid before the D&aacute;il between between 26 April and 7 May 2021: the National Museum of Ireland; the Loughs Agency, which is a North-South body; Public Trustee Ireland, which was established under the Land Act 1903; National University of Ireland, Maynooth; the Account of the Receipt of Revenue of the State collected by the Revenue Commissioners; and the Digital Hub Development Agency.  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued clear audit opinions for all six but drew attention to a number of areas, which I will ask him to address before opening the floor to Members.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to come in at this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#A00600"><p>The first thing to point out is that three of the sets of financial statements on the list this morning relate to 2019 and three relate to periods of account ending in 2020.  The most significant one is the Account of the Receipt of Revenue of the State collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  This has a through put of &euro;82 billion in revenues.  As the Chairman mentioned, there is a clear audit opinion.  There are clear audit opinions regarding the other accounts.  In respect of the National University, Maynooth, for 2019-2020, I draw attention to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset.  That is a standard reference that I include in respect of universities.  In respect of the 2019 financial statements of the Digital Hub Development Agency, I drew attention to a note in the accounts where the agency discloses that it paid a vacant site levy, which was charged by Dublin City Council, in respect of a site that had not been developed.  The expenditure amounted to &euro;227,500 in respect of 2019 and &euro;97,500 in respect of 2018.</p> <p>  I signed in respect of the Digital Hub Development Agency on 29 June 2020.  It has only been presented as of 30 April.  That is longer than is allowed for in the circular.  The committee may want to pursue that.  I signed in respect of the accounts of the National Museum of Ireland for 2019 on 29 October 2020.  Again, that is late for submission.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#A00700"><p>I wish to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General about two sets of accounts.  In respect of the accounts of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, I do not know whether the Comptroller and Auditor General would have looked at the difference between the number of staff from year to year or whether it would have shown up.  One thing that caused the last Committee of Public Accounts concern was a large number of people on very temporary contracts over a protracted period of time.  Would that show up in respect of a change in the numbers or is it something to which the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General was drawn?</p> <p>  My second question relates to the Revenue Commissioners and bogus self-employment.  I do not know if the income streams would draw our attention to that particular component but it strikes me that the Revenue Commissioners are a place for us to go in respect of that topic when we deal with it.  They have done that in the House of Commons in respect of the likes of the BBC.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#A00800"><p>In respect of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth and speaking from memory, there would be figures in the account disclosing the number of employees.  I cannot recall off hand if there has been a change.  We can certainly check that and come back to the Deputy in respect of the numbers disclosed.</p> <p>  On the Account of Receipt of Revenue of the State collected by the Revenue Commissioners, PRSI receipts are collected by Revenue and are accounted for through this account so it is something the Deputy can discuss with Revenue.</p><p>We are continuing to look at that issue because it is a significant matter of public interest.  If I have anything further to report on it, I will report on it in October, but as of now I do not plan to report anything specifically regarding it.  One point that I did note in looking at the accounts is that the impact of Covid on PRSI receipts seems to have been different from the impact on income.  There may be something there that would be of interest to the committee to pursue for further explanations.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#B00300"><p>I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for presenting these accounts to us.  I wish to ask him about the Digital Hub Development Agency and the qualification he made about the vacant site levy.  Could he elaborate a little bit more on where that site is and how come it came to be flagged?  Has this issue arisen previously or is this a new issue facing the agency?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#B00400"><p>I am sorry for the delay in replying.  The vacant site is part of the land that the agency owns in the Liberties.  It is in Dublin city centre.  The determination on the site was first identified in 2018.  The levy is payable in arrears.  It approached &euro;100,000 in 2018 and that was recorded in the 2018 financial statements, but the payment was much more significant in 2019 at &euro;227,500.  I would have expected that the payment was going to continue because the agency flagged that it did not have the resources at that stage to develop the site and therefore its expectation was that the site levy would continue to be paid.  The agency stated that the Department is conducting a strategic review of the agency and any property development plans will depend on the outcome of the review.  There has been publicity recently about the determination to wind up the agency in due course.</p></speech>

Depending on how long the review may take and its outcome, it is important that we might seek to put the agency on our upcoming work programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#B00600"><p>I thank Deputy Devlin.  Could we agree and note the accounts and statements in the usual way?  Agreed.  They will be published as part of the minutes.</p> <p>  No. 3 is correspondence.  Items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions, and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee's meetings and published on the committee's web page.</p> <p>  The first category of correspondence under which Members have flagged items for discussion is category B - correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings.  We will deal with matters held over for consideration in public from the meetings on 31 March, 21 April, and 28 April, as well as some recent items.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 459 B is from Ms Orla Flynn, president, Galway Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, dated 22 March 2021 providing information requested by the committee following a proposal from Deputy Dillon concerning ring-fenced funding for GMIT's Mayo campus.  A working group was established in early 2017 to develop a plan to ensure a sustainable future for the Mayo campus arising from concerns about its financial viability.  At our meeting on 31 March we agreed to note and publish this item and we held it over for consideration in public.  We also agreed to request further information from GMIT, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  The responses that relate to the matter are Nos. 547, 536, and 548, respectively, and they are also before us today.</p> <p>  In correspondence No. 536, the HEA states that a review of the implementation of the plan set out in the working group's report, Developing a Sustainable Plan for the Mayo Campus of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, which was published in late 2017, is currently under way.  The proposal before the committee is to request a copy of that review, once it has been completed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  This matter has been flagged for discussion by Deputies Dillon, Carthy and Munster.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#B00700"><p>Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to discuss this, Chairman.  The response from GMIT to the Committee of Public Accounts was in some way disappointing and highlights the concerns I have on the problems with the GMIT Mayo campus.  In its response, GMIT only makes reference to one recommendation, No. 31, in which GMIT seeks time-bound, ring-fenced funding to allow its plan to be fully implemented to ensure future sustainability of the campus.  The working group's report contained 32 other recommendations that were equally important.  It is widely known on the ground that communication between the Mayo and Galway campuses is somewhat strained and needs work.</p> <p>  Recently, I was delighted to see that Justin Kerr was appointed as the new vice president, VP, of the GMIT Mayo campus and also as the head of the newly established school of health science and well-being.  That is an important appointment.  There are significant opportunities for the Mayo campus as presented by the publication in October 2017 of Developing a Sustainable Plan for the Mayo Campus of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.  Central to that was new programme development to increase student numbers.  That is important and significant.  Also of importance is the reference to the further implementation of the new retention strategy.  It is important to differentiate GMIT's offerings in multi-campus sites to increase demand.  We have not had the necessary leadership and drive to ensure that we have multidisciplinary offerings at the Mayo campus, which is seen as a drain on resources by the GMIT governing board.  I accept that a deficit of &euro;1.6 million was identified in 2017 but, let us be honest, that could have been solved in the lifetime of the report of the working group with a clear and strategic approach by the governing board, with a suite of new offerings that could grow the numbers at the Mayo campus.  It would have required new programmes to be introduced that reflect the social, economic and business sectors within the region.  That is important to note.</p> <p>  I welcome the establishment of the new GMIT school led by the Mayo campus for nursing, health science and social care, but all the graduates will be put back into the public service on the basis of the undergraduate programmes that are being developed.  What we now need is a commitment by the governing board, staff, external stakeholders and the wider region to focus on the sustainable model that is required to drive numbers in the Mayo campus.  The HEA, as the lead authority, has a significant part to play.  I know an independent review is currently under way and Mazars is also working with GMIT on this.  The review was due for publication in March, but it has been delayed until May.  We still have not received justification for the delay.  I look forward to the publication of the review.  It is important that it gives a clear understanding of the response that is needed from the Mayo campus and how it outlines the &euro;3.75 million that was ring-fenced over five years to ensure that the campus is vibrant and represents a major opportunity for Mayo.  This must work.  Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this topic, Chairman.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#C00100"><p>We have received a fair amount of correspondence on that matter.  The gap does seem to be closing or at least was indicative of closing but we still see significant shortfalls in the Mayo campus every year.  Am I right in saying that the HEA is still listed for our programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#C00200"><p>It is on the work programme.  We will come to it afterwards.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#C00400"><p>We can do so.  We can ask the clerk to incorporate it into the invite.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#C00500"><p>Not to repeat what has been said, I agree with Deputy Munster that this requires further scrutiny.  Looking at the expenditure per student, which is slightly higher for the Mayo campus than it would be for the main campus in Galway, it appears that there is a black hole somewhere and a lack of strategy in terms of resources for the Mayo campus.  It would be prudent if we were to follow this up again because clearly Deputy Dillon has outlined the benefits of having a strong institute within the Mayo region.  It is clearly an area that would benefit from having such a strong cohort of a student body so it is crucial that this committee ensures that there is correct oversight to ensure that level of expenditure is being spent in a way that allows for the campus on Castlebar to expand and become more central to the overall workings of the GMIT group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#C00600"><p>The spend per student can throw one sometimes.  An issue I raised with regard to the National University of Ireland, Maynooth is the fact that very often the precarious nature of junior or part-time lecturers might skew the spend.  When we look at that, we must look at the reason for it.  That was quite a sizeable issue.  Primary school teachers have far more rights than people at entry level in universities.  It is a constant source of criticism.  Sometimes there is an hour of research and an hour of lecturing.  It does not improve the output in terms of the quality of what is happening in some of our universities.  Some of it relates to the precarious nature of the employment.  If we are talking to the HEA, we must include this issue when it comes to drilling down and understanding what is happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#C00700"><p>A review of the sustainable plan published in late 2017 is under way.  It is proposed that we request a copy of that once the review is completed.  It has also been proposed by Deputy Munster that when the HEA appears before us, we would include that item on the agenda.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Item 463 B is correspondence from Mr. Maurice Buckley, Chairman of the Office of Public Works, dated 23 March 2021, providing information requested by the committee regarding Miesian Plaza.  At our meeting on 31 March, we agreed to note and publish this item and held it over for consideration in public.  It concerns an impending loss of about &euro;10 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money due to the OPW&rsquo;s mismeasurement of floor space at Miesian Plaza, which is now the headquarters of the Department of Health.  The committee requested an update regarding the OPW&rsquo;s engagement with the landlord.  The OPW states that it has sought a video conference with the landlord but that: </p> <blockquote> 	The Landlord has responded confirming that while they wish to engage constructively with the OPW, their preference is to have a further face to face meeting once this is permissible under Covid-19 restrictions and it is safe for all to attend.  The OPW agree that such a meeting would be more beneficial/productive and it is intended to arrange this meeting as soon as possible.   </blockquote> <p>The proposal is to note and publish this item.  We have another item of correspondence from the OPW regarding the development at Military Road, which we will come to shortly.  The item was flagged by Deputy Catherine Murphy and Deputy Munster.  </p></speech>

We must keep on top of this.  Most of us are managing to do business over Zoom.  I am concerned that the idea of this having to be a face-to-face meeting is prolonging this.  The important thing is that this is resolved without going down the legal route, which could end up being counterproductive in terms of the overall cost, but it will feature in our report.</p></speech>

Governments, courts and businesses all over the world are conducting their business via videoconference and the OPW seems to be saying that it is unable to do so.  All the while, the taxpayer is continuing to overpay for the OPW's mistake.  For months, the OPW has been telling us that it would shortly be engaging with the landlord.  It is increasingly appears as if the OPW is simply hoping we will lose interest and it will go away.  The response is a joke.</p></speech>

I am concerned when something like this is allowed to drag on.  I wonder whether the other side is just hoping the OPW will go away.  This is what it sounds like to me.  The OPW should be trying to put a timeline on this because there is no timeline here, which concerns me.</p></speech>

This is just an indication that the OPW is a very weak negotiating position because it finalised a contract under which, as Deputy Munster noted, the Irish taxpayer is footing the bill for a very serious if not elemental mistake made by the OPW regarding this building.</p><p>It is not good enough to say that this type of meeting cannot take place on the same basis as every other meeting that has taken place for the past 12 months, if necessary.  The lifting of restrictions allows for some physical meetings to take place.

The clerk will write to the Chairman of the OPW requesting that OPW meet with the landlord, in whatever form, as soon as possible and respond to this committee on the matter within a four-week period.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p><b></b>No. 464B is from Ms Rachel Downes, chief executive officer, Caranua, dated 23 March 2021, providing information relating to the recent wind-down of Caranua.  Following a proposal by Deputy Munster, we had requested that Caranua respond to the committee on behalf of certain survivors but Caranua was wound down before the responses were received.  </p><p>At our meeting of 31<sup></sup>March we agreed to note and publish this item and held it over for consideration in public.  We also agreed to request that the Department of Education clarify how Caranua's work will now proceed, provide a timeframe for legislation and an update on progress resolving outstanding cases, and the responses requested on behalf of certain survivors.  That response is No. 519B from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education, dated 19 April 2021.  The Secretary General provides an outline of the role and work of Caranua, the current position following the expiration of the term of office of the board, and how the Department intends to address the committee&rsquo;s request for a substantive response on behalf of three survivors.  The letter states that the Department&rsquo;s legal advice is that there is no lawful basis for the provision by the Department of the information requested by the committee.  Notwithstanding this, the Department is pursuing this matter and has given an undertaking to contact the individuals concerned, and with their consent, to work to address the issues raised on their behalf by the committee and to revert to the committee in due course.</p><p>I understand that the secretariat has been in contact with Deputy Munster&rsquo;s office and in light of the commitment given by the Department, I propose that we allow the Department to complete this work and we will consider the matter again when we receive an update from the Department. Is that agreed?  This item was flagged by Deputies Munster and Catherine Murphy.  I invite Deputy Munster to comment.</p></speech>

The survivors provided Caranua with permission to engage with us at the last committee hearing and Caranua acknowledged in that committee that it was familiar with those cases.  I am not at all satisfied with the Department's response either.  It appears to be hiding behind the same practice as Caranua in claiming to be flexible in the interests of survivors.  The Department mentioned the pre-approval process and the requirement for additional paperwork, yet Caranua told us it was its practice to be flexible with regard to the number of quotes received, for example.  That was the case with the outstanding cases we dealt with.</p> <p>  The Department's response is cold insofar as the people we are speaking about are survivors of institutional abuse.  Redress should not be denied on the basis of paperwork or a lack of paperwork.  The Department references that all of the time, as Caranua has done, and it has stated that it is satisfied with the appeals process.  There are many survivors that are not satisfied.  I hope that if the Department proposes to look into this matter, its investigation will be thorough and it will see fit to address the outstanding cases.  To say that it is in respect of those particular cases the survivors believe Caranua let them down is an understatement.  They are very real and the Department needs to sort this out.  The remainder of the funding rolled back.  This matter needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the Department is splitting hairs in terms the permission given to allow the committee members to discuss the matter with Caranua before it expired.  It may be a fine legal point, I do not know.  Perhaps that is the argument it is making.  In any case, we need to pursue the matter.  The letters of consent are helpful.  We will come back to the matter.  I note Deputy Catherine Murphy is indicating.</p></speech>

In regard to the Department of Education, we had all expected that it would bring forward legislation winding down Caranua.  As yet, that has not happened.  This matter will drag on until that happens.  In the meantime, what happens to the files and can people have access to their records?  I ask that the committee secretariat would check that with the Department.</p> <p>  The learnings from this process are important.  One the key issues is that in the future compensation should be on a mandatory rather than voluntary basis.  That compensation is not mandatory is part of the problem.  In other scenarios, we saw the Department of Education take years to bring in the assets that were to fund some of the compensation schemes.  There needs to be some learning as a consequence of this process, including how Caranua functioned.  Other reasonable questions are who carried out the evaluation, and what were the terms of reference for it.  There needs to be a degree of closure from our point of view.  We need to be able to point to what did not work and what could work should something like this happen again.</p></speech>

The indications are that it is not likely to go to pre-legislative scrutiny until this autumn, which is some time away yet.  It is proposed that we allow the Department to complete its work and that we will consider the matter again when we have received an update on it.  This is as much as we can do for now, but we do need to push for the legislation to wind up Caranua to be brought before the House.  That legislation is some way off yet.  At best, it will be brought forward by the end of this year.</p><p>No. 466B is a reply from the Department of Education about school accommodation at Gaelscoil an tSl&iacute; D&aacute;la in County Laois.  At our meeting on 31 March, we agreed to note and publish this item and hold it over for consideration in public.  We made a recommendation regarding the use of temporary accommodation in our report on our engagement with the Department and I want to bring this item to members' attention because it really highlights the lack of value for money when schools rent prefabricated units over a protracted period.  As set out in the correspondence, the rental cost for one prefab between 2008 and 2020 was &euro;177,000.  After studying that brief, one could buy multiple prefabs for &euro;177,000.  These are single rooms.  Another cost &euro;152,000.  Separately, three prefabs were bought outright and given that the average cost of those three was &euro;49,000, three or four could have been purchased for the cost of each that was rented.  These cost a substantial amount.  A table came with this correspondence and if one looks at prefab 1, rented in 2005, and prefab 2, rented in 2007, the rent came to &euro;249,622.  In 2010, a new prefab, which was superior in quality, was bought for &euro;38,000.  We must take it from this that in 2005, it would have been cheaper and may only have been &euro;30,000.  Even assuming that it was &euro;38,000, there is a significant disparity in cost and it shows the insanity of the rental and lease of prefabs over a long period.</p><p> Unfortunately, Gaelscoil an tSl&iacute; D&aacute;la is still in the same situation in that it is still housed in a number of prefabs.  The Gaelscoil has been successful.  It has 48 pupils in a rural area, servicing south Laois and north Tipperary but it needs permanent accommodation.  It was given permanent status three years ago.  It is in a position now where it has the potential of a permanent site.  We might write back to the Department to highlight that the school is in urgent need of that accommodation because the original prefabs that were rented are not in good condition.  We need to move on with that.  I propose, with the committee's agreement, that we write back and request that in view of the money spent on rental compared with purchase of prefabs, that we would now move, as there is potential for a permanent site, to providing a new building on that site.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> No. 476B from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, dated 24 March 2021, provides further information requested by the committee about the practice of "bond surrenders" by local authorities.  At our meeting of 31 March, we agreed to note and publish this item and held it over for consideration in public.  We have forwarded the response to the correspondent who raised the matter and we also agreed that the correspondent would submit related information, which they had offered to the committee, and sought their consent to forward it to the Department for consideration.</p><p> The following related correspondence was received since our previous meeting.  No. 544B from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, dated 30 April 2021, providing further information requested by the committee in relation to the practice known as "bond surrender".  The Department has committed to reporting on the extent of the use of bond surrender by local authorities and will report back to the committee on this matter.  Regarding the difficulties identified by local authorities, I propose that we request that the Department incorporate potential solutions in the report it is planning to compile on the issue and provide the committee with a copy of the report.  I also propose that we also forward this item to the correspondent who raised the matter and note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> We received two letters on that, Nos. 476 and 544, and what concerned me about it was that even with a template set out in appendix 1, which states that while the Department is not aware of any mechanism that would compel a developer to renew a bond, the standardised template for bonds issued through the County and City Management Association in 2018 as best practice includes a clause that requires a developer to provide six months notice to a local authority prior to the expiration of a bond.  It states that failure to provide this notice would result in the bond remaining in full force until such time as the six months notice is given.  In this way, the bond cannot expire without the knowledge of the local authority.  That sounds good but I have had a number of bad experiences in trying to deal with this issue of bonds.  That does not stop the bond from expiring, especially if it is an insurance bond.  Developers simply have to notify the local authority and if they fail to do it, that is one opt-out clause, and they can also allow the bond to lapse and simply notify the local authority of their intention to do so.  Deputy Catherine Murphy raised this.  We should be concerned about the fact that we do not have a proper template in place for dealing with this issue of bonds by developers of housing estates.</p></speech>

It can delay the estate being taken in charge when it is not completed.  It is a significant issue.  This is a useful reply.  It indicates that there were 20 responses.  There are 37 local authorities now.  We should look for a complete response since 20 responses is not sufficient, although it is useful to see that it has not occurred in those 20 responses.  It was even more useful to see the difficulties that local authorities themselves are facing, such as unnotified expiration of bonds.  I have certainly come across that with, for example, the extension of duration of planning permissions.</p> <p>  The only bonds that were ever offered in perpetuity were Anglo Irish Bank bonds bbut they were not worth the paper they were written on and they ended up being at the end of the list of unsecured creditors.  That further exposed people where the estate was not completed.  Many of the bonds are only offered for seven years.  One may be at snag list stage, the estate may not be fully completed, or it may be a large estate.  The adequacy of bonds is another matter.  These are all issues that have to go back to the Department to make sure that protections are there for people who buy their homes and have an expectation that those systems are robust enough to deal with that.</p> <p>  It is perfectly legitimate for developers to have their bonds partially returned if the estate has been concluded as it was planned.  None of us would have an issue with that.  For example, difficulties with developers obtaining bonds should be a concern for us because that is an impediment to the compliance for construction and output of new houses.  There are a number of issues.  The other issue is that it does not differentiate between developers who are compliant or not.  Local authorities often look for a cash bond where they had a non-compliant developer.  The history of a developer does not seem to translate from one local authority to another.  Somebody who had done a terrible job in Kildare could go on to develop an estate in county Cork or Kerry without bringing that history along.</p><p>Each local authority is almost a satellite from that point of view.  What must be examined from a national point of view is how to have a register that will ensure we get good quality developments and that protections are in place for people.  We should ask the Department exactly how it intends to address the issues that the local authorities have identified as shortcomings in this system because we must ensure that it is remedied.  It is very useful that it has been brought to our attention.</p></speech>

There certainly must be a register in that regard.  We can highlight that to the Department, but the response in appendix A is concerning.  It states that the Department is not aware of any mechanism that would compel a developer to renew a bond and goes on to refer to the standardised template attached.  That shows the system is still deficient and that we have learned nothing from the outcome of the so-called housing boom in the 2000s whereby local authorities were left trying to find the money to finish estates.  The Department had to come up with some money to make some estates safe, as there were immediate safety issues that had to be addressed.  The concerning thing in this reply is that we still do not have a system in place that is watertight in compelling developers to have the work done before it is returned and to ensure the bond is a real bond and not hung on a wing and a prayer as an insurance bond that may not have proper terms and conditions attached to it.</p></speech>

The builders have a responsibility, but the local authorities have a responsibility as well.  For example, if one contacts a local authority and asks for a register of estates that are not taken in charge, I guarantee one would not be able to get that register.  I am dealing with a local authority at present.  I wrote to the local authority and I was advised that it is waiting for Irish Water to refer back to it as there were certain things that had to be finished by Irish Water.  My office then wrote to Irish Water and found that the local authority had made no contact of any description with the company about the taking in charge of the estate.  When I looked back over this I found the local authority has been dealing with the taking in charge of the estate since 2008.  It still has not been taken in charge even though the local authority has drawn down the bond fully.  The residents, therefore, cannot get certain work done on the estate because it has not been taken in charge.  Why does it take 12 years for a local authority to take an estate in charge when it has drawn down the bond?</p> <p>  Let us refer back to the local authorities and ask them if they keep a register of estates that are not taken in charge and if they have a programme set out as regards the end game.  If one starts building an estate today and one takes out a bond, that bond is valued at the cost of completing the estate at the time one starts building the estate or within a reasonable time period of two to three years.  However, if there are any delays by the local authority in pursuing the builder, the bond is no longer sufficient to cover that cost.  That is the reason we should ask local authorities to have a register of estates that are not taken in charge and the timeframe.</p></speech>

It is not just a register; they also have a list of progress written down beside each estate, the current position and what the next steps are.  The councillors in the functional area of a local authority need to ask that question.  If the local authority was supposed to make a request to Irish Water and did not make it, the members of the local authority at district meetings and full meetings of the county council must hold the executive of the council to account, ask why that is not happening and why the council does not have a register.  I am open to correction on this, but the local authorities I have dealt with have a full list of estates to be taken in charge and the current status of the estates.  One can seek regular updates on them quite easily.</p></speech>

Questions need to be asked of the local authority in question as to what progress is being made.  Regular reports on it can be sought at district meetings or full meetings of the county council.  They are sought in other county councils.</p></speech>

What is proposed is that we forward this correspondence to the correspondent who raised the matter.  In view of the discussion, I propose that we write to the Department and point out to it that the responses would indicate that the bond system still appears to be not tight enough and that there are potential weaknesses in it.  Deputy Catherine Murphy suggested that there would also be a register of developers in the State so that where developers have not completed work on an estate and have applied for planning permission in another local authority area, it would show up at that point.  The third issue flagged by Deputy Colm Burke is that we ask the Department what procedures are in place to monitor the progress local authorities are making regarding the taking in charge of estates.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 477B is from Mr. Feargal Hartnett, government accounting unit, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 24 March 2021, providing the minute of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform relating to recent Committee of Public Accounts reports.  These are important items of correspondence as they address the reports and recommendations of the committee.  I want to address one matter before opening the discussion to the floor.  While the majority of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations have been accepted or partly accepted, one has been rejected.  It relates to a recommendation to the Department that was made in the committee&rsquo;s report on its engagement with the Department of Education.  We recommended that "the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform ensures the reasons for delays in capital projects, across all Departments, are published".</p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s reason for the rejection is that it publishes regular updates on Project Ireland 2040 delivery through the capital projects tracker and myProjectIreland map, but reporting on delays on capital projects seems to be a best practice suggestion rather than a requirement.  The Department states that: "It is up to Departments to report on delays in delivery on an individual project level and to update the tracker with this information on a regular basis".  Given that it also states that the tracker is intended to be the: &ldquo;primary tool for public transparency on infrastructure project priorities, timelines and performance targets&rdquo;, I propose that we write to the Department and request that it makes the timely updating of the tracker in terms of both costs and time lines a requirement.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I will open the discussion to members in respect of any of the other responses to the committee's recommendations that they might wish to address.</p><p>This item was flagged by Deputies Catherine Murphy, Carthy and Munster.  I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

Members are aware of countless anecdotes of build delays in every county.  These delays can be the cause of significant consternation and frustration for local communities and boards of management.  The recommendation of the committee is absolutely sensible in the sense that we have asked that a proviso or a mechanism be put in place through which those delays could be explained.  I am disappointed by the rationale of the Department, which essentially states there should be best practice as opposed to it being a guideline.  I do not know whether the Chairman or the Comptroller and Auditor General can offer advice to the committee in terms of the procedure through which the committee can engage with the Department on this issue.  Should we leave it until the public hearing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or is there another mechanism through which we can engage to find a route that would allow explanations to be received in respect of situations where, in my view, they are absolutely warranted?</p></speech>

The committee proposed that we write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and request that it makes it a requirement to have a timely updating of the tracker in terms of both costs and timelines.  We are asking the Department to address it there, if that is agreed, and if the committee wishes to include that item when we have the Department in, that can be done.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 481 is correspondence from the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, dated 28 February 2021.  It accedes to the committee&rsquo;s request for an independent investigation with regard to the operation of voluntary mess committees in the Irish Prison Service.  We previously agreed to note and publish this item.  The item was flagged for discussion by Deputy Munster.  </p></speech>

Briefly, as time has elapsed, can the committee write to the Department seeking an update on and a timeframe for the report?  The correspondence is good in the sense that it is confirmation that the Department will carry out a review or an investigation into the matters that were raised by the committee with regard to strange and questionable financial practices within the prison service.  It is proof, if ever proof was needed, that we should not shy away from raising matters with witnesses.  The Department clearly sees merit in what was raised.  The correspondence was sent in February, so perhaps we should follow up with the Department and seek an update and  an expected timeframe.</p></speech>

We will ask the clerk to the committee to do that.  The fact that an investigation or an independent review is going to be carried out is welcome.  We will ask for a timeline in that regard.</p> <p>  No. 482 is correspondence from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE, dated 25 March 2021.  It provides information requested by the committee in respect of the proposed integrated financial management and procurement system, IFMS.  We intend to conduct an engagement with the HSE on this project.  We will note and publish this item.  We have dealt with this issue before with the HSE.  This integrated financial management system was proposed back in 2014 and the process started at that stage.  Late last year, the committee was somewhat concerned when it came to our attention that this was not even completed at that point.  The procurement process was only awarded in 2019 and Covid has now pushed out the date to an unspecified timeline, as I noted from the correspondence I read yesterday.  We need to flag that, all of seven years later, not alone do we not have an integrated financial management system, but members will recall that when the HSE and the Department appeared before the committee, their representatives told us they would have 80% of the procurement spend brought into a process such as this by 2024.  That 2024 date seems to have gone out the window and there is now no date by which that will be done.`</p> <p>  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I consider that response totally unsatisfactory and I am very concerned about it.  We have been through the Covid emergency but the fact that the HSE has done away with any attempt to put a final date in place or to have any kind of benchmark or staging post by which stage progress would be made on this has nearly left this on the never-never.  I propose that we revisit this issue with the Department, its new Secretary-General and the HSE.  This situation is totally unsatisfactory.  I could not believe it when the matter came before the committee last year and we were made aware no progress had been made in the six years since the process had started.  It has now been seven years since the process started and even the very distant staging post of having 80% progress made by 2024 has now been deleted.  That is not acceptable.  Deputy Carthy wishes to comment on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#G01200"><p>I wish to address the 2019 procurement review.  I am really frustrated by the manner in which this line of correspondence with the HSE is going.  It has been asked by the Committee of Public Accounts on several occasions to clarify the status of this procurement review, which was apparently paused in 2019, and address whether it was actually cancelled.  This correspondence indicates that the 2019 review was paused and that it then resumed but focused entirely on 2020.  To me, this spells that the 2019 review has been cancelled.  This is important because this is the first year in which this type of procurement review has been conducted.   As members know, 2020 was a unique year for all Departments, but particularly for the HSE.  We need the 2019 procurement review to be completed in order to have an adequate baseline and base year with which to compare future years.  I am not satisfied that just having the HSE appear before the committee will resolve anything because I think its representatives will run down the clock on this issue.  We need to ask them in writing exactly what the status of the 2019 procurement review is and what the intentions are to resume that review this year.  We are talking about hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money and there needs to be a full appraisal of whether the procurement process is working in order to ensure we are getting best value.  That is my proposal.</p></speech>

With regard to the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General in terms of looking at such significant spend and not having an integrated system, what does that present in terms of the issues or problems?  We know the HSE has a significant staff and spend.  The past year showed the kind of exposure from not having systems in place in terms of not being able to achieve value for money, with various parts of an organisation doing different things.  I am curious to hear what difference it would make.  I refer to the time it has taken for this to be put in place.  I appreciate that funding for some aspects of this was not made available for some time, but how is it possible even to do a comparison?</p></speech>

We could look at samples in particular areas but we could not extrapolate as to the total scale of the problem.  We certainly knew it was extensive because, as we did samples in different areas in different years, we were finding 30%, 40% and 50% of procurement was not compliant with the guidelines.  There is a difficulty in knowing the implication of that in terms of the value for money that is being delivered.  We certainly know we did not have sufficient assurance that good value was being obtained.</p> <p>  The work being done in respect of the 2019 procurement was being done in the early part of 2020.  It literally got blown away by the pandemic emergency.  That work was ceased.  I am not even sure those responsible can profitably or usefully go back and recommence that work and complete it.  The year 2020 will not be a typical year.  There are obviously issues around procurement and we are currently looking at some of those in the context of the 2020 annual financial statements.</p> <p>  The hope would be that better systems of oversight by the procurement function within the HSE can be put in place at a current date and as we move forward.  Retrospectively we know there has been a significant problem.  We want assurance and we need assurance this will not continue to be the case.</p></speech>

I propose we write to the new Secretary General of the Department with regard to the delay in putting an integrated financial management system in place.  I believe it is a major area of concern and a major spend if the systems are not in place.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has outlined that the HSE operates several different systems throughout the State.  When the officials were before the committee, they outlined to us the difficulties in terms of trying to track or monitor anything.  The request would be that we write to the new Secretary General requesting that the matter be expedited and ask for the organisation to come back with a more realistic timeframe.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 491 is from Ms Mary Ellen Ring, chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  It is dated 30 March and provides further information requested by the committee regarding the Garda College in Templemore and the use of EU funds.  While the investigation has been ongoing for some time and appears to be concluding, a definitive date is not provided.  The chairperson points to the fact there are 40 investigators and 15,000 members of the force.  GSOC opened 485 criminal investigations in 2019 and this figure is likely to increase in 2020.  Although not specifically stated, it appears GSOC may be under-resourced.  Previously we agreed to note and publish the correspondence and request that the chairperson clarify whether she believes GSOC is adequately resourced.  The item was flagged by Deputy Carthy and Deputy Murphy.  Deputy Carthy will comment.</p></speech>

The delay with this particular investigation in respect of the infamous Templemore funds is frustrating.  I understand it is a live investigation so I will not say anything more in that regard.</p> <p>  I will also comment on the apparent contraction in respect of the level of staff in place.  It might be a consideration for us to invite GSOC representatives before the committee as part of our work programme.  I believe it would make for a useful engagement.  GSOC carries out important work with various reports in terms of its effectiveness.  It would be useful if we could include that for consideration.  I would ask that this would be included on the list of items we might consider in the upcoming months.</p></speech>

I suggest the secretariat, when corresponding with GSOC would ask whether the commission has the figure for the number of criminal investigations in 2020.  The document gives the figure of 485 for criminal investigations for 2019.  I was surprised by that in a service where there are 15,000 members.  We will seek a figure for 2020.  It is noted that the figure is likely to increase.</p> <p>  No. 503B is from Mr. Ian Black, interim chief executive of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, and is dated 9 April 2021.  It provides information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with the SBCI on 9 March.  Further questions were responded to in correspondence No. 518B.  The SBCI states both items contain commercially sensitive information.  We agreed to write back to the SBCI to ask that the corporation indicate which aspects of the two items received are commercially sensitive.  We have since received that information.  We can see that in the correspondence.</p> <p>  No. 532B is also from Mr. Ian Black, interim chief executive of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, and is dated 27 April 2021.  It relates to the substantive response.  We have agreed to consider and identify further areas for follow-up.  I call on members to be mindful of the commercially sensitive information involved when addressing the items of correspondence.</p> <p>  We have a further 15 items of correspondence that we have to go through.  We are approximately one third of the way through them.  I appeal to members to be mindful of that in trying to work through the papers before us this morning.

Following on from our interaction with the SBCI, I had asked questions on the agricultural cash flow schemes in terms of regional breakdowns and where loans were issued.

We need to have the aged debtor analysis.  The whole point in discussing this is to ensure the money was spent on what it was intended to be spent on.  The target was the small and medium-sized business sector to fill a gap in terms of ensuring adequate funding sources were available.</p> <p>  I do not believe Bibby Financial Services has answered the question relating to the transfer of money.  In December 2019, &euro;45 million out of &euro;60 million was lent to the company by the SBCI with the balance from HSBC.  This was used to replace borrowing from Barclays.  Is that true or not true?  I am keen to see that specifically answered.  We are awaiting a further response.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#J00200"><p>I will be as brief as possible but this is a very important issue.  A private company has received substantial funds for carrying out a service that is not actually being delivered, namely, the doctor on call and out of hours service in the south.  The committee members may recall that Deputy Thomas Gould had corresponded with the committee on the impact this is having on the Deputy's constituents.  As a result, the committee corresponded with the HSE.  I am very surprised by what can only be described as a very soft response from the HSE.  We are talking here about public health services and substantial funds of money invested.  In the HSE briefing there are references to using mechanisms within the service arrangements, but there is no indication as to what these might be or how developed they are.  I suggest the committee advise the HSE that we wish to speak with it on the matter when the HSE representatives come before the committee in the coming weeks, and to ask for a more substantive response on how the HSE intends to account for this.  It indicates the HSE was advised, following a board of directors meeting on 30 March, that the Blackpool and Listowel treatment centres would remain closed for the duration of level 5 restrictions.  Level 5 is, essentially, over now, so the people of those communities deserve answers on when their services will be delivered.  More importantly, this committee deserves answers on how we are spending money on a contract that is not being fulfilled.</p></speech>

It is very limited opening but we should seek clarification on that.</p></speech>

The service has been closed for a substantial period in Listowel and in Cork.  We will follow through on that.</p><p>No. 535 B from Ms Vivienne Flood, head of public affairs at RT&Eacute;, dated 28 April 2021, provides information to the committee following the meeting on 27 April 2021.  For members&rsquo; information, this is separate to the follow-up information arising from the meeting that has been requested by the secretariat and which will come before the committee in due course.</p><p>I should put on the record that Ms Flood wishes to clarify two matters raised at the meeting.  On the first matter, Ms Flood said in her correspondence that:</p> <blockquote> 	In response to a question raised as to the number of individuals who had been offered employment by RT&Eacute;, Ms Eimear Cusack incorrectly stated that three individuals did not accept contracts of employment and had left the organisation.  By way of clarification, two of those individuals are no longer with the organisation.  The third individual was designated an employee in that they continued to work for RT&Eacute; with all relevant statutory entitlements being applied. </blockquote> <p>Ms Flood wished to clarify a second matter and said in her correspondence that:</p> <blockquote> 	Further to a question raised by Deputy Murphy as regards a recent settlement on a defamation claim, Ms Forbes stated that the cost of the payment in question had [come] through a claim on our own insurance.  On this occasion that was not in fact the case since the amount was below the insurance reserve within our policy. </blockquote> <p>We will note and publish this item and I will open the floor to members for further consideration.  We had raised the issue of the Eversheds report with the RT&Eacute; representatives.  The members will note that 36% of workers were misclassified as being self-employed, but actually had all of the conditions that would be deemed necessary for employment.</p><p>In answer to a question I asked the witnesses, it was said that RT&Eacute; had made a settlement with Revenue with regard to outstanding PRSI contributions.  This was due to the fact that 36% of those workers were wrongly classified as self-employed.  Deputies Carthy, Munster and Catherine Murphy have flagged this issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.89" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021051100002#J00700"><p>On the correspondence we have received from RT&Eacute;, it appears that RT&Eacute; is being very selective in its responses.  Many other questions were posed to the witnesses that they have not responded to.  I understand that this current response is separate from the follow-up information, as the Chairman said, but I cannot see why many of the more serious matters raised are not addressed.  At the committee I had asked how many of the top earners were considered, in any of the strands of the Eversheds report, to be deemed to have attributes akin to employment or self-employment.  That question has not been fully addressed.</p> <p>  I also raised the issue of the pay disparity between workers at RT&Eacute; and at Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  Ms Forbes had agreed to carry out a review on that but we have not had anything back on it.  Perhaps the committee will follow up to seek further information.</p> <p>  When RT&Eacute; representatives were before the committee I had specifically asked the question about whether or not they were aware there was going to be a bill coming from Revenue as a result of the self-employment contracts.  I asked if RT&Eacute; had received a bill or if it anticipated a bill.  On two occasions the respondent said that they were not aware of it.  I find this absolutely shocking.  On the third attempt, in response to a question from the Chairman, the witness suddenly went from being totally unaware of a bill and being oblivious to any bill forthcoming or received, to deciding to tell us that RT&Eacute; had received a bill.  Third time lucky.  Deputy Carthy asked how much the bill was for.  None of this information is included in the correspondence.  I find it shocking.</p></speech>

The response we have today is simply a clarification on two matters that were discussed in replies given by RT&Eacute; representatives, a clarification I have just read out for members.</p> <p>  The list of questions on the issues raised at the meeting has been sent to RT&Eacute; by the secretariat, including the issues referred to by Deputy Munster just now.  We are waiting on the response to that correspondence.  We do not yet have that response but hopefully we will have it quickly.  The Deputy is correct that a number of serious items flagged at that meeting need a response.</p></speech>

A response to the question posed about how much the bill paid to Revenue was could have been included in the correspondence today.  I found it astounding that when initially asked if they were aware of a forthcoming bill from Revenue for the self-employment contracts, or whether RT&Eacute; had received a bill, twice we were told that they were not aware of any such bill.  Then, on being pressed by the Chairman, suddenly a bill had been received and RT&Eacute; was aware of it.  We need to find out about this and whether other bills are due.</p></speech>

This is the Committee of Public Accounts, we were talking about the finances of an organisation and there was a specific line of inquiry.  I expect we will receive that figure fairly quickly as it will give us a sense of whether or not our public service broadcaster is in line for even more payments down the line.</p> <p>  I asked a question about high earners and who their representative agents were.  Can I confirm that is being included in our list of questions to RT&Eacute;?  That would be useful.</p></speech>

I suggest that when writing back to RT&Eacute; we ask if, along with the settlement made to Revenue on foot of that, a settlement was made with workers in terms of PRSI entitlements and other benefits forgone by virtue of the fact they were not employed properly as employees and were wrongly employed as self employed.</p></speech>

I would be quite concerned if the threshold for settling claims is over and above &euro;20,000.  We are dealing with the public's money.  Can we ask RT&Eacute; how many of these settlements are there, or have been in the last year or two?  I asked for figures going back five years, if I am not mistaken.  Maybe someone else may be able to confirm that.  It is extraordinary that an excess would appear to be in the range of &euro;20,000 on insurance.  Maybe we could ask it about that.</p></speech>

This week the BBC initiated a new programme where it publishes the external gigs or work carried out by its employees and journalists.  In the interest of transparency, it is a very good practice.  It would be appropriate if we were to write to RT&Eacute; asking if it had any plans to do the same.  It would create transparency around some of the questions we touched on at the meeting.</p></speech>

However, it is not clear that subsequent increases in Garda numbers and changes to its operating model led to any review of the suitability of the Military Road site.</p> <p>  We will publish this and incorporate relevant material into the committee's draft report on its engagement with the OPW, which will be circulated this week.  We will take it up again next week.  This item is flagged for discussion by Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

It was not on the original list.  I drive by it quite often, or crawl by it, more accurately, because it is a very difficult site to get in and out of.  I would have thought that access alone would have excluded this particular site as there would be quite a lot of movement from this building.  This building would never have been big enough to accommodate all the staff from Harcourt Square.  How it ended up as the chosen site is mind boggling.  We must keep a very close eye on this.  The timeline is very tight.  There could be excess spend because they have to accommodate staff if the site is not completed and fitted out in time.  It still looks like a hole in the ground and it is supposed to be completed and occupied by the end of next year.  It would be a minor miracle.  We need to look at the origins of how this was selected as a site at all.  That is the big issue.</p></speech>

No. 511C is from Senator Gerard Craughwell, dated 15 April 2021.  He raised the matter with me some months ago and I suggested that he write to the committee.  The letter is requesting that the committee review a contract for a search and rescue service that has been managed by the Department of Transport.  At our meeting on 28 April, we agreed to write to the Department to request that it respond to the matters raised.</p> <p>  I remind members that this relates to a contract which may be subject to a new procurement very shortly and that in light of the EU procurement principles of fairness, equity, transparency and non-discrimination, the committee and the individual members thereof cannot express a view that indicates a preference or favour for any particular tenderer, nor tenderers of any particular EU member state.  I ask members to keep this in mind when discussing this matter.  There is a commercial sensitivity around this.</p> <p>  This item was flagged for discussion by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Matt Carthy.  The original contract certainly needs to be reviewed.</p><p>There are certainly issues in it that would raise an eyebrow or two.  It is certainly worth examining.</p></speech>

I sent on a couple of replies to parliamentary questions on a review that was done.  The structure of any procurement process will determine what will be possible.  If it is for the complete service, the possibility will obviously be excluded.  It appears it would be perfectly possible for at least part of the service to be carried out by the Air Corps.  That would seem to be prudent, but obviously there is a tender process.</p></speech>

As I understand it &mdash; I am not an expert on this &mdash; you could be talking about a sum in the region of &euro;125 million.  It is a question of what happens to the helicopters and equipment on the renewal of a contract.  It is a question we need to follow up on because there is a sizeable contract.  By no means does it involve a small amount of money.  It could have major implications.

I understand the board was requested to confirm its availability by last Tuesday but did not do so.  I asked that the clerk request confirmation not later than yesterday.  However, the board's position as of yesterday on its availability and on making the progress report available in advance of the meeting is:</p> <blockquote> 	The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is currently engaging with the Department of Health on this matter.  We are unable to confirm attendance at this time but plan to respond later on this week. </blockquote> <p>I will ask the clerk to keep Members updated on this.  It is enormously frustrating.</p><p>Members will recall that, late last year, we were looking for the progress report on the costs and completion date.  We deferred our meeting with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board until February of this year in the hope the report would be in front of us.  We did not have it.  We had the witnesses in here.  We requested the report again and we were to have it in March.  It has been long-fingered since then.  I ask that the clerk relay to those concerned that the situation is unsatisfactory and we expect this to be dealt with quickly.  We should also correspond with the new Secretary General of the Department of Health asking that he use his office to have this matter expedited.  The board is saying it is dealing with the Department on this matter.  This has been long-fingered repeatedly and the public needs answers on this issue.  We are being fobbed off on this.  Mr. Robert Watt should be requested to revert to us regarding a date for the report, both in terms of the expected final cost and a timeline for completion.  I ask the clerk to request that representatives of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board appear before this committee in the near future.</p><p>Inquiries have been made with the Department of Transport in regard to 27 May.  I will open the matter to the floor because members can see there is an issue regarding 20 May.  We cannot invite in an Accounting Officer or a Secretary General at such short notice.  He or she would have only a week, which would not would give reasonable time in which to prepare.  Members may have other suggestions for the date.  Inquiries have been made with the Department of Transport regarding 27 May.  Does any member wish to comment?  They are happy enough.</p><p>What I have outlined will take us until the end of May.  We are provisionally scheduled to engage with either the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on 6 June.  There are important matters to be dealt with in this regard.  To allow preparations to be made, I will ask members to make an input if they have suggestions.  Representatives from the Department of Foreign Affairs have not been before the committee since 2018.  Matters for examination include the appropriation account for 2019, Vote 27 - International Co-operation, and Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as chapter 8 from the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2019 &ndash; controls over humanitarian assistance funding.</p><p>Regarding the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, we could resume our consideration of its 2019 appropriation accounts, Vote 34 - Housing, Planning and Local Government, as well as the Local Government Fund and expenditure on the housing assistance payment and the rental assistance scheme, or hold a stand-alone meeting on emergency accommodation.  How do Members wish to proceed?  Some of us have requested a stand-alone session on the Local Government Fund and the expenditure on the housing assistance payment and the rental assistance scheme.  Is it agreed we continue to look for this?  I take it as agreed.  Deputy Hourigan flagged the issue of emergency accommodation.  Since no member wishes to comment on that, we will ask the clerk to include in the invitation a direction requesting a focus specifically on the Local Government Fund and the expenditure on the housing assistance payment, the rental assistance scheme and emergency accommodation.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>That concludes our consideration of the work programme.  Does anyone wish to raise any other matter?</p></speech>

I have a good number of questions and I hope I can get answers to all or most of them.  If not, I might get the replies in writing afterwards.</p> <p>  In particular, the weighing crisis is a massive issue.  I presume every coastal Deputy is inundated with calls from concerned fishermen.  Many of them are very close to the brink and are seriously worried about their future.  I have been asked to issue a request through the Oireachtas committee, although it might be difficult in this pandemic time, for us to be able to visit processing plants with representatives of the EU, the SFPA, the Department and so on to let everyone have their say.  The exact same thing is suggested for whitefish, shellfish, lobster, shrimp and crab and it would be good for them to visit co-ops in west Cork at Baltimore, Union Hall, Schull, Turk Head and Colla Pier.</p> <p>  I have the following questions and the witnesses might be able to take them down and answer as many as they can.  Does the SFPA accept that the mismanagement of this entire debacle is adding to anti-European sentiment in our country?  At face value, it was an act of madness to throw the fisheries industry into turmoil within one hour.  On 16 April, at 4 p.m., everything was normal, but at 5 p.m., nothing was normal and a new regime was in place.  Do the witnesses think this is acceptable behaviour from a regulatory body?  Has the SFPA seriously looked at how this new regime of weighing on piers is going to impact on our two main ports, Killybegs and Castletownbere, as well as the small ports in west Cork, especially for landings during the pelagic season, when a daily landing of 5,000 to 6,000 tonnes of fish is common?  It takes numerous factories weighing on their own plant or in-factory devices eight to nine hours a day to clear those fish.</p> <p>  How is the SFPA going to manage putting all landings to all plants through pier weighing when no facilities exist for that scale of throughput?  Do the witnesses accept this could lead to a serious amount of landings going elsewhere, for example, to Norway, the Shetlands or elsewhere in Scotland?  I am not just talking about Irish vessels but other EU vessels refusing to come to our ports due to the present uncertainty.  This will result in serious loss to the Irish economy.  Do the witnesses think this is acceptable?  Is the SFPA committed to restoring in-factory weighing?</p><p>Will the witnesses assure us today it is a real possibility, that it is part of the programme for Government and the Government is committed to it?  Is weighing a policy matter or solely an operational matter at this juncture?</p><p> Control and quality monitoring must be separated from the SFPA.  The events since 16 April have proven the SFPA cannot do both with fairness, as quality is secondary to control in the eyes of the SFPA.  That is despite articles stating both must be done with equal priority.  It is crazy what the officers are asking fishers to do at the pier, and this will get worse after 1 June unless somebody calls this out.</p><p> What information did the SFPA give to the EU about the system?  Why did it accept EU audit findings?  To whom did the SFPA speak prior to responding to the audit report?  Did it include fishermen, port officers or SFPA protection officers on the ground?  What measures have been put in place to limit the damage and alleviate the hardship arising from draconian measures and the withdrawal of weighing in factories on the fishing industry?</p><p> Is it true that for years prior to this happening, the fishing industry has been imploring both the SFPA and the Department to implement a code of practice governing how SFPA fisheries protection officers should interact with the industry and discharge statutory responsibilities not just in the area of enforcement but, just as significantly, in the area of certification of Irish fisheries produce in the context of health and hygiene and the provisions of safe and healthy fisheries product that is fit for human consumption.</p></speech>

As a fellow west Cork person, it is good to speak to him.  On the invitation to visit processing plants with Members of the Oireachtas or others, we have always taken meetings with the industry or Members.  I thank the Deputy for extending that offer.  The Deputy asked a significant number of questions, so if it is okay I will go back into what has happened with the revocation of the control plan.  I am aware some Deputies are very well versed on what has happened but for others there may be a large number of questions.</p> <p>  We can talk about the weighing of fish, which is a very important part of the fisheries management system.  Under EU law, the accuracy of the weighing of catches landed is the responsibility of the operator.  The law states that all wild-caught fisheries products must be weighed at landing before transport, and there are a number of potential derogations.  In 2012, the SFPA submitted and obtained Commission approval for derogations and there were five separate plans that we submitted at that point.  These were a control plan, two sampling plans and common control programmes with Belgium and France.  We consulted extensively both internally and with the Irish fishing producer organisations.</p> <p>  Under the control plan, which is what the Deputy is speaking about, from 2012 until 2021 weighing was following transport to Irish establishments and allowed once it took place in a premises, usually a processor, permitted by the SFPA for that purpose.  The weight derived would be used by fishers to make landing declarations and reckon uptake from available quota.  The European Commission decided recently to revoke this derogation for demersal and pelagic fisheries with immediate effect.</p> <p>  I will speak about how we ended up with this decision from the Commission.  It was made as it deemed the risk of industry's non-compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy as being too high.  This decision arises from an administrative inquiry the Commission requested Ireland to carry out following an audit in Ireland in 2018 aimed at monitoring the implementation of Ireland's control for pelagic fisheries.  The administrative inquiry looked at possible underdeclaration of catches in 2012 and 2016 and investigations of the same, sanctions for operators, effectiveness of the Irish sanctions system and effectiveness of the Irish control system.</p> <p>  In particular, the Commission identified that the operator did not have in place a weighing system fit for purpose and the audit identified manipulation of weighing systems.  Moreover, although it was aware of these shortcomings, Ireland did not take appropriate measures to address such non-compliance, in particular by withdrawing the permission to weigh after transport.  Consequently, the control plan did not, in the view of the Commission, minimise the risk of systematic manipulation of weighing of pelagic catches in Ireland and the underdeclaration of catches by operators.  Therefore, Ireland could not guarantee an effective control of landed quantities of catches and could not minimise the risk of non-compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy.  All of us here agree that is a policy that would lead to sustainability in our fisheries and our coastal communities.</p> <p>  The revocation centres around post-transport weighing of pelagic landings specifically.  Pelagic fish include mackerel, horse mackerel, herring, blue whiting and sprat.  Pelagic fish are landed into 11 processing plants in Ireland.  In contrast to the traditional fish boxes, these fish landings are highly mechanised, involving pumping fish ashore in bulk with a significant quantity of transport water, and there are practical challenges in trying to verify the quantity of fish involved.  It is easier to hide fish because it is harder to quantify accurately the amount of fish moving rapidly when mixed with water.  The weighing of fish and water or draining of water from fish has been an issue over many decades in Ireland and it led to the stand-alone set-up of the SFPA.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if we accept the mismanagement of this debacle or what we think is acceptable behaviour and how we would go forward.  The SFPA employs more than 150 people across the major fishing ports around the coast and in our headquarters in Clonakilty.  These colleagues are committed to fulfilling our extensive remit for sea fisheries protection and seafood safety to the highest level of governance.  In the case of our sea fisheries officers, this work can be done in difficult and challenging circumstances.  We have acknowledged there have been lessons and we are committed to addressing them, as our decision to the Commission and our capability review highlights.  We continually reappraise and build on mini-learnings, all the time working towards improving and focusing controls to manage non-compliance risks.</p> <p>  That does not answer the Deputy's next question about how the weighing will affect larger scale landings throughout the country.  The SFPA has consulted the industry about this, working on solutions relating to weighing devices, training and the questions about quality of fish.  The Deputy asked if we accept this could lead to landings going elsewhere, and that is a matter for those who are deciding where to land rather than the control authority.</p> <p>  There was a question about control and quality measuring.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority has a broad and extensive remit.  We do not just look after the regulation of the commercial sea fishing industry and fishers' compliance with the Common Fisheries Policy.  We also look after wild and farmed fish, the classification of wild and farmed mollusc areas, food trade controls, catch and health certification of Irish fish exports and the control of compliance with maritime environmentally protected areas.  We also look after infrastructure provision to facilitate fishers or vessel operators' compliance with their obligations.  We function for data provision to the State and the EU on sea fisheries activity and give advice to the Government on policy relating to fishery control, food safety and trade controls.  We also look at fishery control for all Irish-registered fishing vessels.  There is a large remit for the SFPA.  It is committed, through all its staff, to delivering in its full remit.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what information went to the EU.  The EU carried out an audit in 2018 and, following that audit, it asked Ireland to carry out an administrative inquiry.</p><p>For the committee members who may not be aware how this works, the Commission requested a significant amount of information from the SFPA on historical fisheries data and cases from a large number of areas in respect of the pelagic fisheries in question.  This information went to the EU.</p><p> I apologise to Deputy Collins, but a number of questions were asked.  As to whether the SFPA will commit to weighing in factories, we have moved over the past season to weighing on the pier.  In terms of pelagic fisheries, we will be moving to controlled weighings on the pier.  We are far from weighing being approved in factories, though.  We are in this situation because of the issues identified in the pelagic factories.</p><p> The SFPA does not see the same risks in terms of whitefish and shellfish.  We will be working with and consulting industry on a control plan.</p><p> Due to the number of questions and if it is okay, I will ask Mr. Kinneen if he has anything to add.  I apologise to the Deputy if I missed anything.</p></speech>

Those data were primarily concerned with the landing of pelagic fish at Killybegs between 2012 and 2016.  We provided the Commission with detailed records using the data we had on hand as regards what was recorded by the masters of vessels, what we had recorded about the dipping of vessels, etc.  We made every effort to respond to the Commission with a complete data set.</p> <p>  In our contacts with the Commission, we have been clear in our views as technical experts and the competent authority about what we regard as the technical limitations of data gathered from the dipping of refrigerated saltwater tanks.

Apparently, the European Commission audit that was made available to the SFPA and the Government in 2018 covers the period from 2012 to early 2015.  This audit was presented to the SFPA, which then chose to carry out an administrative inquiry.  I am not sure about the SFPA's administrative inquiry, but the audit has been leaked to a range of national media.  There have been three articles in mainstream media that have referred to the audit in detail.  Is that acceptable when the industry whose reputation and livelihood is under such serious threat has not been afforded the right to see that audit and defend itself in any way, shape or form?</p></speech>

In any situation where data have been leaked, we have taken it seriously.</p> <p>  Regarding the audit and the administrative inquiry, the SFPA is bound by legislation to carry out the administrative inquiry.  It is not that we choose to carry it out.  Rather, following an audit, the Commission will request an administrative inquiry, which is what has happened in this situation.</p> <p>  I want to check something with the Deputy.  I believe what he is asking is whether we support the publication of the EU audit report and its own administrative report.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It could not be more damaging to the reputation of the industry, yet none of the industry's representatives have seen the report or had a chance to defend themselves in any way, shape or form.  Is that an acceptable way to do business?</p></speech>

It has been stated on the record that the SFPA strongly supports the publication of all Directorate General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, DG MARE, audits of all member states and third countries.  When we deal with audits of food controls by the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety, DG SANTE, they are published.  We put this submission into the control regulation.  In the values of our organisation as a regulator, we are of the view that this level of transparency serves to help the confidence of those whom we regulate and shows there is a level playing field in the application of European legislation.</p> <p>  There is no SFPA administrative report.  Rather, there are EU audit findings.  Under Article 4 of EU Regulation No. 1049 of 2001 of the European Parliament regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, no documents relating to the administrative inquiry can be made public.</p><p>I acknowledge what the Deputy is saying.  If it is acceptable, I will ask Mr Kinneen to comment because I can see he would like to.</p></speech>

There is no doubt we agree with the procedures of natural justice in the courts according to which an individual has the right not only to know what he or she is being accused of but also the evidence backing it up and the identity of the accuser.  We fully value and follow the standards of the Irish judicial system.  I would not quibble with any of that.  As Dr. Steele has said, we are bound by the legal provisions in European law.  They do not give us discretion to publish the audit findings or the details of the administrative inquiry, but we can assure the Deputy that we are not in the business of leaking confidential information to the public or the media, nor are we in the business of constraining the media's choice as to what is fit to publish.  We are not in that space at all.  However, as Dr. Steele said, we have been on record over time as being in favour of a higher level of transparency regarding the publication of audits and the response of member states to audit findings, as is the case with our dealings at food safety level and with DG SANTE.  It is not the case with DG MARE.</p></speech>

In recent times, I have observed the weighing systems at a factory in Killybegs, County Donegal.  I want to describe the scenario there.  The weighing device the fish go over is state of the art.  It is virtually impossible to tamper with it.  It is sealed.  There is closed-circuit television.  The weighing system is monitored round the clock by the SFPA.  Therefore, the SFPA has its eyes on it.  It is a National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, weighing system.  That authority can inspect it at any time.  That is the front-of-house oversight of the weighing system.  The SFPA has monitors observing the fish and the weighing system such that if you tried to tamper with it, you would be a bloody fool.</p> <p>  At the back end of the operation, the loading of fish into packaging can clearly be seen.  They are loaded at a rate of 20 kg per box.  There are 60 boxes, which weigh 1.2 tons.  There is access to the freezer.  At any time, the SFPA officials can gain access to it.  Indeed, the industry is very eager to co-operate with the SFPA to ensure full oversight at any time and in any shape or form.  If I were in the SFPA and the reputation of our entire industry of fishers and fish producers were being taken apart due to a leaked report that the very industry under attack cannot even read to defend itself, I would seek to tell the story I saw with my own eyes.  I do not believe there is any other industry subject to oversight at the level in question but it is okay with that because it wants to keep fishing.  Those concerned want to maintain a livelihood for themselves and for the people who work in their factories.  Do the delegates believe the level of oversight I have described is one that could be presented to the European Commission?</p></speech>

We have always worked with them and supported them in their compliance with the control regulation, particularly the requirement to weigh fish.  However, the decision of the Commission we are now examining is such that the weighing of fish would have to occur prior to transport.  This is due to historical issues with the industry-owned machinery.  There was a requirement to have state-owned weighing machinery to weigh the pelagic fish.  What the Deputy is describing is a system.  There are cameras on the system but there are still concerns over the systems.  That is the reason for the Commission's decision to remove to control plan.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Commission is finding it very hard to get past the record to the effect that there has been a criminal conviction against an individual processor for tampering with weighing equipment &mdash; weighing equipment that was inspected and approved by both the NSAI and SFPA in good faith.  One aspect of the matter is we need to have more robust ways of ensuring weighing equipment is protected.</p> <p>  We have made a considerable effort to ensure we would learn what is state of the art and the vulnerabilities of state-of-the-art equipment.  While Deputy Mac Lochlainn is correct that there is better equipment available now that has electronic features that produce a data log after the event that lets us know if any tampering of the weighing has taken place, we have learned in the journey we have taken to assess this modern equipment that state-of-the-art equipment, with all these electronic features, is still vulnerable to physical tampering.  The accurate weighing of fish can be affected by techniques such as interference with the speed of the belt feeding in the fish or interference in respect of the way the machinery is set up.  We have even learned that in the event that systems are being used that might be dewatering fish using fans, care has to be taken that this, in itself, does not have a distorting effect on the load cells.</p> <p>  We agree entirely with the Deputy in that we are looking for a transparent system in which we can have confidence.  There are challenges.  There are opportunities presented by more modern equipment but they certainly do not close off all the issues we are facing or might be dealing with.  It is a subset of the industry that is determined to circumvent the regulations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051100002#D00600"><p>Deputy Mac Lochlainn covered two of the questions I wanted to ask.  On the issue of Killybegs, the SFPA was initially involved with the terms of reference and the planning and design of the system, yet it is now saying it is not up to scratch and has refused to authorise it.  Why is that?</p> <p>  Let me return to a point raised by Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  Surely it is crazy that the fishing industry itself is being denied the details of the European Commission audit, especially when it has such a devastating impact on fisheries and livelihoods.  Several fishing organisations whose representatives appeared before the committee have questioned the dual role of the SFPA in both fishery quality and control.  Is the authority capable of carrying out the many roles outlined in the opening statement?</p> <p>  The Irish Fish Processing and Exporters Association has more or less said the authority has taken its eye off the quality aspect in terms of weighing catches pier-side.  The PricewaterhouseCoopers report raised concerns about the organisational capacity of the authority, specifically regarding the need to reset the dial concerning the strategic plan of the organisation and its interaction with staff and stakeholders.</p></speech>

There are two points of note.  Let me offer a slight clarification.  The Deputy is speaking about a new device that was built on the pier in Killybegs whereas Deputy Mac Lochlainn was talking about the factory weighing.  What I will do is speak about the weighing device on the pier.  We cannot comment at this stage on the weighing equipment on the pier in Killybegs as it is currently subject to legal action on the part of the equipment owners.</p><p>However, we have followed up with the Commission on concerns that the Commission has expressed regarding this particular equipment, and we await further information from the Commission at this time.  That is what I can say on the first matter that was raised about the weighing equipment that is currently on the pier in Killybegs.</p><p> In terms of the mandate of the SFPA and it covering quality and control, in the significant mandate of the SFPA that was described, that I gave in my opening statement and went through it earlier, and I am conscious of time so we will not go through it again, we have 150 people across the major fishing ports and we have colleagues who are fully committed to fulfilling the extensive remit.  We are audited on all aspects of our work.  We are discussing one particular audit outcome here, but in others areas we have been audited and we do not have significant issues.  We will continue, within the SFPA, always to learn and always to work towards improving and doing a better job.</p><p> On the final question, and apologies to Deputy Browne if I skipped over anything but I am just conscious of the time of the committee, about the PwC organisational review, which I am glad the Deputy raised, the SFPA was set up and, as an organisation, both the remit and staffing numbers have grown.  In 2019, we commissioned a capability review of the organisation.  Ms Loughnane who is the director of transformation with the SFPA.  The key things that we have undertaken have been the setting up of an advisory board and appointing a director of transformation.  I invite Ms Loughnane to talk about the other work that is being undertaken within the organisation from the capability review.</p></speech>

From the outset, it is important for me to state the organisation fully accepts the recommendations made in the report.  My role in the organisation is to work with the very hard-working and committed people who are in the organisation and accept the need for change to deliver on those 46 recommendations.</p> <p>  In terms of those pieces, what we have is a number of different pillars around which those recommendations are based.  We are working through those recommendations.  As we speak, a total of 26 recommendations are under way, seven of which have been delivered and 15 of which have yet to commence.  My role is to work with colleagues across the organisation, not just to implement those recommendations but to deliver on the underlying objectives of those recommendations.</p></speech>

I read them and found them very helpful.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the responsibility the authority has regarding human health and ensuring fish product that lands on the pier is appropriate.  I am aware the new practice is going to be icing and de-icing.  Fish will be taken out of boxes, de-iced and then put back into boxes again.  The analogy used to me was that it will be like milking cows back in the 1960s inside in a stall.  I would like to hear Dr. Steele's views on the issue of human health and the product and whether she believes it is effective, appropriate and the way forward.</p></speech>

I will address that question first, which is a significant one.  The first thing to be aware of is that the sampling plans are still in place.  This means the full catch does not have to be weighed in all situations.  There are sampling plans where parts of the catch can be weighed.</p> <p>  The responsibility for food safety is obviously with food business operators.  The key things are ensuring unloading and landing equipment that comes into contact with the fishery products is constructed of material that is easy to clean and disinfect and is maintained in a good state of repair and cleanliness.  There should be an avoidance of contamination of fishery products during the unloading and landing, which means people working as quickly as possible to move product into ice and not use equipment and practices that cause unnecessary damage to the fish.  The crew members must have a reasonable standard of hygiene and prevent contamination of fish or fishery products through contact with any open wounds or sores.  The ice that is being to used to chill all the fishery products must be made from either potable water or clean seawater.</p> <p>  When we are looking at this, the onus is on the operator, but within the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, one of the key areas we often work on is in the promotion of compliance.  There has been work and there will be a frequently asked questions document that is going up.  There will be discussion with members of the industry.  We have already met many people in the industry.  We are meeting with the fish buyers and we are working with a group of the industry on these questions.  So we will have information on our website, we will have consultation and will work with the industry.  The main thing is that the sampling plans are in position.  That means not every single box of fish has to be emptied.  It is as per the sampling plans that were agreed in 2012, which are still in place.  I hope I have given some assurance of the seriousness with which we take this and the work we are doing with the industry.</p> <p>  We are dealing in Ireland with an industry that we find is largely compliant in many port areas.  Since the news of the control plan came out, there has been incredible engagement by the industry which has worked with us and suggested solutions.  I praise and thank the many people who have engaged with us and worked with us on this matter.</p></speech>

We have a slight issue regarding the definition between member states.  There seems to be no definition of what is meant by a serious infringement.  Can I get clarity regarding whether there is any common ground between the member states regarding that terminology and that definition of a serious infringement?</p></speech>

I would like to discuss the matter with the Senator afterwards to understand where the actual issues are and then we can go into detail of the legislation.  I am always very nervous of quoting from legislation that I do not have it in front of me, but my understanding is the legislation defines what are serious infringements. I am unsure what the Senator is referring to in terms of the differences between member states.</p> <p>  I am conscious that Mr. Kinneen wanted to come in on the Senator's first question.  I am not sure whether he wants to come in on serious infringements.</p></speech>

It is worthwhile taking note of the sampling plans, which greatly reduce the amount of fish that has to be weighed.  The SFPA will do everything to facilitate and promote compliance with the requirement by buyers and fishers.  To that effect, we would support EU funding for the purchase of suitable scales and other equipment.  We had discussions with our control partners in the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, on calibration issues and bringing this equipment online for the practitioners in the industry.</p><p>There is no doubt there is a risk that the quality of the fish will be affected by what I regard as additional handling, but I assure the Senator it will not get to the point, to my knowledge in any event, that there will be a risk to human health arising from the fish.</p><p> This issue points to the value of the dual role of the SFPA, where there is a definite knowledge in the organisation with regard to quality, the handling of fish, the preservation of the cold chain and the protection of public health across the board.  Equally, that is linked to our role in monitoring illegal, unreported and unregulated, IUU-caught fish coming on the market where it is certified as compliant with that regulation and as eligible for export certification, as might be required, to third countries.  The dual role in the statute, as I might loosely call it, serves the Irish industry very well in that an organisation has knowledge of both the environmental impact of the catching and the proper management and production on the market of the quality of the seafood product.</p></speech>

I recently visited Union Hall, having been invited to the pier to witness at first hand how the fish is weighed, brought to the plant and processed.  The staff carefully talked and walked me through the process as it would be with the control plan in place.  Union Hall, as our guests will be aware, deals mainly with smaller whitefish boats.  The boxes of fish, which are already iced, are hoisted directly into the back of a lorry and brought straight to the processing plant, which is only a couple of hundred metres away.  If I am not doing it justice, it is because I was walked through the process only once, but our guests will get the point.  The fish is brought straight to the plant, de-iced, weighed accurately with transparency and full traceability, boxed, labelled and put into the back of a truck to be distributed wherever its intended market is.  To me, that makes complete sense.  It is safe, transparent and traceable.</p><p>I was then walked through what the process will be following the removal of the control plan and the weighing of the fish on the pier at Union Hall.  These whitefish boats can carry anywhere between ten and 15 different species, or even more.  The idea of the sampling plans will not work in those cases because it could be five boxes of one species, and eight, three and 12 of others, so it simply will not work.  Without the control plan, the boxes of fish are iced, landed on the pier, de-iced, weighed, re-iced and put back into a lorry to be transported to the plant, which is only a couple of hundred metres away.</p><p>You can see straight away that makes no sense.  It will lead to health and safety issues, as was mentioned, because more time will be spent on the pier exposed to the elements. There may, unfortunately, be an issue with the quality of the fish.  We pride ourselves on the incredible fresh quality of our fish, but if the control plan is removed and it is weighed on the pier and exposed to the elements, such as bright sunshine on a hot day, that will have a very significant impact.  The key to our fishing sector and the pride we have in the quality of our fish is getting it to market quickly.  This will slow down that process by hours.  It makes no sense.</p><p>Do our guests accept that in the instance I have just described at Union Hall, where there is a variety of species of whitefish, weighing the fish on the pier simply will not work because of the lack of infrastructure on most of our piers and the fact that, in most cases, the processing plants are located various distances from the pier?  Do they accept that what is being forced on the fishing sector with the withdrawal of the control plan cannot work in most instances?</p><p>Dr. Steele asked how we got to this point.  I will read out a passage from the opening statement from the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association to be presented to the committee at our next meeting.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	A subsequent Administrative Inquiry was required by the EU Commission to be carried out.  The SFPA undertook this inquiry during 2019.  Again no input was sought from us as a sector. </blockquote> <p>Does the SFPA accept, therefore, that the reason we are here relates to a consistent lack of consultation with the sector and industry?</p><p>Will the SFPA commit to making every effort, in full consultation with the industry, to bring back a control plan with in-factory weighing?  As is the case in instances such as at Union Hall, it is fully traceable and transparent and much more efficient.  Dr. Steele said she will examine the reintroduction of a control plan and in-factory weighing for the shellfish and whitefish industries.  Is there a timeline for when that might happen?</p><p>In cases such as that which I described, processors simply do not have the equipment to hand for on-pier weighing.  What will be done in the interim?</p></speech>

The key issue is that this is an EU decision.  The removal of the control plan was a removal of a derogation that Ireland had.  This decision, through the EU, involves significant changes to weighing practice and the SFPA is working to ensure the industry can introduce them efficiently and in a way that assures compliance with the regulations.  We are working with Union Hall through the Clonakilty port office and examining the use of the sampling plan, but the onus is on the operators to weigh the fish.</p> <p>  As for the impact of the control plan on the demersal and shellfish industries, we have committed to producing control plans and will consult the industry in that regard.  In-factory weighing for the demersal, shellfish or pelagic industry is slightly different from the audit and the administrative inquiry.  There is a commitment but there will not be a quick resolution.  The SFPA will have to work on the new control plan, which will have to be submitted under EU legislation.  The minimum timeframe, if there are no issues and no further audits are required from the Commission, will be two months.  To be open about it, a change will not happen at any point soon.</p><p>Weighing will have to occur at landing.</p><p> Regarding the question on the administrative inquiry and input from the sector, it does not work like that with an administrative inquiry.  The administrative inquiry looked for significant volumes of historic detail about landing figures, landing declarations and other materials.  It would not have been appropriate to look for input from the industry in the administrative inquiry.  It was looking at data that was stored by the SFPA.  It is a very significant undertaking with a significant amount of data being submitted to the Commission for its examination.</p><p> The other side to be aware of is that the administrative inquiry is not complete.  The removal of the control plan is the first decision we have seen from the Commission.  There will be other engagements with the Commission on other aspects coming out of the administrative inquiry and we will communicate and deal with those as they arise.  The committee should be aware of that.</p><p> The Deputy asked about consultation with the industry.  The SFPA has always been committed to and consulted the industry.  We meet the consultative committee.  At times, the relationship between a regulator and the industry can be difficult and can be strained but we, as an organisation, have always met with the industry and count it as a very important part of our work.  Personally, I count it as one of the most important parts of the work.</p><p> I do not know if Mr. Kinneen wants to come in at this point on those questions.</p></speech>

What he described, the walk through he was given in Union Hall, sounds to me as if they have a best-practice system in place there.  As an organisation, the SFPA is doing everything to minimise the impact of where we stand at present to deal with the revocation of the control plan.  Part of that strategy is to have a mapping in place for the major fishery harbours and for the local authority harbours, such as Union Hall, where we may be able to define a footprint area where fish could come off boats and go to a local handling facility or buyer and there would be little or no disturbance to the practice.  We are working on that, gathering information and getting it in place.</p> <p>  From the consultations we have had with different sectors of the industry, it is clear the revocation of the capacity to weigh pelagic fish in the factories has had a huge impact and there are huge challenges to work through given the audit findings.  We are also hearing a strong message from the more artisanal and small-scale fishers who would be landing into places that do not have the benefit of much, if any, infrastructure.  We are looking, and are solution orientated, to see what we can do with that.</p> <p>  We are working hard to try to get over where we stand.  The Commission decision to revoke the control plan was not signalled to us.  When it was happening, we were not consulted about it.  However, we are certainly using many of the resources of the organisation to react and support the industry to get through where we are at present.</p></speech>

I have just one more question.  It was in the original suite of questions.  Dr. Steele mentioned a period of roughly two months maybe before a control plan could be brought back in for the whitefish and shellfish sectors, if I understood her correctly.  In the interim, they are in a serious situation.  They cannot work.  Much of what they do is not workable.  What measures will be introduced in the interim to help them out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.167" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Susan Steele" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051100002#G00400"><p>It is a minimum of two months.  Under the legislation, it is a two-month consultation period.  That is if we are in a position where it passes through Parliament.  There was a significant delay on the previous occasion when the control plans were submitted.  The committee should be aware not to take it as that.</p> <p>  In the interim period, we have been working with the industry.  I praise the industry, which has been looking at solutions for this.  There have been groups buying shared weighing scales that they are putting into piers and lot boxes for smaller piers.  As we were saying earlier, there is a huge component of the Irish industry which is compliant and it has been looking at how to comply and how to make this situation work.  It is to work with them in looking at solutions.</p> <p>  The control plan is gone.  The weighing has to be in the same way as it was ten years ago, at landing.  We are looking at how we define the landing areas.  For some situations, that includes the apron area and the pier area.  The only step forward is to work with us to ensure compliance.</p> <p>  In the interim period, it is literally to move to the new situation to have weighing equipment to put in place for quality.  It is a significant change but many members of the industry are looking at this and at how they can work into a compliant situation with it.  There will not be a change to this in the short term.</p></speech>

I would like to read one paragraph of the document they submitted to the committee and ask a question.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	... commission identified that the operators did not have in place a &quot;weighing system fit for purpose&quot; and the audit identified manipulation of weighing systems.  Moreover, although aware of these shortcomings, Ireland did not take appropriate measures to address such noncompliance, in particular by withdrawing the permission to weigh after transport.  Consequently, the control plan does not minimise the risk of systematic manipulation of weighing of pelagic catches in Ireland and the under-declaration of catches by operators. </blockquote> <p>I take it that by &quot;Ireland&quot; is meant the SFPA in this regard.  I am sure at the time the SFPA could have acted in relation to individuals and that, rather than penalising the whole industry and adopting a blanket approach as we have experienced, which has had the effect of making life impossible for everybody, the SFPA could have dealt with individuals.  There is no doubt that, with any system, no matter what it is, somebody will try to manipulate it at some time.  You have to deal with the manipulation, not penalise the whole industry.  Does Dr. Steele accept the SFPA has fallen down where these issues were not dealt with individually and that has led to the whole industry being impacted by the changes that have been put in place?  Dr. Steele dealt with the questions on the whitefish sector which I was to ask as well.</p><p>The EU control plan says it all.  Monkfish should be weighed individually but it does not apply to EU-registered or UK-registered vessels at Irish ports.  Where is the fairness in that and what comments has Dr. Steele on that?</p><p>Irish fishermen are responsible for 1% of infringements under EU law.  We seem to be subject to the strictest enforcement of anybody.  How does Dr. Steele view the enforcement that is taking place in Ireland versus that taking place across the EU in fisheries issues?  Those are all my questions.</p></speech>

I am conscious that we are eating into time and I will be as quick as I can on these.</p> <p>  On the manipulation of scales, where there have been cases, the SFPA has prepared cases for the DPP.  One case has gone through the courts and another case has not gone through the courts.  However, these cases, in the view of the Commission and in the view of the audit, showed systemic issues within the industry that were not being picked up by the control authorities.</p><p>The answer, therefore, is yes, we acted on an individual basis in those cases, but the cases and the follow-on surveying of ullage tables and tanks in the vessels showed systematic issues in the industry.  That is where this audit has picked up the issues.  The Deputy has identified one of the key things on which the SFPA acted in respect of individual cases, but we did not act on what was identified by the Commission as systematic issues across the industry.  As I stated earlier, our organisation continually reappraises, learns and tries to develop and to do better, so there are lessons for us from the entire process.</p><p> I might come back to Deputy Pringle on monkfish and UK-registered vessels in Irish ports because there is quite a bit in that question.  This relates in part to the sampling plans.  Given the time constraints, I will come back to the Deputy afterwards if that is okay.  I assure him that all vessels, whatever their nationality, landing in Irish ports have to weigh prior to transport unless they have first point of sale in France or Belgium, where there is a common control programme.  The weighing at landing is for all vessels.  I thank the Deputy for the question about monkfish.  We will come back with clarity on that because to go into the detail of it here would use up a lot of time.</p><p> As for the 1% of infringements across the EU and strictest enforcement in Ireland, I will not comment on other member states.  All I can assure Deputy Pringle of is that we in the SFPA believe sustainable fisheries underpin the future of our coastal communities and that, in the shared maritime area, the work the SFPA does in regulating this is the most important work that can be done to ensure a future for our generation and generations to come in the coastal communities.  As I said earlier, we are supporting that work with 150 very committed staff.  Also, and I know I said this earlier but I will say it again, the vast majority of Irish fishers, by being compliant with the Common Fisheries Policy and the quotas, are acting to develop sustainable fisheries into the future.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank not only the committed staff in the SFPA but also compliant fishers around the coast who are responsible for those low infringement levels.  I do not know if Mr. Kinneen-----</p></speech>

I am sorry.  I forgot to ask it during my previous contribution.  Dr. Steele said earlier in the context of white fishing that she expects that within two months a new procedure will be in place, which is very optimistic.  It will be a year or a year and half, probably, before it happens.  How soon will the interim measures the SFPA is putting in place be in place?  That is vitally important.  They should be in place, I believe, within the next month or so to run until the period during which this will be accepted.  When will they be in place?</p></speech>

When the derogation is removed, the weighing has to be at the point of landing.  That has already started from the decision on 13 April.

I would like the interim measures to be put in place as soon as possible because the approval of this control measure will take longer than two months, as Dr. Steele herself said.</p></speech>

We have eaten into the hour of their time, but I felt it was important that members get the chance to question the SFPA extensively and I did not want to cut any member short.  The witnesses for this session were undoubtedly listening to the exchanges and I hope they found them informative.  There was very intensive questioning of the SFPA by all Deputies and Senators.  I apologise again for eating into the witnesses' allocated time.</p> <p>  To the second session of the meeting I welcome the following witnesses: Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Donoghue, CEO, Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation; Mr. Ciaran Doherty, chairman, Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation; Mr. John Lynch, chairman, Irish South &amp;amp; East Fish Producers Organisation; Mr. Karl McHugh, chairman, Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association; Mr. Brendan Byrne, CEO, Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association; Mr. John Ward, CEO, Irish Fish Producers Organisation, all joining remotely; and Mr. Patrick Murphy, CEO, Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, joining from a witness room in Kildare House.  They are all very welcome to the meeting.  We have received their opening statements, which have been circulated to members.  We are limited in our time due to Covid-19, so the committee has agreed that the opening statements will be taken as read in order that we can use the meeting for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.</p> <p>  I will read out an important notice regarding parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Participants in the committee meeting from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which their participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I now invite questions from the members.</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned, the four core points about this proposed legislation still stand.  The normal threshold for conviction for most citizens is beyond a reasonable doubt and there is an onus on the accuser to prove the matter.  In this case, it is done on the balance of probabilities.  The submission from the Irish South &amp;amp; West Fish Producers Organisation refers to the way that the UK, when it was a member of the European Union, applied it in a similar common law system.  I know some members of the organisations represented today have taken court cases and have been successful in the Supreme Court a number of times.  I want to get that perspective.  That is the first question for all the producer organisations.</p><p>The Bill only covers Irish and EU-flagged vessels.  It does not cover UK, Norwegian or Faeroese vessels.  A particular concern would be that it does not cover UK vessels.  It is comparable to having two drivers on the same road and one can be prosecuted for speeding but the other one cannot be.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.</p><p>My third question is for the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association, IFPEA.  Its representatives have made a very detailed submission to the committee today and will be aware that we have just had an intensive engagement with the SFPA.  The EU audit of 2018 was conducted from 2012 to 2015.  Apparently, this audit has been leaked to at least three national media outlets.  Its implications are very damning to the reputation of our entire fishing industry and fish producers, and yet representatives of the IFPEA have not had a chance to see that report or the report of the SFPA administrative inquiry.  I invite the representatives of the IFPEA to outline the reality of the oversight.  I have touched on some of it today in the engagement with the SFPA.  The IFPEA submission outlines the level of oversight.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	Ireland's seafood landings are the most regulated in Europe.  Our industry has embraced those controls.  We are committed to sustainably managed fisheries and will continue to play our part in protecting our fisheries as long as controls are proportionate, reasonable and pragmatic. </blockquote> <p>One would not know that Ireland's seafood landings are the most regulated in Europe based on what was leaked to national media.  I invite the representatives of the IFPEA to offer a defence of the industry and to outline their vision for the way forward at what needs to be done in the immediate term to address the serious impact of the revocation of the EU control plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051100002#J00200"><p>I will respond first on behalf of the four producer organisations.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn asked very pertinent questions about the Bill applying penalty points to masters or skippers, as we would know them, of fishing vessels in addition to the owners.  I must say this at the outset.  The industry has been accused of going after these things as a delaying tactic.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We have always accepted that there is an onus on Ireland under EU law to have penalty points in place for both the owners of fishing vessels and for the skippers of fishing vessels.  We have ended up in this mess because the Minister and his predecessors have ignored what we have tried to tell them.</p> <p>  The four producer organisations made four proposals on the previous penalty points for owners over the years.  Unfortunately, the Minister has now copied and pasted all those provisions which are anathema to us and need to be addressed.  Before I deal with the specific issue of the burden of proof, it is important for the committee to be aware that the Minister this time around under the EU regulation has considerable latitude in how he implements penalty points for serious infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy for masters of vessels.  He did not have the same latitude for owners but he does have it here.  Based on the heads of the Bill, he has seen fit not to do that and we are really mirroring what is there as such.</p> <p>  Regarding the burden of proof, the Supreme Court already found that there is no impediment to having beyond reasonable doubt for this.  Unfortunately, the Minister has included provision for the balance of probabilities, ignoring that if the master or skipper gets a significant number of penalty points, his livelihood will be taken away from him forever and a day.  He can no longer be a skipper of a fishing vessel.  If someone's livelihood is being taken away, it must be beyond a reasonable doubt.</p> <p>  That brings me to a ridiculous point in the Bill.  The skipper may only appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  Given that his livelihood could be taken away, it is not fair and equitable.  To rub salt in the wound really, even if he is successful on the point of law in the High Court, the penalty points still apply to his licence.  It is hard to imagine telling someone who challenged a speeding offence in the courts and won the case that the person would still have the penalty points applied to his or her licence for the three years.  This does not stack up in any democracy and needs to be changed.</p> <p>  The other point the Deputy mentioned is very relevant here.  The Bill, as it stands, and the EU legislation only apply to EU-flagged vessels.  In the new scenario with Brexit, all the Irish vessels, as they have done for decades, will be fishing alongside their UK counterparts.</p><p>We will be subject to penalty points and they will not, as such.  Just in case anybody is suggesting there are other measures for UK vessels, that does not stack up because the penalty points are being invoked in addition to the other measures, as such.  The cornerstone of the control regulation is being thrown out the door with this Bill, and if there are to be penalty points for a skipper, we must have a level playing field for fishermen who are fishing in the same fishing grounds.</p><p> The Minister has repeatedly said, including at a recent committee meeting, that allowing an appeal to the High Court or not taking off the penalty points was delaying the system.  That is totally inaccurate.  From the very beginning, going back a number of years, we have said we fully accept that if somebody gets penalty points, those points stay on the licence or the master's registration until a case is successfully taken in the High Court.  The penalty points would then be removed but not before that.  There can be no excuse for not implementing this immediately.</p><p> I hope I have covered the Deputy's questions.  We have also set out the situation in our opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank all our guests, including Mr. Murphy, Mr. O'Donoghue, Mr. McHugh, Mr. Lynch, Mr. Byrne and Mr. Ward.  The representatives of the SFPA, who were before us previously, have said they are consulting the industry.  That is not right, in my mind, because of the weighing crisis we have now.  At 4 p.m. on 16 April, nobody seemed to be aware of what was going to happen at 5 p.m., and a massive crisis was put before the fishermen.  Is that right?  Were our guests consulted about this?  Did they know anything about it?  Were they aware it was going to happen?</p> <p>  Some 5,000 or 6,000 tonnes, or more, of fish can come into places such as Castletownbere, Union Hall and Baltimore, fished by onshore and pelagic fishermen.  Do our guests accept this could lead to a serious amount of landings going elsewhere?  Could the catches of bigger fishermen go to Norway, the Shetland Islands or Scotland?  Is that a possibility?  I have been told it is and I would appreciate the comments of our guests in that regard.</p> <p>  It looks to me as if there will no budging in respect of this issue.  I tried to get a space to talk about it in the D&aacute;il today but that is not happening.  Is there any chance of a restoration of factory weighing, even as a short-term solution?  The SFPA is saying it is solution orientated.  Have its representatives approached our guests to discuss what solutions they think might resolve this crisis?  I understand the board of the SFPA is made up of three internal employees.  Is that, in the view of our guests, highly unusual for a State agency?  I had better stop there because I could ask 100 questions that our guests will not have a chance to answer.</p></speech>

The most recent time we spoke to the committee was to highlight our fears that 20% of our natural resource would be given away.  For this issue to arise on top of that is crushing for our industry.  It is hard for our coastal communities.  I understand the SFPA has a job to do but we do not agree with the way it is being applied.  We have pointed out in our submissions that there must be a procedure here.  There must be time to lead into this new regime because the sword of Damocles has come across our heads and is being used.  It is happening on piers all over the coastline now and has immediate effects.</p> <p>  The SFPA has stated it is consulting the industry, as Deputy Collins said.  I do not know what its definition of "consulting" is, or that of the committee.  For me, consulting does not mean just being told what is happening and that is it.  It should expand to include looking for solutions and sitting down with us.  We have spent a good few meetings trying to put that point across to the SFPA.</p> <p>  Our biggest question is why the SFPA accepted this report.  This is a damning report and the SFPA accepted it even as it highlighted the SFPA's own incompetence.  That is a hard word for me to use, and I know representatives of the SFPA are not here to defend themselves, but that is the reality of the situation.  The SFPA accepted this report.  It was the SFPA, as Deputy Pringle identified, that put forward a request for revoking what was there in 2012 in the context of fishing scales.  The circumstances have not changed.  The SFPA is also the competent authority for the quality of fish.  I find it incredible that anybody could stand over the taking of fish out of a chilled box, putting them into another box that may not be chilled, looking for ice on piers without the facilities to provide it to re-ice the fish and put them back into boxes.</p> <p>  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, Union Hall is lucky to have a factory a couple of hundred of metres up the road, even though it is not, as Mr. Kinneen said, currently in the roadmap plan for catches to be weighed a couple of hundred metres away.  It points to the lunacy of what we are talking about here.  This has to be addressed.</p> <p>  Returning to Deputy Mac Lochlainn's questions, we did not object to penalty points being brought in.  The industry tried and sought many times to meet the Minister and those who were drafting this legislation to see if it could be introduced in a fair and transparent manner, especially when it was defeated in our courtrooms on the basis that fair procedures were not being followed.  There was little or no consultation.  We are left scratching our heads and wondering is it possible that we, as a country, are going to allow the balance of probabilities decide somebody's future and right to make a living in this country.  If a case goes to the Supreme Court or the High Court and a fisherman is exonerated, he or she may still lose the ability to fish.  I am not going to make light of this but I want the situation to be understood.  If this was a death penalty and a man was prosecuted and sentenced to death but was thereafter exonerated in a courtroom, he would still be executed under this law.  That is what it means.  Perhaps that is an imperfect analogy but we must get this point across.  It is not following fair procedures.  We have requested the same ability to defend our good names in a court of law as any other citizen of the State would be granted.  We understand the administrative sanctions and, if they follow a court conviction, surely we should be afforded the same rights as any other citizen in the land.</p> <p>  I do not like using these sorts of analogies but they have to be used to get across the severity of what we are talking about.  If a murderer goes into prison, he or she will not be there for life.  He or she will eventually come out and be pardoned.  However, under this legislation, as Mr. O'Donoghue pointed out, if you lose your rights, you never get them back.  Time does not erase it.  Nothing you do or change will ever erase it.  There is no other avenue to rectify that situation.  You are guilty and punished for the rest of your life.  It is incredible.</p> <p>  There is so much I would like to say but it would be unfair of me to take the floor for too much longer.  I hope I have addressed the issues.  I thank the Deputies for their questions during the previous session.  I was listening and they are well versed on the issues.  Their questions were very pertinent and I would have been happier if clearer answer were given to the simple questions that were asked.</p></speech>

I know most of our guests were probably tuned in to the previous session with the SFPA.  There is an opportunity now to answer, clarify, or correct some of the statements made by the SFPA, or agree with them, whichever way you want to look at it.</p><p>Deputy Collins touched on the fact that the SFPA said it engages extensively with the sector.  I think Mr. Murphy has just answered that.  It was said that in the whitefish sector, for example, going back to the situation whereby they were weighing on the piers, that is just a return to what was happening ten years ago.  It is my understanding that was not happening ten years ago, that was not the situation that pertained and that fish have always been weighed in plants, markets or whatever else.  I would like clarification on that.</p><p> My next question is for whichever witness can answer it.  Are the witnesses confident about the data the SFPA sent to the Commission when this audit was being carried out?  I would love to give Mr. Murphy an opportunity to emphasise clearly and as much as possible what needs to happen with the fallout from the Brexit trade agreement, what it means for the Irish fishing sector and, essentially, what needs to happen now in terms of our approach to burden sharing and sharing with other EU countries.  I would like another opportunity to hear him speak on that.  He should be given the opportunity to clarify that further.  I hope those questions were clear enough.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051100002#L00400"><p>To respond to the question Deputy Mac Lochlainn asked, in fairness to him, in his earlier question to the SFPA he outlined the robustness of the control measures in place right across the sector.<br/><br/>Before I go into the detail of the answer, however, we have to address the reality of where we find ourselves as processors and exporters.  Our entire world has been thrown upside down by the removal of the control plan.  The control plan brought certainty to us as processors and exporters.  Article 61.1 brought with it a level playing field, that is, the derogation to weigh within our factories.  We are one of seven countries in the EU that can do that.  Historically, that has had to happen in Ireland because of the locations of our factories.  Article 61.1 is therefore an instrument of fairness that creates a level playing field for us as fish processors and exporters.  That is the purpose of that article.<br/><br/>The earlier witnesses from the SFPA gave what was to me a very shocking misrepresentation of the facts surrounding processors and exporters.  We are the most regulated and most controlled of all fishers right throughout Europe, with no exception.  Our record has been exemplary over the past ten years.  Yet there is this audit of 2018, which none of us have had sight of, an administrative inquiry of 2019, which none of us have had sight of, and at least 15 different sets of leaks that emanated from somewhere that accuse us of all things and, most importantly, are destroying the Irish fish sector through misinformation.  No other nation would tolerate what has been inflicted on the Irish fishing community over the past six months as to what has gone on here.  In our paper we have identified that we have to get a way forward.<br/><br/>Before we do that, however, let us deal with the reality of what we have heard from the SFPA.  The SFPA is a flawed entity.  It is not just me saying that.  The Wolfe report of 2012 stated that.  The PricewaterhouseCoopers report of 2020 stated that.  The greater part of the problem we find ourselves in at present is through the incompetence of the SFPA as our regulatory authority.  The control plan brought certainty to us as processors and exporters.  What is being talked about now is effectively the creation of a Chinese wet market on every pier and harbour in the country, where the food going into the food chain is open to the elements, be that sun, rain, wind or the fowl above our heads.  No other country would tolerate this, yet it is being foisted on us through two audits, or an audit and an administrative inquiry we have not had sight of.  I take exception to the earlier speaker who said an administrative inquiry cannot be released to the public.  That is factually incorrect.  It was confirmed to me that, under Article 4 of the same regulation, that information can be released at the discretion of the Minister.<br/><br/>We need to have a serious discussion as to where we are going with fishing.  For too long the Irish fishing sector has failed to get a political voice, but we have crossed the Rubicon and are in an unprecedented situation in which Brexit has inflicted a 20% cut to our quota, which was already small.  Now as processors we are not even allowed to function in the way we have functioned with certainty since the foundation of our businesses.<br/><br/>I wish to address three sections of this.  It is grossly unfair to have shellfish included in the removal of this control plan because they are non-quota and were not part of the control plan or weighing, yet fishers are being forced to weigh them under the elements, on piers and harbours throughout the country.  There is no basis for that and it has to stop.  Both whitefish and pelagic were subject to the derogation.  I seriously question the weight of evidence the SFPA has suggested is in this yet-unseen audit and this yet-unseen administrative inquiry.  If we got full sight of that, I think there would be a greater body of evidence for the incompetence of the regulatory authority than against us as fishers.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman for his indulgence.  I want to say one further thing about due process and where we have got ourselves.  Deputy Collins was right when he said that within one hour on 16 April everything had changed and everything was turned on its head.  Deputy Collins is 100% right, but that should not have happened.  No transitionary arrangement was made by the EU or this national Government to protect us.  However, Article 102.4 of the 2009 regulation states:</p> <blockquote> 	If the administrative inquiry referred to in paragraph 2 does not lead to the removal of the irregularities or if the Commission identifies shortcomings in the control system of a Member State during the verifications or autonomous inspections referred to in Articles 98 and 99 or in the audit referred to in Article 100, the Commission shall establish an action plan with that Member State.  The Member State shall take ... [the] necessary measures to implement that action plan. </blockquote> <p>We were not afforded an action plan.  We were not afforded a transitionary period.  We were afforded nothing.  We were thrown out into the proverbial deep waters and cut loose.  I ask the committee to stand up for fishing.</p></speech>

That is only a natural course of justice.  I assure Mr. Murphy also, and I would say I speak for all committee members, that we believe the leaks going on are totally unacceptable, especially given the witnesses tell us the SFPA is not even communicating with them.</p> <p>  I wish briefly to raise three things.  The first is for the Killybegs contingent.  They heard the reply we got from the SFPA earlier about the weighing system in Killybegs.  The SFPA representatives say there are legal issues around the weighing system there and the equipment.  We have been led to believe the SFPA was involved in the installation of that equipment.  Will the Killybegs contingent share with us their feeling on that?</p> <p>  The Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association has made it quite clear that, as far as it is concerned, the SFPA just cannot handle the remit it has been given in terms of fishing control and that it has taken its eye off the quality aspect.</p><p>Is it the view of the witnesses that the SFPA has done this deliberately in order to focus its attention someplace else and that is why there is so much secrecy involved?  On the Commission audit, it is crazy that so many families and fishers like the witnesses, who cannot even access the report, are affected.  Could they give us an idea of how large an impact there will be on catches - in the context of an open weighing process - when temperatures start to increase?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.194" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051100002#M00200"><p>On Deputy O'Sullivan's question, he is absolutely right in saying that prior to 2012 the fish were weighed in the factories, markets or auction halls throughout the country.  In very limited circumstances where there were recovery measures - cod stock comes to mind - on one occasion a small percentage of that fish was weighed on the pier.  Unlike the situation now where the scales have to be provided by the agent selling the fish, at that time the scales were provided by and the weighing was performed by the SFPA because it was part of a stock recovery programme.  Other than that, the fish have always been weighed at the point of sale in factories or auction halls.  The withdrawal of this derogation is really disastrous for all sectors but especially on those involved in the demersal fish and shellfish sectors who lands smaller amounts of fish in boxes that are packed in controlled conditions on vessels with refrigeration, ice and plenty of water on board for washing.  When the fish are put onto the pier, these facilities are no longer immediately to hand.  According to the sampling plan, all the fish have to be stacked on the pier and then sorted and weighed but there will not be enough ice to re-ice all of the fish.  On the admission today of the SFPA, this will affect the quality of the product, but it will also potentially affect the condition of the product to the point that it may deteriorate enough to get contaminated and affect public health.  That is, in fact, what is going to happen.</p> <p>  I cannot understand why no notice was given of the possibility of this happening.  The first we heard of it was on the evening of 16 April, which was a Friday, so we had no opportunity to make any inquiry until the following Monday morning.  We were told on a Friday evening, with no warning whatsoever, that in future all fishery products would have to be weighed on the pier.  No accusation was made against the fishermen and no evidence was produced in the context of which they could defend themselves.  Out of the blue we were just told to stop weighing in the auction halls and to weigh on the piers instead.  That is unacceptable from a fisherman's point of view.  It is unworkable.  It is a danger to public health and also a danger to the health and safety of the people doing the work.</p> <p>  On the sea fisheries (amendment) Bill, we have the same problem in our organisation with the penalty points for masters.  We would call it the main problem, in that fisheries offences are prosecuted under the Criminal Justice Act.  If an offence is alleged by the authority, it will apply points to the licence and the Bill outlines that points will now apply to the master.  On the case being taken to the court, and if the offence is subsequently found not to have occurred, the master will be found to be innocent of the offence, but the penalty points will be retained anyway.  We cannot see any justice in this system.  We cannot understand how this can be allowed in a country with a common law system.  Once again, it is an imposition on fishermen that they cannot see the evidence and defend themselves in order to be proven innocent.  Even if they are found innocent when prosecuted they must still keep the points.</p></speech>

It has been an amazing four months for the industry between Brexit, penalty points and now the proposed change on the 16 April.  It is very hard to equate what they have gone through with any other industry in Ireland.</p> <p>  I touched on the food safety issue in the context of the change in practice on piers.  This is a massive issue.  I do not think it has been thought through.  I would welcome a comment in that regard.  I described the scenario as like going back to the 1950s and milking cows in a stall.  It has that kind of feel to it.  Is there logic to it?  If we had decided to do this on the ground, I am sure they would have stopped us.  As a result of the fact that we did not decide to do it, however, it is okay.  This is a major issue and I would welcome a comment on it.</p> <p>  In terms of the point on common law, penalty points are the biggest issue I have seen in fisheries in my time on this committee in the past five years.  In terms of the Minister's position and the basis of his approach, I heard his testimony at the previous hearings and I ask the witnesses to comment on that.  He seemed to say that he is legally bound in respect of the issue because of the advice he has received.  I have started my own inquiries into the matter.  What is the information of fishermen on the advice?  What the Minister said was very strange to say the least.  I asked him straight out if there was any other two-tier system in his Department in the area of agriculture.  It does not exist in agriculture, but it does in fisheries.  I would welcome clarity from the witnesses on their view on the Minister's statement at the committee's previous meeting.</p> <p>  On the media, in hindsight, we should have had this meeting back to front.  I would have preferred if the fishermen came in first and the regulator came in afterwards.  The issue about the media is something we almost need to go back to the regulator to talk about whether there are leaks of information.  My first question is whether the Data Protection Commissioner, Helen Dixon, has been informed.  Has she been asked where the information has come from and if it was leaked?  Articles were published in three major newspapers.  The information must have come from one or two sources, either the commission or the regulatory body itself.  For me, that is a data protection issue.  Ms Dixon mentioned it.  I am interested in the views of the witnesses in that regard because we must stop having a one-sided conversation.</p></speech>

It certainly was not the fishing industry.</p> <p>  I would like to make a point on the weighing system.  The SFPA expressed serious doubts about the weighing system in the factories.</p><p>The type of weighing system that exists in the factories in Ireland is exactly the same as what is in factories in Scotland, Norway and Denmark.  For some reason, the authorities in these countries do not seem to have any problem with them.</p><p> In response to another question, the weighing systems that are in the factories were approved by the SFPA.  Further to that, the SFPA insisted that CCTV cameras be installed so that it could watch the weighing of fish in its offices.</p><p> Today, the SFPA has said that it has 150 members of staff and that 11 factories in total produce pelagic fish.  Surely out of that 150 staff, if the SFPA is not satisfied by what is happening in the factories, it could find 11 people who could spend a day in the factories to see exactly what is happening, but there is an unwillingness to do that.</p><p> We, as an industry, have tried very hard to engage with the Minister but we have seen Ministers change while nothing else.  The problem is that there is an unwillingness of what we call the permanent government to change.</p></speech>

This meeting is a part of our engagement regarding the reduction of carbon emissions by 51% by 2030 and this is the second of three sessions which are focused on biodiversity, ecosystems, the relationship between biodiversity and climate action, how biodiversity and ecosystems can play a role in achieving the reduction of carbon emissions, and the general health of biodiversity systems and ecosystems.  We will today focus particularly on maritime ecosystems and water in general.</p><p>To that end, I welcome to the meeting Dr. Simon Berrow of the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, and Professor Anamarija <b>Franki</b>and Mr. Stephen Kavanagh from Native Oyster Reef Restoration Ireland, NORRI.  We are also joined by Ms Ellen McMahon from the Sustainable Water Network and Professor Ken Whelan from the Atlantic Salmon Trust.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome them all to today's meeting and thank them for attending, sharing their expertise and playing an important part in this process.</p><p>Before the meeting starts and we take statements from witnesses, I must read out a note on privilege.  I remind our guests of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p>For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful that domestic law could be applied to the evidence they give.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p>For those watching this meeting online, Oireachtas members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I, as Vice Chairman, and necessary staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everyone to bear with us should any technical issues arise.  That is an important point because, from time to time, we have technical issues with the connection.  Do not panic because we always manage to get people back online and get them through the rest of their statements.  It will all be fine in the end.</p><p>It is now my great privilege to call on Dr. Berrow to make his opening statement.  I remind witnesses that they have five minutes to make an opening statement, after which I will invite questions from members, who can indicate they have a question during the course of our guests' statements.  Each question will have a two-minute limit and we will then go to each of our guests for a response.  I ask Dr. Berrow to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Renewable energy is a central pillar of climate action.  The marine renewable energy industry in Ireland is expanding rapidly with a production target of 5 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030 and an ambition of 30 GW by 2050.  Assuming a standard 7.5 MW turbine, up to 650 operational turbines may be deployed in the next decade, or up to 4,000 by 2050.  Large sections of our coast will be transformed, impacting on our nearshore environment and coastal communities.  Offshore wind and marine renewables provide significant opportunities and challenges.  We need to mitigate negative impacts on marine species and habitats but we should also be looking for opportunities to enhance biodiversity and contribute to ocean management.  The IWDG has worked on a number of offshore marine renewable projects, including at the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, wave energy test site off north-west County Mayo and commercial wind farm site surveys off the east and south-east coasts.  We have prepared guidance documents for the SEAI and, in December 2020, we published a policy document on offshore wind farm development to stimulate debate and present policy recommendations.</p> <p>  The marine renewables sector is operating within an environmental vacuum.  There is very little guidance on environmental assessment, acceptable risk thresholds or monitoring requirements.  A suite of baseline surveys are currently under way, including risk modelling and proposed mitigation.  Some approaches are good, some not so good.  Each company is doing what it thinks is required to achieve planning consent.  Tight environmental regulation enhances environmental protection but also brings more certainty to an industry investing hundreds of millions of euro; it is good for everybody.  Potential impacts on some marine species are well-documented, for example, marine mammals and seabird but this is much less so for habitats, for example offshore sandbanks.  What are acceptable levels of habitat loss, noise exposure, collision risk or displacement?  Impacts are best mitigated by appropriate site selection, using best available data.  Areas important for sensitive species and habitats should be avoided.  Current available data are poor and often out of date.  Individual wind farm site surveys must be integrated into larger spatial scales and not evaluated in a piecemeal way through the planning process.  There are good examples of State-funded surveys, for example the ObSERVE programme, aiming to address some knowledge gaps.  Surveys should be ongoing, as marine distributions are changing as they are influenced by climate change shifts.  Projects such as EirWind have provided guidance on supply chains and constraint mapping but less on how to protect or enhance marine biodiversity and resources.  A marine enhancement fund, with contributions from industry, should be considered.</p> <p>  Industry needs best practice guidelines, supported by legislation, to ensure site assessments and risk analyses are robust, appropriate and consistent.  We can learn from countries in the southern North Sea and from the UK.  The German approach is precautionary but quite prescriptive, setting thresholds for permitted noise generation and monitoring protocols.  The UK takes a more site-specific, risk-based approach.  What best practices could work in Ireland, with our different marine environments and biodiversity?  The IWDG has recommended data sharing agreements to minimize duplication and disturbance; an open-access online database for research and future development assessment; an independent acoustic monitoring array to support monitoring and mitigation requirements; adaptive management to respond to new opportunities or identified impacts; and an integrated ocean management unit, with one regulator, responsible for marine environmental management as well as licensing.  Offshore wind cannot be considered in isolation and needs to be integrated with fisheries management initiatives and marine protected areas, MPA, designation.  The new marine planning and development management Bill could have addressed many of these issues but there is deep concern among many groups about whether it is currently adequate.  Nevertheless, there is still an urgent need for contemporary data to support evidence-based policies.</p> <p>  Ireland has a poor track record of environmental monitoring and enforcement and strong policies, supported by legislation, are necessary to ensure offshore marine renewable energy does not come at further cost to Ireland&rsquo;s depleted marine habitats and species.  Currently, our relevant State agencies and Departments are not resourced sufficiently to meet their obligations.  Planning applications will soon be lodged for an array of wind farms along the east coast, followed by the Celtic Sea over the next few years.  Wind farm development is currently industry-led and the Government needs to catch up and take the lead through policy initiatives.  A knowledge base for informed recommendations and policies should be built.  Making decisions under time pressures and meeting renewable energy targets could lead to bad decisions, which we will have to live with for many decades to come.</p></speech>

Mr. Kavanagh and I represent NORRI, which we started a few years ago.  The initiative did not actually come from us but from the local community, and from nature which desperately needs us now.  As we know marine habitats have been seriously degraded in the past 150 years, especially in coastal areas.  I worked for more than 20 years on the west and east coasts of the United States, addressing restoration of oyster habitats as well eelgrass beds and salt marshes.  It is essential that these three aspects of coastal ecosystems support each other.<br/><br/>Often when we restore our coastal systems, we choose and compromise between several different species or habitats.  NORRI is trying to address coastal ecosystem health to adapt resiliently and sustainably for climate change.  To mitigate the processes we are now experiencing we definitely need to integrate coastal restoration.  The role of marine habitats as an important carbon store is termed &quot;blue carbon&quot;.  Vegetated coastal habitats such as salt marshes, sea grasses and mangroves, though they comprise only 2% of ocean area, are estimated to store more than 50% of ocean organic carbon.<br/><br/>More and more research, especially through the Native Oyster Restoration Alliance, NORA, in Europe has shown that with shellfish blue carbon storage is very complex.  Oyster reefs and oyster habitats have globally been the most degraded coastal habitats.  There is perhaps between 1% and 5% of this habitat left.  When I teach restoration or management of coastal systems globally and locally, I can show my students examples of mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds and coral reefs but I cannot show them an example of a healthy oyster reef.  This is the reason we think restoration is the way to support biological diversity of coastal systems.  We believe oyster habitat and reefs, as well as kelp, were abundant on the Irish coast.  This is why we are trying to address the necessity of local restoration where we can become an example of this new, innovative approach - an automatic type of integrated coastal restoration of seagrasses, specifically here macro algae through kelp and the native oyster, <i>ostrea edulis.  </i>We know this is a very complex issue of averaging and showing the qualitative data because when there is a living organism that also provides a carbon sink, it also provides a carbon source.  That is why the new research showed how critical the restoration of keystone species, in this case <i>ostrea edulis</i>, is essential to enhance benthic and pelagic coupling.  We definitely need to ensure conservation management understands the need of integrated restoration of different keystone species and the habitats that used to thrive together for millions of years, and used to adapt together to climate changes and environmental changes in general.</p><p>There is so much to learn from those systems and species.  We have more and more evidence, thanks to new research and technologies, of the importance of the ecological services and functions of those missing habitats.  We do not have enough time to further prove the importance of those species and habitats for the health of our coastal systems, including water and food quality and human health.  </p><p> Recently I gave an international presentation on biodiversity for climate change which shows the importance of the healthy oyster systems which used to embrace every single continent.  These were an essential or keystone species and habitat, providing a nexus of food, water and energy between land, coastal systems and the open ocean.  We need to do everything possible to restore them locally.  Projects in Wicklow and in Ireland can serve as an example of local, innovative restoration to improve our coastal waters and our environment, to adapt to climate change and to enhance the long-term health of humans.  </p><p> I thank the committee for providing me with this opportunity to share some of my experiences.</p></speech>

Next we have Ms McMahon from the Sustainable Water Network, SWAN.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.211" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ellen McMahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021051100002#C00300"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee today.  The Sustainable Water Network is an umbrella network of 25 of Ireland&rsquo;s leading environmental NGOs, national and regional, working together to protect and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s aquatic resources.</p> <p>  We are in the midst of a climate and biodiversity emergency.  The Government's own assessment of the health of our seas in 2019 found that only six out of 11 indicators are compatible with good environmental status.  Our marine territory is ten times the size of our landmass and as an island nation, our seas and marine wildlife are at the heart of our culture, well-being and prosperity but I fear that we have turned our back on the seas.  Critically, our ocean is the planet's largest carbon sink.  It has absorbed 93% of the heat generated by industrial-era carbon dioxide emissions and it captures nearly 30% of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere every year.  The marine environment plays a key role in reducing climate stress through carbon regulation and storage.  It also provides opportunities for tourism and recreation, cultural heritage and education as well as physical and mental health benefits.</p> <p>  In 2019, the UN's biodiversity assessment stated that approximately 66% of the marine environment has been significantly altered by human actions.  It also identified that while overfishing is a threat to the health of our marine environment, our seas are under increasing pressure from a wide range of stressors, such as pollution, invasive species and climate change.  The situation in Ireland is stark.  The latest review of the birds of conservation concern in Ireland by Birdwatch Ireland and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has shown that iconic and much-loved seabird species such as puffins and kittiwakes are globally threatened and experiencing significant declines in Ireland.  Climate change, overfishing and changes to the food web are all playing a role in their decline.  Approximately 13% of our seabed, which is almost the equivalent in size to the entire landmass of the island of Ireland, is disturbed by bottom fishing activity.  Bottom trawling and dredging is only prohibited in three out of 90 of our marine special areas of conservation, SACs.  Bottom trawling is one of the most damaging activities to our marine environment.  It involves dragging heavy weighted nets across the sea floor in an effort to catch fish.  In doing so, it churns up seabed sediments which are the planet's largest carbon stores.  Bottom trawling is a major emitter of carbon with some studies showing that it emits as much carbon as the entire aviation industry. </p> <p>  At present, Ireland has designated a mere 2% of its seas as marine protected areas, MPAs.  MPAs are geographically defined areas which involve the protective or restorative management of a natural area according to management objectives.  We have failed to meet the UN's biological diversity target of protecting 10% of our marine area by 2020.  The current programme for Government commits to realising the target as soon as practical and sets a further target for 30% protection by 2030.  However, MPAs are not currently defined in Irish law, meaning our existing network only consists of EU marine sites such as SACs and special protection areas, SPAs.  In 2019, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government formed an expert advisory group to determine how to expand Ireland&rsquo;s MPA network and the expert group's report, Expanding Ireland&rsquo;s MPA Network, was published last year.  The report makes a number of strong and welcome recommendations.  A public consultation on the report is under way and we hope that the result will be ambitious legislation that provides for an ecologically coherent network of MPAs.  Worryingly, we have heard that MPA legislation is about two years away from enactment.  While we await this crucial legislation, large areas of our marine territory will be designated as activity zones for the expansion of offshore renewable energy, leaving MPAs to squeeze into the areas that remain.  This disparity between offshore wind and MPAs has been facilitated through the national marine planning framework.  We recognise the role that offshore renewable energy will play in decarbonising our economy and tackling climate change but MPAs are often overlooked in the role that they can play in addressing the twin climate and biodiversity emergencies.  A recent report has highlighted that globally, the rewilding of key blue carbon marine and coastal ecosystems could deliver carbon dioxide mitigation amounting to 1.83 billion tonnes, or approximately 5% of the emissions savings we need to make globally. </p> <p>  We are routinely failing to meet EU and international targets for the protection of biodiversity.  If we look to the UK and Northern Ireland, the North has designated approximately 38% of its inshore region as MPAs.  Last year the UK published the Benyon report which looked at the establishment of so-called highly protected marine areas, HPMAs.  HPMAs prohibit extractive, destructive and depositional uses and allow only non-damaging levels of other activities.  The panel's headline recommendation to the Government was that HPMAs are an essential component of the marine protected areas network and that they should be included in the Secretary of State waters.  We need the same in Ireland.  MPAs and HPMAs can work for biodiversity, climate, our fishing fleet and our coastal communities.  I urge Deputies, as legislators, to carefully consider the protection and restoration of our seas and marine environment in all of their decision-making, bearing in mind their duty to our future generations and the fact that in addition to reversing catastrophic biodiversity loss, all ocean action is climate action.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.213" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ken Whelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021051100002#C00500"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to make a submission on the subject of Atlantic salmon as an indicator of ocean-related climate change.</p> <p>  Atlantic salmon are regarded as a keystone species and play a unique and crucial role in our aquatic ecosystems.  A superb biological indicator, their migration pathways traverse lakes, rivers, estuaries and the high seas.  Tracking the movements and overall welfare of salmon stocks across these distinct biotopes can tell us a great deal about the health of our oceans and our freshwater resources.  As they migrate across these zones or domains, the salmon absorb into their bodies chemical and biological clues as to the overall state of our oceans and our freshwater systems. </p> <p>  Wild salmon, in their migrations across the oceans, are one of the natural world&rsquo;s most sensitive indicators of the biological and chemical effects of climate change.  Research has shown quite clearly that aquatic systems are changing and changing fast.  Water is getting warmer, storms are getting stronger and the availability of food resources in and from the ocean is under increasing pressure.  Oceans and atmosphere are intimately and inextricably linked.  Changes in the oceans are forcing unprecedented shifts in climate patterns.  </p> <p>  Similar patterns are apparent in fresh water, where we are witnessing unprecedented rainfall events resulting in deluges which have caused massive landslides and the dislocation of tonnes of mud, silt and peat.  Recently in Ireland in 2018 we also witnessed an intense drought and unprecedented increases in summer water temperatures.  The impacts of severe droughts on juvenile and adult salmon may well be far more serious than the more dramatic flood events. </p> <p>  Such climate perturbations are also causing major biological modifications including the appearance of new fish and other animal species off our coast and the spread of non-native, invasive species around the coast and in fresh water.  Atlantic salmon is an ideal bio-monitor to track and trace climate change from remote mountain streams to distant zones in the Arctic seas.</p><p>The salmon, which is equally at home in fresh and salt water, traverses large areas of the planet in a relatively short time but is endowed with an uncanny ability to find its way home.  Throughout its odyssey, the salmon collects and stores a wide range of physical, chemical and biological information.</p><p> Although the science surrounding the biology of salmon and other diadromous species is complex, the take home message is very clear: adaptation to climate change is in our hands.  Combating climate change requires a clear and unambiguous focus on monitoring change, responding quickly to that change, conserving biodiversity and relieving man-made stresses on the environment.</p><p> Salmon divided into the Atlantic and the Pacific forms more than 20 million years ago.  They have faced huge changes on many occasion over the millennia and have shown their ability to adapt to these changes.  Such biological adaptation needs time and space.  Mitigation implies doing a minimum in order for a particular species to survive.  On the other hand, adaptation gives the species time and space to recover and thrive.</p><p> For example, a large salmon returning to our rivers in spring takes five years, on average, to reach maturity, including two full winters at sea.  Each decade that passes, therefore, only provides two full cycles of spring salmon.  Genetic and biological adaptation to warmer oceans and higher freshwater temperatures will take a long time.  Faced with increasingly warmer oceans, salmon may not find it possible to adapt fast enough to the areas they now inhabit and will invariably seek out colder waters.  Over the coming decades they may seek out and flourish in the more northerly zones, which are currently too cold and inhospitable for them to live successfully.</p><p> If we wish to retain and increase the numbers of salmon in Ireland, we need to provide the fish with the marine and freshwater environments in which they can adapt and thrive.  Cold, clean water is fundamental to the salmon&rsquo;s survival.  Currently, management is focused, quite correctly, on salmon conservation and protection.  However, I would ask whether we have the ability to move fast enough to take advantage of any improvements that might happen in the environmental conditions in our rivers and our oceans and to implement stock rebuilding programmes.  Have we the systems in place to monitor and forewarn us of these changes?  Are we prepared to move quickly in adapting to the many and varied changes which the changing climate may well bring?</p><p> There is an ever increasing urgent need to establish refugia, or strongholds, for the very best genetic stocks and the most resilient salmon stocks.  Adaptation strategies require determined and co-ordinated efforts to reduce, mitigate and eliminate pressures on wild stocks of salmon.  This will ensure that the core stock of juvenile fish is available to take advantage of the full suite of adaptation strategies.</p><p> With in excess of 60 years of detailed monitoring data from the Marine Institute&rsquo;s Newport facility in County Mayo and a wide range of ocean data from the institute's offshore monitoring programmes, Ireland is ideally placed to directly monitor and advise on climate change events and likely climate change impacts.  Geographically, the seas around the island of Ireland are ideally placed to study these changes, located as we are between the cold seas to the north and the far warmer oceans to the south.</p></speech>

All members will agree they were incredibly interesting, educational and thought-provoking.  Unfortunately, we are limited to two hours, but we genuinely could have gone on for many more hours on last week's discussion on biodiversity.  There will be a lot of interest in this.  As the meeting is confined to two hours, can I get agreement from members that we will limit contributions to two minutes to ask questions?  There will then potentially be an opportunity for a second round of questions.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  That will also give the witnesses an opportunity to elaborate on their answers.</p></speech>

I could sit and listen to them for the entire day.  Coming from a fisheries background, I find this absolutely fascinating.</p> <p>  As a broad comment, it is interesting that even though the witnesses deal with different species, the biggest risk and potential for us to make a difference is for us to properly plan what happens with our marine areas.  The risk that we are not doing that is highly problematic.  It appears that we are potentially putting the cart before the horse when it comes to climate mitigation in respect of renewable energies if we implement them in the absence of protecting ecological areas.  That is a major problem.  If we do not put in place MPAs, what is the worst-case scenario for our biodiversity?  What is the potential for nature-based solutions or carbon capture in addressing our climate actions?</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Kavanagh.  I find his project interesting. He is based in Arklow, County Wicklow.  There are plans for three large-scale wind farms off the coast of Wicklow.  The coast of Wicklow is a pilot for how we manage to roll out these programmes and infrastructure.  He has worked on this project for quite a while and has the support of Wicklow County Council.  What are the barriers for his project with Professor Franki in terms of ramping it up and putting it in place before we have three large wind farms off the coast?  What are the synergies?</p></speech>

Professor Franki is in Croatia and I am in Wicklow.  We need a bigger team.  We need money for salaries and experts in the area to help us to establish the first pilot project off the coast.  Professor Franki has worked extensively with us on this and is very definite on how things should progress.  It is important that we get the nexus between land, coastal waters and the ocean where we want to do the trial right.  Site selection is hugely important.  Getting licences is another major issue we are facing.</p> <p>  Getting the funding to put a team together to do the project is an issue.  This is a major generational project which will go on for a long time.  We want to model it so that it can be recreated all over Ireland and the world as an example of how this kind of restoration should proceed.  Professor Franki can probably give the Deputy some insight on this as she has worked with large wind operators in the US where this has happened.  She might give her some insights about what is necessary for this project to go ahead.</p></speech>

We should all work together.  We all want the same for our coasts, including the MPAs for salmon, oysters or anything that nature used to have but does not have any more because of us.  Our initiative is to work with wind farms and all of the other development activities together and engage with the network of MPAs.</p> <p>  I was fortunate to work on establishing marine protected areas in other parts of the world.  That is essential.  I could share the experiences of science in areas where we showed how restoration is successful if those areas are no-take zones.  If we do not have areas as no-take zones we cannot have adaptations for climate change, biodiversity enhancement or healthy coasts, oceans and the world in general.  </p> <p>  How can we work together, with coastal managers, as Mr. Kavanagh said?  It is not just a question of funding.  Money is out there.  We need to work with developers and coastal managers, along with a political approach and vision, on how we want to go forward.  In Europe, we are beginning a large biomimicry network to learn from and base our solutions on nature, including how we can incorporate large wind farms that can become sources of biological diversity.  We tried that in the United States.  It worked in certain areas but not others.  We have enough science, technology, power and knowledge of how to do this.</p><p>This is the moment for all of us to work together and we have a couple of pilot projects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.220" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Simon Berrow" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021051100002#E00200"><p>That was very eloquent.  I am quite new to offshore wind farms.  As a group, we have concerns about their impact on whales and dolphins.  There was a lack of guidance for wind farm companies in that regard and that is why we produced our policy document, as well as to stimulate debate.  The reaction we have had from individual companies has been interesting.   We have been working with Wind Energy Ireland.  Many companies have thanked us and said that now they have something to discuss.  They can say that the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group recommends this and decide what they think about it.  There has been a lack of discussion at national level about how we want to roll out wind farms.  They are coming at us and they are a good thing.  They could be a negative thing or a neutral thing but I think they can be a very positive thing.  We are not giving guidance or putting baselines down.  We are not building capacity in our research community, not only to roll out pilot studies such as the oyster restoration project, but we are also not building capacity to monitor the effects.  We also need the adapted management Dr. Whelan talked about so we can feed back in real time and have a dynamic process.  To be honest, we are pushing an open door.  The wind farm companies we have spoken to are very open to all sorts of suggestions.  Ultimately, they want to harness the wind, get on the grid and make money.  They can make a lot of money.  The opportunity there is to work together to make sure it is a win-win situation.</p> <p>  There is great concern about how MPAs fit into this process because we are way behind.  We are ten years behind on the MPA roll-out and we are paying catch-up.  How we marry those different conflicts will be a challenge.  Ultimately, we need to support our planners and regulators, not just with research and science but with people on the ground.  It is quite shocking how long it takes to get a foreshore licence in Ireland at the minute.  A foreshore licence is the very basis of things.  If it takes 12 to 18 months to get a licence to deploy a simple device, how are we going to make informed decisions about wind farms and operational issues?  How will we integrate the positive biodiversity impacts that have been discussed?  We seriously need a national conversation about where we are going with managing our inshore marine sites.  A lot of the legislation is coming a bit late.  The question is how legislators can influence this process and what legislative incentives can be put in.  That is the challenge.  What power do members have to push this journey down the road we would like to go down?</p></speech>

I echo Dr. Berrow's sentiments.  Ten years ago, when I was working with the Marine Institute, we were talking about integrated coastal zone management in a very sophisticated sense.  We have not actually achieved that.  The integration of coastal zone management with the MPAs, with a clear focus on biodiversity, is really urgent at this stage because we have lost a full decade.  I was recently involved with a very innovative study carried out in Wales, where there are designated marine areas for marine renewables.  We have been looking at diadromous fish, which include eels, salmon, shad and so on, and seeing what can we do and how we can track the animals we are concerned about when putting a turbine into the marine area.  Those reports will be out very shortly and I have referenced them in my submission.  As Dr. Berrow said, we need to push the boat out here as regards research and development, but it must be integrated.  For too long, our science has been in silos and we need to start integrating this in a very real sense.  The ultimate goal here is marine resilience and we have to make sure MPAs have an integrated resilience to face into the issues we are facing as a result of climate change.</p></speech>

We know that the marine environment is in a completely degraded state and is on a downward trend in a lot of areas.  The national marine planning framework is facilitating that disparity.  What will eventually underpin that is the marine planning and development management Bill.  MPAs are not included under the current heads of that Bill.  The Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage made some very welcome recommendations on that Bill, including two specific ones.  First, it recommended that MPAs be allowed under that legislation so we could designate through it.  The second recommendation was that interim protections be provided using sensitivity mapping.  That is something we want to see included.  We would look at the features, habitats and species we need to designate in our network and could do sensitivity mapping to look at the pressures that act on those features.  Then we can steer offshore renewable energy away from those sensitive areas.  That is what we need here, quite urgently.</p></speech>

Everybody welcomes that to reach our climate targets but also as employment for rural coastal communities.  What we hear less of is the potential for jobs in biodiversity, natural capital and research.  I was particularly interested in Dr. Whelan's statement about the Newport facility in County Mayo.  Do we need investment in that facility to ramp it up?  Do we need other similar facilities in coastal areas to boost Ireland's reputation for marine research, as well as for job creation in natural capital?  Responses from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications show that Ireland is way below the EU average when it comes to research and development funding.  Are there issues we should push as legislators to steer this?  As Professor Frankic said, the funding is there but people have to have the political will to put the plan in place and look for that funding.  What should we be doing in that regard to create potential from our marine habitats, not just to protect the biodiversity but for those coastal communities?</p> <p>  Offshore wind farms are going ahead on the east coast.  Is there a remit for some sort of independent inspection system for them in order that the operators will be compliant when they are being developed, while in operation and further down the line if they are ever dismantled?  Do we need some sort of system to monitor their compliance with the applications to protect the marine environment?</p></speech>

There is no doubt that we are lagging way behind.  We have some good initiatives in our third-level institutions but there is not enough there and not enough people working on them.  There are so many questions we could answer but we are not doing so.  It takes a few years.  If a PhD student is on a project, it will take three or four years to get answers on management issues or how to enhance biodiversity.  We need to start this now because my fear is that planning applications will drop on people's desks for offshore wind farms along the east coast very soon, if not this year.  How are we going to evaluate them, and how do we then build in more progressive enhancement projects, if we are playing catch-up?  There is no doubt that offshore wind is driving the whole process in Ireland with our policy initiatives but the Government needs to take the lead, perhaps through guidance and showing people how it wants them to do things.</p> <p>  I agree with the Senator about building capacity in our coastal communities to support those wind farms jobs, as well as research and monitoring.  It all goes hand in hand.  That is important.  I have forgotten her other question.</p></speech>

From speaking to wind farm companies, they want certainty but they are not getting it from the Government.  They are investing hundreds of millions of euro but they are not even sure whether they will get planning permission or what the monitoring or decommissioning obligations are.  It is not helpful to them either.  They would like a lot more certainty when they are investing hundreds of millions of euro over 20 or 30 years.  It would be good for everybody.</p> <p>  How do we build policy to try to enhance what we have been speaking about?  I was struck by a new project in Scotland, the Scottish marine environmental enhancement fund, which is supported by the wind farm companies.  They are putting money into a fund for the type of projects we are speaking about.  They are directly involved and it is directly relevant.  We do not have to reinvent the wheel.  There are many experiences we can gain from other countries.  What fits well for Germany does not necessarily fit well in Ireland.  What fits in the UK may not be appropriate here.  Let us use what has happened elsewhere and make it fit for purpose for Ireland.</p></speech>

Nature-based solutions provide approximately one third of climate change mitigation globally but they attract less than 3% of the funds to address climate change.  There is definitely a need for investment to support job creation in the sector.  In terms of an independent agency for monitoring enforcement of offshore renewable energy, under the marine planning Bill, the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, will be established.  This regulatory agency will look at compliance with regard to offshore renewable energy.  What the exact remit or functions of the agency will be I do not have to hand but certainly we need an independent agency that can monitor the effects of these sites on the marine ecosystem and to look at decommissioning.  It will be a learning experience but having an independent regulatory or enforcement agency would be very beneficial.</p></speech>

We really have to think laterally.  Through the Atlantic Salmon Trust we set up another group, the Missing Salmon Alliance, to fundraise privately for the big issues that are facing salmon.  We are funding the likely suspects framework through which we are trying to identify exactly what is happening and what we can do to try to mitigate it.</p> <p>  I very much agree with what Professor Franki said earlier.  There is a lot of money but at present what we are doing is following the old method of approaching the research.  The answer to the question as to whether we need more Newports is that we do.  We have a huge opportunity here.  We have two opportunities.  We have a national need, as we have been outlining, and we also have an international opportunity.  We are sitting on the edge of climate change.  Climate change is happening in the ocean off the west coast.  We are sitting on the very edge of this change.  We really have a fantastic opportunity to roll out research and development so we can support it.  Certainly in the context of marine renewables, there are all sorts of models, as Dr. Berrow mentioned earlier, that we can follow in terms of integrating the finance available through venture capital and new businesses with our research needs, and make absolutely certain that the biodiversity component is at its core, which, in the past, may not have been the case.</p> <p>  A few years ago, I was privileged to be part of a Government review looking at the whole question of aquaculture licensing, which has been very difficult down the years.  Dr. Berrow mentioned the question of foreshore licences and how slow it is to issue them.  I am really fearful that we are beginning to repeat the errors we made in the past in the development of other marine industries.  We really need to be fleet of foot and look at these things laterally, and be highly creative in terms of looking at the opportunities and going for them with a modest amount of State investment but an awful lot of intellectual investment.</p></speech>

We need to create not just jobs for today but for the future, which is why I am optimistic when I see my students.  There is a solution for every problem we have today.  We have to see it, as Dr. Whelan said, as an opportunity.  We have to work together on this.</p> <p>  We created a programme to adopt a student for a green job, for which someone does not have to be aged ten or 70.  My students can be 85 years old.  This is where we need to work together to create the circular economy we speak about so theoretically.  When my students leave my classroom, I do not know where they go and whether they find a job.  Through adopt a student for a green job we can follow them when they stop studying.  They can find their niche.</p> <p>  We need to start working with companies so these students can find their niche, support their local communities and find the solutions and be part of them, and not constantly be depressed with what is going on in the world today.  Between the pandemic and climate change, my students ask me how I can smile.  They ask me what I am on.  I ask them to think about how we can use these circumstances as an opportunity to go back to nature and the human race, and be positive and use the resources of which we have more now than ever.  Let us think about what we have today.  We have knowledge, technology and resources.  Even nature, which is screaming for help, will work with us.  This is why we have to be positive and use this opportunity to build.</p> <p>  What is missing is an example.  If we take Wicklow as an example, NORRI received a small grant for educational purposes with regard to everybody from kindergarten to the elderly.  The elderly would love to contribute because they have traditional cultural knowledge that we are missing from the story.  It would be great if we could create an example in Ireland or any other country, and I also speak about this when I am in Croatia, whereby we could show what we mean by sustainable development, resilience and linking science with technology and solutions.  We do not have a living laboratory such as this.  This is why Mr. Kavanagh and I put this together in Wicklow.  We have the money and we would like to work with the committee to showcase the living laboratory in the local community.  If we do not show the solutions to local communities, we will cause even more damage and depression than ever.</p></speech>

All of the witnesses are marine biologists and scientists.  The near coastal environment 1 km or 2 km out is a nursery ground and it is extremely important.  The wind farms we are speaking about in Wicklow start at six or seven miles out to sea but the couple of kilometres that are very close to shore are vital nursery grounds, particularly the kelp forest.  When the mussel reefs and oyster reefs establish underneath them, they are phenomenally beautiful and biodiverse ecosystems.</p> <p>  The kelp forests off the coast of Sussex, for example, were hundreds of square kilometres but less than 5% of them remain because of trawling.  These were vitally important to north Atlantic herring.  The herring laid their eggs on the kelp fronds.  Following the herrings were sea birds, whales and dolphins.  There were entire ecosystems that migrated around Britain and Ireland but they have been wiped out and destroyed.  These ecosystems start with the near shore environment.  The kelp forests and oyster reefs are the basis of what we are trying to do.</p> <p>  With regard to jobs and what the Senator said, if we have these ecosystems close to shore, the potential for biotechnology, local fisheries, marine tourism, study and science is phenomenal.</p><p>A huge number of jobs will come from that but we need a belt around Ireland.  We talk about green belts around cities and urban centres but Ireland, as a country, needs a green belt.  Rather, it needs a red, brown and green belt, which are the colours of our seaweed, a couple of kilometres deep around our coastline.  That belt needs to be protected, not just dots of marine protected areas.  We need that belt right around the Ireland that will be a nursery ground for our fisheries and the sustainable development of our marine economy.</p></speech>

It was really interesting listening to them and reading what they sent to us in advance.  There is significant benefit to what they are telling us, because the national marine planning framework is being rushed through the D&aacute;il.  We had little time to discuss it.  We had a row about the lack of allocation of real time to discuss it on the floor of the Parliament.  We will be voting on it next week or the following week.  It is causing significant frustration for those of us who are on this committee and want to see these things as connected.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, we know the way parliamentary democracy works in that one Department does this and the other Department does that and they do not join the dots.  They must join up because if they do not, we will make a bags of this.</p> <p>  I particularly want to ask Ms McMahon what she thinks of the marine planning guidelines.  Why is our protection of marine biodiversity areas so poor and unenforceable and what impact that will have on climate mitigation in the longer term?  We all fear that the guidelines before us and the Bill that may follow will do long-term harm to climate action, never mind biodiversity and the tragedy unfolding before us in terms of our natural resources and wildlife.</p> <p>  I want to ask the panel about one issue which bothers me.  What I see happening in terms of the marine planning framework is the wholesale privatisation of our natural resources.  In Ireland, we are blessed to live on the edge of the Atlantic, not just because, as Mr. Kavanagh said, we have this wonderful biodiversity and nature sitting on our doorstep which is the solution in many ways for the future to address climate change, but we can also harness renewable energies at a rate at which probably very few other countries can do, if we do it right.  </p> <p>  My worry is the wholesale privatisation of that project is not overseen, funded, run and led by the State, rather it is a free-for-all in terms of what companies want to compete for what bits of our ocean they can grab up.  It is a dangerous prospect for the future.  I would like to hear comment from the other witnesses on that.</p></speech>

They only apply to the foreshore, so areas beyond 12 nautical miles are limited to designations under the habitats directive or the OSPAR Convention.  The habitats and species which are not listed in these directives but might be locally, nationally or internationally important cannot be afforded the necessary protections.</p> <p>  The biggest issue we have with the national marine planning framework is that the plan we have at present does not meet the objectives of the marine spatial planning directive.  Under article 5(2) of the directive, the objective is that these plans should contribute to "the preservation, protection and improvement of the environment, including resilience to climate change".  However, by leaving out MPAs, that objective will not be met.  That is why we recommend, at a minimum, there be sensitivity mapping to guide the development zones away from these sensitive areas.  </p> <p>  There are other issues with the plan in that there are data gaps.  The plans also need to take into account the temporal and spatial distribution of all activities, current and future, which is not there for all sectors in the current plan.</p> <p>  In addition to the lack of legislation for MPAs, enforcement is a huge issue.  The European Court of Justice is taking Ireland to court over our failure to implement management plans across all of our current designated sites.  Whether that is from a lack of resources, I am not 100% sure, but it is of massive concern.  We need to get management sites in for the sites we have, get on with designating our MPAs and address the disparity between the national marine planning framework or we will exacerbate the issues that exist.</p></speech>

There is huge potential there.  It is the job of Government to make sure a good percentage of those resources are going back to the local communities and the Irish economy.  We do not want a situation in which all those profits are going overseas.  Absolutely, there is a danger they can be privatised with all the profits going overseas.  They could be traded on the Stock Exchange and Ireland could get very little out of it.</p> <p>  We have had meetings with the developers of the Codling Bank and SSE Airtricity which are developing the Kish Bank off Arklow with wind farms and they are both extremely interested in working with us and doing some kind of environmental restoration around the wind turbines, so there is a good opportunity for us to work with the wind industry.  </p> <p>  However, because, we assume, the locations of the wind farms will become no-fish zones, they are excellent areas for all kinds of marine restoration.  We are also interested in the near-coast habitats such as kelp forests and so forth as a means of protecting vital nursery grounds for offshore fisheries.</p> <p>  I work in the fishing industry, in processing.  There is a huge interest on its part.  It is incredible people talk about the fishing industry as being the enemy sometimes but it is very important.  Especially in terms of oyster restoration, it is important some of these beds and reefs are worked, fished and managed for them to succeed, so there is a huge tie-in with the industry.  The fish processing industry is also interested in what we are working with.  It has been invited to our workshops to partake in discussions on how the industry can work together with farms and everyone involved.</p></speech>

When looking at it in that way, we obviously need the private sector to come in and invest in those areas.  In my experience, part of the problem often is when a plan is presented and discussions start at the planning stage.</p> <p>  In reality, the concept stage is when one needs to integrate the long-term needs of the nation with, perhaps, the short-term to medium-term needs of an industrial involvement.  It comes back to planning and coastal zone management.  I agree completely.  That is what I had in mind for seaweeds and those areas close to the coast.  </p> <p>  We need to do what we cleverly did with Galway Bay when we designated it as a smart bay with a view to getting industry to look at it as a test bed.  We need to be designating smart bays and coastlines, starting the discussions at the conceptual stage and bringing those private sector industries with us so that we do not have any conflict in the future between the resources which belong to the State and the need to be able to utilise them for our energy needs.</p></speech>

"Our marine environment" is probably the key part of that sentence.  I have written down here "wind farm companies do not own the wind" and they do not own the waves.  However, as Dr. Whelan said we need them to invest because it is a high-risk business, especially when coming off the south, east and west coasts.  Fixed turbines are the only show in town.</p><p>Floating offshore wind is a minimum of ten years away, with huge capital costs.  We need these companies to come in and invest in capturing that resource and that potential.</p><p> Dr. Whelan asked what our vision is as an island nation.  At the moment, consultation with stakeholders, be that coastal communities or, more importantly, the fishing industry tends to run through the planning process.  By the time a project has gone out to consultation, the plan is already in place.  One is asked one's opinion but it is very late to influence what is going on.  We need to take one step back and have a vision for how we want to manage our coastal resources through coastal management.</p><p> What is the engagement in terms of our fishing industry?  Certainly, inshore fishers are very fearful.  They do not know what is happening.  They are fearful of marine protected areas, MPA, and offshore wind farms.  In fact, they should be one of the biggest supporters and champions of it going forward.  They are not consulted, however.  They do not know what it looks like.  As Deputy Smith said, it is almost like we are selling off the resource, telling them "Off you go" and saying we will pick a few crumbs up at the end.</p><p> To take that step back and look at the vision takes that big planning perspective.  My fear is that we are slow in doing that and we are running away with ourselves.  To take that one step back and have that vision is difficult.  Obviously, the national marine planning framework gave us that opportunity.  The concern, certainly within the NGO community, is that there is no room and space for debate and that it is being rushed through.  It is a huge opportunity to provide that legal framework for planning the next 20 to 30 years of how we manage our inshore resources.  It is a race against time, however.  It is a very good question and one that we need to discuss in a national conversation, not just with people who live on the coast.  We are all islanders.  Even a person who lives in County Offaly is an islander and only an hour and a half from the coast.  We, therefore, need that national conversation.</p></speech>

It is very hard for me to say because I work on both sides of the legislation in trying to understand the need for MPAs and private ownership.  We sometimes need to start understanding it from the side of nature instead, however.</p> <p>  I often raise my hand and say that I represent an oyster or a whale.  Who owns them?  How are we going to have this relationship honestly between nature and private ownership, community ownership and access and public access and everything else?.  In the end, all species, including humans, need healthy oceans, healthy food and healthy energy.  That is all I can say.  Private ownership can become a problem if it is greedy and unhealthy.</p></speech>

That might speed things up.</p> <p>  I agree completely with Dr. Berrow that this is a race against time.  We must devise the correct role for the State, which is to align public and private activity in the delivery of the public good.  Does Dr. Barrow believe the State currently has the capacity within it, by which I mean the skills and ability, to do the sort of model to which he referred, that is, early consultation leading through to perhaps the State itself becoming a platform provider?  I know that has been mooted as a possible way to manage this effectively, quickly and safely.  Dr. Berrow might furnish us with information about the optimal State strategy.</p> <p>  Given the urgency of climate action, Professor Franki might respond as to whether there is capacity in the marine environment to quickly enhance the capacity to absorb carbon.  Can that be included in the inventories of the Paris Agreement?  Is there, to use that awful phrase, low-hanging fruit in the marine environment where we could start to deliver greenhouse gas mitigation quickly and safely?</p></speech>

It is a difficult question.   Clearly, I do not believe we have the capacity in the key agencies that are charged with responsibility for the marine and biodiversity.  It is very welcome that a review of the National Parks and Wildlife Service is under way.  It is badly needed.  It has been pushed between Departments for many years and it is chronically under-resourced.  That is welcome but it will take time.  Do we have the time to build that capacity?  I am not sure.</p> <p>  The marine sector is fragmented.  To get a licence for this or permission for that, it is all over the place.  For many years, different governments have suggested that we need a proper Department with responsibility for the marine and a proper marine sector.  Obviously, the Marine Institute has grown hugely in recent years and has been playing a very important role in co-ordinating marine strategy and research.  It is only an agency, however.  How do we pull those together in a timely fashion to address the very urgent issues?  I am not really too sure, to be honest.  It is probably a bit beyond my pay scale.  The bottom line is, no.</p> <p>  I look at the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which has three or four marine people who have to cover everything from benthic to marine mammals to sea birds, and all planning applications, and comment on it in a knowledgeable way.  They do the best they can.  Many of us, including Ms McMahon, have called for perhaps an independent agency that represents all parts of it, which can take on that responsibility, including monitoring.  I am not sure if that is the best answer but I am afraid it is the best I can come up with at the moment.</p></speech>

We have done much regarding carbon sinks on land and to paraphrase my colleagues, carbon dioxide in science is not pollution in nature for any species or organisms.  They thrive on it and we need to start understanding that.  On the land, we are trying to restore the soil with micro-organisms, fungi and bacteria.  We are now understanding how important that is for carbon sinks and nutrient replenishing.  It is the same in the ocean.  We need to start understanding how oceans and coastal systems work.  Our historic data used to show what used to thrive in our coastal waters, for instance, where and how abundant Atlantic salmon was and the nexus between the land, coast and ocean.</p> <p>  To make it short, in certain areas where I worked closely on this, specifically Chesapeake Bay, we have already shown that it is necessary to restore systems together and not separately in silos.  That is how they support each other.  I am talking right now about eel grass beds, oyster beds and salt marshes, for example.  Then on the other side we have mangroves, oysters, coral reefs, etc.</p> <p>  Our case, and Mr. Kavanagh also mentioned a blue belt around Ireland, is that we need to select, together with Ms McMahon and everybody else, the sites in which we can create marine protected areas, restore and enhance what we used to have there and showcase how important that is for not only carbon sinks, which are not only thriving and supporting life, but also nitrogen and nutrient sinks.</p> <p>  I could go on and on, by the way.</p></speech>

I was extremely struck by the heat aspect in that this is not simply around carbon being absorbed or not, and the very direct impact that temperature has in terms of marine life and habitat.  I would be interested to see any further notes the witnesses have on that heat aspect because that is the very direct impact of climate change.</p> <p>  I was also very interested in the projects.  The Cuan Beo project in Galway, of which Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, and others will be aware, is similarly trying to look at Galway Bay.  I want to ask about three areas.</p><p>I wanted to ask about three areas, one of which is public research.  I heard a really strong call for public research and development and indeed possibly public-public partnerships.  Dr. Berrow mentioned the idea of open access information - the exchange of information.  Again, we are looking for the research and development to be partly State-led and public body-led and engage with communities around how we drive this so we create a context in which public-private partnerships may happen.  It is about the importance of a really strong and open exchange because these same issues are happening across the world and it is important that there be a public exchange of information between states and public actors on this.  Do the witnesses have any comments to make on that? <br/><br/>Regarding the industry-led piece not being enough and the dangers of a case-by-case approach, the witnesses described companies trying out different approaches in good faith but how <i>ad hoc</i>that can be.  We heard from Wind Energy Ireland about how it changed what it did in terms of noise in response to community engagement but in the case of seismic activity, which is the underwater equivalent of that, we will not hear submissions from dolphins and marine life.  Could the witnesses comment on that seismic issue and the importance of the precautionary principle, particularly with regards to that?  It speaks to that precautionary principle.  We have a situation where the planning framework exists in advance of the protected areas.  What are the interim protections we put in right now for even that two or three-year period to ensure we do not do damage that is hard to reverse?  Is it around using the German noise thresholds?  Is it around limiting bottom trawling?  Is it around the mapping of sensitive areas?  Is it a very strict limitation of foreshore licences, as Mr. Kavanagh mentioned, during the period of time during which we look very carefully at foreshore development?  What can we do in the next two years to ensure that huge ground has not been lost and species have not been lost?  <br/><br/>I think Professor Franki commented very eloquently in terms of nature-based solutions and the importance of them not being simply seen as storage units.  When I go to climate talks, they talk about mangrove or kelp and not those little interconnections - the ecosystem.  It is about the importance of habitat versus simply nature's service so that nature-based solutions are about habitats.</p></speech>

This is really important in the context of trying to look at what I mentioned earlier, which is the new vision for trying to plan this.  I mentioned earlier than I am a very firm believer in getting people together at the conceptual stage.  There is also the fact that we need to show people how effective this can be.  A first-class article in <i>The Irish Times</i>some years ago was written by a colleague of mine, Mark Costello.  He worked in New Zealand for many years and encountered groups of fishermen who were hugely sceptical about marine protected areas.  In the article, he described how he won them over through demonstrating to them the effectiveness of marine protected areas and how their communities were able to benefit from that.  Perhaps it is time for representation from our various coastal communities to see what we are talking about in terms of not just scientific papers but practical results.  If enthusiasm was building as a result of that sort of connection between the discussions where enthusiasm was building for different sorts of marine renewables and marine protected areas, it will alleviate a huge amount of the delay that is ongoing in our planning process.  If I understand it correctly, the message from us all is to think about what comes before planning because that is critical in terms of getting people on board and moving forward.</p></speech>

We are creating a large European council of purpose to bring nature-based solutions to public knowledge and showcase what solutions exist and where they can find and implement them.  This relates to the Senator's question about public research and participation, the precautionary principle and nature-based solutions.  It is all connected in how to live resiliently and sustainably and not compete with each other.  I was always told that in nature, competition leads everything and it does not.  We are now learning more and more that it is collaboration.  It is sharing.  That is how we need to start seeing nature and start learning from systems around that.</p> <p>  Regarding public research, this is something Mr. Kavanagh and I included in the NORRI Biomimicry LivingLabs we are starting everywhere - wherever students want to participate and include their research because all of the research we are doing is trying to address local community needs.  This is where public participation is necessary because if we are doing the research, publish the papers and give us the PhD student, that is not the goal anymore.  We need to figure out how those researchers in science and technology will solve local problems.  This is where the Biomimicry LivingLabs were very helpful because students were working with different stages and ages of education together with the local community.  They were translating their knowledge - each other's knowledge - and working together to solve the problem.  This is how I see this working in future.</p></speech>

We need to remember that wind farm companies are competing for licences.  There is a bit of a scramble to get in there first in some ways.  Some of the areas of interest overlap so we are seeing that in terms of site surveys, one company will go out one day and on the following day, the same team of observers on the same vessel will go and survey the site next door to it.  There is significant duplication of effort and a significant increase in disturbance so that this seems crazy.  I appreciate that there is commercial competition here so they need all their own data.  Where does the State obligation begin and end and where does that of private companies begin and end?  We suggest that if there were some data sets that were common to all and could be shared, one would not need to go and do it again.  This suggestion has been quite well received by the wind farm companies.  It could be whale and dolphin surveys, sea bird surveys or benthic surveys.  This approach makes sense.</p> <p>  There is a lot of pressure on them for acoustic monitoring because a lot of the impact of offshore wind would be acoustic affecting acoustic creatures like whales and dolphins.  It has been increasingly shown that fish and crustaceans are very acoustic.  What is the point in each company having its own acoustic monitoring?  Why do we not have an independent acoustic array where each company can tap into that data so they are not duplicating the effort?  Does the State step in there and run that array?  Is it State-run with industry funding?  Can we piggyback other issues such as Dr. Whelan's transponders for tracking salmon through these monitoring stations?  Can we meet marine strategy framework directive obligations at the same time?  One array can achieve a lot of objectives in everybody's interests.  That would be far more efficient for them and far more beneficial for the State.  There are examples out there that we should consider.  </p> <p>  We mentioned the observed contract.  A new contract has been put out for inshore aerial surveys.  This is State-funded so the data is freely accessible because it has been paid for by the taxpayer.  Everyone can tap into it.  This will enable these site surveys but on a larger spatial scale.  There are examples that can be done.  Perhaps the State needs to be a bit more aggressive in pushing these initiatives.  </p> <p>  The Senator mentioned seismic surveys.  There are guidelines for that.  I will leave it at that and come back later.</p></speech>

We need a list of the features, habitats and species we want to designate within an MPA network and we have the criteria that would make it an ecologically coherent network.  We have an awful lot of data, both at a national level and from citizen science, about what features we need to protect.  We would like them to be listed and identified by location, with an assessment of the pressures to these features.  That is where interim protection measures can be provided in the absence of the MPA legislation, which is so far down the line.  That is how we would go about getting the interim protections in place in the meantime.</p></speech>

I am again struck by how none of this can be done in isolation and the era of siloed thinking is over.  Do our guests see in governments - I mean governments globally - the humility to accept this and the imagination and emotion to create the transformation we need, even though it is backed up by hard data and evidence?</p> <p>  The story of the salmon is very powerful and is the way in which we should engage on this, in terms of hearts and minds, especially in Ireland.  The salmon means so much to us, going back to the days of the brad&aacute;n feasa.  Has the narrative yet to be exploited fully?  I refer to public engagement to overcome political siloed thinking and to put a cultural ownership stamp on this as opposed to the purely business and industrial aspect.  Dr. Whelan might comment on that.</p></speech>

The year 2019 was designated the international year of the salmon and it gave us an opportunity for the first time to talk in detail with our colleagues in the Pacific, where similar cases to that which we are seeing in the Atlantic are occurring.  It also offered us the opportunity to start thinking about how we can utilise the iconic nature of the salmon to get across the information about the changing ocean situation and climate change impacts in fresh water.  That has been extraordinarily successful and I will send to the committee some website links to material put together through the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization and a sister body in the Pacific.  When this iconic creature was used, people suddenly started to engage with the reality of ocean climate and the commonalities between the Pacific and the Atlantic.  That is a key point.  It does not rest just with the salmon.  We need to start utilising other creatures, both aquatic and terrestrial, to highlight to people how indicative they are of the circumstances we as humans may face in future.</p></speech>

There has been a shift even in the past three years.  The high nature ambition coalition this year is calling on governments throughout the world to increase the levels of ambition in regard to marine protection.  It is about capitalising on that, continuing on that trajectory and, ultimately, inspiring coastal communities.  In future we might see the roll-out of coastal partnerships.  It is about giving a voice to those local communities in order that we will have a two-pronged approach, from the Government and the coastal communities.  That is how we will drive change.</p> <p>  There are some brilliant examples.  I worked in New Zealand for a year on marine protection, and the way in which that country wins that hearts and mind argument is very successful.  In Ireland, I would love our legislators to be species champions, that is, people we can look to as champions for habitats and species who can help to win those hearts and minds.  I am optimistic.  The narrative is changing and let us keep going down that track.</p></speech>

Sometimes it is a struggle that we have constantly to repeat our message because politicians change every two or four years, and we have to waste a lot of time and energy.</p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Cronin, I do not know of any specific place where it is working or any country that can show they live sustainably and have managed resources in the way in which we are talking about.  We are all connected with those resources.  That cannot be isolated.  There cannot be one country that is working with something we all depend on and share, and degrade.  That is why Ireland is a perfect example of an island where those issues can be presented in an exemplary manner to the rest of Europe and the world.</p></speech>

In today's money at the restaurant table, that would be worth somewhere around &euro;90 million.  It was resourced and managed by local fishermen and protected for more than 100 years, but in the end, bad management and legislation from the government at the time led to the destruction of the entire fishery.</p> <p>  We are trying to bring local people back into touch with what is happening offshore.  What is under the water is usually out of mind and that is a big problem.  We want to restore kelp forests.  In County Wicklow, there are Avondale and Kilmacurragh, famous forests that everybody knows, and we should have the same in the ocean.  We should have forests with names that people can identify with and cameras that can show them the beauty and diversity that is down there under the water.  Ordinary people cannot connect with it, whereas in the 1860s, the fishing communities on the east coast could do so because they were so tied to it and it was so vital for their survival.  It no longer is and this is a different time.  Helping people reconnect with the marine and coastal environment is vital.</p> <p>  I do not necessarily believe the Government will do that, given that governments change regularly, but rather local communities.  Governments can certainly help with legislation and the laws regarding trawling and so on, which could destroy those local habitats, but ultimately the local communities, when they have pride in and knowledge of what is out there, will protect it and it will self-sustain from there.</p></speech>

People are demanding it now.  They want circumstances to change and need to see some positive things happening, and Covid has made that even more the case.  Perhaps the inertia stems somewhat from vested interests.  Our challenge relates to how the Government should give power and responsibility to those who are most affected.  Can we give them the mechanisms to take responsibility and manage their local patches, as Mr. Kavanagh was saying?  It is something the Government can do and I implore it to go down that road.</p></speech>

I have found this session very interesting.  For anybody who has an interest in the maritime and aquatic world and marine ecosystems and wildlife, it has been essential viewing, as is probably the case for anybody interested in the future of this country and our oceans.</p><p>I thank all the witnesses for their incredible contributions.  I have a few specific questions for specific witnesses and I will start with Dr. Berrow.  Could I have a few more specifics on the potential impact of offshore floating wind farms in terms of their construction?  Are any studies being done on how that will impact on cetaceans?  I ask Dr. Berrow that because he is representing the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, IWDG.  I ask also about the actual structure itself, including the hanging anchors which will, I suppose, be like the spokes of a wheel from the actual turbine.  From the science we know, will the impact be negative or will there be potential for little ecosystems to form underneath those wind farms?  I would like Dr. Berrow to elaborate on that.</p><p> Apparently, there is an increase in the number of cetaceans, such as the humpback whale.  Four or five years ago, I kept a keen eye on the IWDG's humpback whale catalogue.  Three or four years ago, the number was 33 animals.  That number has increased to well over 100 in the space of approximately four or five years.  There is clearly something happening there.  Are more people observing them?  Is there more food here for them and, if so, is that a result of climate action?  I would like a comment on that because a record number of basking sharks have been reported this year.  I spoke to the IWDG's sightings officer, P&aacute;draig Whooley, recently, and there has been a peak in the sightings of basking sharks.  Is this all connected?  Is there something happening there in terms of food, particularly off the south-west coast?</p><p> This question is to Dr. Franki, and Deputy Bruton asked my question on carbon capture.  In terms of oyster reefs and kelp forests, is there potential there for the prevention of coastal erosion?  We are seeing more severe weather events and more storms and waves battering our coasts.  Do these become really important not just in terms of carbon capture, but in terms of stopping our coastlines from flooding and eroding?  I would like to hear a comment on that.</p><p> I would like to ask Ms McMahon about sensitivity mapping, which has to happen.  How quickly can that happen?  Is the data out there?  Obviously, we are talking about where our inshore fishing fleet fish and where cetaceans gather.  Although the IWDG provides a fantastic cetacean atlas, it is still very dependent on citizen science.  How quickly can we get the appropriate sensitivity mapping that can enable us to make decisions on, for example, the location of a large offshore wind farm?</p><p> My next question is to Mr. Kavanagh.  Obviously, we cannot talk about things maritime if we do not talk about the fishing sector.  I had very interesting meeting last night with members of the inshore fishing sector.  It seems they are very keen to work with NGOs and with Government in regard to areas that have been productive in the past for inshore fishing fleets.  This relates to boats under 18 m and whitefish and non-quota shellfish.  For them, the variety of the catch is very important.  For example, if there was a ban on a certain whitefish, there is a fear the fleet would then target non-quota shellfish and that that could have a negative impact.  I would like some comments on where the inshore fishing fleet fits in terms of a healthy marine environment.</p><p> There are a lot of specific questions there.  I am sorry I left Dr. Whelan out.  His presentation was incredibly interesting but, unfortunately, we are pressed for time.</p></speech>

There were a lot of questions there.  To start with the question on floating offshore wind, clearly fixed wind is the main gig and people are quite aware of the impacts of construction operations in terms of acoustic impacts.  Floating offshore wind is much more of an unknown.  A few floating offshore wind farms have been in deployed in Scotland and I think there is one in Portugal but they are quite small.  Therefore, we are speculating to a certain extent on the potential impacts.  They seem to be more benign.  There is still debate on how to best fix the turbines with drag anchors, which obviously can have an impact on the benthos, but it is quite limited, on whether there is an entanglement risk, on what species would be most at risk, on the noise of them, on what they would sound like, on what frequency band they would be in, on how far it would travel and on which species would be most sensitive to those noises.  In terms of running the cable ashore, there would be concerns about electromagnetic fields and whether that would impact on elasmobranches, which would be particularly sensitive and about how far that would travel.  We are still very much in the unknown, and that is where the research comes in.  We deploy, we monitor, we feed back, we change, and we work with the designers to try to be as efficient as possible and minimise impacts.</p> <p>  Ireland could lead the way.  We have the wave energy test site off north County Mayo and there is a project called Afloat, which aspires to deploy a full-scale floating offshore wind device by 2023, so that we can see what they look like, what they sound like and see what the drag anchors do and do all that kind of primary research.</p> <p>  At the moment, the impact of floating offshore wind is unknown.  There will be large areas that are excluded from some activities.  Will that be positive?  Will they act as fish aggregating devices?  Will they create artificial reefs?  Can we put mechanisms in place to enhance that biodiversity?</p> <p>  There are lots of questions.  The members, as decision-makers, need to have a knowledge-based decision-making process.  We need to have that empirical data, the research, the monitoring and the baseline reference values, so that we can say with a certain level of confidence that if we do something, we think something might happen or will happen.  The members can then make an informed decision.  At the moment, I do not think the research is there for members to make an informed decision.  We have been borrowing things from other countries and, perhaps, some of them are not appropriate.</p> <p>  In terms of humpback whales and basking sharks, these are charismatic megafauna, which people can relate to.  They are bringing good news stories to Ireland.  The number of humpback whales is increasing worldwide.  They are showing incredible resilience, as a result of protective measures.  As human beings, if we do the right thing and make the right management decisions, marine species can respond.  In some ways, they will respond much more quickly to those on land.  This is not the case with all species.  Some species and habitats are, in some ways, beyond recovery.  We talk about champions that people can relate to.  We are privileged in Ireland to be among these species.  We need to value and treasure them, not just for tourism, but for those of us who live here.  Seeing a humpback whale bubble-netting is an unbelievable lifetime experience.  We do not need David Attenborough to tell us about that and we do not need to see it on National Geographic.  We can go out on a boat off the coast of Ireland and we can experience and connect with them.  If we do not treasure these things, we will not protect them.  That is the flowery bit.</p> <p>  What do they feed on?  What are the pressures?  What are the more sensitive?  Where are the best places for them to be?  In which seasons do they naturally occur?  Where were the sharks which appeared off the Cork coast going?  Why did they not go to west Clare, where I was?  I was waiting for them and I was going to sample them, but they never arrived.  Why was that?  They seemed to have gone to Mayo.  These are fundamental questions which are important so that we have informed management.  We need to build that capacity in Ireland.</p> <p>  There are good examples of mapping marine species, but we have to remember that we are living in a changing world.  We are living in unprecedented times.  Therefore, data that we might have collected ten years ago is out of date because things have changed.  Sea-level temperatures are changing very rapidly.  The underlying physical oceanography, the zooplankton, the basking sharks, the forage fish and the humpback whales are all feeding the larger higher predators and are all changing.  We, therefore, need an ongoing research and monitoring technique which feeds into management and human beings-----</p></speech>

In our written statement, we explained the importance of ecological services and functions of those missing habitats, such as kelp and oyster beds and oyster reefs.  Those forests were once vast and those reefs were high.  We find evidence of 7 m high reefs along the coasts of the United States.  We talk about erosion issues.  In the last ten years, the living shorelines has become a part of the restoration and the adaptation to climate change.  The living shorelines are scientific proof that we need to restore the habitats to protect our shorelines, and not just from erosion but from storms and to mitigate sea energy.</p><p>The effects of waves can sometimes be attenuated by 70% through benthic structures constructed by engineers, depending on their vastness.  Imagine an 80 km long oyster reef that is 1-mile wide and I do not know how many metres high.  What will that do to mitigate and share this energy?  I think that is the best.  We are talking about artificial wind farms.  It is from the way that nature captures, creates and shares the energy that we need to learn.  We should not only focus on one source of energy, such as wind, wave or solar.  </p><p> Living shorelines are now also part of the analyses of insurance companies.  In certain coastal areas in the US, if you choose to incorporate the living shoreline as part of mitigation for the rise of sea level caused by climate change, you will be insured better than if you used a hard structure.  This is something to consider in the future in the context of restoration.  It is not only for biological diversity, there is a complex and cumulative effect from all these species and habitats when we restore them and bring them together, or when we protect them by designating them maritime protected areas.</p></speech>

To give the committee an example from the restoration world, Chesapeake Bay is now in year ten of its oyster restoration.  The worth of blue crab fishery has increased by $5 million and the fishermen are ecstatic about that.  Blue crab is a major fishery for them and a local culinary delight.  Whelk fishermen in Wales are calling for oyster reef restoration because they know that whelk catches will increase if oyster reef restoration goes ahead.  The fishing industry can be brought along, including, importantly, the processing side of the fishing industry.  We must ensure they can see the benefits of the restoration of kelp forest and oyster reefs and are educated about the spillover effects from these areas and the catches that are by-products.  Whelks and crabs are natural predators of oysters.  There is a beautiful synergy there between the fishing fleet on the east coast and what we are trying to do.  Those fishermen will protect the oysters and, ultimately, if the oyster reef and oyster beds can be restored, they can, in turn, also be fished because if an oyster bed is not fished, it can become a tenement where disease can be rife.  They must be fished.  That is what we are trying to restore.  The fishing industry must be central to all our restoration efforts.  It has to be on board.  There is no point in us going out and putting reefs out there just before they get started because fishermen will wipe them out with a trawl.  The fishing industry absolutely must be a part of the solution.</p></speech>

I would want to speak to our members and the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, IWDG, and get those timeframes for specific species and habitats.  A considerable amount of data has been collected through the marine strategy framework directive.  Sensitivity mapping and interim protections could start tomorrow.  If we look at our mud and sea floor habitats, we have a great amount of data on them.  For example, circalittoral mud offshore occupies approximately 32,000 sq. km and yet 73% of it is highly disturbed.  We have a lot of data about our sea floor integrity that we can go straight to and begin to reduce the pressures impacting on those areas.  We can get started tomorrow and do not have to wait to have data for all the habitats, species and features we want to protect.  We can start tomorrow with the ones for which we have data and then, as has been said by many of the witnesses today, start resourcing the monitoring of those other features we are going to want to protect.</p></speech>

If there is anything that our guests wanted to say and did not get the opportunity to say during the session, perhaps they would send it to us in writing to.  We will take any such submissions and make them a part of the overall report we will produce at the end.  Would Dr. Berrow like to add something in the remaining time?</p></speech>

We need to engage with coastal communities - not consult with them, but engage with them.  We need to identify the pressure points and key issues, their concerns and fears.  We must listen to their voices and find out where the synergies are.  If we can roll out some pilot projects in three or four locations around Ireland and see what the commonality is, it would be useful in informing where we go in the future.  That could be started straightaway.  It might take two or three years to roll it out properly but that can be done tomorrow and would be very positive.</p></speech>

At the same time, we also have an incredible coastline and unbelievable ocean and marine ecosystem.  That has been clear, listening to what our guests have said.  We need to protect and enhance our coastline and ecosystem and we must ensure that will inform part of the direction in which Ireland is going in terms of our economy, tourism and reaching our emissions targets.  The discussions we have had today have helped us, as policymakers, in terms of how we form those decisions.  I thank our guests for attending; we appreciate it.</p></speech>

I propose that we approve the minutes of the private meetings of 30 March 2021 and 29 April 2021, already approved in the virtual private meeting earlier.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave immediately.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain to the witnesses some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  An international applicant is anyone who is seeking international protection status, whether that is refugee status or subsidiary protection status.  Direct provision is the means by which the State meets the basic needs, such as the need for food and shelter, of such protection applicants directly rather than through full cash payments while their claims for protection status are being processed.  The system of direct provision was officially 21 years old on 10 April 2021.  There have been many studies and reports on direct provision over the years, including two by parliamentary committees, the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions in 2015 and the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality in 2019.  The Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions recommended in May 2015 that the remit of the Ombudsman be extended to include the direct provision system.  This was done in April 2017.  We are here today to discuss the fourth commentary on direct provision from the Ombudsman, The Ombudsman and Direct Provision: Update for 2020.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, who is accompanied by Mr. Sean Garvey, principal officer, and Ms Linda Joyce, assistant principal officer.  I propose we publish the opening statement from the Ombudsman on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I invite the Ombudsman to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

As he pointed out, the committee was very influential in the decision to ensure that my office had jurisdiction over complaints from residents in direct provision.  As a consequence, it is very useful to be able to report back to the committee on our work over the past year.  I will not read out my opening statement in full as I believe members have had an opportunity to see it.  I will just draw out a couple of principal points, if I might.</p> <p>  At the last meeting of the committee I attended, when the previous update on direct provision was considered, the committee was very anxious that my staff and I should engage in unannounced visits.  At that time, we agreed to do so.  The potential for any visits has been severely limited because of Covid.  That is one of the major themes of the report.  We did, however, begin the process of unannounced visiting and we will continue with it once it becomes possible for us to extend the number of visits we undertake to direct provision centres and to people staying in emergency accommodation, which has been one of the major themes we have had to address in the course of the last year.</p> <p>  The pandemic had a major impact on our ability to visit centres.  I have always said to the committee that we recognise that it would not be terribly effective to expect people to come to us with their complaints.  Although we have implemented a series of measures to enable people in centres to bring their complaints to us during the pandemic, there has been a fall in the number of complaints during the year.  We are convinced that this is directly linked to our capacity to visit centres.  People are sometimes much more willing to come and speak to us in person.  Even though we have made arrangements for Zoom calls and the like, the take-up has been lower.  We are very anxious to get back on the road again and we will do so at the earliest possible opportunity.</p> <p>  The other things to highlight have been the change to a new Department and the White Paper on the ending of the direct provision system.  We were not entirely persuaded by the findings of the review of direct provision in respect of housing accommodation.  We made that quite clear when we had the opportunity to meet with Ministers to discuss the proposals.  The proposals in the current White Paper are more realistic.  We are hopeful that we will see a gradual transition to a system of own-door accommodation.  It is a point the committee will have heard me make on more than one occasion that it is very important that people should not be sharing accommodation with people to whom they are not related or with whom they have no other links.  The issue for all of us will be to ensure that happens with sufficient pace so that, first, we can see an end to the use of emergency accommodation and a transition away from the direct provision centres with the fewest self-contained facilities and, eventually, a move away from direct provision altogether over a period that is not too lengthy.</p><p> Another point discussed as part of all of this is the lack of access to any oversight of the administration of the international protection process.  It is entirely proper that decisions about granting or not granting citizenship are executive matters.  They are not matters of administration, but the administration of the system has proved a source of great frustration to many people who have been seeking asylum or refugee status.  I am encouraged that the proposal is now there so that my office should be able, as is the case with ombudsman offices across Europe and more widely, to look at the administration of the protection system.  Those were the points I wanted to highlight and I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

I ask members to keep to slots of five or six minutes.  We should be able to get all contributors in and have time for a second round of questions, if needs be.</p> <p>  Mr. Tyndall spoke of how his outreach programme worked well until the pandemic affected his ability to travel.  He noted that the best engagements had been face-to-face engagements with the people in these centres.  Does he have any concerns that the fall off in the number of complaints does not necessarily mean there are fewer complaints but that it is more difficult to report them?  I set that against the background of the report on the safety and welfare of children in direct provision by the Ombudsman for Children's Office which makes for upsetting reading.  It speaks to the reluctance to complain and the concerns that were highlighted.  Is it Mr. Tyndall's view that concerns that are believed to be there are going unsaid or unreported?  If so, does the Department's White Paper go far enough to deal with the issue in a prompt manner?  Have we an accurate overview of the whole system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.290" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Tyndall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021051100002#B00300"><p>We are absolutely convinced that very many people within the direct provision system and in emergency accommodation are reluctant to complain.  This is for a variety of reasons.  They may also find it difficult to complain, which is a separate issue.  First, many of the people do not have English as their first language.  They do not necessarily have huge faith in the State because of their experiences.  Many of these people are fleeing from very challenging circumstances and so gaining their trust is an issue.  There is also an important concern in that people believe that complaining might have a negative impact on their application to remain in the country.  When we are able to meet people in person we can address all those issues.</p> <p>  One final reason I want to pick up on is the lack of knowledge of the way one goes about making a complaint beyond the direct provision system.  Although we make our information available, make sure it is displayed, that it is in a variety of the most common languages and so on, being at the centre and being able to talk to people is by far the best way to address their concerns.  We can reassure them that their complaint will not impact on their application to remain.  We work, often with the help of NGOs or others, or perhaps with other colleagues in my office, on being able to speak to them in a language in which they are more comfortable.  It is the simple ease of access of having someone there.  We do two kinds of regular outreach, one in respect of direct provision and the other where we simply have someone taking complaints in citizens' information centre offices in Cork, Limerick and Galway every month.  We find there are many people, even people who are not at the disadvantage of being in direct provision, who prefer to simply come and talk to us.  People come and talk to us in the office in Dublin too.  With all the disadvantages of direct provision, clearly making oneself available is the best way to deal with it.</p> <p>  While Mr. Garvey is properly here in suit, collar and tie and Ms Joyce is dressed for committee, we try to dress informally when we go to the centres to be as unintimidating as possible and to make it easy for people to talk to us.  We publicise the visits in advance.  We have also been providing opportunities for people in emergency accommodation to come and talk to us.  We work with NGOs, both national and local.</p> <p>  Yes, we have seen a fall-off in the number of complaints and I am absolutely convinced that it is not because there are not an equivalent number of complaints, although in our commentary we highlighted a couple of areas, particularly around people being able to prepare their own meals and so on, where we had many complaints which have been addressed in many centres.  We would have expected some reduction in certain kinds of complaints.</p> <p>  We have had complaints specific to the current Covid pandemic but that is a different matter.  I think our complaints will go up again once we are back on the road, which we hope will be in early autumn at latest.</p></speech>

I compliment Mr. Tyndall's on the update produced in March.  It was very comprehensive and extremely informative, considering the committee's concerns.  I was on the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response last year.  Mr. Tyndall appeared before the committee and discussed many of the issues surrounding the residents in direct provision centres and their concerns in the face of the pandemic.  It is evident from the Ombudsman's report today that there are ongoing complaints of different nature.  What was the No. 1 complaint received by the office over the past few years, pandemic aside?   Chapter 2 of the update raises issues such as driver licences, bank accounts and complaints about various Departments.  Will Mr. Tyndall elaborate on the extent of those problems and why they exist?</p> <p>  Mr. Tyndall said there were 61 complaints in 2020, down 60% from 168 in 2019.  I heard what Mr. Tyndall said about being physically present.  He highlighted signage and advanced notice being given in various languages, Arabic, French, Russian, etc., which is welcome.  Will Mr. Tyndall give a broad outline of the number of and the biggest complaints and how they can be resolved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.294" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Tyndall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021051100002#B00600"><p>I will turn to Mr. Garvey for some more fine-grained information.</p><p> The complaints have changed over time.  As to the top element of complaints, early on, there were an awful lot of complaints about food, for instance, the unsuitability and inappropriate nature of the food being provided.  As we saw the move towards more self-cooking facilities, that has probably diminished as a major complaint.</p><p> Consistent throughout is the issue of transfer, for a whole variety of reasons.  This has become particularly acute during the pandemic, and Mr. Garvey will talk to that shortly.  People want to transfer to be near particular medical facilities or to be near particular family members who may already be in the State.  For example, we have just been dealing with a complaint where a couple want to be transferred so they can be in the same centre.  Transfer is a particular issue.</p><p> We also get complaints, as the Deputy mentioned, about access to other Government services, and healthcare was one where we were very actively engaged with the HSE.  For example, some of the centres were in areas where there is simply no availability on the lists of GP practices, so we have had to work quite hard to make sure people were not being denied access to appropriate healthcare.</p><p> I should have said that transfers also relate to education issues, where people have access to a course and want to be near it.  That is the transfer issue.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned some very particular issues but those two would be the issues I would see as being particularly significant in terms of numbers.  Mr. Garvey can add to that.  The issues around things like driver licences are ones we have been raising and have raised at ministerial level, and we are seeing movement on all of those long-standing ones.  Some of them are very difficult to resolve because of the legislative requirement for a fixed address.  Bank accounts definitely fall into that category, as does access to medical cards.  Sometimes legislation has had to be amended.  We are looking at changes to the current road traffic legislation to enable people to drive because, from an employment point of view, that is particularly important.</p><p> We found that a couple of the measures reduced complaints dramatically.  I spoke about cooking and the other, of course, was the right to work.  With people being able to work and being able to prepare their own meals, we noticed a change in morale in the centres in that it did not feel so bleak for people under those circumstances.  We are continuing to work on this.  Bank accounts are problematic.  The State properly has anti-money laundering legislation and that makes it very difficult to open a bank account for many people, and it becomes impossible if people do not have a fixed address because they are in the direct provision system.  Explorations are under way to find a way around that and I am optimistic they are coming to a satisfactory conclusion.</p><p> I want to go back to something the Chairman said because I should have picked it up earlier.  We were very aware of the concerns of the Ombudsman for Children and his report was very powerful.  We would also have had complaints from the other end, with families complaining about lack of access to facilities and, where we can, we have helped out with that.  We work very closely with the Ombudsman for Children and where a complaint is more appropriate for one or the other of us, we transfer it promptly.  When my staff are in the centres and they get a complaint about a children's issue, they will help that person and make sure that complaint reaches the Ombudsman for Children so it is not lost.</p><p> Mr. Garvey might want to come in on the volume of complaints and what the most common ones are.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.296" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean Garvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021051100002#C00200"><p>As Mr. Tyndall said, I will fill in some of the fine grain.  We got 41 complaints against the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, in 2020, and 25 of those related to transfers.  As Mr. Tyndall said, there are a number of different scenarios through which people seek transfers.  IPAS has been operating a policy but given the volume of people in centres, and what is quite a high volume of people looking to move from one centre to another, it takes the view that priority cases should be the ones most likely to move.  We do not have an issue in principle with the idea that people who have more pressing circumstances should be the ones who get a move, possibly even ahead of other people whose circumstances may be less pressing.  Mr. Tyndall cited, for example, access to education, medical services, training, educational opportunities and family reunification as being among the priority circumstances that IPAS would look at.  In situations where people's requests for transfers have been turned down, where the requests have been in these areas, we have succeeded in getting IPAS to overturn decisions.  For example, of the 25 transfer cases that were dealt with in 2020, eight were refusals that we got overturned when we engaged with IPAS.</p> <p>  We have had a couple of new scenarios in 2020 in regard to transfers.  Mr. Tyndall highlighted the particular case of two people who had formed a relationship after they independently arrived into direct provision and they wanted to be accommodated as a couple.  Following our intervention, we are happy to report that has since happened.  There was another scenario where a woman was in a centre with a child, but her partner, who had been a resident of direct provision, was at that point living in the community with status.  She sought a move to a place which was closer to him for family reunification purposes.  That had been refused but that decision was reversed following our engagement.</p> <p>  Mr. Tyndall mentioned that one of the more significant sources of complaints was food and catering.  That has significantly diminished over the past two years.  While the wider move to the provision of own-door accommodation in the context of the White Paper is now, hopefully, starting to accelerate, over the last couple of years there has been a significant move within congregated settings to provide people with self-cooking facilities and a residents' shop where produce of the residents choosing can be got.  Where we have visited centres, without exception, the residents have commented on how valuable they have found that and how independent it has made them feel to be able to select ingredients and prepare food of their own choosing.  That has resulted in a significant reduction in the volume of complaints relating to food.</p> <p>  They would be the main sources.  As Mr. Tyndall said, in the last two or three years, we have had a number of complaints relating to delays in people getting medical cards and PPS numbers, in particular.  We have engaged with the Department of Social Protection and the HSE and, following that engagement, their processes for dealing with protection applicants getting access to those services has accelerated.  That has resulted in a reduction in the number of complaints from those sources coming to us.</p> <p>  They would be the main subject areas or topic areas of complaints.  I reiterate what Mr. Tyndall said on the reduction from 168 complaints in 2019 to 61 in 2020.  I share Mr. Tyndall's confidence and belief that it is not a case of people having fewer issues but that, where people have issues, they are not reaching us.  As Mr. Tyndall said in his opening remarks, we have provided facilities for people to reach us through Zoom meetings.  We had scheduled 11 visits to the centres before the latest round of travel restrictions prevented us from doing them, and we facilitated those 11 meetings remotely.  However, the uptake was considerably lower and we had a total of seven people across ten centres contacting us, whereas, at the one centre we managed to visit before the travel restrictions were reimposed, nine people reached us.  That is an indication of the most successful way for us to engage with residents and, clearly, residents feel most comfortable engaging with us if it is face-to-face.</p> <p>  We have also found that our engagement with centre management on those visits has been very fruitful.  Quite often, there are centre-specific issues where people are concerned or are not happy with certain things within centres.</p><p>We have found frequently that the core issue is communication, whether a lack of it or a mix-up in communication.  As Mr. Tyndall said in his opening remarks, some people are simply reluctant to complain.  They feel that by complaining, either their protection application will be compromised or their day-to-day treatment in the centre will be compromised.  We have been doing this for nearly four years and we have not found any evidence of anybody being disadvantaged as a result of complaining but there is fear of it and it is articulated to us.  As Mr. Tyndall said, and this works better in a face-to-face context, we try to reassure people that if they complain, it is their right to do so.</p><p> We have not seen any incidents of people who have complained being disadvantaged, either through their protection application or through their situation centre.  Those are the main issues that have come to us through the year.  The trend is for fewer centre-specific issues as the current programme of provision of self-cooking facilities and a residents' shop for getting produce is rolled out.  That leads to an in-house reduction in complaints and externally, as Mr. Tyndall said, the right to work has made a significant change, since people can finance more independent aspects of living and so on.  That was an issue in complaints raised with us too.</p></speech>

I have a question for Mr. Tyndall about unaccompanied visits, which I welcome.  In my last position, I was an advocate for mental health services.  The unannounced visits seem to bear more fruit.  I agree about the number of complaints before Covid compared with now.  I am well aware of that because I have been speaking with NGOs and people in the centres.  The White Paper is substantial, with more than 170 pages.  There is a lot in it.  I hope it is not only aspirational.  I welcome the movement from the private sector to NGOs.  It should work better since it seems to be more empathetic, with people who are in it for the job and not for the profit, so profit does not drive things.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the complaints mechanism, specifically in the direct provision update for 2020.  Regarding mental health, many people who enter direct provision are quite possibly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, because they have come from conflict of one kind of another.  My worry relates to the overlapping issues of when they come in, from feeling unsafe to an environment where they are afraid to complain or, worse still, they are afraid to ask for help because it puts extra pressure on management or staff and they are dismissive.  It is a problem.  I have been dealing with a number of cases where people have been hospitalised as a result of mental health issues and they have been penalised when they have come back into the direct provision setting.  I am dealing with one or two at the moment.  How do I get that complaints mechanism to assist those people?</p> <p>  Mr. Garvey spoke about another matter.  In many cases, we find that a common sense approach seems to be lacking.  If a couple is together but they are not together, with one in the community, the obvious thing is to make them a family unit.  It progresses everything.  How does one move that on?</p> <p>  There is a final matter I want to address.  The witnesses touched on the matter of work, driver licences and social protection, the fact different families should not be living in the same rooms and cooking facilities, which are all niggling problems.  There is possibly much anger as people are saying that while these people can be moved out of enclosed conditions into communal living, we cannot afford to put our own people into social housing.  How does one find where the balance lies, and I will not say for selling it?  I have seen Government reports and they have been shelved.  It all sounds great on paper and it is a great plan but nothing is driving it.  I am excited about the power the witnesses' office has.  It is great to engage with the Ombudsman because there must be more of this and more collaboration.  We are here today to try to do the right thing.  Let us be realistic in that we will not sort everything out overnight but how can we address the main concerns when people come from a difficult situation and are dropped in to another difficult situation but are not in a position to tell the truth?</p> <p>  As mentioned, Zoom is not the same as person-to-person contact.  One cannot read people's faces or the emotions in their eyes, whether they are telling the truth or whether they want to tell more.  Is there a plan to accelerate that?  I know there is much in it but I did not want to miss the opportunity to get this across.  There are great people working here, such as the NGOs, which are brilliant and are volunteers in the centres.  They want to do the right thing but when they come to us for help, we are stuck.  They cannot go to management because management might be involved or to the corporate body because this gang is involved in it.  Is there a direct route to the Ombudsman or to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  If one involves the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that escalates the problem again.  Are the people punished for that?  We will not mention protected disclosures because that is another box of frogs, as I call it.  It sounds great until one gets to the final point and then one cannot check to see if it is resolved.  Is there an endpoint for safeguarding everybody when it comes to these kinds of complaints?  I know I raised a lot of issues and I apologise.</p></speech>

I will get Mr. Garvey and Ms Joyce to speak more about mental health issues and complaints.  The reason for doing annual commentary is to make sure that things do not get lost.  It is all too easy to look at a complaint, to close the subject matter in that complaint, to treat it as a one-off event and then forget about it, or to deal with a series of complaints, to get some progressive legislation in response to them, and then not watch to see whether what is promised is delivered.  To give an example, with the self-cooking facilities, by going out and checking, we could see whether it was happening or not.  It was not an academic point.  It was not something we stopped thinking about at the point at which a decision was made to fix it.  We kept doing it.</p> <p>  The usefulness of an Ombudsman lies in a couple of respects.  First, one can let the voices of the people themselves be heard.  We do that through providing the case studies within the reports.  It brings to life some of the individual circumstances of people.  That is quite important.  One has to anonymise them to protect the individuals.  If one cannot see people as people then one has problems.  I will come back to the housing issue in a moment.</p> <p>  Regarding what one can do if a complaint is not being resolved locally, many Deputies and Senators bring complaints to my office.  We are more than happy to take complaints from Deputies and Senators acting on behalf of individuals in direct provision.  We generally operate two things.  The first is that we ask people to complain to the provider first.</p><p>The second is that we ask that if a person is acting on behalf of another, that consent to that has been given.  However, importantly, if issues arise where, for the reasons the Deputy described, it would be inappropriate to bring the complaints to the centre, we have discretion to accept them or to bypass the centre.  We have discretion to accept such complaints in appropriate circumstances.  It is occasionally the case, for example, that a person has genuine fears a complaint regarding a nursing home would impact on the treatment of his or her family member in the home.  In such circumstances, we can take a complaint directly.  We are not normally the first stop for complaints because we simply could not deal with the volumes we would get but, where circumstances require it, people can come directly to us with complaints.</p><p> We can deal with complaints about any public body, broadly speaking.  The exceptions are quite narrow.  We can pick up issues around healthcare, such as ancillary issues affecting people.  Although matters such as banking are not in my jurisdiction and are clearly within the remit of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, if people complain to us about those matters, we will pursue those complaints anyway and have done so in the past.  Some of those in the ombudsman community state that one's powers are what one makes of them until one is told to stop.  If the law is on the side of the person or body telling one to stop, then one will probably be forced to comply.  In general, we try to engage with people on their issues and raise those issues on their behalf where we can.</p><p> I am not especially familiar with the particular issue the Deputy raised regarding problems people have had on return from having received care in hospitals.  We are well familiar with the issue of people having problems accessing healthcare.  I will ask Mr. Garvey and Ms Joyce to address that briefly from their perspective.</p></speech>

That has not been brought to us.  What we have seen is, as Mr. Tyndall noted, people having difficulties accessing appropriate health services, including mental health services.  What we do in such cases is to attempt to link that person in to his or her appropriate treatment.  We succeeded in so doing in several such cases.  However, we have not encountered the particular scenario of people who, having received treatment, come back to centres and are in some way disadvantaged.  I am not for a second saying it does not happen, but it has not been brought to our attention as yet.</p></speech>

It is a difficult topic.  Some members will know that in the distant past, I worked in social housing.  It is an area to which I have a particular sensitivity.  Affordable rented housing, and social housing in particular, is in general short supply.  I know through the rest of my work that we get many complaints about waiting lists.  Oftentimes, people do not get the property not because they do not deserve it but simply because the pressure is such that other people had greater needs than they had.  There is a real problem in that regard.  How one avoids creating resentment was one of our concerns about the original sets of proposals that emerged from the review of direct provision.  Having a separate capital stream to purchase and make property available has the virtue of, at least, not forcing people into competition for scarce social rented housing.  From that point of view, it is a good proposal.</p> <p>  As members will be well aware, the issue in all of these things is about delivery.  We will continue to monitor progress in terms of producing the regular reports and in the course of our work.  For instance, as I stated, we will be keeping an eye to make sure that emergency accommodation is phased out sooner rather than later.  We have already seen that some of the least suitable centres are no longer being used.  We will try to stay on top of these issues.  The Government has many competing priorities.  Due to the breadth of my jurisdiction, I am well aware of the various competing priorities for public funding, but I am hopeful that, as we are able to bring a particular focus on this issue, we will be able to monitor progress over time and will see genuine progress.  I look forward to the day when everyone seeking protection here has access to own-door accommodation.  I hope that will happen sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

How many disclosed visits would the likes of the Ombudsman have made before Covid?  Would it be more suitable for people in direct provision to be able to enter the labour market after three months, rather than six months as recommended in the White Paper?  It is kind of disappointing that the recommendations to grant five-year leave to remain for people within the system for more than two years is only under consideration.  That is not a sufficiently robust commitment as far as the committee is concerned.  Many asylum seekers working in healthcare or the food industry, for example, are currently very anxious about facing deportation.  There is a need for stronger commitments on the issue.</p> <p>  Is there significant consultation with local communities when centres are being set up and so on?  Various issues have arisen in that regard.  Would it be preferable to have more consultation with the local public before decisions are made?  Are some existing facilities the subject of more complaints than other facilities?  If so, why?  Is Mr. Tyndall satisfied that measures are being taken to address that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.307" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Tyndall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021051100002#E00700"><p>I thank the Chairman.  There are quite a lot of questions there.  Some of the matters raised are policy matters and, as such, not directly within my jurisdiction.  On the issue of work, for instance, I can observe, as I have previously, that there were clear advantages and improvements in morale in centres when people were allowed to work.  In that light, it is clear that any expansion of the right to work is likely to be met with very considerable satisfaction by the people concerned who are able to work as a consequence of any changes.  However, it is clear that it is not for me to determine the policy on that issue.</p> <p>  On the issue of unannounced visits, it is a mixed bag because much of what we wish to do is to speak to people so that they can bring their complaints to us.  By publicising visits in advance, we can get the maximum possible turnout while we are there.  On the other hand, unannounced visits afford us the ability to get a real feel for what things are like when people have not been preparing for our visit.  It was suggested in the UK that the Queen assumes that all toilets smell of fresh paint.  I do not think anybody is busy painting before Mr. Garvey and Ms Joyce arrive but, nonetheless, announcing the visits in advance gives people an opportunity to put the best face on things.</p><p>We will continue with a mixture of both.  As we said in the report - and Mr. Garvey may well want to comment on this - one of the important things for us is that, where we are told things have been fixed or where we have difficulty in getting things resolved, we are better placed to deal with those issues when we make an unannounced visit.  I will come back to Mr. Garvey on that in a moment.</p><p> The issue of consultation with communities in advance is very nuanced.  Sometimes it simply generates a degree of anxiety and concern before the move, which then makes it impossible for the move to go ahead.  I hope that the move away from larger centres will make this less of an issue in future.  Helping people to integrate into communities is important.  We have seen both outcomes but overwhelmingly communities have welcomed and supported people.  In the past I have paid tribute to the role of the GAA and its clubs in welcoming people into communities.  If one consults in advance, one can make sure that those people who are minded to be helpful are ready and willing to support people as they move.  On the other hand, it can give momentum to opposition, which can sometimes make it impossible for the move to happen.  The question does not have a straightforward answer but it is important to pay tribute to the very welcoming nature of many communities in Ireland, of which we have seen plenty of evidence.  We have talked about NGOs.  NGOs have been helpful but an awful lot of ordinary people have also gone out of their way to be welcoming and supportive.  We have seen evidence of that as we have gone around the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.309" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean Garvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021051100002#F00200"><p>I will come in on two points.  With regard to unannounced visits, we carried out three such visits in 2019.  As Mr. Tyndall said, we were not able to undertake any in 2020.  We were only able to make one visit in total due to the travel restrictions.  We did three unannounced visits in 2019 and, as Mr. Tyndall said, we found a mixed bag.  The main purpose of our visits is to talk to residents.  If we do not say we are coming, the residents will not know we are coming and we are therefore less likely to meet as many as we otherwise would.  On the other hand, there can be issues.  I am thinking of particular cases with which we have dealt.  Different versions of events are presented to us with regard to how things are being done or things that are happening in centres that are impossible to resolve by way of desktop examination.  One person may tell us one thing while somebody else may see something else.  We have found that it can be best to go and see for ourselves.  We did that three times and we were satisfied that what we saw when we showed up was the way things actually were and we were able to progress issues on that basis.</p> <p>  In 2020, we were not able to visit and received complaints about inaction in addressing Covid issues in centres.  These included issues regarding whether there were adequate social distancing measures or whether adequate masks, facilities for social hygiene or sanitation were being provided.  We simply were not in a position to form a view as to whether centres were doing that type of thing reasonably because we could not see for ourselves.  An unannounced visit would be of most use in such scenarios.  We could show up and see how things actually are.</p> <p>  Another complaint received from a resident in 2020, when we could not visit, related to the quality and breadth of produce in the residents' shop in the centre.  Again, we could not verify that without showing up to see how things were.  These are the types of scenario in which unannounced visits are beneficial.  However, overall we find that we get a much higher level of engagement if we engage with residents in advance so that they know we are coming.  For example, because the one visit we did undertake in 2020 had to be carried out in the context of Covid, we had individual appointments with people rather than us turning up and holding an initial communal meeting with residents followed by individual one-on-one meetings with people.  We could not proceed with the communal meetings so we met with people by way of a sequence of appointments.  Every appointment was booked which demonstrates that people had a desire to come and see us.  In a nutshell, we found unannounced visits useful where issues cannot appropriately be resolved by a desktop examination but we did not find them useful for getting a high level of engagement from residents.</p></speech>

With regard to communicating with communities, I think of the situation in Borrisokane.  The trouble is that, if the local communities are not communicated with, whispers start and a momentum builds up.  By the time the truth is known, it can be hard to reverse the decision.  With regard to Borrisokane in north Tipperary, information got out to the community fairly early.  The centre has worked brilliantly since.  The residents have integrated with the community.  The issue I was raising is that, the earlier communities know what is happening, ideally before the Chinese whispers of which we all know begin, the easier it is for those who are welcoming refugees or other immigrants to integrate them into the local community.</p> <p>  I call Senator Eugene Murphy.  The Senator is muted.  We can hear him now.</p></speech>

I hope we do not have to put up with another year of Covid.  I have never met Mr. Tyndall in person but I find his media interviews to be compulsive listening and I find his contributions and sound and solid points of view very helpful in this debate.  I also acknowledge Mr. Garvey and Ms Joyce.  I come from Roscommon, where we have had the emergency reception and orientation centre, EROC, in Ballaghaderreen on one side and on the other the debacle at Rooskey, which is just a couple of kilometres away.  I will refer to my cousin, Mary Gallagher, in Ballaghaderreen, who got a lot of national coverage for the way she said that we must welcome people into Ballaghaderreen and look after them.  She was helped by many people in the community.  At that time, a quotation of hers was used which I came across earlier this morning.  She said that if people are driven out of their homes and if one sees a child being picked up out of the clay in Aleppo, how could one say "No."?  The vast majority of Irish people feel that way.  Ballaghaderreen really shone when it had to shine.  It did the right thing.</p> <p>  I very much agree that this cannot be a for-profit scenario.  While emergency accommodation is sometimes needed, it gives me a bad feeling to hear anyone talking about making profit when we are talking about human beings.  I accept that on some occasions emergency accommodation may be required and that is better to provide for-profit accommodation than to leave people stranded but, certainly in the longer term, people should be accommodated.</p> <p>  I have one or two things to say in that regard.  To take Ballaghaderreen, at the time there was a lot of talk suggesting that there would be little grant-aided community schemes to encourage integration.  Where are we with that?  They do not seem to be there at the moment.  Some of the people involved came to meet me a few years ago.  They were being moved to housing, which was good, but they were being moved from Roscommon to a house in Donegal.  This was one family on their own.  They did not want to complain.  They were really happy that they were going to be housed but they hoped that, if one of families with which they were friends were to be moved, they could move to a local community together.  They had no fear of the Irish community where they were going.  That was not the issue.  However, any of us might like to have some of our own countrypeople with us.</p><p>They were told that was their house in Donegal and they could take it or leave it.  Do we have a policy that, where people express a desire that there would be another family house beside them or close to them for contact purposes in that locality, we try to accommodate that?</p><p> In Roosky, it was a horrifying situation and it was really annoying that the genuine local community, consisting of 18 different nationalities in that parish, was portrayed in such a manner by extreme people on the left and right, who exploited that situation.  It goes back to a point I have argued for quite a while, that it appears to the public that secrecy in relation to putting vast numbers in a hotel, as was happening there, causes a lot of this.  If people were engaged through GAA, soccer clubs or community parish groups in advance, much of this would never happen.</p><p> Moving a large number of people into a small village does not work and hopefully we will move away from that.  There was no proper bus link in Roosky and nothing for those people to do.  They had a roof over their head but they were all congregated in a smallish hotel.  While some people would say it is good enough that they have a roof over their head, I do not look at it that way.  If we are going to take in citizens, we will look after them properly.</p><p> There has been a tendency recently in one or two debates I have had where people said the foreigners were taking our houses.  I never had a situation in Roscommon County Council where a foreign family was responsible for somebody local not getting a house.  It is completely misleading but it is being used more and more.  I do not like it.  I do not know if any witnesses have a comment on that.  Their work is fantastic and well done.  It is great to have them before the committee.  I look forward to engaging with them more in the future.</p></speech>

If one can engage with opinion-formers in the community of the kind the Senator described, and get the generosity of spirit he described in Ballaghaderreen, those things can make an enormous difference to how things are accepted.  Putting a notice in the local paper is not the best way of doing consultation.  Consultation has to be nuanced and well thought through.</p> <p>  I largely agree on the point about putting large numbers of people into a small community.  It is often not going to work.  Many of the hotels and so on that became available to the Department were ones that were not commercially viable as hotels and were in the kind of situations where they were not ideal for accommodating large numbers of people seeking protection.  In some ways, the system had its own issues.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Garvey to comment on the issue around allocation of housing to people who are refugees being accommodated from the EROC centres.  The arrangement was made that each local authority would provide a certain number of properties.  In the early days that caused a problem in that people were assigned to a local authority when they moved into the centre.  If one local authority was able to house a number of people, people were being housed out of order.  That led to a lot of misunderstanding and resentment and we intervened.</p> <p>  I take the general point that if it is possible, and I do not know whether it will be or not, to accommodate more than one person or family from a particular country in a certain locality, it will make it easier for them to settle in.  Perhaps Mr. Garvey could talk about the particular situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.314" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean Garvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021051100002#G00300"><p>We had two complaints in 2020 on that point.  The situation is different for UN programme refugees, whose right to reside has already been established before they arrive in the country.  They remain in the small number of reception and orientation centres, such as Ballaghaderreen, pending the allocation of housing.  It is a different scenario from most direct provision residents who are awaiting a decision on the right to remain.  EROC residents are awaiting allocation of housing.</p> <p>  As Mr. Tyndall said, it was the case that people were assigned to a county list and, depending on the speed at which each local authority moved, that determined when they were housed.  That has changed and it is more of a housing-need basis on which decisions are made.  In the case I referred to in 2020, a family from Ballaghaderreen was to be accommodated in Wicklow.  They were particularly close to another family in the centre who were to be accommodated elsewhere.  We were able to engage with the Irish refugee protection programme unit within the Department of Justice, which was responsible for the programme refugees.  As a result, those two families were housed in the same development.</p> <p>  There is more flexibility under the current system to deliver on the type of scenario the Senator raised.  That was the one case of that sort brought to our attention in 2020.  It could be that other people are having the same issues.  The big change was the moving away from the county-by-county list and having people allocated based on housing need, which gives more room for flexibility.</p></speech>

I asked about incentives for integrating people, which I think is important to help the communities who want to help, to integrate people and to make people part of their community.  I should know this but I have not looked it up.  Where do we stand with that now?  When we were dealing with Ballaghaderreen, I think Deputy Flanagan was the Minister at the time and there were small grant initiatives to help local community groups with integration.  Do they exist?  Is that something we could expand on?</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for the presentation they have made.  I missed the opening statements but I have read them.  I refer to the developments that came with the White Paper on direct provision around the right to work.  I apologise if it has been mentioned while I was absent.  Does the witnesses' office deal with complaints from asylum seekers in cases where they have been refused that right by the operators of the direct provision facility?  Second, do people living in direct provision who get employment have access to the suite of protections under existing industrial relations legislation?  Is anyone coming to the witnesses' office if they have a relevant complaint related to industrial relations?</p></speech>

We talked briefly about issues around employment and the big advantage it had offered to those people who were able to pursue employment.  My office is specifically excluded from dealing with industrial relations matters and there is a separate mechanism through the Workplace Relations Commission for dealing with that.  If we did get somebody raising that kind of concern with us, we would signpost them in the right direction.  Perhaps Mr. Garvey or Ms Joyce want to come in on this, but I am not conscious of complaints specifically about centres preventing people from working, which was my understanding of the thrust of the Senator's complaint.  Clearly, he may have some knowledge of that and we would be very interested in hearing more.  However, I am not conscious of us having received complaints on that topic, although perhaps Mr. Garvey or Ms Joyce would have more on that.</p></speech>

The Department of Justice labour market access unit is responsible for assessing applications to get labour force access.  We had complaints in 2020 on that but, in fairness to the unit, we would have to say that the three complaints we dealt with were in the process of being looked at when we got the complaint.  When we engaged with the Department, we were able to confirm that they were in train and, as it turned out, all three were subsequently granted.  They were complaints from the residents' perspective about delays in granting access to the labour market and it was nothing to do with the centres.  We have not had any complaints of that nature about any action by centres preventing people from accessing the labour market.</p></speech>

New standards for the accommodation centres came into force this year.  Have those standards improved things, in the opinion of the witnesses?  To go back to 2011, Emily O'Reilly, the then Ombudsman, told the petitions committee that the administration of the law in regard to aliens or naturalisation is within the remit of most ombudsman offices in Europe but that is not the case in Ireland.  What is the witnesses' view on the current position?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.327" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Tyndall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021051100002#H00800"><p>I will take the second part.  I alluded to this earlier.  The proposals have been made to bring the administration of the protection system into my jurisdiction.  That is a point Emily O'Reilly made very forcefully and that I have continued to make.  It is actually the case that, not just in Europe but across the globe, public service ombudsman offices are able to look at the administration of the protection process.  Clearly, as I said earlier, decisions as to whether to grant asylum, leave to remain or citizenship must lie with the Executive and it is appropriate that that be the case.  However, a lot of frustrations have been expressed about the administration of the system and, up to now, my office has not been able to look at those.  Therefore, I welcome the proposal to bring that within the jurisdiction of the office, and I am sure that is something the committee will be watching progress on as it works its way through the legislative process.</p> <p>  Bringing things within the jurisdiction of my office is generally straightforward and it can be done with secondary legislation.  However, where there are specific exclusions, it may be more complicated but, in this instance, I would hope that happens as a matter of reasonable urgency.  The members of the committee have all been familiar, through their own case work, with the issues relating to the administration of the system.  I hope we are able to look at that point.  Perhaps Mr. Garvey will come in on the other point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.328" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean Garvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021051100002#H00900"><p>I will deal with the question of the standards applied to the model of communal centres, which is now in the process of being replaced.  One of the key components is that, according to the White Paper, there is a three to three and a half year timespan to those reforms being implemented, so, by any definition, people are still going to be living in congregated settings for at least three years.<br/><br/>On the standards, one of the key recommendations was that there would not be any more than three unrelated people in a room.  It had been the case that it could have been more than that and, in a small number of cases, many more than that, but that is no longer the case.  We have got confirmation from IPAS that there are now no examples of more than three unrelated people in a room.<br/><br/>In addition, there are specific requirements under the standards that the size and physical dimensions of a room should align with provisions in the Housing Act on the number of people per room.  That is something we can look at.  The advantage of having standards, from our perspective, is that there is a measure against which we can assess something.  For example, if somebody says the room is too small for the number of people in it, we can get the dimensions and look at that, and see if that is the case or not.  It gives clarity for us and an objective standard against which something can be measured.<br/><br/>We do not have a role in overseeing the rollout of standards <i>per se</i>but if a person has a complaint that would fall under the standards issue, we can pursue it on that basis.  Again, as the changes in this sector roll out, we have not been getting many complaints on those lines.  However, where we have, they are presented to us by way of transfer.  If there is a family of four in one room, that family will generally seek to move to a different centre where there is more appropriate accommodation, and that is the mechanism under which we would receive most complaints of that nature.</p></speech>

We will use the standards as a means of looking at complaints.  As Mr. Garvey said, when we get a complaint, we can seek wider reassurance.  If it looks to us as if a complaint is representative of a systemic problem, we can pursue the wider problem and we do not have to confine ourselves to the individual complaint.  Nonetheless, I think it will take the measures in the White Paper to move us away from people sharing rooms with people they are not related to.</p></speech>

That was one of my next questions.  Is there something Mr. Tyndall would like to have included in the White Paper that is not there?  For example, he referred to the situation of families in one room.  Are there other things the Office of the Ombudsman would like to see included in the White Paper?</p></speech>

We try to be evidenced-based, based on the complaints.  The White Paper, to be fair, addressed most of the concerns we had, so our principal issue at this stage is making sure that the provisions of the White Paper are implemented, particularly around the own-door accommodation, the access to work and so on.  In general, it addresses most of the concerns that we have been looking at.  In a sense, we will be happy when that is implemented and then, in the course of our time looking at the implementation, if other issues arise, we will bring them up.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Tyndall for his contribution and the work he does.  What are his views on location, or should I say geographic dislocation?  What does he think is unacceptable in respect of where direct provision centres are located?  There was quite a high-profile example in Kerry last year.  Varying views were expressed by people on that case.  One thing that struck me most was the distance involved when it came to proximity to services and the availability of the various supports that one would expect would be available to residents in direct provision centres.  Does Mr. Tyndall have any views on which locations are suitable geographically and which are not?</p></speech>

The first thing is that large concentrations of people in remote rural locations do not work particularly well.  It does not serve the interests of the individuals.  With some of the more remote centres with which we dealt, people were a long way from anything so that does not work very well.  Large concentrations in small communities can have a unbalancing effect on the community.  On the other hand, we are all aware of very bad examples of people being concentrated together to enable them to have access to facilities but this leading to ghettoisation to some extent.  Luckily Ireland has avoided this experience, which is not uncommon in other European countries and the UK.</p> <p>  Moving away from large centres is a very important element in dealing with this issue.  Putting groups of people in remote locations never works.  Having people reasonably dispersed around the State and not concentrated in particular areas has helped to enrich our communities, as we have seen in many instances, but also helps to avoid that resistance one sometimes sees.  There is no easy answer to this question.  There is no perfect solution.  What is proposed, which involves having people accommodated in a wider variety of settings, is good but people also need to be able to access facilities so using remote rural locations to house concentrations of people does not work.</p></speech>

I think we are all very aware that we have really bad gender balance on this committee, which has no female member.  I know it is something in respect of which we have a common goal and want to rectify.  If we are serious about gender balance, we need to ensure there is some percentage of females on the committee.  I speak for everybody and I know the Chairman is aware of it.  It is something this committee must address.  If it came to it, I would be more than prepared to step aside for somebody from my own party to come forward, even though I love this committee.  However, we might not have to do that.  We need to address the lack of gender balance on this committee.  We cannot stand up the Seanad, D&aacute;il or committees and talk about gender balance and have committees that do not have any female representation.</p></speech>

I raised and will raise again the issue with my party.  I ask the three major parties to bring it up.  It will be hard for Independents to solve the issue of gender balance but perhaps the three parties could do something.  The fact that the committee is all male is something that crossed my mind on several occasions.  It looks bad so I ask members from the various parties to raise it with their own parliamentary parties to see if something can be done to address that situation.</p></speech>

I wish to advise members that Deputy Cairns has taken the place of Deputy Whitmore on the committee.  I welcome Deputy Cairns.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I remind members who are participating remotely to keep their devices on mute until they are invited to speak.  When they are speaking, I would ask that, where possible, they have their cameras switched on and be mindful that we are in public session.  In addition, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate in this meeting from outside the precincts will be refused.</p> <p>  Today is our resumed consideration of the Ombudsman for Children's report, entitled Unmet Needs, with the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte.  We welcome her.  She is addressing the committee from a meeting room in Kildare House.  I also extend a welcome to the officials accompanying her, Ms Jenny Anderson, assistant principal officer, and Mr. Noel Byrne, special adviser to the Minister of State.</p> <p>  The purpose of our meeting is to continue our discussion of the issues identified in the report, which was published in October 2020 by the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon.  The report identifies serious shortcomings in how assessments of the needs of children are now conducted and the unacceptable waiting lists that face children who require an assessment of their needs.  On 15 December 2020, the Minister of State appeared before the committee on this topic.  Members of the committee felt that it would be beneficial to engage with her again for a further update on the matter.  I remind members that, when putting their questions to her, they should adhere to the agenda item scheduled for this meeting, which is an examination of the contents of the report.</p> <p>  Before I invite the Minister of State to deliver her opening statement, I will advise her of the parliamentary privilege situation.  She is protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation she makes to the committee.  This means that she has an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything she says at the meeting.  However, she is expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if her statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, she will be directed to discontinue her remarks.  It is imperative that she comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister of State to deliver her opening statement, which will be followed by a questions and answers session with members.  Members will be asked to speak in the order they indicate.  They might start indicating now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051100002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for this further opportunity to update it on some of the issues raised in the Ombudsman for Children's report, Unmet Needs.  Since becoming Minister of State with responsibility for disability, addressing and tackling the assessment of needs backlog has been and remains a top priority for me.  Less than two weeks ago, I spoke at the beginning of a Private Members' motion on autism services of my vision for the provision of disability services for people of all ages in the coming years.  A number of Deputies who were present in the convention centre that day are present again today.  They heard me say that my vision had been ambitious from my first day as Minister of State, and I make no apologies for that.</p> <p>  Children are referred for assessments of need where it is considered that they may have a disability.  This assessment identifies a child's health needs and the accompanying service statement outlines what supporting services will be provided to meet those needs.  The length of time to complete an assessment of need varies depending on the child's complexity of need.  However, the most up-to-date data show that the national average time it took to complete an assessment of need in the last quarter of 2020 was under 20 months.  We are all in agreement that this is far too long for any child who is in need of crucial therapeutic intervention.</p> <p>  Therefore, in an effort to standardise procedures and facilitate the timely completion of assessments as well as early access to interventions, the HSE has developed a standard operating procedure, SOP, for assessments.  The SOP was implemented for all applications for assessment of need from January 2020.  The assessment of need process now comprises a preliminary team assessment that determines a child&rsquo;s needs and the initial intervention required to meet those needs.  Contrary to previous statements, professionals are not limited to a 90-minute assessment.  Clinicians undertaking assessments of need will use their clinical judgment to determine the format of the assessment based on the presenting needs of the child.  However, the practice of targeting resources exclusively towards assessments taking 100 hours or more over a long period without providing interventions cannot and will not continue.</p> <p>  Despite Covid restrictions, figures for quarter 1 of 2021 indicate that, of the completed preliminary team assessments, 86% of children were referred for intervention based on the outcome of those assessments while 48% were referred for further assessment.  Nonetheless, I am aware that the SOP has been widely discussed in various forums in recent months, with different stakeholders raising concerns around the new format for assessment.  That is why I welcome the appointment of Mr. Robbie Ryan to chair the review of the SOP, which is currently under way.  This provides an excellent opportunity to assess how the new format of assessment is working on the ground for children, families and clinicians.  I look forward to the outcome of the review and any recommendations that may be made.</p><p>On assuming ministerial responsibility for disability, one of the issues I sought to remedy was the situation whereby, through a combination of factors, the number of overdue assessments of need for children across the country had risen to approximately 6,500 by June of last year.  By working with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, I secured funding of &euro;7.8 million to address this issue.  I am pleased to inform the committee that we have reduced the waiting list to approximately 1,510 cases at the end of April 2021.  This is a reduction of just over 77%.  In addition, three of the nine HSE community healthcare organisations, CHOs, have cleared their backlogs and progress continues to be made.  I thank the HSE, its staff and clinicians around the country for these impressive results.  It is important to note as well that this progress continues to be made despite the challenges posed by the current pandemic.  Even more importantly, the clearing of this backlog will allow services to focus on intervention to support the child, which is the key piece.<br/><br/>Ensuring these therapies can be delivered in the timeliest way is where progressing the disability services for children and young people programme, or PDS as we know it, comes into play.  This will completely change how we deliver services and supports for children from birth to 18 years of age.  Under PDS, children&rsquo;s services will be reconfigured into 91 children&rsquo;s disability networks, CDNs, by the end of June this year.  These teams will deliver equitable, child and family-centred services for children and young people with complex needs.  This new model of service delivery will reduce the reliance on assessment of need and will support timely access to services.  The teams will provide specialist support services for all children with significant disability, regardless of their diagnoses, where they live or where they go to school.  It will also mean the end of the unacceptable situation where children can age out of early intervention services and will help to tackle the current waiting lists, which we all know are at an unacceptable level.<br/><br/>Last month, I asked the HSE to pause the relocation of existing special school-based services to allow for additional engagements.  This stemmed from concerns raised with me by parents and Oireachtas Members over the potential for a reduction in existing services within specific school-based settings.  I wish to clarify for the committee that there will be no removal of posts from special schools and the HSE is working locally with the schools to ensure clarity is provided.  It is very important to note that this does not mean the roll-out of PDS stops, just the removal of these specific posts.  It is worth noting as well that these clinicians will still form part of the local children&rsquo;s disability network team, CDNT, as it is not best practice from a clinical perspective for clinicians to work in a silo.  They will remain linked to the CDNT.<br/><br/>Since being appointed Minister of State, I have made it a priority to meet with families of children with special needs to hear their concerns.  Some people experience frustration as they try to navigate access to services and often come up against long waiting lists for interventions.  I am very aware of the importance of the requirement for the Government to consult and listen to disabled people about their experiences.  &quot;Nothing about us, without us&quot; is not just a catchy media slogan.  We must ensure that people with disabilities are part of the decision making.  As Naoise Dolan wrote in the <i>Sunday Independent </i>at the weekend, this is not about pity, but equality.  The Government must continue to achieve equality in the fullest sense.  We must stop othering disabled people and ensure that across government we are achieving the commitments set out in the programme for Government, the national disability inclusion strategy, the comprehensive employment strategy and so forth.  We cannot let these become box-ticking exercises.  There has undoubtedly been great work done in recent years, but we still have a great deal more to do.  As I see it, unlike in the case of other Ministers, there is an underlying role of advocacy built into my brief.  This means ensuring other Departments are fulfilling their roles, and I will not apologise for being ruthless in achieving equality.<br/><br/>When it comes to children, we all are aware of the importance of early intervention and of the enormous positive impact that timely access to intervention can have on a person&rsquo;s ability to reach his or her full potential.  Improving disability services for all children is a priority for this Government.  We also must be realistic.  One simply cannot eliminate waiting times for assessments and therapies overnight by waving a magic wand.  If only it were that simple.  Instead, I have approached the issues which need to be addressed by speaking to all the relevant stakeholders about what can be fixed in the short term, such as the assessment of need backlog, and issues that need longer-term solutions, such as sustainable and quicker access to therapies.  It is my opinion that we are on the right track.<br/><br/>Thank you, Chairman, for allowing me to speak for a little longer.  I appreciate your flexibility.</p></speech>

As I said, we are delighted you are here today.  This is your second time to meet the committee on this matter, so we appreciate your time.</p> <p>  I will now call on members for their questions.  I remind them that each member has five minutes.  I will call Deputy Cairns followed by Deputy Cathal Crowe.  Can Deputy Cairns first confirm her location?</p></speech>

Yesterday's report in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>shines a new light on this report.  The family of a young boy launched a legal challenge against the HSE's standard operating procedure for assessment of need cases.  It is the first case of its kind and the judge granted leave to pursue a judicial review of this.  What are the implications for families and children if the courts decide this service is not fit for purpose?  Is there a back-up plan under way?  Has the Minister of State sought advice from the Attorney General on it?</p></speech>

I cannot speak about specific cases so I will not talk about the item yesterday.  However, I have taken two steps.  I took the first step when I appeared before this committee on the last occasion.  I have been watching and listening to how this committee has performed with its engagement with the Ombudsman, the various clinicians, representatives of the HSE and everybody who has appeared before the committee.  That is one of the steps I referenced, putting a review into it to build in a mechanism within the next 12 months to see how it performs.  It is important to note that as part of the development of the SOP there was a consultation process, an independent clinical review and a legal review by senior counsel.  In essence, the HSE worked with it.  It is also important to put it in context.  What we had before this was introduced was not working.  That is why I inherited a backlog of 6,500 assessments of need.  Since I took office, nobody has come forward with any other solution as to how I can crack the nut of preventing a build-up of assessments while, at the same, delivering on timely intervention.</p> <p>  Yes, I will be referring to the Attorney General and we will be watching the progress on all this.  However, one of the reasons I have appointed an independent chair to review it is my engagement with and listening to this committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051100002#B00700"><p>Is work under way on a back-up plan if this case goes in a way that finds the process is not fit for purpose?  Will the Department start working on an alternative solution?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051100002#B00800"><p>At present, the independent chair and the review team are working away, but I continuously engage with the clinicians and parents.  It is the feedback and delivery of services.  The most important piece in all this is the timely intervention of the delivery of services.  That is what this is about.  That is why I am letting it go through its process at present.  I will not pre-empt the end result of it, but I will work continuously with the HSE, the clinicians and the various leads in it.  Most importantly, I will talk to the families, as will all members of the committee, to see how it is going.</p></speech>

However, I will get the answer and provide it to the committee.</p><p>I do not want anybody to leave.  I really want to advocate for recruitment into the network disability teams.  It is not a matter of losing staff.  We had lost staff and it is important to acknowledge that staff were repurposed due to Covid, to swabbing and contact tracing.  They are all back.  The sections 38 and 39 staff are also all back.  There was a period when I did not have my full complement but they are back now.</p></speech>

It relates to the backlog and to access to services.  I have probably raised it before.  In west Cork, people sometimes travel 2.5 hours or more to access, for example, essential speech and language therapy.  Many of the people who are doing that cannot spend a long time in a confined space so the journey becomes even longer.  I think access to that service needs to be rolled out into more rural areas, especially far-reaching ones where the city can be more than two hours away.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for attending our committee and for being proactive and dogged, at times, in her Department in championing those with disabilities.  I want to jump straight into questions.</p> <p>  Progressing Disability Services is supposed to be progressive and to have more capacity within the community.  Something that was not progressive about that scheme was removing therapists and clinicians from special schools and deploying them to community service.  I get that there is a balance of one part of society's needs versus another.  It is welcome that the Minister of State has taken a bold, brave decision to pause this.  She has qualified this by saying that it is not gone entirely but she has put a pause on it.  That is good.  I was a teacher 12 months ago.  Young kids need speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.  Well done to the Minister of State.</p> <p>  Has the Minister of State political support for that pushback?</p></speech>

I also had the support of the Taoiseach's office.</p></speech>

I got the impression that this plan was to be rolled out with full effect up to and including the withdrawal of clinicians from schools?  Has the Minister of State HSE support for her ministerial pushback?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051100002#C00900"><p>With the decision to pause it, I have to be fair and say that perhaps I did catch the HSE wrong-footed with it.  We are working on a solution to build up the team and not reduce services.  By no means do we want to reduce any services whatsoever.  It is all about building up the network disability teams.  While a clinician or a post might still be held within a special school, it still forms part of Progressing Disability Services' wider team in the community, which overlays the primary care team.  When we talk about Progressing Disability Services, it includes 91 teams across the country.  Deputy Cairns talked about the person who needed to travel 45 minutes and that person might not be able to do that in a confined space.  However, if we have network disability teams in 91 different locations right across the country, fully populated, that is the definition in its entirety of Progressing Disability Services in the community.</p></speech>

The past 12 months with Covid have shown some deficiencies in both of those entities.  We saw in some CHOs that CAMHS was out every single day using Zoom and every platform possible to get into the homes of kids, appearing on screens and delivering many therapeutic supports.  That did not happen in all areas.  There are a number of overlapping matters here, with portfolios covering health, education and children.  Someone needs to undertake a review of how CAMHS has functioned over the past 14 months because it has been very hit and miss and I hope the Minister of State, as a champion for disabilities, would look at that.</p> <p>  SENOs are good people but they are not qualified to take on an educational psychologist's role, look at a voluminous report, rubbish it and strike out key recommendations.  With her role regarding disabilities, I ask that the Minister of State would champion that.  That is a matter of the unmet needs of a child.  A voluminous report to provide structure and support for that child in future was not fully implemented and that is a significant failing of the system.</p></speech>

He also raised it at the last committee meeting that I was at.  If I could be so bold as to suggest, perhaps the Minister of State with responsibility for special education should come to answer those questions.  It is not for me to answer that particular question but I understand and hear the Deputy's frustration.  He is not the first to have said that and not the first professional in the teaching role who has said that.  I hear exactly what he is saying.  There is a need for that to be addressed.</p></speech>

Even within the Department of Health, I did not realise the complexities of it myself until I received this brief.  Disability crosses into primary care which is under the remit of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly.  It crosses into CAMHS and psychology, which is under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  I do not have complete control of it all.  While I will work with my ministerial colleagues and everybody else, I do not have complete control over every unit.  At the same time, try to explain to a parent that it does not fall under one's remit.  That does not wash so it is up to us to find the solutions.</p> <p>  I believe that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and I want to work together to try to iron out the creases because there are many creases and areas where families come up against what I would call barriers.  We need to break down those barriers and silos.  I describe it as an escalator.  One needs to come in the front door of primary care and then one might need to go up the escalator to a network disability team after having an assessment of needs.  One might need to go up for a particular intervention and then come down for something else.  It should be an inclusive space.  A family does not need to know what Department this falls under.  It should flow evenly so that one feels, on coming in the door, that one has access to service.  Whether it is mental health, primary care or disability, inclusion is the whole idea of the rolling out of Progressing Disability Services.  As I said in my speech, sometimes I might have to step on toes to get a job done but I will not apologise.</p></speech>

I think everybody would agree with her on those points and share the frustration too.  I ask Deputy Dillon to confirm his location.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051100002#C01600"><p>I am in the convention centre at present.  I welcome the Minister of State and thank her for joining us today.  I want to raise awareness about the experiences of parents who contacted me with concerns for their children in their search to prioritise early diagnostic intervention and to ensure access to services to allow for the most effective intervention for their child, and to guarantee the best outcome.  I raise the issue of a seven-year-old girl who had an assessment of needs in 2016 and 2017 which identified her requirements.  She was referred for early intervention in July 2017, for speech and language therapy as well as occupational and physical therapy.  Due to delays, she did not receive any appointment until June 2018, nearly a year after her first speech and language appointment.  Both speech therapists were then on maternity leave with no cover available.</p><p>After receiving an initial speech and language appointment, she was only afforded appointments every three to four weeks, which certainly fell far below her requirements at that crucial stage.  Since 2019, she has attended a special class for pupils with specific speech and language disorder, SSLD.   There are two such special schools in County Mayo, with one in Ballina and the other in Castlebar.  She has made real progress, especially in recent months, but certainly falls below what is required to enter a mainstream classroom, according to feedback from her teacher and her language therapist.  Based on their professional assessments, which are the most important element, she would struggle in a large classroom environment at present.</p><p> I am raising this issue because, based on the support plus review carried out by the school, it believes she would benefit from additional placement in small group class settings, with intensive speech and language therapy.  These small groups would afford her the support she requires and ensure that the continuous learning that is to the core of her needs is provided.  </p><p>  She is due to start in a mainstream classroom in September 2021.  Her parents have reached out.  They wish for the matter to be brought to the attention of the Minister of State because, as I understand it, she is responsible for funding the provision of speech and language therapy services for children attending these classes.  In addition, she may be able to influence the Department of Education with regard to a circular dating back to 2007 which specifically refers to the criteria for enrolment into these special classes for pupils with specific speech and language disorder.  The circular states that eligible pupils may spend up to two years in such classes.  The girl to whom I refer is ending her two-year cycle but, on the back of the pandemic, she has not been allocated the time she requires to ensure that she thrives.  Her parents have real concerns that she will regress.</p><p> I ask the Minister of State to consider the impact of the pandemic on such cases, to outline how she intends to deal with this issue and to consider bringing an amendment to the Department of Education with regard to the circular that is currently in force.</p></speech>

I remind members that we are dealing with the report of the Ombudsman for Children.  The issue of speech and language therapy relates to a different area.  I remind members that our remit is not the Department of Education.  Those questions will not be able to be answered.  Does the Minister of State wish to come in on any of the other issues raised?</p></speech>

I will be meeting the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan, and I will raise those issues with her.  It is no different from early years education or anything else like that.  The pandemic has held up education and access for children who needed extra time in classrooms.  &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is the answer on that issue.</p> <p>  As regards funding for speech and language therapists, I am working with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, to see how we can aid on the issue of speech and language therapy assessments, but also the continuing delivery of speech and language therapy services.  I am currently working on an intervention programme and I hope that the next time I appear before the committee we will be further into the roll-out in the context of how we can work on delivering speech and language therapy.</p> <p>  Communication is a fundamental issue.  I believe in children being able to communicate and being given the tools to do so.  One of the primary ways of doing that is through access to speech and language therapists.  I refer to the deaf community in this context with regard to sign language and training up more therapists.  These issues are all on my radar as priorities in the coming weeks and months to actually find a solution to get more therapeutic interventions with speech and language.</p></speech>

I am in Leinster House.  It is always great to see the Minister of State coming before the committee.  The change that has been made since she came into office is phenomenal.  Her unapologetic attitude when it comes to advocating for people with disabilities has been incredible.  I highlight the reduction of 78% in the waiting list during a global pandemic, which she mentioned in her opening statement.  Such a reduction is highly unusual in the health service.</p> <p>  I refer to the timeline for the review of the standard operating procedure, SOP.  The court case was mentioned but I know the Minister of State cannot speak about that.  I refer to the clinical need that is designed under the SOP.  How is the Department going to react if a judge with a law background decides on a medical assessment?  There may be an issue in that regard.  I may be wrong.  </p> <p>  The Minister of State said that three out of nine of the CHOs have cleared their backlogs.  How positive an impact has that had on the delivery of therapies and treatment, as opposed to assessment?  All present know assessment is one thing but therapies are the next step.  </p> <p>  I am also seeking an update on the autism innovation strategy.  It is so welcome.  How does that fit in with regard to how we fix unmet needs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051100002#D00700"><p>First and foremost, the review that is currently taking place was commissioned by the HSE in March 2021.  The full review will be complete by March 2022.  There will be an interim review after six months to see how progress is going.  That process is under way.  One could say we are nearly a quarter of the way into the review.</p> <p>  Second, the Senator referred to CHOs that have cleared their backlogs.  It is important to acknowledge the work the CHOs have done.  Areas such as CHO1, CHO2 and CHO4 have actually cleared their backlogs.  One has to realise that when I first launched this, we had just come out of the first lockdown.  We then went into a second lockdown and there has since been a third.  The challenges under which the HSE has worked under during all of this have been unbelievable.  The biggest challenge was from January to date for the simple reason that clinicians did not have access to the classroom setting.  In certain cases, they need access to the classroom to be able to see how the child engages and so on.  It is the observational part of the assessment.  </p> <p>  As regards the status of the other CHOs in terms of the roll-out, CHO3 is at 89% of the clearing of its backlog, CHO5 is at 80%, CHO6 is at 93%, CHO7 is at 76% and CHO9 is at 53%.  Those are the up-to-date figures for April.  I have just received them.  I thank the parents involved, who may have had to embrace new methods of engaging on an assessment.  Not all of it was done face to face.  Technology played a significant role in that regard.  I thank the parents for embracing that part of it and the clinicians for engaging on the technology side.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about the autism innovation strategy I launched at the start of autism month.  It comes under four elements, namely, health, education, employment and housing.  The whole idea is to have members and organisations that represent autism form part of a stakeholder group in conjunction with the various members of the Departments.</p><p>I said this in my speech.  My plan is that I will chair it.  I will not say exactly where it is going to go, but the whole idea is to set ourselves targets that we know are achievable and measurable in areas that have been frustrating service users and organisations for the last number of months or however long it has been.  I call them low-hanging fruit that need to be tackled.  Perhaps the fact is that we do not get the buy-in from another Department.  That is the reason I am going to chair the group.  Then there can be no excuse, such as that a Minister will not return a phone call or a Department is not freed up.  I will call them out on it.  I have set the target.  There are four different Departments.  I am already within the Department of Health, so I am working on that piece, and it is only three other Departments.  If I get the same response as I have got within the Department of Health, I know we can get this job done.</p><p> The autism innovation strategy might not have been what everybody wanted.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in asked me to take note during the debate on a Private Members' motion introduced by the Labour Party that recently came before the Oireachtas.  I have been taking note since I came into office.  I have been meeting with families and stakeholders and I know what the issues are.  They are housing, health, education and employment.  We must listen and engage, and we need the other Departments to work with us.  I have no doubt we will get there.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for being present.  I also thank her for the very professional manner in which she deals with queries from my constituency office on individual cases.  I record my gratitude to her for her engagement with me on behalf of my constituents and people in the Cork region who live outside my constituency.</p> <p>  I will start with the Private Members' motion tabled by the Labour Party last week.  I questioned the Minister of State about the figures during the debate.  I had tabled a parliamentary question for answer on 8 April which showed that the total number of overdue applications for an assessment of need, AON, was running at 5,078, give or take.  I need some reconciliation of the figures given what the Minister of State is telling us today.  There was a slight discrepancy between what was in the script we received and the script the Minister of State delivered.  She stated she was pleased to inform the committee that by the end of April we had reduced the waiting list to approximately 1,500 cases.  The information I received was 5,078 versus 1,500 cases.  That is the first point.  Could the Minister of State give us a perspective on that?  Perhaps in accountancy terms, a reconciliation statement needs to be done and that might require me tabling a further parliamentary question or perhaps the Minister of State could write to the committee.</p></speech>

That night when Deputy Sherlock asked the question, I contacted the Department straight away because to me that was startling.  Patsy within the Department made contact to discover that the reply to the parliamentary question received by Deputy Sherlock related to a point in time in December.  That is the reconciliation because, to be honest, it was a very clear figure.  I certainly do not want to be putting out figures here today that are not accurate and that I cannot stand over.  Work was done to get the answer and I have given it to Deputy Sherlock.</p></speech>

I take her point and thank her for her clarification.</p> <p>  I will run through my questions very quickly as I am conscious of time.  The interim review of the SOP is due to take place.  Is there a set of terms and conditions or terms of reference for the SOP and will that include taking testimonials from parents?  Following on from the point made by Deputy Cairns, it would be vitally important that parents would be part of that process.  If this issue is a matter for jurisprudence at the moment, that would certainly worry me.  As a member of the committee I would have to be confident that this is not going to be just a box-ticking exercise.  I am concerned about the possibility that it is going to vindicate the existing SOP and then we are out the gap in 2022 with the boxes ticked and we must do retrospective work on what could potentially be flawed AONs.  I am genuinely worried that we would have a problem down the line.</p></speech>

I have set out my concerns and fears to him.  I was not guiding, directing or interfering by any manner or means, because it is an independent HSE-F&oacute;rsa review that is taking place.  At the same time, I want to ensure that the child is at the centre of the process.  "Yes" is the answer to Deputy Sherlock's question on whether he is or would be open to engaging with families.  That was part of the consideration.  It will not be in the first half of the process, but in the latter half of it he will engage with families and clinicians to get an understanding on it.  I was very clear that it needs to be part and parcel of the review.  If one looks at one side, one can tick a box, but if everybody is involved it is very inclusive and one gets an overall perspective on how this is going.</p></speech>

Again, it is about a response to a parliamentary question on 30 April where I asked about additional staff recruitment in CHO 4 since 2018.  The reference number of the question was 20364/21.  I was informed that there was one whole-time equivalent speech and language therapist for the Cope Foundation, one speech and language therapist for north Cork in St. Joseph&rsquo;s Foundation, one occupational therapist for the South Lee Brothers of Charity, one occupational therapist for the Cope Foundation in north Lee, one occupational therapist for north Cork in St. Joseph's Foundation and one speech and language therapist in south Lee.  I do not expect the Minister of State to internalise all of that, but I have given her the reference number of the parliamentary question and her staff will probably have regard to that.  The point is that there has only been one of each type of therapist in each of the sectors in north Lee, north Cork, south Lee, north Cork, north Cork and south Lee.  I refer to speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.  It is never going to be enough to meet demand.  Those are dismal figures in terms of the follow-on from the AONs and the need for access to the services.  It is very hard to see how the Minister of State will be able to provide services to support people in each of those areas unless there is a serious effort in respect of recruitment.  I put that information before the Minister of State.</p></speech>

Before I call on the next speaker, if anybody who has not indicated wants to ask a question, he or she should indicate now so that we can manage the last hour of the meeting.  There might be a chance for some members to come in a second time.</p> <p>  Deputy Costello is next.  I ask him to confirm his location first.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State very much for coming in again.  It is always great to get a Minister of State who is willing to come in and stand over her words.  I am coming from a place of slight frustration but obviously I am not as frustrated as some of the parents.  We are here to talk about the unmet needs of children.  I accept that there are significant overlaps with child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, schools and various Departments.  As we all know, the unmet needs of children continue beyond the assessment.  I am dealing with parents who have been asked by the school to pay for the occupational therapist for their child with special needs.</p><p>I was talking to a parent whose school rescinded the placement because the school did not have a special needs assistant.  The school took away the placement for the child.  There is a lack of school transportation for children with special needs who are in inappropriate placements and are put onto short hours.  They can lose transportation because of that.  The issue of school transport and short hours are broader.  What is happening between the Minister of State and the other Departments?  The Minister of State spoke of the other Departments.  How do we ensure there is joined-up thinking?</p><p> Deputy Crowe mentioned child and adolescent mental health services.  I am conscious of the warning from the Chair about defamation.  I do not think I will say anything about CAMHS because my opinion of the services in this country is incredibly low.  My experience of dealing with the service is poor.  One point that comes to mind is the national review panel from Tusla.  The panel reviews deaths of children and frequently calls out CAMHS and its inability to provide basic psychotherapeutic services.  I will leave that for the minute.</p><p> The unmet needs are obviously beyond the Department.  Can the Minister of State give an idea of how all these Departments are working together?  The Dublin 12 autism group has told me it has written to the Minister's office several times looking for a meeting.  Would the Minister of State be able to arrange a meeting with the group as soon as possible?</p></speech>

In fairness, when we invite a Minister or Minister of State before the committee we have to have respect.  I deal with many parents myself.  It is frustrating that things do not neatly fit into various compartments.  Many of the questions are not necessarily within the remit of the Minister of State.  Although the Minister of State might take the queries back, I appeal to people to be mindful of that and not expect a direct response on matters that, in fairness, do not fall within the remit of the Minister of State.</p></speech>

I do not necessarily expect the Minister of State to answer on those things.  For me it is about trying to understand how these different Departments work together and what can be done to improve this.  The Minister of State has already spoken about her willingness to step on toes to get things done.  It is about trying to understand how all the Departments can meet unmet needs and not simply those of the Department of the Minister of State.  I appreciate that the Minister of State has nothing to do with special needs assistants.</p></speech>

I come from Portumna in County Galway, where Dublin 6, Dublin 4 and Dublin 12 are all the same to me.  I will happily meet the group mentioned by Deputy Costello.  The Deputy should contact Noel in my office and we will happily sit in on a meeting.  Any of my Oireachtas colleagues who represent that area are welcome.  I see the frustrations of people on social media.  I would happily meet the group and take on their concerns.</p> <p>  The Deputy has outlined many of their concerns.  Not all of these fall within my remit.  I might not have all the answers for them.  That does not mean to say I will not take it on board and work with the relevant Ministers.  Perhaps I should meet with the group before I meet the relevant Minister so that I have a good understanding of the issues.  The groups are active.  I have to acknowledge and give them a shout out.  They are active on social media.  They tag me in fairly lively on a regular basis so that I have an understanding of the issues.  Now that Deputy Costello has asked, I will do that.</p> <p>  Deputy Costello addressed other issues.  I am not going to comment on other Departments.  It is up to the relevant Ministers to come before the committee and answer those questions.  This is the most wonderful element about my role within disability.  I also see my role as one of advocacy.  That is why I can and do reach out to other Ministers within education, housing, employment and health.</p> <p>  We have to work together and break down the silos if we are to make progress.  That is one of my core values.  One of the good things about my transition out of the health area - I hope the transfer of functions comes through shortly - is it is not only a matter of disability but of equality, inclusion and integration.  This is where the new Department with responsibility for children and youth sits.  I bring all of that to the table.  That is what I believe the other Ministers embrace as well.  I will do that.</p></speech>

It is lovely to hear from and engage with the Minister of State as always.  I am also grateful for the staff in the office of the Minister of State and how co-operative and supportive they are.</p> <p>  I echo the sentiments or questions of Deputy Costello with regard to the Dublin 12 group.  There are several individual cases in the office at the moment that pertain to their complaints and those of members of their group who would have received the letters from the children's disability network team advising them that there will be a 14-month delay and other delays in the provision of services.  It is not only about assessment of needs.  There is a delay in the delivery of services.  The fact that they included within the letters email and contact details for complaints shows us the extent to which they expect there will be complaints.  That can be deeply frustrating.  We are all tagged on a regular basis or a daily basis because there is such a level of frustration.  We really understand that.</p> <p>  I also work with another group that is headed up by a woman called Vanessa Hughes.  They have children who are perhaps seven years of age and have only had four weeks of occupational therapy.  They are engaged in a long process.  There are changes in staff.  Each time there is a change in staff within the HSE or the provision of services, they have to start again.  There is lack of continuity of personal knowledge.  There is not even a hand-over of files.  It is a question of starting again.  There is a checklist as part of a long questionnaire.  We need some intervention in respect of that.</p> <p>  I am delighted with the initiative of the Minister of State regarding autism.  I know that the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan, is completely 100% on board.  When the Minister of State refers to silos I would be confident that there are no silos with her.  Like the Minister of State present, she is active and passionate in this area and in bringing about resolution.</p> <p>  With speech and language therapists there is a difficulty in private practitioners coming on board with the HSE to fill maternity places.  They are prohibited from having private practice while they are on board for the duration.  We really need to do something about that.  If we could engage and harness the hours of private practitioners, then we would shorten the lists and multiply the provision.  That is important.</p> <p>  I have a practical question around Beechpark.  Many of the services and people we engage with attend Beechpark in Tallaght.  Is the centre closing or moving to the primary care centre?  That is important.</p> <p>  One of the recommendations in the report is the creation of the database of assessment of needs.  Clearly, that is well under way.  There was a meeting recently regarding the biggest offenders of data protection breaches.  The same five groups are at the top of the list of the Data Protection Commission.  One of these is Tusla.  There are repeat offenders in breaches of data protection.  We got reassurance from Tusla at this committee before Christmas that things were being dealt with in the cases of the most recent breaches.  We need to have a culture of privacy protection, especially if we have changes in staff.  I will hand over to the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.399" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051100002#F00800"><p>A question was asked about the complaints and the 14-month delay.  I might not have answered the question from Deputy Costello but he was addressing the same point.  To be honest I have met with the HSE several times about this.</p><p>Where there was a reconfiguration of services and an assessment going through primary care and network disability teams, it baffled me how four years or 40 months was put on letters they wrote.  It flew in the face of where we were going that such letters were written when we had not actually reconfigured or done our assessment.  To be quite honest, my annoyance is also due to the fact that we had parents who might not have received an intervention in a long number of months as we were still in the middle of a pandemic, but I was actively recruiting for posts.  I have funding for 100 posts this year.  Some 100 people were recruited last year for posts that were part of contact tracing and swabbing; they are only coming into position now.  My recruitment is taking place and we still have a reconfiguration taking place.  I have seen the letters telling parents it could be 40 or 46 months in different areas around Dublin.  I am in continuous engagement with the HSE on that and have been assured that those letters are not to continue until we understand exactly what the service need is in the various community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas.</p><p> We have put a time limit on the service statement as well.  The HSE will be back to us very soon so I can answer the question about what exactly that time length will be.  I will not accept that 40 months is good enough; it is not.  It is not good enough either that a person is aged out at six years.  PDS is there so someone does not fall off a system and go back in again at the end of the queue.  That will be stopped.  That is why PDS is happening, but at the same time we need to find out what is an acceptable timeline.  To be honest, if a child is diagnosed with a need for speech and language therapy and is told he or she will not get it for four years that is not good enough.  We cannot stand over that as Oireachtas Members, or in the programme for Government or as a State. </p></speech>

I did not have the answer for Deputy Cairns and I do not have an answer for the Senator on what the turnover is like.  In the past, we have not built in enough capacity to support the turnover.  The reason we have turnover is because it is very stressful unless there are enough people on the teams to make it work.  That is where the 100 posts last year and the 100 posts again this year come in.  It will continue to be my ambition, within the budgetary negotiations, to ensure that our PDS is fully and properly laid out.</p> <p>  We also have to remember that a recruitment process is taking place in primary care as well.  Not all access to speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, OT, or physiotherapy all falls within disability.  There is an access provision within primary care as well.  My question there is whether primary care managers are recruiting with their allocated budgets and if they are reconfiguring their teams the way I am reconfiguring mine.  I am reconfiguring mine on the basis that primary care is working in tandem at this moment in time.  I talked about coming in the front door of primary care, access to provision and the escalator.  That only works if everybody is recruiting in the same way and working in the same pods together.  That answers that.</p> <p>  That also answers the question about speech and language therapists and private practitioners.  On private practices, we went right across the country to clear the assessment and needs issues under section 38 and section 39 of the Health Act.  The private providers played a huge role in that.  There will be a role for them to play if we want to clear a backlog, but at the same time I have a public purse that allows me to recruit.  I want to recruit into those posts.  Primary care has a public purse and we need to recruit into that.  That is what we need to do and we need to fill those posts.  I have 50 posts that will be filled before June and I will recruit again in June.  The portal is set up for the recruitment process.  All I need is more money to keep recruiting and I will keep doing that job.  Needless to say, there is a budgetary constraint on that. </p> <p>  The issue of the primary care centre in Beechpark in Tallaght was raised.  There is work ongoing because we do not have a primary care centre there at the moment.  I do not have enough information to answer the question, but the whole plan is that disability is to be integrated as part and parcel of it.  I will get Senator Seery Kearney an answer on that.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State who gave many good answers.  I know how hard she works and that she is very ambitious for this to work.  I will ask about the review again because she spoke about it ending in March 2022.  Is the review wide enough?  Is there a plan B?  Does it concern the Minister of State that the chief strategy officer of the Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland stated: "The PTA [was] the direct opposite of what is intended by the Disability Act..."?  What will she do to make sure she achieves the right outcome for families from this?  It is so important.  We do not want to see a situation where families will pay privately because many do not have the money.  The Minister of State knows that early diagnosis is essential.  She might answer that and I will come back with another question.</p></speech>

To be fair to the Chair and the entire committee, they have focused on this standard operating procedure, SOP.  It was part of the pre-Covid transition in January before I arrived as Minister of State.  I am not making excuses, but it was already in place.  The committee looked into it, brought in the Ombudsman, whom we have to compliment for the work he did in addressing the issue of unmet need, clinicians and the HSE, and nobody has told me what the alternative should be.  Nobody has presented an alternative to me.  What we had in the past was not working because we created a backlog.  The Deputy asked me if I had concerns about it.  I absolutely do; that is why a review is taking place.  That is why I met with the independent chair and why the HSE is conducting the review, because it realises there is a concern out there.  Those conducting the review want to lay out all the fears and address everything that is laid out.  Nobody wants this to be a box-ticking exercise.  We need to ensure that what we have in place works.  We want to achieve a timely intervention.  Can we get rid of queues once and for all?  Can we get children to therapies?</p> <p>  Of the 100% of children who have had a SOP assessment, 86% of them have received an intervention.  Of that, some 40% have gone on for a further, more complex, assessment while receiving an intervention at the same time.  If we worked with the old system, they would have gone through hours and hours before ever getting an intervention.  Yes, I have the same concerns as all the committee members.  I heard exactly what the Ombudsman said about unmet need, but HSE clinician Dr. Macklin has come forward.  She has worked with the HSE and F&oacute;rsa while the HSE has worked with the legal group in order to put forward this position on it.  I am not saying it is a panacea but do you know who will tell us if it is?  The clinicians and parents who will access it.  We need to let the review work its way through.  Have I answered that question?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1511" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051100002#G00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State and really welcome her answer.  Different areas were brought up today.  The issues of assessment of needs to access educational supports or speech and therapy supports, child and adolescent healthcare supports, CAMHs, primary care, will all come up when we talk to different Ministers, no matter what way it goes, because they are all interlinked.  As the Minister of State said, we need a programme or plan where everybody is on the same wavelength.  I know from dealing with families that I am always ringing someone or another about a particular issue they have.</p><p>We need a plan to ensure all the areas and all the Ministers involved, whether it be the Minister for Education, the HSE or whatever, are on the same wavelength.  There is still a degree of confusion.  It is still an issue.  I know special needs assistants.  Like other speakers, we all have our areas on which we are working.  This is a challenge but there is no better person than the Minister of State to do that.  Unless we are all on the wavelength and are able to have access to deal with the same number of issues through one helpline or one specific Minister, we will have issues with this system in the next few years.</p><p> I welcome the &euro;7.8 million funding provided to address the backlog of preliminary team assessments.  The Minister of State indicated that the 6,500 cases on the waiting list have reduced to 1,500.  Is there enough help provided for children when they are assessed which will enable them to get into the system and ensure they will not have to go for a further assessment?  Timing is very important.  It is important in the context of the funding that when children are assessed they get the interventions they need if that is what the assessments indicate and that there is an outcome for them.  I welcome the funding.  The Minister of State said another Department is involved.  She is working hard to deal with the system.  She mentioned figures for community healthcare organisation, CHO, 5, which is my area and I welcome those.  Can she provide us with a slightly different plan, a plan B, where all of us would be able to address one particular area and get answers and not be directed from one area to another area?  That is my main concern.  I welcome the funding of &euro;7.8 million.  It has made a difference but there still many concerns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.407" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051100002#H00200"><p>There are many concerns because families are waiting far too long for an intervention.  Nobody will deny that.  While children were waiting for an intervention, assessments were being cleared.  I made that a priority in that if I cleared the backlog of assessment of needs I could then focus on the intervention.  That is what it is about.  That is the nut I want to crack.  I want to get families in front of therapists as quickly as possible.  I want to get the intervention.  I do not want an assessment about an assessment, which is what we have had in the past, where people went for an assessment of their speech and language to get their assessment of their speech and language.  That is what has frustrated many people.  That is not what I want.</p> <p>  Families should not know if they are on a primary care list or under a network disability team, when they go into a primary care centre they are assessing the therapeutic services their child needs.  That is an integrated system and model but the mother or father bringing their child for assessment should not worry about whether their child is on this or that list. There should only be one door and that is to access the therapy.  That is why we have 91 network disability teams.  There is massive reform under way in disability services and in the primary care sector.  There is a great deal happening.  We will not see the results for approximately another 12 months but that should not discourage anyone listening in to these proceedings.  We are trying to iron it out and work through it.  We are cracking the nut on the assessment and then moving to ensure every assessment should be seen as an intervention and nobody should be waiting for months on end to get the final outcome of the assessment.  When people are assessed they should also get a therapeutic intervention.  That is what the figures say.  To be fair to the HSE and the relevant Ministers in the Department of Health, everybody is working together but we are trying to tie this in so that it is interwoven.  It should be seamless.  Families should not feel that there is a gap, which is what we had in the early years, when a child fell off a list and had to go on a list.  That is starting and that is what PTS is about.  It is a seamless model and is being exactly overlined with the primary care settings.  It is not aspirational.  It is being delivered, as we speak, on the ground.</p></speech>

That was one of my concerns.  In the feedback some clinicians would have said 90 minutes is too short.  I would have queried that 90-minute process.  We need to allow flexibility among the clinicians carrying out assessments.  When a person goes in the front door, if it takes longer than 90 minutes to get the assessment done, let it take longer.  I hear what the Deputy is saying.  I am in discussions with the HSE on that issue.  It is not a case of an assessment being 90 minutes or less.  It could take longer, be it two or three hours, to get it completed.</p></speech>

I have a brief question to seek the Minister of State's advice on a matter.  I have had instances brought to my attention where home care support for a child with a disability and particular needs has been tendered out and the successful company providing that service will deliver it for a while and then question whether it is delivering the tender, or that what it is delivering goes beyond the scope of what it thought it was tendering for, or it will start disputing the number of hours.  I have had a few of those instances raised with me in the past fortnight where there is that repeated pattern.  It is not the same company so I cannot say it is a change of personnel in it or whatever.  I am curious to know, first, how and why that is happening and, second, what does a parent do in that situation?  What autonomy and power have they and us as public representatives?  I am happy to meet the company and show it its tender document and what it was supposed to be delivering, but the point of contact is not always consistent within the HSE for that family or is non-existent in one of the instances with which I am dealing.  With respect to oversight, quality assurance, delivery assurance and the value for money on the part of the State, what audit process and accountability process do we have in place for that?</p></speech>

If that home care is provided through the disability services, that is the person the parent needs to contact.</p><p>They will work to signpost and address the issues that the Senator has raised regarding the quality of the audit piece and, perhaps most importantly, the service level agreement that they signed up to as a service provider.  That is where service providers realise how difficult it is for carers and why the supports are needed.  When companies tender for a job to support a family, sometimes they do not understand what they are tendering for.  That is where the service manager will work with the family.  It is very disappointing to hear what the Senator has said because families wait so long to get assistance and intervention.  When they get that intervention, the one thing they need is for it to work and it is very disappointing when it does not work.  It is not that these interventions do not cost a great deal of money.  Significant money is being spent on these interventions.  The service manager in a family's CHO will want to ensure that the family and the younger or older service user get the provision that is being provided to support their needs.  It seems from listening to the Senator that there is more than one case involved.  It comes down to the service manager.  If the funding is coming through disability, it will involve a disability manager, and I have nine such managers in the country.</p></speech>

There appears to be a particular number of companies that successfully tender here.  I would like to think that we quality-assure and audit what they are providing because some of them specialise and some provide large-scale services into hospitals, but we must be sure that they are not undoing tenders afterwards.  We need an audit of what is being delivered by comparison with what was tendered for in the first place.  In one instance, the tender document, to be fair from the HSE&rsquo;s point of view, could not have been clearer and would not be in dispute.  I know very little about care other than what I am told but I would have known what was expected.  The idea that it is being disputed a number of months later is very upsetting for the family and very disappointing.</p></speech>

That is why one needs to go back to the HSE because that funding support mechanism is hard-fought and hard-got.  The family is very clear on what level of service delivery they expect.  If service providers are not stepping up to the mark where they have made a contract - much of this is on a tendering basis - and if these providers are failing on their tendering, it is very important that it needs to be called out.</p></speech>

I have just one point which I wanted to raise with the Minister of State and this is only because she referred to it in her speech.  She will not be shocked to hear that it relates to the autism strategy, in which I have a particular interest.  Am I hearing the Minister of State correctly that she is chairing this strategy group, which is a great idea?  Does she envisage that it will just be people from the Department who will be involved in this strategy?  Will she be consulting groups?  Would the Minister of State mind elaborating a little on that point?</p></speech>

The reason I am acting as chairperson of the group is to assist in opening doors.  This is to do with health, employment, housing and education.  I confirm that it is not just Department officials who will be sitting on this strategy group by any manner or means.  There will be an open consultation to invite individuals, advocacy groups and organisations to be part and parcel of identifying what can be within the strategy and outside it.  I have referred to frustraters, agitators and low-hanging fruit that have been there for some time.  Perhaps we can find a willingness within Departments to work with us to get solutions.  I am not going to give a timeline but I am going to be ambitious on this strategy.</p></speech>

The format of the meeting is as follows.  I will invite Mr. O'Connor, Ms Brady, Ms Connolly, Mr. Arneill and, finally, Mr. Holmes to contribute.  I have agreed to allow Mr. Holmes slightly over three minutes given the very important contribution he has to make on behalf of the youth advisory panel members of Webwise, and the young people affected by school bullying.  The statements will be followed by questions from members of the committee, each of whom will have a six-minute slot for questions and then witnesses will respond.  Given the limited time available and high attendance by members, I urge members and witnesses to stay within six minutes.</p> <p>  As witnesses are probably aware, the committee will publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  As the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does, they have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by me to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Mark O'Connor to make his opening statement for three minutes and I will call the other witnesses individually afterwards.</p></speech>

According to research, children with additional needs are two to three times more likely than their peers to experience bullying.  The UN also points out that "children with disabilities are six times as likely as other children to experience violence and abuse".  This is especially true for children with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities.</p> <p>  The bullying experienced by children in schools must be seen through the prism of general attitudes towards people with disabilities in Ireland, the absence of inclusive educational systems and the importance of children's mental health supports.  One important aspect to consider on bullying is attitudes towards people with disabilities in Irish society.  For example, the National Disability Authority has reported that 28% of the public agree that children with autism or an intellectual disability should not attend the same school as their non-disabled peers.  Addressing the negative attitudes towards children with disabilities must form part of the response to tackling bullying of children with additional needs.  Northern Irish research illustrates that children with additional needs felt that they were bullied because they were different, and that the bullying was related to their disability.  Inclusive education and societies are important factors in addressing bullying as research shows isolation from peers is a risk factor for children with additional needs to be bullied.</p> <p>  The NDA has proposed five guiding principles to underpin a framework for schools to ensure that their school becomes a place where staff and children are happy and safe from bullying.  These are: A rights-based approach to protect children from bullying to govern and underpin principles and practices; systemic interventions; inclusive processes; education and training for both pupils and staff; and leadership training and communication.  This framework shares many common principles with inclusive education.</p> <p>  Children's mental health services are a key part in supporting children with disabilities who have been bullied.  It is worth noting that between 35% and 40% of children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities have mental health difficulties during their life, which is five times greater than the general population.  At the same time, the child and adolescent mental health services or CAMHS intellectual disability service is virtually non-existent.</p> <p>  To conclude, the following actions can be undertaken to address bullying and support children with additional needs who have been bullied.  They are: The Government must engage in a public awareness campaign on reducing the stigma around disability in general; the Government must invest in inclusive education as it would result in better short and longer term social outcomes for children with additional needs such as in maintaining positive peer relationships, and better social development into their later years; continue the improvement of therapeutic supports by providing speech and language, and occupational therapy, within educational settings where required; and the Government must invest in the child and adolescent mental health services, especially CAMHS intellectual disability services.</p></speech>

However, bullying has been identified as one of the worst things about being a child in Ireland.  Although children and young people here are less likely to experience it than some of their peers in other countries, almost 8% of those aged between 11 and 15 still encounter chronic bullying.</p><p> The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises the right of all children to be protected from abuse and neglect, and that includes psychological and physical bullying.  Ireland's approach to tackling bullying has been multifaceted, addressing different national policies and legislative provisions across the education sector, child protection policies and youth strategies.</p><p> The 2013 national action plan on bullying in schools contains 12 actions that focus on supports for schools, teacher training and research, awareness raising, and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying are addressed.  We welcome the comprehensive definition of bullying in the related anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools.  That also includes cyberbullying and identity-based bullying, such as racism and homophobia.  However, we feel schools are missing an important opportunity to gather data and monitor incidents of identity-based bullying.  While these procedures acknowledge the need for a programme of supports to be put in place, in their absence, responsibility for dealing with mental health issues often falls on teachers, who are rarely appropriately skilled to deal with serious psychological issues.  There is a clear need to identify the types of resources required for an adequate in-school model of mental health support for those who have experienced bullying or, where necessary, to identify appropriate out-of-school supports, where staff can refer victims of bullying.</p><p> Children make up a third of global online users.  While the Internet brings unparalleled opportunity for children to learn, connect and socialise, it also brings unparalleled risk.  During the Covid-19 lockdown, 28% of children and young people reported that they had been a victim of cyberbullying, with younger children more likely to have been a victim.  The current opportunity to establish an online safety commissioner could help to ensure that children are safer online, and could ensure that children, young people, parents and teachers are educated on how to address cyberbullying and online harassment.</p><p> While any child may be subject to bullying, certain groups of children and young people may be more susceptible or may be targeted because of their own, or their parents', identity or status.  However, there is a lack of data on the impact of bullying on certain cohorts of children, and this includes children in alternative care, children who are members of an ethnic minority, and children impacted by parental imprisonment, to name a few.  </p><p> In our submission to the committee, we highlighted data on particular groups more at risk of bullying.  For example, the marginalisation of members of the Traveller and Roma culture within the Irish education system adversely affects young people's sense of belonging and place.  Traveller children are more likely to have higher rates of mental health issues than the general population.  For Roma children, insufficient English language and literacy support can compound experiences of bullying and marginalisation at school.  We are calling on the Government, therefore, to develop and publish a national Traveller and Roma educational strategy as a matter of priority.</p><p> Finally, while the Department of Education supports initiatives to address homophobic and transphobic bullying in schools, BelonGTo has highlighted that LGBTI+ bullying is rife throughout second level schools in Ireland.  This can have a devastating impact on teenagers' mental health, increasing the likelihood of reporting stress, depression, anxiety, self harm and attempted suicide.  Although it was promised in the last programme for Government, but was never done, the Department of Education should conduct a review of the national action plan on bullying and consider other forms of bullying and harassment in relation to gender, race, religion, or grounds, and put in place appropriate actions to tackle these.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

Barnardos provides a range of services to children and families in our 40 community-based centres, in family homes and in schools.  In 2020 these services were delivered to nearly 18,000 vulnerable children and parents.  Our key message today is that early intervention and prevention is vital to reducing the impact of bullying on mental health.  To meet this objective, Barnardos delivers the following programmes in schools and communities.  The roots of empathy programme is an evidence-based programme focused on social and emotional learning.  A parent and a baby visit the classroom every three weeks over a nine-month period.  Children learn about child development and, indeed, their own development through observing a baby growing and the relationship the baby develops with its parents.  They learn to understand the range of emotions that a baby experiences and, in this way, can connect that to their own emotional world.  Through observing the relationship between the parent and child, children can see a real-life example of a nurturing relationship.  This programme been proven to reduce levels of aggression of children in primary school and, therefore, of bullying.</p> <p>  Friendship group is an evidence-based group work programme that helps children develop skills to form healthy relationships with their peer groups.  It teaches children how to negotiate, express and explore different views and feelings, how to win and lose gracefully and how to work as a team.  The programme reduces bullying because it helps children to relate to each other with respect and understanding.</p> <p>  Our online safety programme is run across primary and secondary schools and aims to promote safe online use and to build capacity for critical thinking, as well as healthy behaviours when interacting online.  Through the friendship group and online safety programme, children learn that they do not have to like everyone, and they do not have to be friends with everyone, but they have to treat everyone with respect.  Bullying, without the appropriate supports, can have devastating short and long-term effects.  When a child is bullied to the extent that their mental health is impacted, it does not solely affect the child concerned, but also the family and the broader community.  The impact of bullying on mental health is not restricted to bullying within school grounds.  Therefore, a holistic approach to tackling the issue must be taken outside of the school context, with consideration given to family and community supports.  Key to reducing the long-term impact of bullying is early intervention and prevention.  Evidence-based programmes, such as the roots of empathy, increases a child&rsquo;s empathy and awareness of others, while friendship groups can support a child&rsquo;s well-being and build the confidence required to negotiate peer relationships.  Targeted and resourced family support within communities also helps children to grow and learn in a home environment that enables them to manage and negotiate school conflicts.</p> <p>  Finally, the introduction of a comprehensive digital literacy and online safety programme must be progressed to ensure children build the capacity to think critically about their behaviours online.  We cannot underestimate the importance of a holistic approach across schools, communities and homes when putting in place early intervention and prevention measures to mitigate the devastating impact bullying can have on children and young people&rsquo;s mental health.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

As an organisation, we recognise the Internet is a powerful and educational resource.  This has never been more apparent than over the last year during periods of strict lockdown.  The Internet also brings with it risks, particularly for children.  My opening statement will focus specifically on cyberbullying.</p> <p>  Cyberbullying overlaps in many ways with traditional bullying, in that there is clear intention to cause harm, it is deliberately targeted and there is an imbalance of power.  One common definition of cyberbullying is "an aggressive act or behaviour that is carried out using electronic devices repeatedly against a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself."</p> <p>  Several key differences between cyberbullying and the more traditional forms of bullying are, first, cyberbullying takes place through the Internet and online platforms such as popular social media apps and as such it can be perpetuated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Second, victims of cyberbullying are not necessarily exempt simply because they remove themselves from the online space.  There is nothing to prevent the perpetrators continuing to create and post content online about their victims, regardless of whether that person is seeing it directly.  Third, cyberbullying creates a permanent record of this behaviour through posts, comments, photos and videos left online.  Even if this content is deleted from specific devices, the nature of the Internet is such that it is likely the content exists somewhere else, or has been screenshot, saved or downloaded by other users.  Fourth, the online nature of cyberbullying easily facilitates anonymity for its perpetrators, who are not required to directly witness the reaction or impact the behaviour has on their victim, and is facilitated by the increasing amount of time children and young people are spending online.</p> <p>  Cyberbullying comes in myriad forms, the most common of which include posting nasty, hurtful comments and messages, excluding people from groups, threatening to share information about someone online and sending or posting non-consensual images of someone, among other forms.  Cyberbullying can even be inclusion as well, such as the case of Charlotte in sixth class.  She was excited to be invited to join a WhatsApp group of her peers, only to discover that the group was called "I Hate Charlotte" and had been created specifically to criticise and make fun of her.  CyberSafeKids believes we must continue to address the issue of cyberbullying at the highest level, as this problem will only continue to evolve with the online world.</p> <p>  Research indicates that cyberbullying has life-changing, and even tragic consequences for children and young people, poses real and self-evident concerns and issues for parents and carers, and also creates significant challenges for teachers.  According to our findings, 59% of teachers are increasingly dealing with incidents which, despite beginning outside school, have inevitable fallout that continues to reverberate within their classrooms.</p><p>Defining cyberbullying, identifying the symptoms early, teaching young people to stand up rather than stand by and modelling inclusive and tolerant environments within schools are all key approaches in tackling the increasingly pervasive problem of cyberbullying in schools. </p></speech>

I thank the chairperson and members of the committee for inviting me to contribute to this meeting today and for listening to me.  My name is Ben Holmes.  I am a sixth year student in FCJ Bunclody in Wexford and I have been a member of the Webwise Youth Advisory Panel for the past three years.  Throughout my time on the panel, I have had the opportunity to mentor Safer Internet Day ambassadors from schools across Ireland, contributed to national and international organisations and, recently, I did an interview with a fellow panellist on &quot;Ireland AM&quot;.  Webwise, through connections with organisations and the Government and informing students, teachers and parents, aims to promote safer use of the Internet and, in conjunction, mental well-being for young people.<br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  As a young person, I hope I can help to provide insight into the stress and anxiety students face, the affects of bullying and cyberbullying and what the Government could do to combat it.  I know first-hand that bullying and mental health is one of the biggest social topics on people&rsquo;s minds today when it comes to schools and young people.  My generation has grown up in a very different world and environment from the one that existed when many of the people attending this meeting were in school.  It is apparent that much of the infrastructure to deal with these issues needs to be consistently updated to connect with students in an engaging way.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  From my personal experience, I know that many of programmes given by teachers and the Garda vary in quality and effectiveness and that, generally, regulations around bullying and dealing with mental health in schools differ quite a bit.  It is unclear exactly what kind of anti-bullying systems schools should have and what situations schools have the ability to deal with, whether within the school, outside of it or even online, when it comes to cyberbullying.  These decisions are often left to senior management and the principal and this causes some schools to do nothing while others are overbearing or invasive. </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  As a young person, I have been lectured on bullying and mental health many times during my time in secondary school, but only a handful of these talks have either informed or enlightened me.  Programmes such as those delivered by the Garda often only cover the legal implications when it comes to illicit image sharing and violence, and much of the information provided by schools and by the Government omits the mental and social aspect of these situations.  While it is essential to explain the legal and logistical side of bullying, cyberbullying and online safety, this is not conducive an environment that destigmatises and comprehensively addresses topics that are ultimately the main cause of stress, anxiety and depression for young people. </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  As a Cycle Against Suicide ambassador I understand the need to handle these topics and situations in not only a careful and mindful way, but also with a humanising and empathic approach.  From the Webwise Youth Advisory Panel and the many other youth activism programmes I have been involved in, I understand the importance of peer-to-peer learning and seeing the full picture from professionals, other young people, organisations and law enforcement.  As a member of the Webwise Youth Advisory Panel, I have acted as a mentor and trained other students to lead online safety and anti-bullying initiatives in their own schools as part of the Webwise Safer Internet Day ambassador programme.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  To guarantee the safety and well-being of all students, anti-bullying and student information programmes have to be consistent within each school.  Encouraging second level institutions to train teachers and staff to deal with these issues in a thorough way would also help humanise the issues.  To help students understand the implications of their words and actions, a system where these situations would be met with mediation rather than just punishment, would allow students to learn to stop bullying and understand their peers rather than learn to not get caught.To educate all parties involved in bullying and mental health in school, a holistic approach where all stakeholders are involved and a wide range of informed views are presented, would be beneficial.  I hope what I have said and will say provides the committee with more insight into the issues and will inform it in how it can create more effective and engaging systems that will benefit not only second-level students but also teachers, parents and society as a whole. </font></p></speech>

I have no doubt there will be some interesting contributions and questions from members.  The first speaker is Deputy Alan Farrell, followed by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  I ask members to direct their questions to the witness from whom they would like a response.</p></speech>

I have three questions for all of the witnesses.  I would like first to speak about a really important aspect of this conversation.  In 2018, the former Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, inclusive of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire at one point, created a report on cyber safety as it applied to children and young adults.  There are 11 recommendations in that report, which is a modest number of recommendations for an Oireachtas report.  In recommendations Nos. 9, 10 and 11 the committee recommended Government advance the establishment of cyber safety programmes in primary and secondary schools; that cyber safety education should be formalised at primary and secondary level and that the training of teachers should include cyber safety education at primary and secondary level.  While some of those recommendations have been implemented, others have not, and that informs this discussion.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  My questions are short and, again, are for all of the witnesses.  Do they believe that our faculty staff, in other words the administration of our schools and the teachers, are sufficiently equipped to intervene and deal with instances of bullying, whether in-person or cyberbullying?  My next question is for Mr. Holmes in particular.  Does he believe that the buddy system, which is used in many primary schools, particularly at junior and senior infant level, could be rolled out at secondary level to provide the student with somebody that they know, particularly in the first few months, and following on from that somebody to whom they could go and confide in if instances of bullying arose?  My teenage years are a long time off, but I remember that sort of system operating in my school.  It was beneficial to students, but I am not sure that it is rolled out across the board.  I would appreciate a response to those questions, following which, time permitting, I would like to pose one more question.</font></p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.453" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ben Holmes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051100002#C00700"><p>On the buddy system specifically, such programmes are beneficial in primary schools.  A similar programme in secondary schools would be very beneficial in first year when students might not feel comfortable going to a teacher, guidance counsellor or adult when issues arise.  If a student had the benefit of having the support of another student that he or she knew, that would be beneficial.  In terms of the buddy system, it is for much younger children.  It is important to not to mash all students together and to put in place blanket policies.  I am a sixth year student and I am very different from a first year student and extremely different from a primary school student.  If a buddy system without a level of maturity to it was implemented, it might be pushed away by students and seen as ridiculous and so on.  It would be useful to implement a programme which would provide students with an opportunity to talk to other students about problems or a time in the school week when students would be able to specifically talk to each other about their relationships with other students in their class and, also, any bullying they might be experiencing.  I had reached third year before anyone asked me about my mental health or if I was being bullied and so on.  It is important bullying is identified in first year, because that is when it happens most.  If it is not identified in first year, and there is no one-on-one between students and teachers at an early stage, bullying could continue all the way to third year and as students mature.</p></speech>

I was a teacher for nearly 20 years.  In respect of the primary school teachers with whom we have dealt, we are focusing on children aged eight to 13.  Over 30% of teachers reported last year that they dealt with between two and five incidents of cyberbullying.  When it comes to the training of teachers, what many teachers find quite challenging is that more often than not, these cyberbullying incidents occur outside the home so there is sometimes a sense of "what's it got to do with me?  I am dealing with the kids within the school."  From working as a teacher and working with other teachers, I know that anything that happens outside the school, regardless of where the responsibility lies, will automatically impact the dynamics in the class.  Similarly, a lot of cyberbullying incidents might originate with dynamics that occur in the school or classroom and then play out on these platforms and websites beyond school.  It is really important that within teacher training, there is a very clear system of defining the behaviour and how to deal with it within the school.  What are the correct steps to take?  Where does one draw that line of responsibility between the school and the home?</p> <p>  When we talk about the difference between bullying and cyberbullying, quite often, when I ask teachers to brainstorm the symptoms, many of the symptoms teachers give are very similar to the symptoms of more traditional bullying.  They include behaviour change, becoming withdrawn and friendship groups altering.  Very few of them identify behaviour around online use.  One of the real red flags for cyberbullying are children being reluctant to go online or becoming angry, aggressive or withdrawn after they have been online.  They might have been very interested in the online world or gaming and suddenly they lose interest dramatically.  From a teacher training point of view, it is really important that those guidelines are established as to where the responsibility lies and how best to deal with it.</p></speech>

One of our asks in respect of this Bill is around the education remit of an online safety commissioner.  That is key.  If we had that not just for children and young people but for parents and teachers, it would really help.</p> <p>  There is a wider issue about ensuring there is a proper curriculum for children and young people within schools that would also help and support teachers to address some of these key issues around cyberbullying so this is also an opportunity for this committee to look at how that interacts with the online safety commissioner piece.  We see it as possibly a quality assured programme where people who are delivering this training within schools would have to be approved by the online safety commissioner.  It would be like a blue tick or a quality assurance to ensure that factual information is given.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051100002#D00300"><p>That is crucially important in terms of the critical skills the younger generation need.  I cannot think of a better place to have overarching policy formation than in the digital safety commissioner or whatever form of words is used to describe it.  I thank the witnesses for their responses.  I am sorry the other witnesses did not get a chance to come in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051100002#D00400"><p>There is a lot of focus this afternoon on online safety and cyberbullying, an issue I raised last week.  It has never been easy to be a teenager but when I listened to the witnesses, I am very glad I am not a teenager in the 2020s and do not have to navigate all the hazards that exist with social media.  I am sure it has many benefits but there are very considerable pitfalls as well.</p> <p>  One of the challenges with cyberbullying is the fact that in many instances, the students will always be more aware of and familiar with the platforms, the culture relating to the platforms, the games and all the rest.  This can be a bit intimidating for organisations and responsible people who might not be familiar with them.  What are the key principles of how someone deals with an incident or series of incidents?  How does someone ensure he or she deals with them even if he or she is not that familiar with the platforms being used because there will always be something new?  Things will always change and evolve.  How can one ensure that a school or any kind of organisation stays ahead of that?  Is there a role for constantly consulting the young people involved to ensure they stay ahead of that?  </p> <p>  My next question is for the Children's Rights Alliance.  There has been discussion recently about relationships and sexuality education; social, personal and health education; and the variety, to put it kindly, in respect of the curriculum.  Speaking more frankly, some of the content being taught in our schools is not appropriate.  I imagine the alliance believes the reform of that is vitally important but is the lack of uniform policy a contributor to a culture of "othering" and exclusion in some schools?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.458" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ben Holmes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051100002#D00500"><p>I think consistent peer consultation is essential in order for organisations and anyone to stay up to date on cyberbullying and information to do with the online space.  Obviously, Webwise has a great peer-to-peer programme, which is why I am here.  It is intimidating for teachers.  As students, we do not necessarily like acting like we know more than teachers or trying to educate them.  This even applies to our parents or any other adults in our lives.  I do not think someone needs to be aware of the Internet and these issues to teach students about them.</p> <p>  By the time we reach first year, we will most likely have phones.  I see children in primary school getting phones earlier and earlier.  I got mine when I entered first year.  When they come in, they will probably already have a very comprehensive idea of the online space and things.  Where the education needs to happen is around what rights they have online and in school.  If I went back to third or fourth year, I would have no idea what I would be able to do if I was being cyberbullied, whether I could take it to my principal or teacher and if they would be able to deal with it because technically, it is outside the school.  Sex education needs to be updated because students do not know these things and have to go online.  The environment in Ireland is still very stigmatised so I am not going to go to my teachers or parents but I will go online and look for that information.  That is where students ultimately end up in many dangerous situations and that is where the threat lies.  They feel they need to go online to learn things and connect with people.  It is about that fear of missing out and wanting to know stuff.  Teachers could provide education to meet this curiosity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.459" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Arneill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051100002#D00600"><p>The first thing is that we cannot say we do not understand the technology.</p><p> We have to stop making this excuse.  We hear many parents say, "Oh, I do not know what they are doing."  There are sites like Webwise and Common Sense Media, and lots of other resources where people can figure out very quickly exactly what TikTok does or what people can do or not do on Snapchat.  The first thing is to go and do that research, and understand what kids are doing.  Parents have to take that interest because it is a big part of their children's life.</p><p> Second, we have to stop making this distinction between what we often refer to as the real world and the online world.  For children and young people, the online world is part of their real world.  By making that distinction, we are sometimes giving licence to certain kinds of behaviour in the online world that we would not accept in the offline world.  By breaking down that distinction and really pushing the kind of behaviour we want, generally speaking, from young people and children, and from society as a whole, it is a really powerful way to tackle that.  What often happens is that kids are doing things online that they do not necessarily realise are the same as walking up to someone and insulting them to their face, or saying something to them they simply would not have the guts to say in person.  The second thing is to break down this distinction and stop somehow othering the online world as if it is some other place where different rules apply.</p><p> Third, a big part of this is empathy and understanding how people feel, whether it is online or offline, and developing those skills within our young people.  Fourth, within schools in particular, it is about modelling that culture.  This comes from the top down.  I know from working in schools that we are talking to children about bullying and cyber bullying and, at the same time, the head may be bullying members of staff and not necessarily modelling that behaviour we expect from the kids.  Within a culture, within an organisation, we need to understand what the signs of bullying or cyber bullying are, and we then have to make sure that all of us, whether it is from the top down or the bottom up, are modelling that desired behaviour.  That will be much more effective.  It is too easy to just blame the technology.  We have to tackle it at the root of the behaviours that we want from each other and that we expect to see.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.461" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051100002#E00200"><p>On the issue of othering, one of the biggest segregated groups in the Irish education system is children with additional needs.  The attitudinal report that is done regularly by the National Disability Authority shows that only one third of people are comfortable having children with psychosocial disabilities in the same class as their child and more than one quarter of people do not believe they belong in those classes.  Those attitudes carry on into the rest of their lives.  People are less comfortable living beside disabled people and less comfortable working with them, and those attitudinal pieces really need to be tackled.  We know from international research that it is leading to greater levels of bullying of children with disability in schools.</p> <p>  When we go back to the original research from many years ago around groups, it only took the flip of a coin to set groups apart when people all of a sudden felt part of one group to the exclusion of the other group.  Children with disabilities, who number in excess of 20,000, are seen as the others within the schools and special school provision.  To address that, and this committee has looked at the issue, requires a movement towards a more inclusive education system, and working on those attitudes at the systemic level is something that will help children with additional needs in regard to bullying.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.462" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1617" speakername="Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051100002#E00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and I wish we had more time to delve into them.  It feels very rushed for topics on which we could spend an awful lot more time.  I want to quickly mention some of the recurring themes that I am seeing appear between this week and last week, which are around revisiting the anti-bullying procedures, which clearly needs to be done; the collection of data, and I wish had more time to dig down into that with Ms Brady, in particular regarding the atomised data she would be interested in collecting; and the focus on mediation and restorative justice.  I want to mention the roots of empathy programme that was mentioned by Ms Connolly; I have seen it in action and it is superb.</p> <p>  I also want to refer to Mr. O'Connor's point about inclusion.  Until we see it in our society, I do not know if we are going to see it in our schools.  Until we see people working in the supermarkets with those disabilities, or learn to accept them within our own communities as neighbours or friends, it will not happen.  That is where we need to go first.</p> <p>  I want to ask a couple of specific questions.  On a question to Ms Brady which was also raised by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire with regard to LGBTQI+ students, a phrase that jumped out at me is that bullying is rife throughout Irish second level schools.  Perhaps this question is speculative but relationships and sexuality education, RSE, particularly in primary school, does not deal adequately with the idea of same-sex relationships or anything to do with that area.  Is it Ms Brady's opinion that if we reform that or if we did RSE better at primary school level, we would see more acceptance of people within that community as we move to secondary school?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.463" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Saoirse Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051100002#E00400"><p>It is a very complex issue.  Certainly, age-appropriate sex education should be instilled in schools from a very young age.  There are programmes that the Council of Europe have developed on how we talk about LGBTI people in general.  Obviously, we have come a long way in Ireland but we still have a way to go and things are not solved.  We really need to address those issues.  Having the NCCA put in place a proper curriculum around this could help inclusion.  Talking to Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh's point, it is not just about LGBTI for children and young people, and it has to be inclusive across the board.  We have to look at how we instill equality in our children and young people from a very young age and, again, there needs to be consistency across schools, which is key.  In regard to the RSE piece in particular, what we have seen are people going into schools where the boards of management decide who comes in, and it is not consistent across the board.  Therefore, they may not be presenting the most factual or accurate information, and it may not be in line with some of our human rights and equality law, as we know it.  We need to address all of that and have a more inclusive education system.</p> <p>  The other piece, to which Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire alluded, is consulting with children and young people around this and asking how they want to learn about this.  They need to have an input into any changes that will be put in place.</p> <p>  Touching on the piece around bullying being rife, that came from BeLonG To.  One of the things it noticed is that it is not just about the people who are carrying out the bullying, it is about the bystanders as well and it is about the staff in schools.  It acknowledges that some staff in schools do not know how to intervene and feel it is not their place.  We need to address all of that if we really want to make our schools more inclusive.</p></speech>

I have two questions which I hope Mr. Arneill and Mr. Holmes can answer quickly.  There is so much I could ask Mr. Arneill but I have one specific question.  Is there a role for the social media platforms?  I am looking at the fact that 65% of eight to 12-year-olds have a social media account and I am quite sure many of those social media accounts require children to be over 13.</p> <p>  Mr. Holmes was very diplomatic in how he described some of the education he got in terms of it not being age-appropriate and not really speaking to young guys where they are.  I want to simply ask him what is an approach that has worked for him, in his experience.</p></speech>

This is why we are coming from the education side because the reality is that kids are on there.  Yes, there are age restrictions in place but, clearly, as we can see from the figure of 65% of kids being on there already, they are not working.  We are firmly in favour of stronger regulation.  We believe it is simply not working to have social media companies restricting and regulating themselves.  That is why we are very much in favour of the online safety commissioner and we would like that office and that commissioner to have the teeth that we believe they should have, including an individual complaints mechanism, which would also address things like cyberbullying.  Individuals would be in a position to complain to the commissioner and to have that content removed, rather than trying to take on huge social media giants like Facebook or Twitter and clearly coming up against a brick wall.</p></speech>

When educating young people, the main thing is not to treat them as if they are ignorant or unaware of these issues.  At this stage, as a sixth year, I know much more about many social topics than, I am sure, some of my teachers.  I am referring in particular to topics associated with young people.  I am still being lectured on material that I may have learned years ago.  It is a question of creating a classroom environment that involves discussion and in which, I hope, teachers could learn from us as well as educating us.  There is a lot that we can learn from them and a lot that they can learn from us.  It is a discussion, not a lecture; that is the main thing.</p></speech>

This is an important topic.  We discussed it last week also.  I made several points last week on the change in the nature of bullying.  It now follows the victim all around the place because of the advent of social media and smartphones.  Often, there can be confusion over the definition of bullying, which involves repeated action over a period, not just a once-off event.</p> <p>  I have a question for anybody who wants to take it on.  I was interested in all the presentations made but was wondering whether the Irish education system is particularly ill-equipped to deal with bullying considering that it is based on separating children.  We separate children at a much greater rate than most other European countries.  We do so on the basis of religion, gender and income.  Some 90% of our primary schools are under the patronage of a body that believes women are second-class citizens and that LGBT people are disordered.  We do not have a State education system; we have a State-funded education system.  Therefore, the reach of the Department goes only so far in respect of asking schools and patron bodies to implement anti-bullying or other policies.</p> <p>  Is there evidence that any particular type of school or age group has a worse bullying problem?  Is it a teenage issue?  Does it start at infant level?  Is the physical element of bullying worse now than five or ten years ago?  I am interested in knowing that.  I am also interested in coping mechanisms.  Given that many of us were bullied as children &ndash; I certainly was &ndash; how do we ensure that we can instil coping mechanisms in children and young people?  How can we ensure parents know what bullying is?  A lot of parent-teacher time can be spent discussing what constitutes bullying.  Sometimes it is believed that any kind of interaction or confrontation is bullying when often that is not the case.  How can we focus on the repeated action, which is quite diminishing and absolutely humiliating for children and young people, and which lasts a lifetime?  It is not just a phase.  Bullying stays with most people for their entire lives.  I would appreciate the comments of anybody who wishes to contribute on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.469" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051100002#F00400"><p>I will address some of the points.  The Deputy is right in that if there is one thing we love to do in the Irish education system, it is segregating and boxing pupils into very specific areas.  I will deal specifically with the disability front.  An unintended consequence of segregation is based on the fact that special schools, by their nature, are not on every street corner or in every locality.  Children are bussed out of their locations and are not going to school with their peers.  They miss out on all the social activity that happens as a consequence of meeting people in school, including the games of football and birthday parties, even when they are going to the same schools.  We heard media stories over the weekend in which parents reported that their children were not invited to certain birthday parties, for example.  Another consequence of segregation is that special schools are seen as primary schools.  We have spoken about RSE and tackling some of the associated issues.  It is at primary school level that 17- and 18-year-olds in special schools are receiving that education.  It is wholly age-inappropriate.</p> <p>  To return to a point I was making, in the research carried out north of the Border it was found that children with a disability cited their disability and their being seen as other as the main reasons for being bullied.</p></speech>

We have to give support to families and communities.  We must examine the broader system and how we all operate.  We all have to learn how to work positively with difference, challenge effectively and non-aggressively, and recognise that children, young people and parents have a range of feelings and emotions.  There are ways of dealing with these effectively and of disagreeing effectively in a way that does not dismiss or minimise somebody else's position.</p> <p>  The reason Barnardos is stressing the importance of prevention and early intervention is that we can see children being rejected and neglected by their peers and we can see bullying behaviour in our early-years services.  It is a matter of modelling for children at an early age the view that all feelings are okay but that all behaviour is not.  They must be shown how to deal with a difference of opinion and how to manage if feeling very aggressive.</p> <p>  We really support programmes such as Roots of Empathy because the approach is so non-invasive.  Children recognise that although they may observe a disability or a variety of differences, all human beings are fundamentally the same.  We all have a range of emotions and go through good days and bad days.  Once one recognises our common humanity, regardless of one's age, one just cannot bully in the same way.  People with empathy really recognise that they are a fellow human being.  We do children an absolute disservice if we do not recognise that they, as with adults, experience very negative feelings towards other people and that, just as they can be bullied, they can also be bullies.  Therefore, we have to recognise the reality that we all have that capacity.</p> <p>  If as teachers, adults, parents or individuals in various roles we can accept that reality, we can then really help and equip children.  We can also listen to them.  One of the reasons children find it very difficult to go home and talk to their parents is because they are afraid of their parents' reaction.  They are terrified.  Therefore, we have to give children an opportunity to learn how to negotiate their difficulties.  We must give them skills and coach them.</p> <p>  The questions that the Deputy is asking are really interesting and broad.  A variety of strategies is required and all of us, no matter what our role, must take responsibility for what we model and how we are with each other.  Anyone who looks at the news today will see the world is not an easy place to be in at the moment.  Aggression, discrimination and such behaviour are rife.  Therefore, if in our world we can negotiate, in the ways we can, how we try to address inequality and victimisation, we can also have really good, honest conversations with children that are appropriate to their development and age of understanding.</p></speech>

We are in favour of more multidenominational and non-denominational schools.  We are going to be examined by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child early next year.  It made a recommendation.  I am not sure a link can always be made to the atmosphere regarding bullying in schools because some schools go above and beyond others, but it is a matter we need to address.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the age groups that experience bullying.

Professor Mona O'Moore of the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre in DCU showed in her research from 2012 that 61% of victims of cyberbullying were also victims of traditional bullying and that 67% of cyberbullies were also traditional bullies.</p><p>There is a very clear link between that culture of what we would consider more traditional, old-fashioned bullying and cyberbullying.

Their contributions have been very valuable.  Combined with what we heard last week from psychotherapists, clinical psychologists and psychiatrists from many different groups, the key issues that came across were the school environment, how important it is schools engage with instances of bullying as well as, and Ms Connolly might have mentioned this, how this impacts not just the children who endure bullying but also the perpetrators and bystanders.  We heard a statistic last week on the high number of children who were presenting.  It was not just the victims of bullying.  This also impacts on people who are doing the bullying and on bystanders.</p> <p>  It was a very impressive presentation from Mr. Ben Holmes of Webwise.  It is great to have such a young man here to speak to us, so I thank him.  I am sure Bunclody in Wexford is proud to have him here.  A few of my family are in that area.  My question for him is about mediation skills, particularly what type of mediation.  This was raised with me by another parent.  Could there be training in mediation skills for teachers?  Teachers have a heavy load, but perhaps there is some type of intervention that might be helpful.  He also said the peer-to-peer aspect is very important.  What might an ideal school managing an instance of bullying well might look like?</p> <p>  I thank Ms Connolly for her presentation on behalf of Barnardos.  It is amazing that it has 40 centres.  The work Barnardos does is phenomenal.  I am very interested in the roots of the empathy programme.  I had never heard of it, and it is wonderful.  It shows the importance of us speaking about it.  I am aware of Webwise.ie and tacklebullying.ie and the programmes that are available.  I am curious about how Barnardos got the mother and the child engaged and how this process started.  How can schools register for something like this?  How do they engage with Barnardos?  It is the practical aspect.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. O'Connor from Inclusion Ireland.  I work closely with the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan.  I know there is examination of the school inclusion model, the pilot that is being rolled out to schools in which there are additional speech and language supports.  However, Mr. O'Connor pointed out that special needs are particularly impacted when it comes to bullying.  Is there something within the school inclusion model that is being rolled out that could be considered as well with regard to bullying?</p> <p>  I also thank Ms Brady.  She mentioned that more than 80% of teachers were surveyed, and 20% are not clear on exactly what steps to follow.  Does this just point to further training or is it a case that schools run a mock incident of bullying and this is how it would be managed?  Sometimes this role playing is very important.</p></speech>

I will be brief as the Senator asked many questions.  Mediation is very black and white.  It is easy in this type of environment to make a bullying situation very general and very black and white, but usually it is not.  For every severe bullying case one will come across, there will probably be ones that are less severe.  In many situations such as those, and even with people I know when they have occurred, perhaps both parties involved have done something and have fought back at each other.  If I have done something to somebody else, my school has a very harsh and strict anti-bullying policy.  If a student who has done something says, "This person did it to me", that person gets punishment without any type of investigation into it or often any type of mediation.  It is easy to say, "This girl says that you have done something", and immediately believe that when, in fact, often it can be everyone doing something malicious to each other.  That is what I meant in my opening statement when I spoke about mediation, that it is not seen as black and white and it is investigated further.</p> <p>  As regards what an ideal system would be, one does not have to train every teacher to deal with bullying.  It is necessary to train every teacher to be able to see bullying and be able to refer that to somebody higher up.  If there were therapists in schools, such as CAMHS therapists, it would be a really good step for the Government to take.  If one were to refer the matter to senior management, somebody specific who deals with it, the guidance counsellors or a therapist in a school, that person could then deal with it.  It is not that every teacher must be equipped to deal with it on the spot, but that the teacher is equipped to refer it to somebody who would know what to do.  In addition, the student knows he or she could go to that person higher up as well.  That would be essential.</p></speech>

We have been delivering it since 2011, and 18,631 children have benefitted from it.  It is in 20 counties.  It is being done predominantly through word of mouth.  A volunteer mother or father or both come in with their baby.  It is up to the age of a year.  It is delivered in primary school between the ages of five and 12.  It has been proven.  There is numerous research at the highest level and randomised control trials in terms of it reducing aggression and bullying in schools.</p> <p>  I thank the Senator for her interest.  If anybody wishes to see it, it really warms the heart.  It is wonderful.  Even for children with very challenging needs in the school who find it difficult to sit still or to concentrate, as soon as a baby comes in the baby takes over.  The children then see their peers differently through observing the way they are with the baby.  The teacher gets a chance to see what is happening in the classroom differently.  They get a chance to talk about the baby's development after the session.  There are three sessions in all in consecutive weeks.  It is a fabulous programme.  It is very effective.</p></speech>

The other thing is that some type of programme should be put in place for teacher training.  The Department should provide resources and continuing professional development, CPD, opportunities for people to continue to train in how to address bullying.  Updating the national action plan on bullying would be key to this.  Having routine refresher courses on that would also help.  My nephew is a roots of empathy baby so it is a fabulous programme.</p></speech>

Specifically on disability, I would point to training and CPD on inclusion.  At second level, according to ASTI, the training its members have received heretofore specifically on special education has been less than impressive.  We can even look at special schools.  One of the people a young person can go to if he or she is being bullied is the guidance counsellor, but those people are not in special schools.  They simply do not exist.  They are a couple of logical pieces.  In addition, as Mr. Holmes said, that CAMHS support going into schools would be more than valuable.</p></speech>

We run an annual peer-led training initiative.  Mr. Holmes is part of it.  On the question of what is effective in the peer-led area, the most effective responses we see in that is that the peer-led training is part of a whole-school approach.  It is supported by ongoing lessons in the classrooms, supported by teachers, supported by robust policies and involves everybody.  Our peer-led training initiative gives students the opportunity to identify issues that are important to them.  In saying that, I am talking about online safety and cyberbullying in particular.  One of the big issues that emerged from our peer-led training initiative this year was that post-primary students were really keen to involve and support parents as well.  There should be additional supports and training available for parents.  We have seen increased engagement from parents in online safety this year as we all have spent more time online.  It is very important that we do as much as we can to involve parents and give them access to training and to supports that work with them.</p></speech>

It is great to have all their wisdom.  I did an online safety course with my children.  It was amazing.</p><p>There were many ways in which I knew things they did not know and they knew things I did not know.  As Mr. Arneill has said, sometimes we are inclined to steer clear of things because we do not feel we have the knowledge when actually there is some wisdom that comes from age.  Then there is some new wisdom that comes from young people, which we still have not caught up with either.  It is very well worth doing.</p><p> I brought up the issue of empathy last week.  I am a big fan of the empathy programme.  It is, in some ways, replicating what happens in society generally around empathy.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on whether school life is adequately reflecting real life outside of school?  If it is not, then we are missing a trick when it comes to empathy.  Perhaps there are other structural things happening in schools that stop empathy from happening.  In some other countries, for example, multi-age education is used because it is clear older children are more empathetic when they are around younger children and younger children learn from older children.  Are there some structural aspects of our educational system that the witnesses believe could actually change the way people feel about each other and so we could have more empathy?  Mr. O'Connor made an excellent point about the othering of some people in society.  What are the representatives' thoughts on that?</p><p> Another suggestion came up last week around getting young people involved in putting in place the policies for their school.  This would be hugely effective.  As Mr. Holmes has said, young people know a lot more and are a lot more advanced in some ways than we might think.  In the context of a more democratic approach to schooling in the State, young people are catching us up, not the other way around.</p></speech>

We are here to be educated and we are here to learn, but it is not very often we get to hear the opinions of peers and what they think, especially where I am.  Programmes where we are all talking to each other, such as peer-to-peer programmes, can help to build empathy.</p> <p>  The training of teachers so they can make sure everyone is included is even more essential within primary schools because the class has only one teacher for the whole year.  A teacher may have something against a student or not like the student.  I am aware from personal experience that such a teacher can make the primary school experience horrible.  Such training is essential.</p> <p>  On the democratic approach, I am aware many young people would be very happy to contribute to decisions based on the education system.  Students are trying to get involved anyway with Government and with decisions being made.  I know many people who want to contribute but there is a real lack of peer voice and of student voice within current legislation and in the decisions made by the Government.  It is definitely essential.</p></speech>

If we want policies within schools to succeed, then we must involve the young people in the schools in developing the policies.  When they have this level of buy-in, they will succeed.</p> <p>  Inclusive education for all people is enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and in the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is looking at this and will bring forward policy recommendations to the Department.  They will be very challenging for this committee.  There is one thing we do know about inclusive education systems: when people are educated together, they are used to each other, they are more involved, and we know from the research that it leads to more inclusive societies where the othering and the bullying reduces.</p></speech>

One of the things I really like about the programme is that it teaches children about different temperaments.  Some children are very active and some are less active.  Some children can concentrate and some do not.  Some will be taller than others and so on.  In that way, children can get to understand how they are both similar and different.  It goes back to that progression towards understanding the variety of human beings and relationships.  It decreases bullying and aggression because not only have they observed each other with a baby, they have also observed each other and concentrated on a really positive shared experience about development.  That is what contributes to the reduction of bullying in the schoolyard and outside of that.  As adults we must model all the time for children.</p></speech>

I have found that schools are always in the rearguard and catching up.  I believe strongly that schools should be at the vanguard.  We see this with the discussion over sex education, which is still being dictated by the church.  It does not reflect the society we live in.  We see it even with issues such as the amount of time spent on handwriting.  When a person enters the world of work, how often does he or she actually employ that skill?  On devices, for example, during the pandemic we delivered webinars into schools once they came back into session and we have found that maybe there is one device in the classroom.  Part of talking about cyberbullying and the training of teachers must also go hand in hand with getting that technological infrastructure into schools so it reflects the society into which the children will graduate and work.  If we are not preparing them for the society they will live in as adults, then what is the purpose of schools in the first place?</p></speech>

This is key.  It is a key tenet of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p></speech>

I am very interested in what Ms Connolly said in her statement.  I am especially curious about the roots of empathy programme and the friendship group.  Empathy is even difficult for some adults to have, so it must be very challenging for it to be taught to children.  Even in advance of children going to school, what can parents do to try to ensure children are more empathetic or more conscious of and sensitive to the needs of others?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.495" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Connolly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051100002#H00900"><p>We know that one of the best ways children learn to be sensitive to others is when they have an attuned parent who is sensitive to them.  If, through the parenting relationship from when the baby is born, a child feels seen, heard and responded to in all the things he or she goes through, and if the child feels safe, then gradually he or she will learn how to regulate the emotions and will then be in a position to be a particular type of growing child.  Often, children who have experienced very harsh home environments learn to manage their negative feelings in particular and then they go to school and act it out.  In a sense, when I spoke about prevention or intervention I was referring to our early years services, but I could have gone back a lot further, even to how the mother is supported in pregnancy, if she has a partner there, which matters, and the support provided in those crucial times after the baby is born.  Children are learning constantly from a very early age that they are valued and valuable.</p><p>If a person feels valued and valuable, he or she will value other people.</p><p> We teach in the friendship group how children can negotiate with each other.  As adults we are not in a school playground.  One of the tricky things that can happen us as adults is to know when to interfere with difficulties in friendships.  We want to help children negotiate for themselves because they need to learn those skills.  We are trying to coach.  We have had friendship groups where children were able to say to another child "I felt very bullied by you" and as an adult one does not react to that.  An adult asks the child to explain more and tries to get the children to sort it out.  I have known of situations where parents have gone into schools and they have tried to address it, and sometimes they have to if it is very serious, but if a parent intervenes too soon, the parent is not helping the child.</p></speech>

Sometimes a child&rsquo;s intention may not be to bully another child but the effect of what the child is doing is that the other child feels excluded.  How do we counteract that or try to ensure that a child is more inclusive when it comes to engagement with other children in his or her class?</p></speech>

We cannot expect a child to be friends with everyone.  One has to help a child who is feeling excluded and neglected to develop their social skills.  It depends on the context.  I am conscious I am being very general.  Sometimes a friendship group can be created around a child but, ultimately, if a child is feeling he or she is not developing friends in school, I often advise parents to try to get the child to have an interest where the child would have a natural forming group of peers.  Many of us will know from being at school that a child's friendship groups change over time and he or she has to negotiate.  It is a matter of listening to one's child, being supportive and giving them confidence.  I would be interested to know what Mr. Holmes thinks about this.  Gradually children have to make their own friends.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

In the past if a young person has been excluded or somebody does not want to be friends with them we have told them it is the fault of the person who does not want to be friends with them.  We have blamed the people who are doing the excluding.  As much as a young person should not exclude a person, especially in a very negative way where it is associated with bullying, as Ms Connolly said, it is useful to teach children better social skills and advise them these are the things they can do to improve.  Some young people as they move into their teenage years can go through their whole lives thinking that for some reason people do no like them or do not want to be friends with them.  They have never been told they can do these things to improve their social skills and learn to make friends better, and that is essential.</p></speech>

It concerns the issue Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh raised about social media companies.  The world has been transformed with the development of online technology in the past 20 years but that has also transformed the pressures on children.  We talk about placing responsibilities and obligations on the school to ensure bullying does not take in the school.  We all agree further work needs to be done by social media companies.  How inadequate has their performance been to date in responding to the threat posed to their customers, namely, children as a result of bullying online?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.502" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Saoirse Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051100002#J00700"><p>I will deal with that.  The tech companies have a responsibility to address many of these issues.  They have put in place some measures to deal with them but much more needs to be done.  I mentioned the online safety and media regulation Bill that is going through and the role for the online safety commissioner.  That is key to this issue.  We need to ensure they have robust powers to deal with what is happening in respect of tech companies, and those companies have a responsibility to examine the way they design their platforms, particularly being mindful of children and young people.  The Council of Europe has issued a recommendation on the rights of children in the digital age, which has much useful information on how to address some of these issues.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child released a general comment in March on consideration of some of the issues arising for children and young people in the digital age.  The UN convention was signed in 1989.  The Internet was only in its infancy then. The convention did not deal with all the issues children and young people deal with today.  Both of those elements are informed by experts in the field as well as children and young people who have had to deal with some of these issues.  They point to ways in which tech companies can design better platforms for children and young people and ensure that they are better protected.  The online safety commissioner is the other key to this and having that in place here to ensure that tech companies must be held accountable.</p> <p>  Another element is an individual complaints mechanism, to which Mr. Arneill alluded, but the Bill does not deal with that.  A super complaints mechanism that would go through non-governmental organisations is not good enough.  We need to ensure fair procedures are followed to ensure there is some mechanism for individuals, particularly children and young people, to complain about tech companies where they have not addressed their issues.  Those are some elements that could help with this issue.  The Deputy is correct about pushing back on some of the issues tech companies say they have addressed.  I do not think that they have fully addressed them.</p></speech>

We have evidence that it is simply is not working.  We must stop being so naive.  These companies are profit-making and the only thing really that will make a difference is if it affects their bottom line.  It is not sufficient to ask them to regulate themselves.  When it comes to age verification, it is not working.  Children are already online.  These platforms and the Internet, on a bigger level, were not designed for children.  We must push back on social media companies.  If there is the political will, they have the resources and the technology to create more ethical design when it comes to their platforms.  This is the responsibility of Government.  We must push back and try to get this regulatory power back in the hands of the Government when it comes to social media platforms.</p></speech>

I was touched, in particular, by the roots of empathy programme and how it is working and I was also interested to hear in some cases it involves a mum or a dad and, in some cases, both.  That prompts me to ask Ms Connolly if there any studies on the impact of father absence on bullying.  It is an issue people are often reluctant to talk about.  I read an article from the<i>Annual Review of Sociology, </i>which examined the evidence of the consequences of father absence.  There seems to be strong evidence it can affect children&rsquo;s social and emotional development, particularly by increasing externalising behaviour.  While we need to be careful how we talk about that, is that an issue we need to talk about if we are serious about addressing the problems?</p></speech>

Children need love, care and attention and safety and understanding but they also need boundaries.  They need to know all feelings are acceptable but some behaviour is not acceptable.  If they are growing up in an environment where they are not given those types of boundaries, they are not challenged when their behaviour is acceptable and there are no consequences for negative behaviour, then one is doing one's child no favours.  A variety of parents can provide that approach but certainly children do need both.</p></speech>

Are we sometimes too afraid to deprecate and to call it like it is with respect to the too early and too frequent access to technology?  Is there a tendency, and the research shows it, that the potential for cyberbullying increases as children&rsquo;s access to technology increases?</p><p>Do we not have to ask questions about empowering parents to say "not too soon" for access to technology, not too frequent during the day and not late at night or in the bedroom?  Do we need to get back to that kind of braver discussion?  This is about "noes" as well as "yeses", is it not?</p></speech>

That needs to be modelled by the parents so there is no point in telling kids to put their devices away if a parent is checking their work email at the dinner table.  It is not necessarily tech.  Tech can be very empowering.  I have seen this in education where it can be incredibly transformational.  It is the type of tech and what is attractive.  Kids are attracted to things such as Snapchat and TikTok which are ultimately not designed for eight-year-olds.  If parental, guardian or carers' support is there then they play a part in establishing that access.</p></speech>

There was a tendency to talk about it as though it were a problem whereas I have a different optic.  There is a Christian heritage, while it is more contested in our country now than it used to be, which is still a big influence on our schools.  Part of that Christian heritage is the "love your neighbour" and "treat others as you would like them to treat you" principles, to look out for the vulnerable in particular.  It seems to me that there is real positive heritage to draw on and use here and that perhaps faith schools in particular can set an example with their long-standing insights into how to promote the love your neighbour principle.  Can we see that in more positive terms?  It was brought home to me when a Catholic school principal told me at the time of the marriage referendum, that they were approached by a student whose family had a principled opposition to the referendum and was taking the most heat from colleagues at the time because of the shift in attitudes in society.  We perhaps do not think about that very much, that we are in a constantly changing society where yesterday's focus of intolerance might be very different from that today.  Is there a more positive ground we can reach for around using the inheritance of faith-based education to promote the love your neighbour principle and the anti-bullying consequences that surely flow from it?</p></speech>

I know I am very young and you might think that maybe I would not be able to speak on this but as a young person in Ireland today I know that Ireland is evolving very rapidly and many young people would not consider themselves practising Catholics.  There have been different stages of secularising by the Government in the last few decades as people of other religions have joined the country and as people have left the Catholic faith or it has had less influence.  I wholeheartedly agree that the love your neighbour principle should be something that schools promote.  I think people's main gripe with the church becoming involved in education is around certain opinions it might hold on exclusion, sex education and LGBTQ+ people.  While the love your neighbour principle is great, that is not the only thing that the Catholic Church might promote.  We cannot necessarily say that what the Catholic Church promotes is always positive.  When it comes to things where it excludes education on same-sex couples, comprehensive education around sexuality and sex education, that is where it becomes a problem.  If the rest of the Government and society as a whole are quite secularist, I do not see why our education could not reflect that.</p></speech>

I do not think the two necessarily have to be combined but there is something there, particularly around today's subject of bullying in schools, that we should all strive to treat others as we would like to be treated, regardless of whether a school is faith-based, Educate Together, or whatever the environment.  I strongly agree with Ben's words.</p></speech>

Really, it is about respect in schools for everyone.  We have to think about what human rights and equality really means.  As long as people are adhering to that, that is the important thing.  It can happen in a faith-based school as well as a non-denominational or multi-denominational school.  We have such a reliance on faith-based schools in the system, because they do make up the majority of primary schools in particular, different people are in them because all of society is represented in those schools, which we have to acknowledge.  If there is consistency around some of the teaching in those schools, particularly around some of those issues such as relationships and sexuality education for example, as long as it is factually and scientifically based, we are all on solid ground here.</p></speech>

The values are fundamentally about respecting people.  Even if there is a difference of views about ethical issues it should always be possible, it seems to me, as part of the formation of students to say that we talk about these issues where different points of view were always heard.</p></speech>

The only place where that freedom of expression might be in question is where it crosses a line.  We are looking at the introduction of hate crime legislation which is obviously the extreme, I am not saying that is what happens, but a line will be drawn and that is where we can look at it.  Discussion and respectful debate is the way forward.  That always helps to address some of the issues that arise for people, particularly around bullying.</p></speech>

It was notable today in Mr. Holmes's opening statement.  There was mention of garda&iacute; coming in and giving their position but it is more about the legal side.  How can young people be better included in discussions, and also parents?  I believe that parents have a very important role to play here.  Some parents understand social media and can identify an issue with a child when the child comes home from school while some parents may not be as quick to find the issue.</p></speech>

If, for example, a programme in my school was being given to first years, if myself and other sixth year students who have more maturity and experience were able to shape those programmes based on our experiences rather than adults doing so based on their experiences 30 or 40 years ago, that would really benefit the younger students, especially those coming into secondary school.</p> <p>  While there are good programmes delivered by garda&iacute; and we do need to know about the legal implications, if there is not a comprehensive programme in my school and I have not been told anything else and they come in and say something is wrong and something is right, that is all I have and it does not cover the emotional aspect that I need in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the subject.</p><p>Other than those kinds of programmes delivered by adults, there are just the general peer-on-peer discussions within that, where perhaps a programme is delivered by a teacher, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or by any such group, and after that this should be followed by a peer discussion, no matter what the topic is.  I hope that answer helps.</p></speech>

It is relatively easily done; it is just a matter of a willingness to want to do it.  As an example, we are working with two human rights organisations within the State about including the rights of children with disabilities in the reporting by the State under various conventions.  With parents, it is a matter of reaching out to them, asking them and creating a facilitation.  It is not difficult and is a question of putting a resource in place for it.  There may be some capacity building involved, depending on where the young people and parents are coming from and their knowledge of the issue but it is easily doable.  It is something we do quite regularly in our own work in consulting with people with disabilities.  It is as easy to do that with children and families.</p></speech>

The Ombudsman for Children made a recommendation to the joint committee on 4 May and specified that this should be rolled out in primary schools and we spoke about this being rolled out on a pilot basis.  Can Mr. Arneill and Ms Brady give the committee their views on this issue?</p></speech>

In the survey that we included in our submission, where principals themselves were interviewed and surveyed, there was a real need for properly trained therapeutic supports in schools.  Otherwise it falls to teachers.  We know that there is a great deal on their plate already.  We know that Covid-19, in particular, has had a detrimental impact on the mental health of children and young people throughout the education system.  We do not know what the ramifications are going to be in the longer-term.  There are a couple of opportunities coming up as well to address what might happen there.</p> <p>  One is the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, 2014-2020.  A new policy of this type will be coming up.  This will need to address the recovery for children and young people following the impact of Covid-19 and there should be a big focus on education in that new policy framework.  </p> <p>  When we go to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, a spotlight will be shone on and what is happening in our education system.  We are very glad that schools were prioritised, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic and that they have reopened.  All schools need those supports to be put in place, not only to deal with Covid-19, but the supports that are necessary were not there in the first place to deal with some of the issues that are arising through bullying and other mental health and socio-behavioural issues.  That is particularly the case in schools where children may be experiencing poverty or homelessness.  We do not always know what is going on in the life of a child or young person.  If we had those supports in place perhaps we might be able to assess in a better way what is happening for them and to provide them with the in-school supports that are there.  Where out-of-school supports are necessary and perhaps where an issue is more serious, there should be a link-up and a way for teachers and for the educational psychologists in the schools to refer those children onwards.</p></speech>

I suggested to the ombudsman last week that there could be a pilot project.  How does Mr. Arneill feel that we could roll out a pilot project in some primary schools?</p></speech>

We have certainly pushed for this with digital skills, in general, by having a specialist within the staff who is trained up.  Similarly, when it comes to the sort of issues that arise from bullying and cyberbullying, if a school does not have that specialist support in-house in the form of an educational psychologist or a counsellor, for example, it will have to upskill teachers with the knowledge and understanding to recognise these situations when they happen, by giving them the ability to mediate, and to be very clear as a staff as to what steps to follow in these instances.</p> <p>  It can be quite traumatic for teachers. Children brought phones to me with indecent images on them, for example, when I was teaching.  It is shocking because one is immediately unsure as to how to react.  Ensuring that there are very clear policy documents in place in all schools is very important and that all staff know where that policy is, can access it, and that they also know the steps to follow.</p> <p>  One example that comes to mind is of images of minors.  By screenshotting those or sharing them with a colleague, even if this is done out of concern, teachers are then putting themselves into compromising positions.  Having that specialist knowledge of how to deal with these situations and knowledge of the legal implications so that teachers are also protected is really essential.  If the money is not there to roll that out in a wholescale way to all schools then identifying, perhaps, pioneer schools, where that information can be cascaded down through and identifying staff members then at a local level within individual schools who will be trained in that specialist knowledge is an option.</p></speech>

I have one final question which I will refer to Mr. Holmes and to Ms Connolly.  Suicide is an enormous issue for younger people and is happening within our secondary school system.  We all have our own very sad individual stories.  Mr. Holmes referred, in one of his statements, to his role as a suicide prevention ambassador.  Perhaps he might expand on what that role might involve and his insights into what needs to be done on this issue.  I am also interested in Ms Connolly&rsquo;s input on this question.</p></speech>

If I was to focus on one thing about suicide prevention and mental health in general in young people, I would say that it is very easy to rationalise it as adults, and to bring it down to saying that if we spread positivity, that that will stop it.  Young people are smarter than that.  As much as one can stick up posters that say that suicide is not the answer and one can cover over a school environment or bullying that is going on, that is not the way to stop suicide or these issues.  A much more hands-on approach is needed and obviously we have been talking about peer-to-peer discussions and of teachers being trained properly to deal with this.  That is essential to allow people to understand suicide.  When it comes back to where we are talking about having therapists and specialists in schools, I am an 18-year-old now, and if my information is correct, I lost access to CAMHS or other external therapy organisations a year ago, yet young people in my age group, between 16 and 18, are much more likely to commit suicide or have these issues than students who are younger, who are not going to be doing the leaving certificate examination, and who do not have as many adult stressors in their life.  That represents the contrast to me between what is actually happening and the infrastructure that is being provided, and there is a real imbalance between them.</p></speech>

Children and young people will have what we have called &ldquo;feeling low&rdquo;, which is one thing.  Then there are very serious suicidal feelings.  What is needed in the first instance is that children feel that they can talk exactly about how they are feeling and, exactly as Mr Holmes was saying, that they are not dismissed or told to just think positively, to do exercise and to have positive affirmations.  If someone is seriously thinking about harming himself or herself, that is not going to help.  What is needed then is a circle of support around that young person.  One also needs to recognise the point at which one brings in particular specialist support that really offers concrete support and listens.</p><p>For some young people it could also relate to meaning and purpose.  We know that things have been very difficult for young people during the pandemic.  I, and all of us in Barnardos, worry about it.  The first thing is to allow that range of feelings.  People should not try to talk some young person out of it if they are feeling low and rather should ask, "How can we support you?  What is useful for you?  If you need a specialist mental health service, that is available."  Then it is really necessary to monitor and support.  For some young people it is not unusual to go through a phase of feeling low, but for some it is really serious.  We should never oversimplify it.</p></speech>

Facebook seems to have gone out the window and it is not as modern as Snapchat and various other sites.

Bullying is no longer restricted to school but comes home with the students through social media platforms.  Ms McGarrigle wishes to speak.</p></speech>

I know we are not able to name platforms.  The platforms vary in size.  This is evolving all the time and new platforms come up.  The role of industry is one of the biggest things we spoke about when we sat down with our youth panel.  We obviously welcome the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, but industry, particularly the bigger players, can do much more and can take proactive steps.</p> <p>  All the witnesses present are very familiar with new safety features and updates on websites.  However, these updates and safety features are not as readily available or communicated to children and young people.  Our youth panel informed us they were not aware of any safety centres available on these platforms.  We believe industry has that major role to play, and not just schools, parents and young people.  Robust effective reporting structures should be in place.  Cyberbullying should not be allowed to take place on these platforms.</p></speech>

His submission and earlier comments eloquently outlined the importance of inclusive education.  I am slightly moving into a wider issue, but I believe it is relevant.  Many parents I have spoken to have concerns about the much-discussed New Brunswick model and they would be keen for children to have tailored supports in an environment with other children in special schools and so on.  There is that desire for choice so that some people can keep their children in a special school as opposed to a unit.  There are different opinions on that.  How do we strike that balance?  How do we ensure we achieve the greatest level of inclusion possible in the education system?  What role can that play in tackling stigma and in tackling bullying based on that stigma?  How can we ensure the parents have the option of sending their children to a special school?</p> <p>  Ms Brady, in response earlier to other questions, substantially answered the question I had.  I would welcome any other comments she might have on it.</p> <p>  I have a question for the Children's Rights Alliance and Barnardos.  While I do not know if we have any statistics, do they have any sense of whether race-based bullying is on the increase or decrease?  What are we learning on that matter as time goes on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.538" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051100002#M00600"><p>The Deputy has asked a very interesting question that we have pondered extensively in Inclusion Ireland.  Many parents I meet will say it can be heartbreaking for them to send their children who do not have a disability to the school around the corner when their other child is going way off to somewhere else to a unit or whatever the case may be.  Those parents are in the here and now.</p> <p>  Last week at one of the conferences I believe the chief executive of the National Council for Special Education acknowledged that we are not yet ready for inclusive education in Ireland.  It is a journey that will take ten or 15 years to evolve from what we have now to something parents can agree is an option for their child.  People simply cannot envisage that at the moment.  It is certainly a fundamental right for children to be able to go to their local school.  However, as the Deputy said, we need to have those tailor-made supports within the school.</p> <p>  There is talk about various models, including the New Brunswick model the Deputy mentioned.  Boiling it down to what we are discussing today - bullying, exclusion and that kind of stuff, as a society we should really be looking at what supports we need to put into schools.  Not all of it is down to supports in schools.</p> <p>  As I mentioned earlier, the biggest thing the Government could do would be to have a campaign on removing the stigma that exists in disability.  The NDA's research indicates not just in school but in workplaces and elsewhere, people are expressing discomfort around disabled persons and all of that.  Targeting the resources is the first thing that could be done.</p> <p>  It is well acknowledged that teachers do not get robust initial teacher training on inclusive education.  That applies across the board, including in respect of LGBTI, people from other countries who have come here, the new Irish, people with different religions etc.  We know the continuing professional development, CPD, in the area is less than robust.  Those matters need to be worked on.  At the moment 109,000 people are in a class of more than 30 pupils.  To get to a truly inclusive education system we need class sizes of a maximum of 20.  Without those foundation stones, we do not have a hope.</p></speech>

That is the whole thing about helping people to up standards.  However, what if that cannot be changed?  What if that is part of the reality of human nature, which I suspect it is?  The history of the human race is that most people are slow to stand up and call out injustice.</p> <p>  If I am right, part of the answer is we need more focus on building resilience.  By resilience I mean two things.  First is the need to help a child to understand what is happening.  That is into the area of restorative justice and bringing people together to understand processes and helping people to understand the person who is suffering bullying.  Second, it is about moving away from the idea that someone is a victim and more to an idea that that person is the agent of positive change.  That takes considerable work.  Is that focus on resilience important?  I would have the fear - I believe many people would - that it might be very difficult to change that poor level of intervention, as Mr. Arneill described it.  Mr. Arneill may want to come in to respond to that.  I have a second brief question.</p></speech>

If we develop skills within children and push a programme on how to become an upstander, which is being a positive agent of change, and then we discover, perhaps, that is not working, that is a different matter.  To start or simply write that off from the beginning as part of human nature is not going to be good enough.</p> <p>  Of course, resilience is important.  We will be insulted and see things about ourselves that we do not like, so it is a balance between those two things.  To get more than 25% of children who witness this kind of behaviour online to even go and tell a trusted adult is definitely a good goal and ambition for us to have not only as teachers but as a society in general.</p></speech>

I congratulate the technical team for waving some magic dust to allow us to commence.  I express my concern and pass on my condolences to those injured and killed by attacks on both sides over recent days in Gaza, Israel and East Jerusalem.  I call on those with influence in the region to use that influence to stop the violence, end the indiscriminate attacks and say the best way forward must involve dialogue, de-escalation and engagement by the international community with both sides in the conflict, being mindful of the application of international law and UN resolutions.  We all need to act urgently to de-escalate from current unacceptable activities.</p> <p>  On behalf of members of the committee, I warmly welcome ambassador head of mission of Palestine to Ireland, Dr. Jilan Abdalmajid; Mr. &Eacute;amonn Meehan, a board member of Sadaka; Dr. Susan Power, head of legal research and advocacy at Al-Haq and Sadaka board member; and I particularly thank Professor Noura Erakat, assistant professor at Rutgers University, New Jersey, who joins us from the east coast of the United States at an early hour.  I am grateful they have all taken time to join us.  I also welcome our members and thank members and witnesses for their patience earlier.</p> <p>  Today, the committee commences an important body of work, namely, a review of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories in respect of displacements and demolition of public and private buildings.  We look forward to hearing from our guests.  Along with the meeting this afternoon, we have scheduled further meetings on Thursday and on Tuesday of next week.  The committee has also sought written submissions from a number of interested parties, organisations and bodies.  At the end of this process, the committee intends publishing a report on the process.  </p> <p>  The format of this afternoon's meeting is that we will hear the opening statements of our witnesses and guests before going into a question and answer session with members of our committee.  We are time-limited due to Covid restrictions but it is my intention to add on the lost time.  I remind members that we are in some way limited due to Covid restrictions.  I ask that the witnesses be conscious of the time constraints when initially addressing the committee by way of opening statement.</p><p>I thank everybody for forwarding their opening statements in writing.  They are invaluable to us in the context of our work.  Following the opening statements, there will be a discussion with questions and answers from members of the committee.  In the first round of questions, each member will have seven minutes for questions and answers.  After six minutes, I will state that there is one minute remaining.  Should time permit, we will open the meeting at the end to deal with other outstanding questions.  We intend to conclude two hours from now.</p><p> I am obliged to remind our witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks in that event.  It is imperative that such a direction be complied with.</p><p> For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence given to this committee.</p><p> I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make that official in any way identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex or the Convention Centre Dublin where the D&aacute;il and Seanad are meeting today.</p><p> For anybody watching this meeting online, some Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.

Dr. Jilan Abdalmajid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051100002#D00200"><p>I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the Chair, members and guests for this invitation to appear before the committee to bear witness and give evidence on the issues of demolitions and forced displacement, settlers' violence against our people in the West Bank and, in particular, the Sheikh Jarrah and East Jerusalem neighbourhoods as tensions further escalate, and Israeli settlers intensify their attacks against our civilians.<br/><br/>Before I commence, I would like to clarify our leadership's position to postpone and not to cancel the election.  The Palestinian leadership announced on 29 April that it will postpone the elections as Israel, the occupying power, refused to facilitate the elections, including nominations, campaigning and voting, in East Jerusalem regardless of the Oslo agreement signed in 1993 and conducted in 1996 and 2006, where six or 12 polls or ballots, respectively, have been assigned in East Jerusalem, and the elections went well.  East Jerusalem is part of the occupied Palestinian territories and it is a key to holding the election.  Palestinians there should have a right to vote and to make their voices heard.  The importance of including East Jerusalemites in our democratic processes was also part of the Cairo agreement understandings among the main Palestinian political factions.  The international community has responsibilities to keep the agreement fully respected and put pressure on Israel.  Israel acts above the law and does not show respect, not only to agreements signed but to all the effort made to bring a transparent and fair election in the occupied Palestinian territories.  We need a strong mandate from our people to realise their democratic wishes for a free Palestine.<br/><br/>My statement today before the committee is compatible with all our messages sent to the international community.  Our voice against the oppression and injustice in Palestine is united.<br/><br/>The situation in occupied Palestine continues to deteriorate as Israel intensifies its human rights violations and war crimes against our people.  The occupying power has escalated its appropriation of Palestinian homes, lands and properties, seeking to accelerate the forced transfer of our people, particularly in and around occupied East Jerusalem and its surroundings in a systematic and deliberate plan to annex and ethnically cleanse it.  East Jerusalem is an integral part of the state of Palestine.  The occupying power is blatantly using unlawful measures to carry out systematic policies of forced displacement, including by use of its judiciary and applying settler-backed laws to occupied territories.  These illegal actions are being carried out in countless ways every single day, in grave breach of international humanitarian and criminal law and in violation of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, including Resolution 2334 (2016), including the specific prohibitions on policies and measures aimed at altering the character, demographic composition and status of the holy city of Jerusalem.<br/><br/>Backed and encouraged by the government, Israeli occupying forces and settlers have ramped up their systematic, violent and racist attacks and incitement against Palestinians in ongoing attempts to entrench the occupation and de facto annexation of the occupied Palestinian territories, particularly in East Jerusalem.  These acts of aggression have become a nightly occurrence since the start of the holy month of Ramadan, with hundreds of Palestinians injured and arrested by Israeli occupation forces.<br/><br/>The substantial deployment of occupation forces in and around Jerusalem's old city, movement restrictions and violent attacks on worshippers at Haram al-Sharif and Al-Aqsa mosque, and the ongoing forcible expulsion campaigns against Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighbourhoods are the latest violations to add to Israel&rsquo;s long list of grave breaches of international law.  In addition to these provocative measures, Palestinians in East Jerusalem are reeling from nights of organised incitement and terror by extremist groups and settlers that include violent marches through the city by hundreds of them repeating anti-Palestinian slogans and threats, including &quot;Death to Arabs&quot;, &quot;We will burn down your villages&quot;, &quot;We will slaughter you all&quot;, and &quot;You know we will kill you one by one&quot;.<br/><br/>Yesterday, the Prime Minister of Israel provocatively tweeted about Jerusalem, stating:</p> <blockquote> 	Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people for thousands of years.  Our roots in Jerusalem go back to Biblical times.  Our continuous link with Jerusalem has been maintained in all generations. </blockquote> <p>Adding to this, the extremist, far-right Knesset member, Itamar Ben Gvir, who has repeatedly called for the transfer of Palestinians and who has provocatively set up his office in the middle of Sheikh Jarrah to stake claim to the area, continues to incite a provocative attack against our people who came in solidarity with families of Sheikh Jarrah, while Israeli settlers roam about freely intimidating and attacking civilians, including children, and vandalising Palestinian homes and properties.<br/><br/>I want to give some background on Sheikh Jarrah, which is considered to be one of the most important Palestinian residential areas in occupied Jerusalem.  It is located in the old city and covers an area of about 200 acres in which there are about 2,800 residents, some of whom are Palestinian families displaced during the Nakba in 1948.  The neighbourhood was built in 1956 under an agreement signed between the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, and the Jordanian Government, which controlled the occupied city at that time, represented by the ministry of construction and development.  The plan at the time was to accommodate 28 displaced Palestinian families.  The agreement provided for the payment of rent for a period of three years, after which the houses were handed to the residents.  The leases expired in 1959, but after Israel's 1967 offensive and the occupation of what was left of Palestine, the colonial Government prevented the Palestinian families from having ownership of the properties and land.  Two Israeli committees attempted to falsify legal documents in 1972 and register the land to be officially at the disposal of the occupation Government.</p><p>In 1982, settlers' associations used fake documents to demand that the Israeli courts should evict the Palestinians from their homes.  The courts' deliberations continued between partial eviction and general postponement of the decisions until last month when the central court in East Jerusalem ruled to reject the appeals submitted by the residents of Sheikh Jarrah and granted them a grace period, between May and August, to leave their homes.<br/><br/>The Palestinian families in the Silwan and Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhoods of occupied East Jerusalem remain at imminent risk of forced expulsion and mass dispossession after the Israeli Central Court in East Jerusalem approved a decision earlier this year to evict four Palestinian families from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhoods in favour of a right-wing Israeli settlers' organisation.  No agreement has been reached as the Israeli judge suggested reaching a compromise.  Our people rejected the surrendering of their rights and will never accept renting their own houses from the settlers who falsely claim their ownership before 1948.  The Israeli &quot;absentee law&quot; allows Jewish Israelis only to claim properties but Palestinians are forbidden to claim the properties when they were driven from the Nakba in 1967.  My dad has a house and land in the city of Lod.  He has a house on the land and we have all of the document.  However, as this law only applies to Israelis, I cannot claim our own property.<br/><br/>The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan provided us with the legally signed contracts between the families and the Jordanian Ministry of Construction and Reconstruction in 1956, but these documents proving Palestinian ownership of the properties were disregarded by the Israeli courts, which work to institutionalise and entrench the colonial settlement enterprise.<br/><br/>The ruled eviction will bring about the forced displacement of approximately 180 members of the combined families who will have their homes bulldozed to make way for an illegal settlement called Shimon Hatzadik, along with a park for settlers under the name King David Park.<br/><br/>The Jerusalemite families residing in Karm Al-Ja'ouni area in Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood and Batn Al-Hawa neighbourhood in Silwan have been persecuted for years in attempts by Israeli settler organisations, backed by the Israeli courts system, to expel these families and install illegal settlers in their homes.Several families in the area have been replaced by settlers, while another family has shared its home with settlers since they took over half of it in 2009.<br/><br/>While the settler groups enjoy the backing and service of Israeli courts and legislation for their unlawful plans, Palestinian families face relentless attacks that are designed to amass as much Palestinian land as possible, with as few Palestinian civilians as possible and to keep the occupation standing.  That highlights the degree to which one group is heavily prioritised over another through a two-tier system that is built on discrimination and oppression.  The issue of Sheikh Jarrah reflects the determination of the occupying power to alter the legal, demographic and cultural status of the holy city of peace.  Sheikh Jarrah is located midway among the Israeli neighbourhoods.  It is a must for them to expel Palestinian residents to facilitate easy access to their own neighbourhoods without seeing any Arab Palestinian on their daily trips in and out of their neighbourhoods.<br/><br/>We are not alone.  From the international solidarity, in January 2021, UN Special Rapporteur, Michael Lynk, warned the international community of the impact and agenda behind Israel's forced displacement campaign in Jerusalem.  He stressed that the forcibly expelled:</p><blockquote>	...are not random but appear to be strategically focused on an area in East Jerusalem known as the Historic Basin. They seem to be aimed at clearing the way for the establishment of more illegal Israeli settlements in the area and physically segregating and fragmenting East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank. </blockquote><p>On 10 March 2021, the Palestinian Human Rights Organisations Council submitted a plea to the UN on behalf of the families.  They highlighted forced eviction as a tool of Israel's coercive environment in East Jerusalem, through which it maintains its institutionalised regime of racial domination and oppression over the Palestinian people, which is a system of apartheid.  Unlawfully applying Israeli law to occupied territory, Israeli courts have ruled in favour of lawsuits undertaken by settler organisations to forcibly expel the Palestinian families.<br/><br/>On 22 April, representatives of 28 Palestinian families, comprising approximately 500 Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah and 191 endorsing organisations, sent a letter to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, ICC.  They called to urgently include the imminent forced displacement of Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah as part of the investigation on the situation in the state of Palestine, with specific regard to war crimes and crimes against humanity, including the forcible transfer, appropriation of property, persecution, apartheid, and other inhumane acts causing great suffering arising from their forced expulsion.<br/><br/>Last week, a Human Rights Watch report stated that the Israeli Government has pursued an intent to maintain the domination of Jewish settlers over Palestinians throughout the territory it controls.  In the occupied Palestine territory, including East Jerusalem, that intent has been coupled with systematic oppression of Palestinians and inhumane acts committed against them.  When these three elements occur together, they amount to the crime of apartheid.<br/><br/>Last January, B'Tselem launched a report that found:</p><blockquote>	In the entire area between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, the Israeli regime implements laws, practices and state violence designed to cement the supremacy of one group - Jews - over another &ndash; Palestinians.  A key method in pursuing this goal is engineering space differently for each group. </blockquote><p>Its executive director said: &quot;We are Israel's largest human rights group - and we are calling this apartheid&rdquo;.  The report outlined in stark terms what Israel has implemented in the occupied territories - an apartheid state.<br/><br/>I will talk a little bit about demolition and displacement, which are an ongoing threat in Area C as well.  Demolitions and confiscations of Palestinian property continue in tandem with plans for settlement expansion.  In the West Bank so far in 2021, as many as 315 structures have been demolished and 468 Palestinians displaced.  Meanwhile, in 2020, 12,000 housing units were advanced through plans in 55 settlements.  Yesterday, Israel's Likud party and Prime Minister Netanyahu pushed for a preliminary vote in the Knesset on a Bill to legalise outposts in the West Bank.<br/><br/>This year alone, 11 new illegal outposts have been set up on Palestinian stolen land.  Last month, EU ambassadors witnessed the demolitions of Palestinian properties funded by their taxpayers and only the Netherlands Government took legal action.  This sends a very clear message to our people that Israel acts with impunity as long as it is not held responsible, and that accountability must be enforced if these actions are to cease.<br/><br/>As reported by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNOCHA, in last February alone, the occupying power forced people to demolish or seized 153 Palestinian properties, displacing 305 people, including 172 children and affecting the livelihoods of 435 other people.  Such escalation has included the deliberate targeting by Israel of EU humanitarian aid, which tripled compared with the monthly average documented in 2020.  This escalation reflects a 65% increase from the monthly average of demolitions in 2020.  The figures for March and April are even worse, and more families are under the threat of expulsion and home demolitions.<br/><br/>Before I conclude, I would like to say that Israel acts with impunity.  It will continue to violate human rights and international law, and abuse our people, to reach what Human Rights Watch and B&rsquo;Tselem said is Jewish supremacy over Palestinian people.  It is not, and should not, be regarded as a religious battle.  It is a political and human rights cause.  I ask my next few questions to draw the attention of members to the plight of our people.  When is the right time to recognise the state of Palestine?  When does one take decisive action to save the two-state solution?  When will the blockade over Gaza be removed?</p><p>When will Palestinians be able to breathe freely in their own land?  When will those who resist the occupation be free?  When will our political prisoners be freed?  I am a Palestinian and very proud of it.  I am Palestinian and deserve to live.  My children who hold Palestinian identity and passports have the right to aspire to freedom and to live in peace.  We deserve to live in peace and have our children grow up in peace.  I ask the committee to support and work for justice to prevail in Palestine.  We need practical measures to hold Israel accountable.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

The government of Israel would have us believe that what has been happening in Sheikh Jarrah, for months now, is a real estate dispute between private individuals.  This is not the case.  It is the latest action by Israel in a decades-long project to remove Palestinians from East Jerusalem and from large parts of the West Bank.  The purpose is to annexe as much as possible of Palestinian East Jerusalem and the West Bank, minimise the space for Palestinians and confine them to enclaves.<br/><br/>Israel is in grave breach of its obligations as an occupying power under international law.  Population transfer is a war crime, which carries state and individual criminal responsibility.  Israel has transferred more than 650,000 settlers into 250 settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories since 1967.  Make no mistake, this is a permanent colonisation.  It is a re-engineering of the spatial and demographic structure of the Palestinian territories.  It is an annexation, pure and simple.  <br/><br/>There is no difference in law between a <i>de jure </i>and a de facto annexation.  The facts identify Israel's actions as annexation and the facts are not in dispute.  Its purpose is to privilege one people and one people only.  De facto annexation is a crime.  It is now well past time to stand for our principles as a nation and to meet our responsibilities.  The focus of the international community on a <i>de jure</i>announcement of annexation by Israel is a political and diplomatic decision, which allows Israel to pursue its agenda while offering the perfect excuse for the international community to do nothing in defence of the Palestinian people.<br/><br/>What we see every day is annexation and we also see its consequences.  The Government should now, immediately, sponsor a motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas declaring de facto annexation has happened throughout the West Bank.  It should then take this declaration to the EU and the UN Security Council for follow-up action on Israel's breach of international law.  The truth is that the events of recent days in East Jerusalem, Sheikh Jarrah and Gaza will continue.  They will be repeated unless the root cause, which is this decades-long annexation and its ever-deepening grip over Palestinian life, is brought to an end.<br/><br/>Professor Erakat will now clearly outline Israel's long-term intentions in East Jerusalem and the Jordan valley, a particularly important part of Israel's strategy.  Dr. Power will outline the law of occupation, how it has been breached and why this is an illegal de facto annexation.</p></speech>

Yesterday, we saw the injury of 612 Palestinian civilians in Jerusalem and Israel's killing of 25 Palestinians, including three children, in the Gaza Strip, which really highlights the urgent need for the international community to intervene and address the root causes.  These are Israel's colonisation of Palestinian lands, its <i>de jure</i>and de facto annexation of Palestinian territory and its implementation of an apartheid regime, all ongoing since 1948 and continued since 1967 under the fiction of a belligerent occupation.<br/><br/>Annexation is the unilateral act of a state proclaiming its sovereignty over the territory of another.  It is prohibited as an act of aggression under the UN Charter.  It is prohibited in occupied territory under the Geneva Conventions and it is a war crime under the statute of the ICC.  De facto annexation occurs when actions on the ground indicate the implied intent of the occupying power to permanently incorporate the occupied territory.  We have seen examples of this by Israel.  In 1967, Israel immediately de facto annexed East Jerusalem.  This was an act which the UN Security Council condemned under Resolution 242, emphasising the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and calling for Israel's immediate withdrawal.  It was some 13 year later, in 1980, before Israel then <i>de jure</i>incorporated Jerusalem into its domestic law, at this time declaring that Jerusalem, complete and united, was capital of the state of Israel. <br/><br/>In the rest of the West Bank we are seeing key indicators of de facto annexation taking place.  This is not a temporary occupation.  We have witnessed the construction of more than 250 settlements and outposts in the occupied territory with connecting infrastructure back to Israel in addition to the illegal transfer in of more 650,000 Jewish-Israeli settlers.  This is permanently altering the demographic of the occupied Palestinian territory.<br/><br/>At the same time, Israel demonstrates an animus or intent to permanently use and exploit Palestine's sovereign resources as its own, including quarried materials, Dead Sea minerals, water, gas and oil.  In addition to this, and in recent years, we have seen Israel directly applying its own law in the occupied Palestinian territory.  A recent example of this is the application of its higher education law in 2018, which brings academic institutions in West Bank settlements under the accreditation of the Council for Higher Education in Israel.<br/><br/>This is coupled with expressions of an intention to annexe.  We can extrapolate these intentions even from policies and plans relating to the expansion of the Jerusalem municipality.  In particular, the Jerusalem 5800 plan has been endorsed by the Israeli Minister of Jerusalem Affairs and Heritage and Minister of Tourism.  This includes the absorption into the Jerusalem municipality of settlements such as Modi'in, Beit Shemesh, Gush Etzion and Ma'ale Adumim, in addition to incorporating Palestinian cities such as Bethlehem, Ramallah, Jericho and the entire Jordan Valley into a greater expanded Jerusalem metropolitan area.  We have also seen and witnessed expressions of intent to annexe coming from Prime Minister Netanyahu who stated that Israel has every right to claim sovereignty over these territories in Area C and that the establishment of Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria is not illegal.<br/><br/>Why are we looking for a motion on de facto annexation now?  Last year, we saw Israel emboldened by the US peace plan and pushing towards a <i>de jure </i>annexation last July.</p><p>Since this has been called off, we have now seen a real acceleration in de facto annexation.  We have seen house demolitions increasing, with 535 documented last year by Al-Haq.  This was twice the annual average of the past ten years.  We are really seeing a rapid increase in demolitions.  In 2020, Israel also accelerated settlement expansion, and appropriated a further 5,000 acres of Palestinian lands for settlements.  We are now seeing an acceleration towards the conclusion of the colonisation of Palestinian territory.<br/><br/>Ireland must intervene.  Annexation, de facto and <i>de jure</i>, is an internationally wrongful act for which there is state responsibility.  Ireland has third state obligations to not recognise and not render agent assistance to a responsible state that is maintaining a situation of annexation.  We call on Ireland, as a starting point, to: introduce a motion recognising Israel's de facto annexation of the occupied Palestinian territory; to recognise the state of Palestine, which is already recognised by 139 states, and which is a non-member state of the UN; and to progress the occupied territories Bill.  As the UN Special Rapporteur, Mr. Michael Lynk, said, international law must not be an umbrella that folds at the first sight of rain.  It is critical, given the situation on the ground, to respond to the root causes.  Ireland is looked on as a leader on Palestine, and it must come to the fore.  We cannot hide behind the collective ambivalence of Europe on this.  Palestine is disappearing before our eyes.  The erasure of Palestine has happened on our watch.  We must address the root causes, introduce a motion on annexation, and ensure the collective right of self-determination of Palestinian people as a whole and the collective right of return of Palestinian refugees and exiles in the diaspora to their homeland.</p></speech>

I emphasise that Palestinians continue to struggle against settler colonial removal and erasure.  What we are witnessing in Sheikh Jarrah is merely the most recent flashpoint of this struggle, which is not about home evictions, not about a real estate dispute, and not about expanding development in the city of Jerusalem.  It is the condition against the ongoing nakba.<br/><br/>We are witnessing the creation of new refugees.  Israel's goal is to take as much Palestinian land, with as few Palestinians on the land as possible, and to concentrate the greatest number of Palestinians onto the least amount of land possible.  This is evidenced in, and explains, the 29 contiguous bantustans in the West Bank, the concentration of Palestinians in an open air prison in the Gaza Strip, the concentration of Palestinians even within Israel proper in the north in Galilee, and the impending removal from the south in the Negeb, or the Negev Desert.  This is in evidence throughout historic Palestine and is representative of our condition.  This context needs to be emphasised so that we do not dismiss this latest episode as skirmishes or as a conflict or a need of just removing the violence.  Instead, as my colleagues have said, we need to emphasise the root cause.<br/><br/>Israel's matrix of laws and policies are meant to facilitate removal and territorial taking, cement preparations that are tantamount to an apartheid legal regime, cement segregation and the racial superiority of Jewish nationals, and suppress protests.  This has been found by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, UN ESCWA, and Palestinian and Israeli human rights organisations such as Badil, Al-Haq and B'tselem and, most recently, Human Rights Watch.  Annexation is one feature of this process and phenomenon.  I will examine that using case studies of Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley.<br/><br/>Israel's establishment is predicated on the removal of Palestinians and the assertion of uninterrupted Jewish-Zionist spatial and temporal presence throughout historic Palestine.  This is why the committee is likely to hear from its other witnesses this week that there is no occupation, that there was no Palestinian sovereignty prior to 1948, that this is a <i>sui generis</i>occupation, and that this is Judea and Samaria on what is disputed territory.  This is simply a legal argument that the international community has long rejected, and which should not be given any air time now 70 years onwards.<br/><br/>Israel achieved its initial mass removal of Palestinians in the course of the 1948 war, between December 1947 and 1949, when it forcibly exiled some 80% of the native Palestinian population.  Upon its establishment in 1948, Israel continued this process in West Jerusalem where it forcibly removed 80,000 Palestinians.  The 1967 war offered a significant opportunity for Israel to continue its expansionist projects under the framework of <i>sui generis</i>occupation law and the myth of temporality and military necessity.  Immediately following the close of the 1967 war, Israel annexed East Jerusalem despite international opposition and two UN Security Council resolutions that were supported by Israel's primary allies at the time, namely the US and the UK.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Israel expanded Jerusalem's municipal boundaries by roughly ten times, annexing some 17,000 acres of West Bank lands.  Rather than reverse these takings, the Oslo accords legitimated them as it recognised 54% of the settlements as Jewish neighbourhoods.  Since 1993, Israel has continued to use a mix of martial and administrative law to pursue its territorial ambitions and the removal of Palestinians through policies, including tenuous residency rights, state lands, absentee lands appropriation, the route of the annexation wall, development of nature reserves, impunity for settler violence, and discriminatory planning and home demolitions.  All of this is done separately so that we cannot see it as an holistic whole that merits outright condemnation and national action such as sanctions.<br/><br/>Similarly, Israel's leadership has historically marked the Jordan Valley as being of military, economic and political significance.  In 1968, the then labour minister, Yigal Allon, included the area within the scope of Israel's defensible borders, and thus within the scope of the State's permanent borders.  Multiple Israeli leaders, from the dovish Yitzhak Rabin, to the more hawkish Benjamin Netanyahu have reiterated that the Jordan Valley, or the easternmost border along Jordan, which constitutes 30% of the West Bank territory, is part of its &quot;security border&quot;.  Israel will not withdraw from it under any circumstances.  Israel declared 60% of the Jordan Valley as a closed military zone in 1967.  It built its first settlements there in the early 1970s, and consolidated its control during the Oslo accords when it declared 90% of the Jordan valley as Area C under full Israeli civil and military control, under the Oslo II framework.  Since 1967, Israel has reduced the Palestinian population in the Jordan Valley from 320,000 Palestinians to 60,000.  It limits Palestinian access to less than 1% of Area C.  It has settled approximately 11,000 settlers across 37 settlements in the valley.  What they continue to say has not been subject to <i>de jure</i>annexation is in fact annexed today, and off limits to Palestinians.  Are members aware that the Dead Sea, which is one of the wonders of the world and is adjacent to and literally within driving distance of Palestinian families, including my own in Jericho, is off limits to Palestinians?  Any member of this committee can travel today to visit that wonder of the world, can spread that mud on your body and can float in that water, but my own family who live there cannot access that same water and wonder of the world, specifically because we are marked for removal and Israel tells the world that this is necessary for military purposes and only temporary.  In fact we are marked for removal.  It is a matter of time.  What is happening in Sheikh Jarrah will happen to us too in the valley.  The territory is a significant source of water, underscoring Israel's intransigent refusal to withdraw from it.</p><p>In 2001, Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, underscored Israel's permanent ambition when he was asked whether Israel would withdraw from the Jordan Valley and replied:</p><blockquote>	Is it possible today to concede control of the hill aquifer which supplies a third of our water?  Is it possible to cede the buffer zone in the Jordan Rift Valley?  You know, it's not by accident that the settlements are located where they are. </blockquote><p>Despite everything that Israeli leaders, officials and people's empirical evidence have demonstrated to us, we keep reverting to the fictions of temporality, military necessity, occupation and peace process when the writing has been on the wall that Palestinians are marked for settler colonial erasure, that Israel intends to cement its apartheid regime and that it is a matter of time before Palestinians are all made refugees, where they can remain as nondescript Arabs on the land, but not as a national people or a juridical people with the right to self-determination.  <br/><br/>I hope that Ireland will help to break this pattern and inspire the rest of the world to take a different course.  I look forward to members' questions during the discussion.</p></speech>

I thank her for her most graphic presentation.  I have had the experience of driving by car from Jerusalem to Jericho, the Dead Sea, across the Allenby Bridge into Jordan and Amman.  It is a most beautiful part of the world.  It is tragic to see it engulfed in the type of conflict to which she made reference.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Meehan and Ambassador Abdalmajid for remaining with us.  I will now invite members to pose their questions and make observations.  There is a lot of information before the committee by way of the presentations.  I remind members of the time constraint and ask that they be as concise as possible in their questions.  I will confine them to a maximum of seven minutes, but they are free to share their slot with party colleagues.  The first speaker is Deputy John Brady, followed by Senator Joe O'Reilly and I, again, ask them to be conscious of the time because I know that our experts are keen to deal with members' queries and to engage further with us over the next hour or more.</p></speech>

Before commenting further and posing some questions, I would like to offer the ambassador and the Palestinian people my condolences, and those of my party, Sinn F&eacute;in, in regard to the slaughter of the 25 innocent civilians in the Gaza Strip last night.  I understand from various media reports that between six and nine of those murdered were children.  I also condemn the provocation by the Israelis in terms of their actions in East Jerusalem, and the attack and assault on the al-Aqsa Mosque as well.  The inaction of the international community has empowered and emboldened Israel in the outworking of its illegal policy of colonial expansion into Palestinian lands.  The ICC investigation into war crimes by Israel is significant, as is the announcement by Israel that it will not co-operate with that investigation.  The recent reports from a number of human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, that find the Israeli authorities are committing crimes against humanity, and of apartheid and persecution, are also significant.</p><p>Mr. Meehan outlined that waiting for Israel to announce <i>de jure</i>annexation of West Bank settlements, as they have done in East Jerusalem, is no longer an acceptable response to grave breaches of international law, of which we heard already, and the fundamental rights of Palestine.  No government in the world can hide behind that false argument.  That response allows Israel to continue its core plan, which as referenced by a number of our guests, is to take as much Palestinian land as possible with as few Palestinians as possible and to pen into enclaves as many Palestinians as possible, as we have seen in the Gaza Strip and in a number of other areas, as referenced by Dr. Erakat.  Since 1967, more than 250 settlements have been established throughout the West Bank and East Jerusalem and these are inhabited by more than 650,000 settlers.  As a committee, we need to reflect on that and raise questions about it with the Israeli ambassador in our meeting with him on Thursday.  I agree with all of our speakers that words of condemnation are no longer enough.  We need a response from the international community that will stop the destruction of the Palestinian people.  </p><p>I would like to pose a number of specific questions to our witnesses, starting with the ambassador.  In her view, what should Ireland and the wider community do now?  We have heard what measures should be taken, but what specifically should Ireland as a country, a member of the EU and a member of the UN Security Council do?  What should the parties within the Oireachtas, as Ireland's lawmakers do?  What does the ambassador believe the Irish people can do at this time to stop the ethnic cleansing and the apartheid system and policies being perpetrated on the Palestinian people by the Israelis?  </p><p>I have two other specific questions.  Our witnesses have outlined that de facto annexation has taken place in much of the West Bank.  I ask Dr. Power to clarify where in international law de facto annexation is recognised.  That is an important question.  I have posed it to numerous Ministers and people, but they tend to hide behind different words and terminology.  I would welcome a comment from Dr. Power on where in international law de facto annexation is recognised.  </p><p>The breaches of international law and the deteriorating situation in Jerusalem were outlined in the presentations.  We are seeing the situation in East Jerusalem and the imminent evictions in Sheikh Jarrah play out before our eyes.  I ask Dr. Power in the first instance to outline what range of countermeasures are available to the international community by way of response, but other witnesses may also respond.  I know we are caught for time, but I would ask that the witnesses comment briefly on what role the current toxic atmosphere that surrounds domestic politics within Israel is playing in stoking the tensions that led to the unrest in East Jerusalem and the West Bank? </p><p>I, again thank all of our witnesses for joining us this afternoon.</p></speech>

I propose to take questions from Senator Joe O'Reilly and to then ask the witnesses to respond to the questions posed by Deputy Brady and Senator O'Reilly.  Senator O'Reilly is a long-standing member of the parliamentary assembly, the Council of Europe and he is Leas-Chathaoirleach of our Upper House, the Seanad.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.569" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1692" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051100002#J00100"><p>I thank the Chairman.  The recent violence and deaths form a tragic and very serious backdrop to this conversation and give it a particular poignancy and importance.  I concur with the initial vote of sympathy expressed by the Chairman and his exhortation for the violence to stop.  He was followed in that regard by Deputy Brady.  I certainly concur with those sentiments.</p><p>There is no question but that there has been an acceleration in demolitions and settlements, with the areas of Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan being outstanding examples of that.  It is completely wrong and immoral, and contrary to international law.  The ambassador stated: &quot;...315 structures have been demolished and 468 Palestinians displaced.  Meanwhile, in 2020, 12,000 housing units were advanced.&quot;  That is a shocking set of figures.  Is this system of illegal settlements intended to block a two-state solution and make it a practical impossibility?  I ask our guests to be more specific on whether the two-state solution will be unachievable at the end of the day, given the state of settlements, unless there is another whole depopulation. </p><p>On the issue of elections, what is happening is tragic and wrong on all fronts.  The Chairman made kind reference to my involvement with the Council of Europe.  Its fundamental principle is the preservation of democracy and the rule of law and its <i>modus vivendi</i>is based around that.  It is horrendous that the elections are not being held.  I ask our guests to elaborate on the practical issues that prevented the holding of the elections in Jerusalem.  The ambassador stated that they have been postponed, rather than cancelled.  It would be tragic for them to be cancelled; it is already tragic that they have been postponed.  Although the violence is the immediate issue now, when does she expect that a properly conducted democratic election could be held?  That is important.</p><p>I am of the view that there is no difference between de facto annexation and <i>de jure </i>annexation.  Annexation is annexation.  I refer to the acquisition of resources as the aquifer in Jordan valley, etc., and the building of distinct infrastructure to consolidate the settlements and set up roads, etc.  It is all wrong.</p><p>This is an all-party committee of the Oireachtas and party politics do not enter into our considerations.  However, all present might accept that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is genuinely serious about this question and has engaged seriously on it.  What specific recommendations do our guests have regarding the actions Ireland could take at the UN?  I am aware of what they want to be done domestically and that is a question for the parties and the Parliament, but what do they think Ireland can do at the UN and within the EU that is not currently happening?  Deputy Brady asked what they think we should do domestically.</p><p>That is my input.  I appreciate the opportunity to contribute.  It is so sad and horrific that we are meeting and discussing this issue in the context of 25 Palestinians having died and 600 having been injured.  I join in offering sympathies to the ambassador.  It is horrific that anybody is injured or killed in this conflict, no matter who they are.  It is shocking.</p></speech>

I invite the ambassador to address the issues raised by Deputy Brady and Senator O'Reilly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.571" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Dr. Jilan Abdalmajid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051100002#J00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  Deputy Brady asked what we want from the Government, the parties and the Irish people.  Ireland is a small country in Europe, but the Deputy's remarks reminded me that New Zealand submitted a resolution regarding the settlements to the UN Security Council in 2016.  It is a small country but the resolutions it put forward have been adopted by the UN Security Council and that is great.  Ireland has a great opportunity by virtue of its role on the Security Council to present something to support Palestinian rights in Palestine.<br/><br/>I refer to the issue of annexation.  As Senator O'Reilly stated, there is no difference between <i>de jure </i>annexation and de facto annexation.  Israel annexed the occupied territories in 1967 and has applied its law there since then.  In terms of appropriating land, more than 60% of Area C on the West Bank has been annexed.  As Deputy Brady stated, 250 settlements have been built on stolen land and are occupied by more than 650,000 settlers.  In comparison, when we signed the Oslo agreement in 1993 there were only 200,000 settlers, living in fewer than 150 settlements.  It is important for the issue of settlements, colonisation and annexation to be brought to the UN Security Council and for it to issue a resolution.  As I stated, New Zealand is a small country but it managed to submit a resolution on this issue.  Ireland has a role within the international community in supporting Palestinians.  In light of the relations of the Irish Government with the current US Administration, I think it can do something.<br/><br/>As regards the parties, we are engaging with almost all parties, including Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il.  So many people are opening doors to Palestinians and supporting our human rights.  The support we have received from political parties and the Irish people in general is great and it is acknowledged by our people.  I refer to the motion that it is hoped will be tabled in the D&aacute;il.  We believe from our contacts with most of the parties that they will support the motion.  I hope Fine Gael will support it.  I refer to the position of the Government with regard to annexations.  It is important that Deputies vote in favour of the motion.<br/><br/>The attitude of Irish people towards Palestinians is amazing.  They are very well educated on the issues.  What we want is for them to keep educating themselves in that regard.  During the assault against Gaza yesterday, I saw that Irish people were tremendously active on the issue on social media such as Twitter and Facebook.  They want to be more educated about the current situation and the historical issue of Palestine.  We are trying to do our best in that regard.  Solidarity groups are working very hard on this issue.  Compared with citizens of many European nations, Irish people are highly educated on the issue of Palestine.  We will keep working with them and next to them.  It is not only about social media.  People should speak to their local Deputies when a motion comes before the Parliament.</p><p>Once a motion on Palestine comes to the Parliament, we want all the people to contact their Deputies to encourage them to vote in favour of it.</p><p> Senator O'Reilly asked about elections.  The election has not been cancelled; it has been postponed.  Let me explain something about the election: from the beginning, the Palestinian Authority and all the factions of Palestinians who met in Cairo before issuing the decree of elections all agreed that without East Jerusalem, there would be no election.  They walk their talk.  We tried for the past three months to work with the EU and international community to put pressure on Israel to have in Jerusalem a right to participate in the election, as happened in 1996 and 2006.  The international community failed to put this pressure on the Israelis.  Just two days before we announced the postponement of the election, we received a letter from the Israelis stating they would not allow it.  There were many solutions.  Reference was made to voting outside and to some people in Jerusalem accessing the polls in the West Bank.  These were not accepted.  The right to participate in an election in Jerusalem is at the core.  It is key to our Palestinian cause.  The agreement was signed and we agreed upon it.  The international community has a responsibility to put pressure on Israel to allow the election in East Jerusalem.  Once the international community could not put pressure on the Israelis to respect it, we could not say more than that we would postpone the election.  The moment the Israelis will allow an election, including nomination, voting and campaigning in East Jerusalem, a date will be set for it.  It is our democratic right.  Every single Palestinian, young, old and middle-aged, has wanted what I have described for the past 15 years.  We lost the right.  Every single Palestinian wanted the election to happen.  With the help of the international community, it is a matter of putting pressure on Israel to allow the election in East Jerusalem.  Without East Jerusalem's participation, no election will be held.</p><p> The other witnesses will talk about the settlements and the two-state solution.  I will keep some time to outline the rest of my beliefs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.573" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. &Eacute;amonn Meehan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051100002#K00200"><p>I will defer to Dr. Erakat and Dr. Power on de facto annexation and on providing more detail on the range of countermeasures.  Perhaps Dr. Erakat might provide more detail on domestic Israeli politics.<br/><br/>Israel has already annexed East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan<i>de jure</i>.  From the perspective of the international community, it is clearly in breach of its international legal obligations as an occupying power.  When Russia occupied Crimea in 2015 or 2016, the EU and various countries had no difficulty in identifying a range of countermeasures to apply to Russia, including sanctions against the assets of individuals, travel bans and the prevention of technology transfer.  It is very easy for civil servants and others in individual capitals and Brussels and at the UN Security Council to come up with a very strong list.  Therefore, we do not need to wait for recognition of de facto annexation.  Israel is already in serious breach <i>de jure</i>.  It has announced it.  What are we waiting for?  For how long do we do nothing and allow the situation that Dr. Erakat has so eloquently described to be allowed to persist?  Her family cannot drive down the road and enjoy the waters of the Dead Sea or River Jordan.  Dr. Power might say something about how de facto annexation is recognised, and Dr. Erakat may have more to say on countermeasures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.574" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Susan Power" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051100002#K00300"><p>I thank the members for their questions.  The prohibition of annexation is implicit in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.  It is useful to point out that Article 8 is of the Rome Statute, in criminalising acts of aggression and acts of annexation as acts of aggression, speaks to any annexation.  We are talking about any type of annexation, be it partial, total, de facto or <i>de jure</i>.  They all fall under the same umbrella.  In considering the UN Charter, in particular, the jurisprudence from the International Court of Justice is particularly relevant in interpreting the relevant provisions.  We have already had an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice in the wall case.  This is specific to the occupied Palestinian territories.  The court observed that the wall and its associated regime could well become permanent and hence might become tantamount to a de facto annexation.  The advisory opinion was issued more than 15 years ago.  Based on this and many other examples that we have, we are seeing a de facto annexation on the ground.  It is not just a matter of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in the wall case; we also see references to de facto annexation in the findings of the UN War Crimes Commission on crimes committed in Ethiopia during the Italo&ndash;Abyssinian war.  This is related to recognition by third states of the annexation of Ethiopia by Italy.  It was recognised by some states <i>de jure</i>and by some states de facto.  These are important contributions in the jurisprudence.  Other examples include separate opinions from two International Court of Justice judges, both related to the Namibia case.  Both opinions refer to the de facto annexation of the territory of Namibia.  There are many other examples.  The EU Parliament has examples on the visa regime of Russia in respect of Georgia.  Reference is made to de facto annexation in that case.  The European Court of Human Rights references creeping annexation, which is also de facto annexation.  There are many references to this throughout.  While we say de facto annexation, let me outline the main difference we are talking about.  Having regard to the types of domestic legislation that Israel is passing, I do not believe we are actually going to see <i>de jure </i>annexation like we have seen in East Jerusalem, whereby Israel formally absorbs the territories.  It is too easy to get away with continually expanding the colonisation without that.  We really saw that last year when Israel pulled back.  The situation on the ground is the exact same.  It is still a matter of annexation.  It is an international crime of annexation amounting to an act of aggression.<br/><br/>A question was asked on the kinds of measures that could be implemented at UN and EU levels.  Dr. Meehan spoke about this.  At UN level, there is the UN database on businesses active in the settlements.  This is before the Human Rights Council.  The database was released last year and should be updated every year.  Corporations that are active in the settlements are placed on it.</p><p>The continuation of this database is under threat.  It would be great if Ireland could ensure the continuation and the annual update of the database and not just that, but if Ireland could also use the database in its public procurement it would be very beneficial.  At UN level, we have spoken about apartheid as well.  It would be good to see a push for the convening of a special committee on apartheid that could examine and oversee issues of apartheid as well.  We should really push for this at the UN General Assembly.</p><p> In terms of EU countermeasures, we have seen this before with the EU's response to Russia's annexation of Crimea, where the EU implemented countermeasures against Russia.  We want to see the exact same types of countermeasures implemented against Israel for its annexation of the Palestinian territory.  We must see consistency in international responses.  Michael Lynk, the special rapporteur for Palestine, has also supported the types of EU countermeasures that we could see, for example, a freezing of diplomatic relations between Ireland and Israel, the imposition of individual restrictive measures such as asset freezes and travel restrictions on individuals who are part of a policy and plan to commit crimes against the Palestinian people, including crimes such as annexation and crimes related to the settlements such as appropriation, pillage of property and so forth.  Importantly, I think we could see restrictions on economic relations between Ireland and Israel, similar to the kind of economic restrictions that we saw regarding Crimea and Sevastopol, and restrictions on economic co-operation.  For example, at EU level if we could see the freezing of the Horizon 2021-27 programme, that would be quite powerful and the withdrawal or suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement and other such agreements, for example, the aviation agreement.  We need to see serious countermeasures in place for acts that are grave violations of international law.  We must remember that there are third state responsibilities and obligations to intervene to bring the illegal situation to an end in response to violations and acts of aggression such as annexation.  Ireland has a responsibility to ensure there are suitable countermeasures that are commensurate to the crime.  This is a denial of the Palestinian people as a whole to their collective right to self-determination in regard to the unlawful acquisition of territory through use of force.  I will let Dr. Erakat continue the response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.576" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Noura Erakat" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051100002#L00200"><p>Thanks to Dr. Power, Ireland now has almost a buffet of options in how to respond.  Ireland can approach this from a fully frontal position of unequivocal condemnation of Israel's annexation and intention to maintain an apartheid regime or instead it can approach it in a piecemeal fashion in an administrative way through politics of non-recognition and supporting initiatives on business and human rights.  This is not about a lack of options, this is not a question of what to do; this is about political will.  I am somebody in the United States, at the heart of Israel's primary patron, the provider of military aid and unequivocal economic and diplomatic support, where when Palestinians are murdered, it is read in the US as Israeli vulnerability.  Palestinian deaths in the US are refracted through a lens that tells those who are watching that Israel is unsafe.  This is the perversion that we exist in, and it accentuates the level of dehumanisation that Palestinians are enduring.  On the one hand, it emphasises that if the Irish Parliament does nothing, there might be very little cost because Palestinians have been so thoroughly dehumanised that the political cost of doing nothing might be very little and Ireland can continue matter of factly with business as usual.  On the other hand, it also emphasises that Ireland has within its hands the responsibility to change the course of history, to be a part of a course of history that looks back and says it was part of the solution that ended apartheid.  It stood on the side of justice.  It continued an Irish legacy of resistance, of principles.  I was invited on a book tour and was visiting Dublin just two years ago and I have never felt such a visceral connection to a people because of our shared histories of resistance.  Ireland too could have had a different history if there was not support and there was not the courage of a people to say, despite the low political cost, we will make this sacrifice.  This is what connects us.</p> <p>  Regarding the question about the two-state solution, again I can give members all the empirical evidence that they need.  I will also provide them with a laundry list.  Palestinians have seen the writing on the wall.  The 1993 Oslo accords and the subsequent agreements that have been drafted afterwards have never ensured that there will be a Palestinian state.  The first Israeli leader to even articulate that there would be a Palestinian state as a result of these peace processes was Ehud Barak in 2000, but the documents themselves only promised derivative sovereignty or Palestinian autonomy.  The fact is that today the Palestinian state is obsolete because Palestinians are separated from one another through 20 non-contiguous bantustans, or what we would recognise in the US as Indian reservations, which by the way I know that leaders who know colonial history will know was something that was developed in North America to contain and suppress indigenous self-determination and sovereignty and was then adopted in South Africa through the leadership of Jan Smuts and is now being transferred to Palestine.  There is a colonial circuit and circulation of knowledge.  What we are seeing is in fact not new at all.  What becomes new is Israel insisting that it has the right to do this, that it is righteous in its colonisation, that the world should look the other way because unlike other people they are a victim and, therefore, whoever is their victim should be forgotten.</p> <p>  There are 20 non-contiguous bantustans, an annexation wall is being built since 2000 that at the end of its construction will confiscate another 13% of the West Bank, as 85% of the wall runs through the West Bank.  The Jordan Valley is de facto annexed, and that is 30% of the West Bank.  There are bypass roads that are off limits to Palestinians.  There are military zones that are firing zones.  There are checkpoints.  My cousin was murdered at a checkpoint on his sister's wedding day this past summer.  He was travelling from Abu Dis to Bethlehem.  Those are two Palestinian cities.  He could not travel, and he was shot and killed at a checkpoint.  His body remains in captivity in a freezer at Tel Aviv University.  Palestinians on the West Bank cannot travel.  People have been calling to ask how my family is.  I say they are fine, because they are not allowed to go into Jerusalem.  Palestinians in the West Bank cannot enter Jerusalem.  Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, the supposed two parts of the Palestinian state, cannot visit one another.  If a Palestinian from Gaza is found in the West Bank, he or she is deported back to Gaza.  This is separation and segregation.  This is an attempt to undermine our national cohesion.  Jerusalem has been explicitly annexed since 1980, despite UN Security Council Resolution 480 condemning it.  In 2016, another UN Security Council Resolution 2334 condemned it and yet the situation remains the same.  I am not sure what the international community is waiting for.  What it sounds like is that even if Israel says that is it, there is no Palestinian state, the international community will respond and ask what are the prospects of Palestinian statehood.  We should get back to talking.</p><p>Israel is not looking for a state.  Israel is going to concentrate us on the smallest plot of land, put a flag on it and say that they have given us a state.  That is not what we need.  We are looking for the right to belong; we are looking for the right to exist.  We do not want to be erased.  A formal state does not nothing to protect us in the fact of this reality.  So, no, there is no two-state solution and it has been obsolete since 2001.  It has been held up on stilts and we patiently wait for Israel to tell us when this is over.  This matter is really about political will and resistance so the impetus is on all of us, not merely on this committee, as committee members, doing us this work to challenge the <i>status quo</i>and deep dehumanisation to change the course of history.  I thank Dr. Power for providing the committee with a litany of options for how to proceed with that in baby steps or strides.</p></speech>

I also condemn the killings and injuries that have occurred in recent times.  Any death at any time is to be condemned.  We must express our condolences to the bereaved and call for all of this activity to stop.</p> <p>  Many questions have been raised by colleagues and I will not cover old ground because time is short.  One of the big issues that faces us all at the moment is Covid-19.  I ask our guests to comment on the Covid-19 vaccination programme in the various areas that have been mentioned, in particular the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  We have heard various reports and I ask the ambassador to give us some up-to-date information on what exactly is happening and the impact.  Israel has told us that it is opening up its economy and leads the world in having a vaccinated population.  What is the vaccination situation for the Palestinian people?</p> <p>  Mr. Meehan is a former head of Tr&oacute;caire.  In my former job with the Chairman, we were very concerned about refugees and asylum seekers.  Where do people go when they have been displaced following the demolition of their houses and homes?  Do people have to move?  Where do they go?  I ask him to paint the picture.</p> <p>  Mention has been made of the freezing of diplomatic relations.  Our Minister has said more than once that if dialogue is cut off completely, a certain amount of a persuasive position is lost.  He is not in favour of cutting off dialogue.  The cutting off of diplomatic relations might actually mean cutting off dialogue.  I have heard all the other arguments that have been made and taken them on board.  It is quite important that our meeting took place today because it is important that we are informed by the people who are on the ground and know what they are talking about.  The history of the region is extraordinarily complicated for very many decades.</p> <p>  The Minister has called on Israel to halt demolitions.  On 26 February, at a meeting of the UN Security Council, he commented strongly on the issue and our ambassador has also been involved.  We have made our positions quite clear but today's meeting is quite important for us to raise awareness and give our guests a voice.</p></speech>

For a period, the vaccination programme was problematic because the Israelis vaccinated their people.  As Israel is responsible for the occupied territories, they have a legal responsibility over the vaccination of my people.  However, Israel rejected all of the calls by the international community to abide by these agreements.  We managed to get vaccines from Russia and China.  We have also signed agreements with AstraZeneca and other international companies to provide vaccines.  We are with the COVAX scheme, which has promised to vaccinate 20% of the Palestinian people.  In the meantime, vaccinations have started in Gaza.  The Emirates have directly donated some vaccines to Gaza and vaccinations are under way in the West Bank.</p> <p>  Israel vaccinated the Palestinian labour force who cross the border daily.  However, in Gaza, only 2.5% of the people were vaccinated while in the West Bank it was 7%.  An increasing number of people are being vaccinated.  Both of my parents are aged over 75 and they received the Russian vaccine.  The people themselves still doubt vaccines.  Like many others, sometimes they do not believe in vaccines, which was a problem.  There is a sufficient supply of vaccines.  Vaccines arrive from time to time so we are in the process of vaccinating most of our people according to WHO rules.  The vaccination programme is working well but we are behind with between 60% to 70% of the population to be vaccinated.</p> <p>  Regarding dialogue, I shall start by talking about the state of Palestine.  We signed the Oslo agreement in 1993.  I know that it is not the goal in all of the minds and dreams of Palestinians but the agreement was our first step to move forward as Palestine.  In 2012, the UN recognised the state of Palestine and that is strong recognition.  We have joined many international organisations.  Without signing the Rome Statute, we could not join the International Criminal Court.  Now, an investigation of the war crimes against us is starting.  Without this we could not move on so I really disagree with the professor but respect what has been said.  This is the case for the recognition of the state of Palestine and nothing has happened.  We are suffering since 1948 and 1967, and now with another nakba in Sheikh Jarrah, yet still the Palestinians could say their words.  In East Jerusalem, the people are defending the Al-Aqsa mosque and defending their right to exist in East Jerusalem as a part of Palestine.</p> <p>  Regarding dialogue, with whom?  The problem is that Israel is an extremist government that does not recognise the rights of Palestinians.  The international community have tried to facilitate dialogue but rights have been oppressed and the Palestinian people have been under oppression since 1967 and that continues.  We talked to the Israelis.  We sat at the table, negotiated and signed the Oslo agreement, which recommended that after five years we could talk about the final status of the water, refugees and Jerusalem but we have not got anywhere since.</p><p>If you want to have dialogue, you need to have at least equal parts.  Recognising the state of Palestine is one of the things that will strengthen our position in any future dialogue or negotiation with the Israelis.  We are not only focused on the recognition of Palestine but also on the rights of the Palestinian people.  However, if it is ignored, it will not be easy to sit with people who ignore our right to exist.  </p><p> I will hand over to Professor Erakat or Dr. Power to comment on the other questions.</p></speech>

All Israel wants to do is to remove these people.  It has no concern for their welfare and does not care where they go so long as they move outside of the boundaries of East Jerusalem into one of the towns or cities in the West Bank.  There is no concern, as the UNOCHA can confirm, for these people and what happens to them.  If they fall on tough times, they have to be looked after by the UN or charities or taken in by family members.  Their permanent residency status in East Jerusalem is tenuous.  They are not citizens and do not have citizenship rights.  In any event, the Palestinian communities in East Jerusalem live in a situation of permanent neglect by the Israeli municipal authorities, whether it is the collection of waste, the provision of education or healthcare, or anything else.  They have a fraction of the annual expenditure<i>per capita</i>of the Israeli citizens of the country.  It is a situation of permanent neglect and it is all part of the same overall strategy.<br/><br/>On freezing diplomatic relations, as Dr. Power outlined, there is a suite of measures.  Freezing diplomatic relations might not be what would be done in the first instance.  It should be there as an option, but not on top of the list from the start.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.585" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Susan Power" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051100002#N00400"><p>I have some experience of coming into contact with people who have just suffered from having their house demolished.  I recall approximately two years ago we visited a family whose home had been demolished an hour earlier.  It is like entering a removal or a funeral.  The house is completely destroyed.  There are bits of clothing, smashed furniture and children's toys.  I remember profoundly seeing all the chairs lined out, like one would see at a removal, and neighbours coming up and shaking the family's hand.  There was such a palpable sense of grief and sadness at what was taking place, and of hopelessness.</p> <p>  We have had field researchers working in Jerusalem who have left because there are so many house demolitions and there is nothing we can offer.  All we can do is keep documenting and asking the international community to do something.  The families are pushed out of their area and usually end up staying with relatives.  They are displaced further and further.  The whole point is to displace people so everyone is confined within bantustans and pockets of territory.  We are seeing that unfold in front of our eyes and it is an ugly truth.  It is all part of the ongoing apartheid.  There is very little people can do.</p> <p>  In some of the communities in the Jordan Valley, such as Humsa al-Fawqa, international aid has been received and Ireland has donated aid.  Even those shelters and homes have been demolished again.  There are continuous demolitions in areas that Israel is eager to rapidly colonise and settle.  We have people who are doubly displaced and sometimes have been displaced a number of times and are living in precarious situations.  It destroys families and the ethos of the family.  Often, the family is displaced between numerous relatives and the family unit is broken up into different households as different relatives offer shelter.  There is a deep hole ripped in the fabric of Palestinian society by these house demolitions.</p> <p>  There has been some discussion on the vaccine.  Israel is the occupying power and has obligations under the Geneva Conventions to supply vaccines to the occupied territory.  We saw Israel straight away reneging on its obligations as occupying power.  The Geneva Conventions include provisions specifically providing for pandemics.  There are very clear obligations.  Israel refused and denied the vaccine to the protected Palestinian population under its effective control and administration.  In the end, it vaccinated some Palestinian workers who were travelling into the territory but it never fulfilled its obligations to the Palestinian population and continues to renege on its obligations to provide the vaccine.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.586" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Noura Erakat" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051100002#N00500"><p>I will make three brief comments to close.  The first is to emphasise the idea that Israel has an obligation to treat the Palestinians in the pandemic.  Not only is there a blatant contravention of that obligation as Israel sends its excess vaccines across the world to curry greater diplomatic relationships with new allies, it is now before our eyes evicting Palestinians from their homes when they should be staying at home for shelter to avoid spreading the pandemic.  In addition, they are using tear gas on protesters during a pandemic that primarily affects the lungs and breathing.  There is not only a disregard to treat the Palestinians, but an exacerbation of that vulnerable condition through policies of outright violence.  "Neglect" would be too kind a word.</p> <p>  Second, regarding what seems to be a disagreement between me and the ambassador, I do not think that disagreement is significant to our point. Whether one believes and aspires to a state or to a different political configuration for coexistence, peace and justice is not the point.  My point of demonstrating that it is no longer that the state is obsolete is to highlight how the peace process framework and diplomatic approach has become counterproductive to achieving any outcome with dignity for Palestinians.  It has become a way for those who want to express solidarity with Palestinians to retract into a crouching posture and say they support peace, want to see two states and dialogue and that we need to go back to the negotiating table.</p><p>That becomes a way of deflecting the responsibility to say that there must be accountability and sanctions and that there must be a restraint on the more powerful party that is oppressive in what is a clear disparity in the distribution of power.  Israel can prevent President Abbas from travelling outside Palestine.  There is no parity in this.  What the state framework does is obscure the power disparity and that this is an issue of rights, belonging and resisting erasure.  Regardless of the political outcome, I urge the committee to insist on accountability, the application of a rights-based framework, sanctions, pressure and naming the power imbalance instead of using an obscuring framework that allows even the United States, which supports Israel in fulfilling this violence, to say that it believes in the two-state solution, which has not only become empty, but a liberal veneer for violence.</p><p> In response to the question on what will happen to the Palestinians in question, they will become like me and the majority of Palestinians who live outside Palestine.  Of the global Palestinian population, 66% live in exile.  They become refugees.  They become people who are living in the diaspora for the rest of their lives.  That is why this struggle is not about finding a new home.  It is about remaining on the land.  Palestinians understand that, if they are removed, they can never return.  That is what is at stake and why even the topic of Palestinian refugees has become so inflammatory within Israel discourse.  They equated the right of refugees to return and belong with an existential threat to Israel.  That is what we must resist.</p><p> I thank the committee again for this opportunity.  I look forward to seeing how it becomes part of the solution in a legacy of freedom and justice.</p></speech>

I thank all of our guests - the ambassador and head of mission, Dr. Abdalmajid, Mr. Meehan, Dr. Power and Dr. Erakat - for what was a fine presentation to us.  It will be fundamental to the report that we will compile during the summer months.  Tragically, the current wave of violence continues in Jerusalem and Gaza as we speak.  I speak for all members of the committee when I say that the right to protest and freedom of assembly in East Jerusalem are as fundamental a pair of human rights there as they are anywhere.  They are fully recognised in international law and must be upheld.  There are Palestinians in East Jerusalem all of whom appear to me to be protected persons under international law.  As such, the international community has a firm duty not only to speak up, but to act.  The current wave of violence must cease immediately, there needs to be an urgent de-escalation on all sides and there needs to be the promotion of dialogue in the immediate term.  We will speak to the ambassador again in the context of our work.</p> <p>  We will adjourn until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday when we will meet the Israeli ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Ophir Kariv, and representatives of the Ireland Israel Alliance.  I thank the committee's members and our guests for their participation and I apologise again for the earlier technical glitch.  My thanks and appreciation go to Ms Ciara Kilbane of our secretariat for the manner in which we were able to have our proceedings completed as envisaged.</p></speech>

My colleagues Senators McGahon and Currie will attend as soon as they can.  The Seanad is sitting at the moment but I am told they will be here shortly.</p> <p>  All Members of the Oireachtas should attend this meeting remotely from their offices within the Leinster House campus.  Remote participation outside the campus is not possible.  If there is unwanted feedback, it may be necessary to mute everyone and the person speaking can then unmute themselves.  I ask everyone to stay muted unless they are contributing.</p> <p>  As regards the questions rota, I propose to take Sinn F&eacute;in first as I understand two Sinn F&eacute;in Members will attend the Ballymurphy inquest report launch at 11 a.m. so they need to leave early.  The order is Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the SDLP, the Alliance Party, Independents, Aont&uacute;, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party and the Green Party.  We will then go around again.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I very much welcome our two witnesses.  The Reverend Karen, which is what she prefers to be called, and Mr. Trevor Lunn MLA will discuss topical issues related to Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement.  On behalf of the committee I welcome them both to this meeting.  The three of us here in the committee room are wearing masks because it is the order of the House as we are in close proximity.  Everybody else is in their offices so they do not have that obligation, no more than the witnesses.  I want the witnesses to be absolutely relaxed.  They are very welcome.</p> <p>  I will read the notice on privilege.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts does and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given.  They should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the person or entity's good name.</p> <p>  I call Reverend Karen and Mr. Trevor Lunn to make their opening statements.  When they are finished, our members will discuss their contributions with them in rotation.</p></speech>

I grew up in a unionist background in east Belfast, raised by a single mum.  I am currently the first and only female Baptist minister on the island of Ireland.  I have been involved in ministry life for approximately 20 years and have worked both inside and outside the church walls.  My work is focused on peace and reconciliation, and I am a leader of a peace hub, Soulspace, based in north and west Belfast.  We are currently in partnership with different organisations such as the Anabaptist Mennonite Network, which connects peace hubs across the world.  We are based at Forthspring community centre on the Springfield Road in west Belfast, which is literally built into the peace wall.</p><p>I have served as chaplain to two Lord Mayors of Belfast, and I am currently involved in various projects including, the Catholic-Protestant divide, gender equality, racism, LGBT+ rights, interfaith work, and so on.  I am a champion of progressive faith and public theology as I believe in equality, inclusion and creating a fair society for all.<br/><br/>Who is my neighbour?  This ancient question is foundational to my work.  It stems from an ancient story told of a man who was beaten up and left on the side of the road to die.  We are told that certain people who saw the wounded man chose to cross the road and ignore him.  However, one man responded.  He was from a different background, identity, religion and a different community.  When he encountered the wounded man he had compassion for him.  He took a risk and knelt down into the dirt and dust to help his neighbour.  Why is this important?  It is important because whether we have faith or not, this ancient story has the potential to help provide a unifying framework to build a nation of neighbours.<br/><br/>What is our context?  The Good Friday Agreement is a document that examples this ancient story.  The document provides the foundation for building a nation of neighbours with a commitment to &quot;partnership, equality and mutual respect as the basis of relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South, and between these islands&quot;.  Twenty three years ago 71% captured the vision and voted &quot;Yes&quot;.  I am thankful for the brave leaders, peacemakers, thinkers and risk takers who brought about this agreement.  I am thankful that my children get to grow up in a different Northern Ireland from what I did.  However, we are still a wounded people.  We only need to view our media coverage to discover that the political backdrop of Northern Ireland remains both complicated and complex.  A few weeks ago I stood with local residents and community activists at the peace wall at Lanark Way.  We created a human chain to prevent young people getting to the wall to riot.  That evening I witnessed a deep sense of <i>communitas</i>and of togetherness.  Ministering in the streets has informed me that the majority of people do not want to return to the past.<br/><br/>What is Ireland&rsquo;s Future?  A few months ago I took part in an online discussion concerning Ireland&rsquo;s Future.  During an era in Irish history when serious consideration is being given regarding possible Irish reunification, the danger is that just like the ancient story of who is my neighbour, we cross the road.  In other words, we ignore the rising number of voices wanting to engage in conversations regarding our future.  The question therefore is, what is the next stage?<br/><br/>Let us talk about a table of neighbours and a citizens' assembly.  I propose that the next step is to set up a fully funded citizens' assembly to provide a table where people from North and South can come together in a place where all voices can be heard.  A citizens' assembly extends a conversation from being solely politically-led to include being people-led and providing an opportunity to cast vision, discuss, deliberate, learn and unlearn, and enabling us to plan for the future.  Most importantly, the forum would contribute to this unifying framework as a nation of neighbours based on finding our common ground, common values and a common vision regarding healthcare, education, employment, economy, identity and so on.  These are what matter to people most.  Brexit is a stark reminder of the importance of carrying out the groundwork before a border poll is called.  The baton of peace and reconciliation has been passed on to us today.  We have a responsibility as peacemakers to have this conversation.  There is a little phrase, <i>solvitur ambulando</i>, which means &quot;it is solved as we walk.&quot;  It is important that we do not cross the road on this.  I support the vision of Ireland&rsquo;s Future and others in the setting up of a citizens' assembly.<br/><br/>In closing, I commend and thank the Government for accepting the amendment put forward in the Seanad last night by Senator Black in respect of the planning and preparing for a citizens' assembly.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

It is quite comforting to see so many familiar faces on the screen in front of me.</p> <p>  I will give the committee an idea of my background.  I am now the independent MLA for Lagan Valley having been an Alliance Party representative from 2007 until 2019 when I left the party.  From 2001 until 2011, I was an Alliance Party Lisburn councillor and Mayor of Lisburn from 2006 to 2007.  I am also a past president of Lisburn Chamber of Commerce.</p> <p>  I grew up in a very unionist community in Belfast.  My father was a proud Orangeman, a member of the Royal Black Institution and was probably an Apprentice Boy as well.</p> <p>  Over the years and particularly since I became involved in active politics, I have found myself questioning many aspects of Northern Ireland life, the fact that at Belfast Royal Academy, where I attended, no Irish history was taught and that virtually no Roman Catholic families lived in my area.  As I grew a little older and as I read some history, the clear discrimination, both historic and current, against the Catholic community was obvious to me.  I was married in August 1971, a date which has some resonance today as it was the month of internment and the events in Ballymurphy when 11 civilians were shot dead by the British army.  Many years on, the Ballymurphy inquest verdicts are to be delivered this very day and I am speaking to the committee from the community house in Ballymurphy where I am to hear those verdicts this morning.  I am proud to have actively supported the families for over ten years now and I hope they get the closure they deserve.</p> <p>  Despite all of this, I still regard myself as a "soft" unionist but certainly, like many others, open to a discussion about the best way forward for the island of Ireland and its people, North and South, including the prospect of reunification.  The Good Friday Agreement makes provision for that discourse and, of course, the possibility of a border poll.  Such a poll is not likely or desirable for a few years but the discussion has started and given the major changes now taking place across these islands, the outcome cannot be predicted, despite the efforts of unionists to play down the notion that it could go against them.</p> <p>  I note the shared island unit initiative by the southern Government and the public platforms for debate on both sides of the Border.  I also note the comments by British Secretaries of State around "no strategic or selfish interest" in Northern Ireland, the recent tests of opinion in England specifically indicating that a large majority of English voters would be in favour of breaking the link with Northern Ireland, the reference even away back of Harold Wilson to "spongers" in Northern Ireland, and Churchill's immortal reference to the "dreary steeples" of Fermanagh after the Second World War.</p> <p>  Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol, the position of Scotland which should become more clear by the time we have this meeting but does not seem to be the case, the disarray among unionists, and the mixed messages not to say untruths coming from Westminster, are all contributing to uncertainty and doubt within the population and to the upsurge of violence, which at least so far is relatively minor.</p> <p>The Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement all make it clear that the status of Northern Ireland can only be changed by the expression through a referendum of the people of Northern Ireland.  The stated requirement is a simple majority of 50% plus one.  It is being suggested recently that a larger majority should be required but I see no reason to change what is already laid down.  In anticipation, it is imperative that voters across the island should be well-informed and there is an onus on both Governments to provide the necessary information.</p> <p>  For that reason I support the demand of the organisation which I have recently joined, Ireland's Future, for the establishment of a citizens' assembly on an all-island basis to seek that information and provide a forum for non-political discussion about the problems and benefits arising from reunification.</p><p>Ireland's Future is clear in its insistence that the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts must be respected as the only way forward.  If that was not the case, I would not have joined the organisation.</p><p> Finally, there are threats of violence from loyalist groups if this is taken forward and reunification becomes likely.  I acknowledge the possibility, but we should not be deterred from the course set out in the Good Friday Agreement and we should work for the greater good of all our people.  I believe if the proper groundwork is done to reassure unionists about how their identity and culture will be protected in a united Ireland, any threat of violence from loyalists will not be supported in the unionist community.  It is up to all of us to provide that reassurance.  That is all I have to say at this time.  I hope I have not run over my time and I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I spoke to Ms Michelle Gildernew MP earlier and she suggested that we take Mr. Paul Maskey MP and Mr. John Finucane MP first, as they have to attend the inquest statement at 11 a.m.</p></speech>

It is a very important aspect of the work that we do.  It would be remiss of me not to wish the Ballymurphy families well today.  This is a massive day.  It is 50 years of campaigning for them.  I know Mr. Lunn has been very much part of that journey with them in recent years as well.  I thank him on behalf of my constituents in west Belfast for all that work over the years.  I am glad that he will see that in the courts today.  I would like to think that this committee would send its regards to all the family members today and wish them well.  I hope it is a great success today for them because it has been a long time happening for them.  I say "well done" to all the families.</p> <p>  I also thank the Reverend Karen.  She mentioned the fact that she stood in Lanark Way shoulder to shoulder with community activists.  I was proud and honoured to stand shoulder to shoulder with her in Lanark Way.  I believe the actions that took place that evening helped to create some positivity around that area and stopped the riots.  I think that was a very good piece of work done by community activists, youth activists and some political activists, as well as people like the Reverend Karen, who worked tirelessly to ensure that we worked together to bring peace to our streets in those days some weeks ago.  It was a bit of work well done.</p> <p>  I thank both the witnesses for coming to the committee.  It is a very important debate.  Both Reverend Karen and Mr. Lunn mentioned the citizens' assembly.  My question to both is what more they think politicians and political parties can do to make this a reality.  I believe that talking is good and that we get places when we talk.  We can learn from each other.  We can have that conversation with each other, which is very important.  At today's meeting, what more can we do as a collective to try to make this a reality?  I thank them and I apologise for having to leave early, it is just because I have to be somewhere very shortly.</p></speech>

I echo Mr. Maskey's comments to both Mr. Lunn and Reverend Karen.  They are both very welcome before the committee today.  As a slight caveat to Mr. Maskey's question, I would be interested to hear their views on what they feel the Irish Government needs to do with regard to a citizens' assembly and why it needs to do it.  A subquestion within that is what protections they feel need to be afforded and what actions can be taken to reassure those with a unionist background who cherish the union with Britain to ensure that their culture and identity is protected as we go forward in this conversation.</p></speech>

A bit like my other two Belfast colleagues I have to go to the same event.  I extend the welcome to Reverend Karen and to Mr. Lunn and thank them for their contributions.  I apologise for missing some of it as I was in the Chamber.  I caught the tail end of Mr. Lunn's contribution.  He will appreciate what it is like getting tied up in the Chamber and missing things.</p> <p>  I have seen both of their contributions independently and in terms of Ireland's Future going back a while now.  I take great heart from the fact that through the initiative of our committee colleague, Senator Black, last night the Seanad voted for the establishment of a citizens' assembly.  That is very important and significant and chimes with the work Reverend Karen in particular has undertaken.  I know Mr. Lunn appreciates the importance of that as well.  While I do have to slide out, I will certainly get the opportunity to read what has been said over the course of the meeting.  I would love to hear their views on the importance of the adoption of that call by the Seanad last night and where it sits.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.605" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Reverend Karen Sethuraman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051100002#C00800"><p>I thank the Sinn F&eacute;in representatives for their welcome and their words.  I want to say a couple of things in terms of the Irish Government.  First, I thank all the politicians.  It is not easy being in the political world in our context, but wherever they stand politically I think most people recognise that they work hard and we hear their heart and vision in that in terms of Ireland's future.  What I would simply say is that they should keep doing that and keep connected to their communities.  The beauty of a citizens' assembly is that it comes from the grassroots and it comes up.  This will complement the work of the politicians because it gives the opportunity to be able to inform them and to give information back and to help the politicians shape matters, and if the day comes when we have a border poll that the politicians then run with that.  It complements the work the politicians are already doing but it brings in people's voices.</p> <p>  I think Mr. Finucane referred to our precious unionist community.  More than anything, it is important to say that the beautiful thing about a citizens' forum or assembly is that there is room at the table for everyone and it is important that we keep extending that hand of welcome.  It is important that we do that right across our communities.  I commend the Government.  I thank it so much for last night, for the recognition that this planning and preparation needs to start for the citizens' assembly.  I ask the Irish Government and our politicians to continue to the next step of that and to work towards that.  The folks that I work with really want to begin to cast vision and dream and just consider if there is something better out there for us.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Maskey for his compliments.  He is quite right that I have been working with the families here for more than ten years now.  To turn to what the politicians can do, the Seanad took a big step last night in terms of what they can do.  They forced through the establishment of a citizens' assembly.  Could I just point out that the British agreements that we have - the St. Andrews Agreement, the Good Friday Agreement, the New Decade, New Approach agreement and the Stormont House Agreement all reference the possible establishment of the sort of body we are talking about, in particular the Good Friday Agreement, which states that "a consultative Civic Forum will be established".  It is not the only thing that has not been brought to pass arising from that agreement but it is there in black and white.</p> <p>  As to what the Irish Government can do to assist, I think the Irish Government would probably be more disposed to this move than perhaps the northern Government would be, but it has taken a good step last night.  I tried to bring a motion before the House in Stormont to promote the idea of the establishment of a citizens' assembly, North and South.  I have not made much headway with it yet because various parties are slightly resistant to the idea, but we will see where that goes.  It is in its early stages.</p> <p>  Mr. Finucane mentioned protections for the unionist community and what would be built into whatever would come out of all this discussion.</p><p>There are three sections of unionists.  There are the ones who vote for the Ulster Unionist Party and would be perfectly happy with the way they are.  There are those who vote for the DUP who would never accept what we are talking about, but there is also probably 40% of the population who do not vote at the moment.  We have joined the rest of the world in not being very good at voting and those are the ones we would need to convince.  There are some Protestant unionists who will never accept this and it would not matter what came out of this discussion, but the question is how big a minority are they and to what extent should their views be taken into account.  Obviously they must be taken into account, but how important are they in the overall scheme of things?  That is probably all I would have to say about it.  It is a work in progress.</p></speech>

I extend a warm welcome to Reverend Karen and Mr. Lunn and thank them for their presentations.  We have been calling for some time to have more unionists' voices at the table.  The witnesses are very welcome here today.  I am very interested in their approach and presentations.</p> <p>  To take the comments made by Mr. Lunn first, he referred to the unionist community needing assurances.  Given all that has gone on in the past with respect to working up all the agreements up to the Good Friday Agreement, an awful lot of work went on behind the scenes to give that assurance to unionists.  Reverend Karen spoke about taking people to the table.  There were many tables and many people have been taken to them.  There were many people taken by an awful lot of individuals who worked behind the scenes, which most people do not know anything about.  That work has not really started yet.  We have seen of late in recent months the difficulties in Lanark Way and other areas in Northern Ireland when political vacuums were created.  Does Mr. Lunn believe assurances can be given to unionist communities, political leaders and unionist parties in Northern Ireland given the leadership? I would like to hear his view on that.</p> <p>  Reverend Karen mentioned taking people to the table, which is a great way of putting it, but we need many tables.  I and Senator McGreehan, a colleague who is present and due to speak next, brought forward a motion on the Good Friday Agreement and the shared island unit last night and we discussed at length the idea of a citizens' assembly.  I spoke against it on the night but we did not vote it down because I do not want to shut down discussion.  It is my view and the view of the Government that it would be too early to have a citizens' assembly.  We are not in that space yet.  I feel that without the ability, first, to meet the unionist community and create that assurance, I am not sure a citizens' assembly would be as effective as we would like it to be plus I would be wary of setting the conditions and terms for any assembly without that political and unionist input.  We are dealing with a very dicey situation.  I would like to hear Reverend Karen's views on that.  Moreover, when the coronavirus scenario moves on, I would welcome if members of this committee could go to Belfast and meet the witnesses and their communities.  Many fires could be put to bed in that way than meeting such an assembly.  I thank the witnesses again for their time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.609" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Trevor Lunn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051100002#D01200"><p>If it is okay with Reverend Karen, I will reply first.  I thank the Senator for those comments.  As far as the various agreements are concerned, it is important to remember not everybody signed all the agreements.  The DUP did not sign the Good Friday Agreement.  The guy who is liable to become its leader, in particular, walked away from the Ulster Unionist Party at that time and joined the DUP.  The Ulster Unionist Party has told us recently it did not sign the New Decade, New Approach agreement.  It was news to me but apparently it did not sign it and let us bear in mind that agreement has not been ratified yet.  The St. Andrews Agreement was so inconclusive and vague and did what most agreements do, which is leave things open such as the Irish language legislation, which was approved by the British Government but not by the Stormont Assembly.</p> <p>  Moving on to the Senator&rsquo;s question about the parliamentary activity on Lanark Way, as I said in my opening statement, that activity has been relatively minor so far but that is not to say it could not become much worse, but I question whether there is an appetite for it.  I can tell the Senator that in Lisburn, in my area, a loyalist protest was called on Saturday night which happened to coincide with the people coming out of mass just down the street on Chapel Hill.  Nobody turned up for the protest.  There was an effort by leading loyalists in Lisburn, as far as I understand, to try to play it down.  No bands turned up, nobody turned up to riot and the main activity there was the police, not protestors.  Nothing happened.  If we look across the country, I know these things happened in Belfast and a wee bit in Portadown and Carrickfergus, obviously, but most of the country remained quiet.  If we go about this the right way in a controlled manner, and I agree with the Senator it will not happen overnight and that it will take years, but the appetite is there across our population to move things forward and not move them backwards.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Blaney for his comments.  He raised great questions.  It is right to fear these things.  It is right to have things we would be concerned about, but when we get to the core of what people want, I do not believe it is political.  I believe it is the things we share together such as healthcare and education and what I mentioned earlier.  When we get to the core of people&rsquo;s lives, we need to acknowledge we have come a long way.  Brexit has catapulted us to this place and we need to learn lessons from Brexit.  It is a great reminder the groundwork is critical in this.</p><p> If we are going to set up a citizens' assembly with a remit to examine and explore Irish unity, then the groundwork, as Mr. Lunn said, will probably take years.  In that there will be difficult conversations.  The whole idea of neighbour has to be recognised.  In Ireland's Future we talked about a warm house for all.  This is not about saying one person is welcome and another is welcome.  No one is an addition.  This is already our home.  The way the political stance is at the moment provides us with an opportunity to have these conversations.  That is really what I want to emphasise.  There is nothing to fear about conversations.  The beauty about the story of the good neighbour is that when the man went to help the wounded, it never affected or diminished his identity.  This is about gathering around a common vision and common goals and beginning to do the hard work based on experts.  We need to be able to deliberate, learn and unlearn.  It will be difficult.</p><p> These conversations are happening at kitchen tables.  We have phenomenal grassroots community workers.  All voices are there.  People are doing this day in and day out.  People have contacted me asking whether and how they can be part of it.  Those are the people who I want to be heard.  They include Kathleen, from the caf&eacute;, Sarah, the single mother, Jim, who is divorced, and Aidan, who is a mechanic.  Those are the people we need to give the space to hear from.  To leave this conversation off the table is not to put everything on the table.  I do not think we need to have the answers but we need to begin to start this journey.</p></speech>

Questions are being asked of me and my involvement in this.  Some people were perhaps surprised with my involvement.  I am being asked plenty of questions not by fellow politicians but by members of the public.  The questions are about what happens to our health service, our education and our policing.  People ask where Stormont House stands in all of this.  I could list all the questions but committee members probably know what they are.  I am not being asked about the threat of loyalist violence.  I am not being asked about major political questions because the people who might ask me those questions have their minds made up.  I prefer to go back to at least 40% of the population who are persuadable in both directions.  I want the unionist population to make their case as well.  This is not a one-way street.  I agree with Reverend Karen on the point about the kitchen table.  My grandchildren are asking me about this.  It is a valid discussion and I hope it continues.</p></speech>

It is nice to meet them.  I read the briefings with interest.  What is nice about today is we get a chance to engage at a human level with personal stories and opinions.  That is positive.  I would like to see more of that in this committee because it is about reaching out to people in their day-to-day lives and experiences in considering the future.  I believe that is what is happening.</p> <p>  The conversations around a vision of what a new Ireland could look like are really important.  Reverend Karen is right to say it is not political but outside of politics.  It is about people getting engaged in this and asking what education would look like and what health could look like.  Obviously, it is important we move aside from the "isms" and go into the conversations of a vision.  I really welcome any participation in these.</p> <p>  I have said this before at this committee.  There is a big difference between the engagement people have in the North and in the South.  Some people are already very invested in this and some are completely apathetic about it.  Others are afraid to have the conversation.  That is why I believe there is a significant degree of sensitivity around this.  It is not to avoid it but to ensure everyone has the opportunity to participate, because it is so important.</p> <p>  The question around the citizens' assembly is about timing more than anything else and ensuring we are gathering the right momentum and doing this in a positive way.  Senator Blaney referred to the talks and dialogue taking place before the Good Friday Agreement.  We have to learn from that.  We also have to go back to the 1960s and the civil rights campaign for social justice and all that was happening at that time.  We have to allow people to get engaged in this conversation - that is what we call it.  We have to allow people to get involved.</p> <p>  The question I have is around the civic forum and the North-South consultative forum.  I talked about this last night.  The Good Friday Agreement is so important and we have to defend it fiercely and implement it.  I want to ask the witnesses about this.  Who do they see becoming involved in the civic forums?  I see it as an opportunity for the people who have been left behind and those who did not benefit from the peace dividend and those in business to consider the opportunities with the protocols for GB and EU markets.  I see it benefiting North and South for tourism and the all-Ireland economy.  That work should be happening.  What are the views of the witnesses about progressing that?</p></speech>

It was very inspiring.  What Mr. Lunn said is right.  These conversations are already happening.  The purpose of the citizens' assembly is that it brings structure.  I am passionate about this.  We have to think outside the Catholic and Protestant divide.  We have to include our Muslim neighbours and the LGBT+ community.  We have to include various ages.  It is about recognition of the business people and the 1,000 people who already signed the document some years ago saying they were supportive of this.  That list contains experts in the medical field, business people and people working in rural communities.  It is about ensuring the work is done and the framework is in place.  Someone mentioned about different forums and subforums and committees where those voices can be brought together and represented in a citizens' assembly.</p> <p>  I emphasise that this takes time.  As Mr. Lunn said, everything has to be included in this conversation, including the conversations to support remaining part of the United Kingdom.  That is important.  At the end of the day, if a border poll is called, we will vote.  That is the beautiful thing about democracy.</p> <p>  I commend the groups that already exist, including Ireland's Future and the newly formed Ireland commission and shared Ireland as well as the other groups working on uniting the United Kingdom and working together for a better Northern Ireland.  These conversations are already happening.  Groups are set up to do this.  They are seeking to bring together a wide range of people.  It is about commending them and ensuring their voices are representative because they have been doing the groundwork for some time.</p></speech>

The question of how to populate a civic forum or citizens' assembly is an interesting one.  I do not quite know how the candidates would selected.  Not having politicians would be a good start because a citizens' assembly would need to have a non-political discussion.</p> <p>  As regards people changing their minds and being prepared to move into a space where they would consider the kinds of questions I am trying to promote and that we are discussing, we should look at the voting figures.  My ex-party, the Alliance Party, has suddenly seen a surge of votes.  One should bear in mind that the Alliance Party is agnostic on the Border situation and reunification, yet it has experienced a major surge in the form of DUP voters transferring to it.  This was very much evident in the European Parliament elections.  It was also evident in the last Assembly elections and it was certainly evident in the Westminster election, particularly in the Lagan Valley constituency.</p> <p>  My thrust is to compare the circumstances that have developed over the years in the Republic and Northern Ireland.  Fifty years ago, Northern Ireland was the powerhouse of Ireland.  In manufacturing terms, it was the big noise.  Dublin was well behind the eight ball, as is said these days.  This situation has changed dramatically over the years.  Apart from the Republic having become a powerhouse of industry, technology and all the rest of it, it has made terrific social strides that people in the North did not see coming.  We would have thought it would never have happened in the South.  The Republic has shown us the way in terms of gay marriage, abortion and other social issues and we are having to play catch-up with a bit of help from the British Government.  All these matters needs to be discussed in something like a citizens' assembly.  There are enough people in the North who are prepared to participate, listen and make their own judgments on them.</p></speech>

It is refreshing to hear from them.  I was really struck by Reverend Karen's point that what people want is not just politics.  We have had a lot of that but it is a matter of getting into the substance.  Reverend Karen will probably be aware the New Ireland Commission was launched last week by the SDLP.  Quite a few months of planning were involved and there are to be quite a few more years of the same.  Dozens of sectoral experts and thinkers have been assembled to try to get into &mdash; to echo quote Donald Rumsfeld &mdash; the known knowns, unknown unknowns and all the other matters we need to discuss, because the reality is that while we talk about the constitutional conversation, it is about so much more than the Constitution.  My regret has been that even in the 20-plus years since the Good Friday Agreement, there has been so little talk and action concerning meaningful change in people's lives.  I hope that, through the New Ireland Commission, we will consider the why of the new Ireland and not just the how.  It is exciting work but it is quite clear already, even from our initial meetings and the various strands of work, that it is probably a marathon and not a sprint, or some distance in between.</p> <p>  Senator Currie's summary on a citizens' assembly is correct.  It is right to start thinking about the structure, agenda, some of the topics, the parameters and how we might take it forward.  There are really good ideas circulating but I am not sure whether the initiative is ready to burst out just yet.</p> <p>  Many of us are thinking about the future but today is also very much a day on which our very grim past is in view.  Like others, I express solidarity with the Ballymurphy families, who have been relentless in their campaign and dignified.  They have done so much of the detailed work that credible investigations should have been doing.  I look forward to hearing that work vindicated today.  I regret the families have had to wait so long.</p> <p>  Today, with horrible timing and, I believe, ill intent, the UK will be announcing an amnesty on prosecutions and, we understand, a departure from the Stormont House Agreement and the attempt to try to get to grips with the past.  How do the witnesses believe the past can somehow be decoupled from the future in this debate?  We are aware that no matter how many years go by, whether in decades or centuries, the past and all that went on here plumbs into many people's political viewpoints.  How do we go about detoxifying in this regard?  Understandably, both witnesses have talked about the threats of violence over the protocol and other such matters.  With their experience of different communities, how do they believe we can make a break and move forward with some sort of joint, shared commitment to non-violence and to putting the ugly part of our past behind us together?</p></speech>

She mentioned the SDLP initiative, the New Ireland Commission, at the start.  It is a very good initiative.  I wish it a fair wind.  I hope it does not overshadow what we are trying to establish, which is a non-political citizens' assembly.  There is no reason it should but we will see how it goes.  I wish Ms Hanna well with it.</p> <p>  I am glad somebody raised the issue of legacy given the day that is in it.  I am referring to the British Government's timing, or Mr. Boris Johnson&rsquo;s timing, and bringing this into the Queen&rsquo;s speech.  While the Queen's speech had to be today, did this have to be mentioned in it?  We will see what the Queen is actually told to say but it does not sound good.  People have asked me about this and I have said I would not like to be in the position of having to tell the Ballymurphy families that if they have a successful day today, there will be no prospect of prosecution or further investigation.  I could not say that to them.</p> <p>  The UK Government has been at this for some time.  It may be that it will get away with it on some basis.  I am waiting to see what is actually in the document.  It is hard to believe that blanket immunity would be issued for people.  At the same time, if it goes the other way and soldiers are prosecuted for what happened in various incidents here, we should bear in mind that under one of the agreements, many prisoners, terrorist prisoners, were let out without having completed their sentences and that others who perhaps should have had much longer sentences had them restricted to just two years, with the prospect of some remission.  Therefore, I would not realistically expect soldiers to go to jail, but that should not mean there should be no investigation and no attempt at prosecution.  There is such a thing as a suspended sentence.  We have a long way to go with that but it is certainly a matter for both the New Ireland Commission and the citizens' assembly to discuss.</p></speech>

There is room for everyone.  All of the groups can complement and inform one another and work together.  There is no reason there cannot be a sense of togetherness in a citizens' assembly.  I love the range of stellar and good people from all walks of life that the New Ireland Commission has pooled together, while also recognising the work of other groups.<br/><br/>To add to what has been stated, we are a wounded people.  Speaking as a minister, my heart aches today for the Ballymurphy families.  It is a heavy day.  My prayers are for all the families and the people standing with them.  We all stand together on this.<br/><br/>As to dealing with the past, I do not have the answers.  There are great people working on the ground with the deep wounds we will carry into our conversations.  Those wounds cannot be something on which we shut the door.  When we are wounded, we can sometimes get caught up looking into all we know, but the way to <i>solvitur ambulando</i>, that is, walk our way through that, is to provide fresh vision.  Fresh vision can provide hope and a way forward even when we have to walk wounded.  All of us have been wounded by the past.  Our common ground is that there is room for fresh vision.  I do not view the wounds of our past as something on which a door should be closed.  They are part of who we are, but we can walk wounded and have been doing so.  However, we need to ask ourselves whether we can remain in this place or if we are ready to embrace a fresh vision of a better future.</p></speech>

It is a shadow on the conversation but it does not have to define us.  Perhaps we can find ways to process what happened.</p> <p>  Keep up the good work.  As I stated at last week's meeting, we should let a thousand flowers bloom on this because some people will be plumbed into networks and organisations like the citizens' assembly, Ireland's Future and the New Ireland Commission while others will not be and will just hold their views quietly.  It is a question of how we bring them all together.  I look forward to working with Reverend Karen over the next few years.</p></speech>

I wish to reference the families of Ballymurphy and send our solidarity and thoughts to them in their long search for justice.  I hope they achieve a large part of that today.</p> <p>  I agree with what Reverend Karen said about timing.  I often find it interesting that commentators say that matters are moving slowly in the North and so on, but these issues take generations to change.  Even in the South, the difficulties stemming from Civil War politics lasted generations, and they were not as deep as those that exist in the North of Ireland.</p> <p>  Mr. Lunn indicated how the 50% plus one was important.  There is a considerable debate in the South on whether the 50% plus one is the right way to proceed.  We must have voices to indicate the importance of the democratic decision, and that democracy has not changed in all of these discussions.</p> <p>  I would be a little cautious about a citizens' assembly.  There are different views in the South as to how effective the Citizens' Assembly was in recent years.  It has a role in allowing people who may not be politically connected or are free of the shackles of political parties to discuss their experiences and ideas, but the stakeholders in this process have to be inside the discussions tent.  If they are outside the tent, they can feel detached from discussions.  It would not be good for them and they would be less likely to be positively disposed towards discussions.</p> <p>  I agree with Reverend Karen on how the debate in the South sometimes gets distilled down to flags, anthems and so on.  In reality, bread and butter issues are the most important elements of most people's lives - the health service, jobs, education and their ability to reach their full potential.</p> <p>  I was struck by something when I carried out research into the all-Ireland economy approximately three years ago as a member of what was then the Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  I spoke to people from all backgrounds - those who were involved in unions, business, education, health, etc.  They all pointed to three elements, those being, planning together, funding together and delivering together.  If we could achieve those three elements on an all-island basis, it would mean a more efficient and better service delivery for everyone.</p> <p>  The important word is "convergence".  Convergence does not need to have a threatening aspect for a particular community.  If we converge elements of society, for example, public service delivery, taxation and regulation, it makes it easier for life to function within the island of Ireland, be that in business, education and so on.  Areas where there is a lack of convergence make life harder.  Regardless of what background people come from, we should be able to achieve convergence in many areas of life North and South.  If people then make a decision towards unity in future, and I hope they will, achieving that unity will be far easier because many aspects of society will already have been converged.  What are our guests' views on convergence, what is possible under the current Administrations and how can we work towards that?</p></speech>

Those were the two significant social issues that have already been mentioned.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to 50% plus one.  There is a suggestion that it should be changed to a more definite expression of opinion, perhaps 60:40 or two thirds.  That suggestion is largely coming from south of the Border rather than north.  I can think of a referendum - the Brexit referendum - where 50% plus one was perfectly acceptable to the people who wanted to leave.  They got their way.  I do not see any reason to change what has been laid down in an international treaty, namely, the Good Friday Agreement, under which 50% plus one on both sides of the Border is sufficient.  To me, that is a referendum.</p> <p>  The Deputy made an interesting point about convergence.  When does the discussion on convergence start?  Does it start after a referendum?  Not really, as it must start long before that so people know what they are in for and what their prospects are.</p><p> Reference was made to the health service in particular.  When I consider the health service scenario on both sides of the Border, I am aware that in the South the Government has the ten-year Sl&aacute;intecare programme to bring the health service there up to the point where it could be free at the point of delivery for everybody, which would be great.  That would be in line with the National Health Service we have.  There are people who defend our health service and say that we are far better off than those in the South.  Maybe we are slightly better off in some ways but we currently have waiting lists exceeding 300,000.  This is partly as a result of Covid-19, obviously, but the problem goes much further back than that.  It is going to take years to solve.  When I look at the two health services I do not see an awful lot of difference.  When I look forward I see even less difference.  If we could converge the two systems and increase the level of co-operation that actually already exists across the Border, it would be a good step along the road.</p><p> On the other issues, I admire Educate Together in the South.  It can be compared to our integrated education movement.  I wish it well.  It is something that could also be worked on jointly.  All of these issues are resolvable.</p></speech>

I believe the biggest step the South could take towards persuading people would be, without a shadow of a doubt, the development of a free-to-access healthcare service funded centrally by taxation.  Even people in the nationalist community in the North of Ireland would have concerns around migrating to a less accessible health service.</p> <p>  I agree 100% with the point made on the education system.  Pluralism is the key that unlocks many difficulties on how Ireland should function in the future.  If we have a pluralist society, people can be confident their cultural background, their values and their objectives will have an equal respected place within a new Ireland.  This would be a big step to allay fears among many people.</p></speech>

Listening to them both has been very refreshing and inspiring.</p> <p>  Before I make any comments I send out my solidarity to the Ballymurphy families today.  I cannot even imagine how they are feeling today, with all of the stress, anxiety and work they have experienced over the past years.  I want them to know I am certainly thinking of them.  I commend Senator Currie on calling out the names last night in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It was very moving and I thank her for that.</p> <p>  The witnesses' presentations this morning were very powerful.  There is no doubt that everything has changed with Brexit.  Despite voting by a clear majority to remain, the fact is the North is being dragged out of the European Union against its will.  This brings enormous problems and puts front and centre the question of our constitutional future.  For me, the issue is around human rights.  Irish citizens in the North must have equal rights.  Brexit undermines this, which is a concern.</p> <p>  I cannot stress enough how important planning and preparation are.  History has shown us that change often comes very quickly.  It is simply not tenable as a political position to say we would like to wait until change picks up the phone and announces itself as on its way, setting out a clear timetable for its arrival.  We must focus on planning and preparing.  Listening to everyone here, I realised we are all on the same page when considering Ireland's future given the New Ireland Commission and the shared island unit.  I loved Reverend Karen's comments on us all working together.  Let us all work to bring everybody together to look at how we will bring about change.</p> <p>  The only question I have for Reverend Karen and for Mr. Lunn is around their experiences in their own communities.  What is the biggest fear around this conversation?  From our perspective of the Good Friday Agreement, this is what we need to hear today.  What is that block and that fear?  It is very important we look at how we are to go forward on this issue.  I thank both of the witnesses.  I really appreciate them and they are both inspire me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.631" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Reverend Karen Sethuraman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051100002#H00400"><p>I am happy to say something on that.  I thank Senator Black for her welcome and for the opportunity to be here.  I commend the Senator's work last night in putting forward the amendment, for which I thank her.</p> <p>  I would say that the greatest fear around the issue is timing.  The effect of Brexit is still very fresh.  As I said earlier, if we have learnt anything from Brexit, it is about the lack of planning.  When people do not know what they are going to vote for, it automatically creates a nervousness.  Sometimes, because these conversations are heightened and are happening, as they should be, people automatically panic.  People have said to me they are not ready for a Border poll tomorrow.  I spend a lot of my time reassuring people that the purpose of the citizens' assembly is to begin those conversations.  Leaders in communities have a responsibility for that.  It is not about championing, waving the flag or saying "Let us do this".  It is about settling people and saying all we are asking for at the moment is for conversations.</p> <p>  When I get down to the core bread and butter with people on this, I will be honest with the committee, I have not had one person say to me "I am not up for that".  I genuinely have not had this.  Certainly after the announcement of this on Twitter last night, I have found people contacting me asking if they can be part of this.  It is about settling people's fears about it being rushed through, telling them it will take time and that we are committed to the hard work of planning, preparing, listening, learning and unlearning.  It is about reassuring people that we will take our time with that so that when the day comes, the political parties, the unionists and those North and South will have shared their vision.  People will go to vote on that day, whenever it is, and they will know exactly what it will mean for their families and what it will mean for education.</p> <p>  There is a fear on the part of people who think it is moving too fast.  I believe this is highlighted on social media and in the press when it is actually not moving too fast and is going at a good pace.  The citizens' assembly is a priority and needs to be set up to start those conversations.  Those can begin now.  They are already happening.</p></speech>

She mentioned, like many others, the Ballymurphy families today.  I am going down the road shortly to join them and I will pass on the comments and emotions that have been displayed today by so many representatives from the other side of the Border.  I think it is absolutely marvellous and I hope that the Ballymurphy families have a successful day.  It is going to be very emotional day for them but it is nice to hear that the members support them so openly.</p> <p>  Senator Black asked about the fear and what people are afraid of.  When I was growing up, people were afraid of domination by the Catholic Church.  That was the big thing.  I remember the father of my first girlfriend who told me one night, when we were having a discussion about this, that as far as he was concerned the South was not ruled from Dublin but Maynooth.  That was a big strapline for people in those days, that the Catholic Church dominated everything.  I dare say that there might have been some validity to that argument but it certainly is not the case now, and rightly so.  The South is an open-minded, outward-looking cosmopolitan type of society and long may it continue to progress.  That fear is gone.  There is a fear of a loss of identity and culture.  The ability to display culture is quite a big thing.  I see no reason in a new Ireland why that should be interfered with.  In fact, given the South's record in these things, it will be more than open to making sure rights of identity and culture are protected.</p> <p>  The health service has already been discussed.  People would like to hang on to our 300,000 waiting list health service as an alternative to whatever is going to happen in the South.  I cannot discount that that is a big thing but it will be resolved, I think.</p> <p>  Lastly, there is the cost of living.  I have seen so many comparisons between the cost of living in the South and the cost of living in the North.  At the moment, I find it quite impossible to decide who is better off.  In the South, wages are higher but so are prices, costs, taxation and all the rest.  How do you make the comparison?  How do you make the comparison looking ahead to what would be the situation after reunification?  It is impossible.  There is also the cost of reunification.  That is not really a fear for the population.  That is a fear perhaps for government.  There are other fears but identity, the health service and the cost of living are high on the list and we have to deal with those.</p></speech>

It is good to hear voices of different angles and it is very important to have them at a meeting of this committee.</p> <p>  Reverend Karen talked first about neighbours and I think that the neighbour issue is very important.  Although I live within what is termed "the murder triangle" I always found that my neighbours worked together.  It is a farming community where neighbour helped neighbour and it did not matter from what religious domination they came from, so neighbours is a very important issue.  I remember one unionist man saying to me that, for him, the land was the most important thing.  Whether you called it British or Irish, his 200 acres of land were more important to him than anything else.  He wanted to work it and live it, and it is very important we have that within the rural community.</p> <p>  What both Mr. Lunn and Reverend Karen advocated for and it came across very well was strong leadership.  What we need is strong leadership.  People keep saying that now is not the time and we must wait and get everybody on board before we start.  If we had everybody on board we would be well down the road at this stage.  If civil rights campaigners had waited until everyone came on board before starting to look for rights, then we would not have got them.  That is more than 50 years ago, so things do move slowly whenever we get into this situation.  This is now the time to make the most of and build on the investments of the past, particularly European investment, in building community structures, infrastructure and all that exists.</p> <p>  It is very important that we get a unionist voice into discussions.  People talk about having the right structures in place but I think you can be too structured so we need more informal discussions.  Someone asked me a while back would I talk to a number of unionist politicians and I said of course but I would rather talk in Moygashel Orange Hall where I could talk to ordinary unionist, Protestant working people, and that is key to getting a conversation going with the working-class community.  We are all part of that and, to some extent, people may have different visions of how to do that.</p> <p>  How do we get that vision?  How do we bring the citizens' assembly into the working-class Protestant community, unionist community or whatever term we want to use?  How do we get the grassroots unionist response?  I found at council meetings at different times that unionist, the DUP and others would agree with a lot of the messages that we brought, but because we delivered the message, they would not vote with it.  However, it is very important, if we are representing ordinary working-class people, that we give them an opportunity to be heard.  We did not have much say in partition and partition happened very quickly after all without much discussion or input into it so let us have a better say in this matter.  I believe the assembly must form another version of a more informal discussion other than its regimented parliamentary structure.  It is an assembly after all and it is a good mechanism for a transition within an all-Ireland structure.  It does not have to be done away with.  It can be part of the all-Ireland structures for managing the changes that might actually happen within it.</p> <p>  How do we get the voice of the grassroots unionist community, not the politicians but the working-class people, into the civic forum and citizens' assembly and get discussions going?  I do not think it has to be one discussion; it can be several and very informal.  I thank the witnesses for coming along and it is good to hear everyone.</p></speech>

Their contributions are important in the sense that often we focus on the politicians, particularly those in the DUP and Ulster Unionist Party, as representative.  They remind us that unionism is not just the elected politicians of the DUP and the Ulster Unionist Party, and that there is a much broader unionism that we need to speak to in the North.</p><p>The contributions of the witnesses are important in that regard.</p><p> Reference was made to the citizens' assembly.  Prudent and careful planning for a referendum is inevitable.  It may be five or ten years away but it is inevitable, especially with the way events in Scotland are going.  This will have a significant impact on our island.  We need to prepare.</p><p> My fear is some representatives of unionism insist they will not participate.  Should we allow a veto on a citizens' assembly or on responsible planning for a referendum because some refuse to engage?  I am keen to get the thoughts of the witnesses on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.643" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Trevor Lunn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051100002#K00200"><p>Mr. Francie Molloy made the point about unionists being prepared to listen to the message but having something of a hang-up if the message was coming from Sinn F&eacute;in.  That is a valid point but perhaps it is not as serious now as it was.  When I first joined the Northern Ireland Assembly, most DUP members would not turn their head to speak to Sinn F&eacute;in members.  Those days are long gone.  Some DUP people might surprise us by the extent to which there is conversation and co-operation displayed with Sinn F&eacute;in members.  I hope no one takes this the wrong way, but I believe the idea of a citizens' assembly has to be led by citizens and not by Sinn F&eacute;in.  This is because Sinn F&eacute;in by association, whether correct or otherwise, has baggage and this upsets unionists or some in the unionist communities.  When I joined the assembly I made a conscious decision to treat everyone the same because everyone was there with the same mandate and people voted for them.  I find that useful.  I look around the screens.  I have good friends on the screen, including some who have just departed.  Some are members of Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP.  There are nationalists and republicans.  I do not really mind as long as they talk to me and I can talk to them.</p> <p>  How do we involve unionists?  I said earlier there were some unionists who will never listen to this argument.  However, I believe they are a diminishing band.  My impression of unionism at the moment is that there is a substantial section prepared to listen and talk.  Once they start, they may even develop some enthusiasm for it because the alternative is to cling on to a link with Britain when it is so painfully obvious that large sections of the British population do not see it as important.</p> <p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn mentioned the Scottish situation.  If Scotland votes to leave the union, then to me the union is finished.  I cannot see any rationale for trying to maintain a united kingdom of three countries, one of which is Wales and another of which is Northern Ireland.  I believe little England would come to the fore with English nationalism, and in no time at all we would be driven to another situation rather than working toward something with accommodation and compromise and coming up with something fair to everyone.  It is not easy but it is about the long term.</p> <p>  I have to go down the road now to the Ballymurphy event.  I am sorry to leave early but I really would like to be there for the start of that event.  It is starting about now.</p></speech>

My thanks to him and Reverend Karen for their interesting contributions.  These are not especially long questions.  I know we keep going around the issue of the citizens' assembly.  I am particularly interested in it.  I was sceptical of the concept when such assemblies were set up first.  Now I have become a big convert.  The real incredible value of them is they are made up of regular Joes picked in a relatively random way and there is no alliance or allegiance.  That is one of the great strengths.  It is non-partisan and all of that.</p> <p>  Based on the conversation today in particular, the role of religious leaders North and South in the citizens' assembly and how that should play out is relevant.  Is it that there may have to be two different forums?  Does there have to be one forum and one assembly?  Will the witnesses give any thoughts on how we integrate?  I know several forums are happening at the moment, including the shared island forum and so on.  What are the thoughts of the witnesses on that?  Do we need to keep the citizens' assembly as it is in the sense it is made up of regular citizens or Joes?  Is there a way to combine them or have them as separate things?  How willing would unionist communities be to come to the table of a specific structure like the citizens' assembly?</p> <p>  The other question was for Mr. Lunn but I will ask Reverend Karen.  In his opening statement Mr. Lunn mentioned the proper groundwork that needs to be done with unionist communities to reassure them their identity and culture will be protected in a united Ireland.  Are there any further thoughts or expansion on the kind of key assurance the community would need from the South?  From whom do those assurances need to come for them to be taken in good faith by the community?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.647" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Reverend Karen Sethuraman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051100002#K00700"><p>Mr. Francie Molloy mentioned this point earlier, as did several other folk.  I do not believe this has to be simply one conversation.  The first thing to say is these conversations are already taking place, whether at the kitchen table or within communities.  There is room for everyone.  All these things need to be discussed and thought about at the next stage in setting up a citizens' assembly.  Senator Hoey is right.  If we waited for everyone to be on board, where would we be?  We need to begin.  That is why I keep going on about the Latin phrase <i>solvitur ambulando</i>.  We need to begin to work and take those steps.  These things will be solved and we will work these things through as we go ahead.<br/><br/>We also need to recognise there have been phenomenal people over the years - the Good Friday Agreement is testament to this - who have been risk takers.  These have been people who crossed the divide and recognised we are neighbours of each other.  My community is your community and my people are your people.  That is the whole heartbeat of being a neighbour.  Those people exist.  People poured onto the street in Lanark Way, ranging from politicians to youth workers to parents and residents, to say &quot;No&quot; to this.  They sought to create a better way to do this.  This shows there are people living out day by day what it means to be a neighbour.  Recognising the shared island publication is a great initiative.  It is about building a nation of neighbours.  It has already started.<br/><br/>A question was asked about getting unionists on board.  Mr. Lunn said there will always be people who will pull up the drawbridge.  It is back to the ancient story of crossing the road and wishing to ignore it and not be part of it.  The reality is the majority of voices I hear from and the people I work with in all sections of the community are open for conversation.  They recognise this conversation needs to happen and are ready for it.  I believe we will be relying on grassroots community leaders, youth workers and people who work across the communities.  Earlier I mentioned our community centre is built into the peace wall.</p><p>It is people who were doing this long before I or anybody else ever came along.  The baton has been passed on to us but the gatekeepers, those who want the peace and reconciliation, are there.  This gives us an opportunity to do that but it is important to recognise that it is already taking place.  Valuable work with community activists, day in day out, is already being done.  When I was chaplain to the Lord Mayor of Belfast, this was an opportunity to get a window view into everything that was happening in our city.  These are the unsung heroes as they are working and doing this, day in and day out.  The citizens' assembly gives us a chance to pull those folks together.  Whether it is groups that have been set up or it is our grassroots, this is a recognition it is already happening.</p><p> The other thing I want to say, and I say it as a mum, about the 50% plus one, and there is much conversation about that and I do not see any reason to change it, is that I automatically think of when I play football with my son and every time I go to score a goal, the goalposts are moved.  We need to stick with and to begin to work our way through this.  It is not a case of asking how we engage.  People are already engaging.  It is just to maximise on that.</p></speech>

I suspect it is perhaps a little bit further down the line but I would be very interested to hear Reverend Karen's thoughts on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.650" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Reverend Karen Sethuraman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051100002#L00400"><p>Where we all stand politically is down to everyone's opinion.  I mentioned on a number of occasions that we need to commend the people here and the people up North and across the board for the work they do as political leaders.  I do not see it being one or the other, if I am honest.  The people on the ground and, in particular, the voices of a citizens' assembly and the different forms of engagement that are taking place complement and inform politicians.  There are people who can be go-betweens.  As I said earlier, when we hear from certain politicians, people react in different ways depending on where that person stands politically, but within those communities there are the settlers.  These are the people who say this is going to be okay.  There are also people who, simply because of Brexit, panic and say we may go too fast on this.  The reality is when you settle that and explain this will take time, we are just engaging in conversations and making it a bit more formal, then people get it.  Yes, political leaders are key in this process but the people-led aspect is equally important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.651" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mickey Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051100002#L01000"><p>I thank Reverend Karen and Mr. Lunn for their presentations.  It was good to see Trevor again, who I know through the assembly.  This is more of a comment on my part.  It has been my experience over many years that both communities in the North probably have much more in common than they often realise.  As an example, when I was in the assembly, I was invited a few years ago, I believe, by Westbourne Presbyterian Community Church, by its Minister, Reverend Mervyn Gibson.  This was to do with the welfare cuts.  One of the things that particularly struck me was that both sides of our community were equally as badly off because of the Tory austerity measures that were being imposed and continue to be, even at this stage.  Would Reverend Karen agree that, for most people in the North, it is the bread and butter issues, which some have already mentioned, which are a priority, and the effort of trying to exist?  This is especially the case for people with disability - historically, we have a higher number of disabled people in the North, for whatever reason - and those people trying to exist on the benefits system.  There is a myth abroad that the benefits system in the South is worse, but of course it is not.  It is trying to convince people, if we are going to bring this argument forward, that they are going to be better off and that their quality of life will be improved.  That is a very important point to make.</p> <p>  The dialogue that was involved when I spoke to a loyalist audience in east Belfast was, unfortunately, interrupted by the flag protest at that time.  On a day-to-day basis I deal with people from the loyalist-unionist-Protestant community and we have absolutely no issues.  We are there to help everybody.</p> <p>  On the question of getting a unionist voice, there was an opportunity for one of my own constituency, Ian Marshall, to be re-elected to the Seanad, but unfortunately he did not get the support he probably required.</p></speech>

I commend her on the work she has been doing during the recent disturbances at the interface.  It was excellent to see the community come together, from political leaders to herself to local residents.</p> <p>  As to the discussions we are having today on a citizens' assembly, it would provide a platform to discuss a wide range of issues.  In particular, given a discussion on Irish unity is now well under way, it would provide a platform in which to elaborate those discussions and to plan and prepare for what a new Ireland would look like in terms of the health service and a wide range of issues that affect everyday society.</p> <p>  Does Reverend Karen believe a citizens' assembly or forum could help engage unionists in discussing what a new Ireland would look like and what way they would like a new Ireland to be shaped?  On a second question following on from that, could a citizens' assembly also act as an aid to reconciliation going forward?</p> <p>  I also extend my solidarity to the Ballymurphy families today because they have been on a long journey towards truth and justice and it is to be hoped today will be a significant step for them.  I thank Reverend Karen.</p></speech>

As Ms Hanna and others have said, this is a particularly difficult and traumatic day for the families of the victims of the Ballymurphy massacre.  We sincerely hope the findings of the inquest will bring the truth.  We at this committee have often discussed with the families of victims that the least people deserve is the truth about what happened to their loved ones.  We sincerely hope they will get the answers today.</p> <p>  Mention was again made today of the fact the British Government put out a narrative last week about an amnesty for people who committed hideous crimes.  That would be a terrible reneging on an international agreement and commitment and it would be absolutely reprehensible if the British Government were to go ahead with that.  It would again damage trust in politics.</p> <p>  Mr. Lunn referred to the Good Friday Agreement and that it being respected in all of its parts was the only way forward.  If we want to get to a new, agreed Ireland and a shared island, we must honour the commitments that have been made through international agreements, especially the Good Friday Agreement and all its successor agreements, and we need to have them implemented.</p><p> Mr. Francie Molloy touched on the issue of the civic forum.  As we know, the civic forum is provided for in the Good Friday Agreement under the stewardship of former First Minister, David Trimble, and the former deputy First Minister, the late Seamus Mallon.  It was established in 2000.  My recollection is that it has not met since 2002.  It is, again, provided for in the Stormont House Agreement under the establishment of a civic advisory panel.  There should be more attention paid to putting in place that civic forum because it was to deal with economic, social and cultural issues.</p><p> Mr. Lunn used the phrase "to provide a forum for non-political discussion", but that was in the context of a citizens' assembly.  I do not hear much attention being paid to the need to set up the civic forum that has been provided for since 1998.  My understanding is this is a matter for the assembly and the Executive.  Perhaps Reverend Karen would offer her view on that, or in subsequent discussion with Mr. Lunn perhaps she would mention to him that I believe much more attention should be paid to putting in place the civic forum that is provided for and which would, as mentioned by him, provide that non-political forum for discussing issues that concern the people every day.  As Mickey Brady and others said, what concerns people is welfare, health, jobs, education and so on.  We need those issues being discussed by the non-elected people as well.  In the interests of time, I will conclude on that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.655" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051100002#M00500"><p>I would like to comment on a point made by Reverend Karen in regard to the 50% plus one.  It is important to say that 50% plus one is the democratic standard.  It is the democratic mandate.  To deviate from that risks my vote or someone else's vote being bigger than the other.  That is a very important principle of democracy.  The concerns that are being articulated around it reflect more of an unwillingness to force an annexation or to replicate an unwilling counter majoritarian scenario.  It is not about changing the numbers, rather it is about the broader conversation we are having, which is about great dialogue and being invested in and talking to each other and creating the circumstance which, whatever the constitutional outcome, is one that has been agreed together and moved forward together.  That is where I see that focus on the 50% plus one conversation going.  It is interesting to see how the conversation on that point alone, which is trying to express a generosity about the circumstances in which we have the conversation, risks becoming polarised very quickly.  I am not suggesting Reverend Karen is doing that, but I am observing this series of conversations.</p> <p>  On the citizens' assembly, it is a fantastic and necessary prerequisite for any major constitutional change.  One of the issues discussed by this committee was the engagement between the universities, which appeared to be engagement between the universities around the Border rather than in Belfast and Cork.  It would be really interesting to have a citizens' assembly on a county basis, thus forcing counties throughout the country to engage with each other and at an early stage.  My comments are observations on the dialogue thus far rather than specific questions.  I again thank the witnesses for joining us today and for participating with us.</p></speech>

It was great to hear Reverend Karen say there is still a good proportion of people involved in unionism in Ireland who are open to dialogue.  That brings me to back to the point made in recent weeks that there are three minorities as such in Northern Ireland, the nationalist minority, the unionist minority and the soft unionist minority in the middle made up of both sides of the community that could go either way.</p> <p>  On the citizens' assembly, it has worked well here in the Republic.  I think it is the way to go.  On another occasion we might, perhaps, have a conversation about the best way to engage that third minority I spoke of, which is the soft unionist minority who would be willing to engage and open up that dialogue, and how best we can include those voices in that debate.</p></speech>

It is important we heard from them.  I am delighted they are here.  I hope the wee man continues to make a full and speedy recovery.  I have one question to which I would like a one-word answer, if possible.  What one thing would encourage unionists to get involved in a discussion about our future?  Would it be the NHS or is there another issue the witnesses believe would tempt them to get involved?</p></speech>

It has been an absolute honour.  I have loved meeting everyone, some of whom I follow on Twitter and others of whom I have had some interaction with previously.  A lot has been covered in the past few minutes, but I will try to keep my response brief.</p> <p>  Ms Begley asked if unionists would engage.  I believe they would.  Mr. Lunn mentioned that 40% of people do not vote.  There will always be a pool of people who will pull up the drawbridge and not engage, but I still believe the majority would be open to conversations.  On the question as to whether this would contribute to reconciliation; it would.  Anything that seeks to bring together what is divided is reconciliation.  This would be a phenomenal beacon to the world in terms of a willingness to go further down the road on this.</p> <p>  On the civic forum, Deputy Smith is correct that it last convened in 2002.  I think the 2014 Stormont House Agreement also provided for the establishment of a civic forum, but that has not happened.  If any of the representatives from the North are listening in, that might be something worthy of consideration.  To be honest, there is nothing wrong with setting up a civic forum, but it needs to go beyond the North.  We are at the stage now where we need to do North and South if we are to build on the work that has been done already and is being done in terms of the shared island dialogue.</p> <p>  Ms Gildernew asked what would help unionists.  We need to maximise the welcome and listening.  As I said earlier, we are going to go ahead with this and they would be an addition to that work.  This is already our home and they should work with us to make it better.  That constant welcome is important.  As someone in ministry life once said to me, "You've got to keep reaching out your hand even if it's cut off."  It is important we do that.  The welcome and listening is important.  For me, 95% of ministry life is listening to people, not trying to solve their problems or fix them.  When people feel listened to, they will contribute.  I again thank the committee for this opportunity.</p></speech>

We are also happy to discuss any aspect of local government with the witnesses and we can keep the range of topics as broad as we like.  All of us come from a local authority background so we are fully aware of the pressures on councillors and the good work done by them the length and breadth of every county in the country.  It has been my pleasure to work with councillors for many years on various topics and subjects.  Over the years, I have always found our local authority members, district councillors and town councillors to be highly committed to the job and I appreciate the support of organisations such as those of the witnesses.</p> <p>  From the AILG I welcome Councillor Mary Hoade, president, Councillor John Joe Fennelly, vice president, and Councillor Anne Colgan, delegate.  From LAMA we are joined by Councillor Michael Anglim, chair, Councillor John Sheahan, general secretary and Councillor Joe Malone, Oireachtas liaison officer.  Members have been circulated with the opening statements from both organisations.</p> <p>  I will invite Councillor Hoade to make an opening statement for the AILG followed by Councillor John Sheahan to make a statement on behalf of LAMA, after which I will invite members to address questions.  We will try to keep to five-minute slots for questions and responses, which will allow us time for a second round of questions.</p> <p>  Members attending remotely within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, which is Leinster House or the Convention Centre.  For witnesses attending remotely there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.</p></speech>

The association is taking a strong position in defence of the role of councillors in disposing of land owned by the local authority and we are also taking a strong position on the primacy of the local authority as the housing and planning authority.</p> <p>  The AILG has supported measures over the past number of years to assist in the delivery of much needed housing as we continue to tackle our housing and homelessness crisis.  We recognise that the Land Development Agency, LDA, has an important role to play in assisting local authorities in the performance and delivery of their housing function.  We note the primary objectives of the LDA are to drive strategic land assembly and fully utilise State and public lands to build social and affordable homes and sustainable and regenerated communities.  These are key objectives of our elected members as they try to deliver appropriate housing for their communities and their constituents, and build sustainable communities for generations to come with place making at their heart.</p> <p>  We welcome the additionality the LDA will bring, particularly in affordable housing.  We acknowledge the Bill provides for the LDA to provide services to local authorities to assist them in the development of sites for housing and urban development and in the performance of their housing functions.  However, it must be acknowledged that for more than a century local authorities have successfully been the providers of social housing for the Irish population.  Our local authorities have a strong record of achievement in the housing area and the AILG is adamant that we must continue to ensure the primacy of local authorities in continuing to be the lead provider of social and affordable housing, and that they are central to any public housing delivery programme.  The programme for Government is categorical in its stated commitment to "ensure that local authorities are central to delivering housing" and there cannot be any deviation from this.</p> <p>  The AILG and our members are concerned that the Bill in its proposed form will lead to the curbing of some of the reserved functions of councillors, particularly under section 56 of the Bill, which proposes to remove the section 183 reserved function of our members on the disposal of local authority owned land.  The association is concerned that this will result in the transfer of local authority land to a centralised agency, unaccountable to the local public representatives.  As a national representative body, we can never support or accept any removal of reserved functions and powers from our elected members and we ask that this section of the Bill be removed.  Our proposed amendments include amendments to section 49 and section 56 of the Bill to protect the reserved function of our members.</p> <p>  The AILG is also concerned that the Bill does not go far enough in protecting the primacy of our member authorities' county and city development plans.  County development plans have a high level of legitimacy though public engagement and the councillors' role in their development and approval.  They are critical and central to orderly development and their role must be protected.  It is essential that LDA developments must co-ordinate with the local authorities' own future plans, as political responsibility for any development will remain with the elected members of a local authority, even where their statutory roles have been bypassed by the powers conferred on the LDA.  We propose an amendment to section 50(3) and an additional section to ensure the LDA will take account of the development plan policies of the local authorities.  We also propose an amendment to section 75 of the Bill to ensure it is the local authority that is responsible for setting the appropriate percentage of land to be set aside for affordable housing, in line with the local development plans, housing strategies, core strategies and population projections.</p> <p>  The LDA will be given compulsory purchase powers, and provision needs to be made to exclude local authorities from the LDA's CPO powers by way of an amendment to section 59 of the Bill.  Provision should also be made that if the LDA is disposing of lands originally acquired from a local authority, the local authority should have the option of acquiring back those public lands.  We suggest an amendment to section 55 of the Bill for this.</p> <p>  We have detailed a number of other proposed amendments in our accompanying submission to the committee.  In all, the AILG proposes 14 amendments to the LDA Bill.  These proposed amendments focus on our key concerns, including protecting the reserved functions of the councillor in the disposal of council land, retaining the primacy of the county development plan, asserting the role of the local authority in deciding the amount of affordable housing needed on any LDA site in its jurisdiction, expanding the range of towns to benefit from LDA technical assistance, and amendments to strengthen transparency and ensure continued public ownership of the LDA.  We believe these amendments will strengthen the Bill.</p> <p>  We thank the Chair and the committee members for listening to our submission and will be glad to take any question the members may have.</p></speech>

I am joined today by our chairperson, Councillor Miche&aacute;l Anglim, and our Oireachtas liaison officer, Councillor Joe Malone.</p> <p> The Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, is an apolitical representative body with a membership of over 800 locally elected members of the 31 local authorities of local Government in Ireland.  LAMA has deep concerns with certain aspects of the new Land Development Agency DAC proposed in this Bill.  We see significant merit in having an agency set up to compile and manage an inventory of publicly owned lands within the State but we are not convinced the proposed powers to be vested in the agency are in the best interest of local government in Ireland.</p> <p>  The formation of a designated activity company to deal with the current housing crisis as a matter of urgency, as stated in the Bill, is the wrong footing to start with.  Rushed legislation is bad legislation and is a quick fix solution to what is now a prolonged housing crisis.  Whether we like it or not, there are no quick fixes or magic wand policies out there to solve this overnight.</p> <p>  The stated mission of Government for housing for all, is one every body agrees with, whatever one's ideology or principles.  How we get there is where politicians, people and there ideologies differ.  We, as an apolitical representative body, will not dwell on any preferred political ideology as how to achieve the stated mission statement, because no matter how one presents it, the housing crisis is supply versus demand.</p> <p> We agree the most critical asset this State has is a publicly owned land bank made up of land in city centres, dockland areas and rail depots.  Colbert Station in Limerick City which is being developed in conjunction with the LDA is a case in point.  There is merit to the LDA DAC collating all the information and legal data on the State&rsquo;s land bank and, in doing so, producing a master plan for Ireland Inc. to work from and to extrapolate what best to do with these assets.</p> <p>  LAMA has concerns some of the powers to be given to the LDA DAC go too far in creating an entity that could remove the decision making from the people, that is, the elected councillor.  This would fly in the face of the principle of subsidiarity whereby decision making should be made nearest to the citizens, that is, the local authority and councillors.</p> <p>  Councillors have been aggrieved with the introduction of other vehicle mechanisms to provide housing, such as approved housing bodies and short-term and long-term leasing.  Each of these has, in some way, removed the direct involvement of councils and councillors.</p> <p> The diminution of decision making by locally elected members needs to halt.  For one, we as a representative body cannot understand how more responsibility is not devolved to the executives of our councils to produce a medium-term to long-term plan on housing provision, cost that need and receive the requisite funding.  The executive needs to be accountable for the delivery.   Instead, the system is centralised at national level .  </p> <p>  At present, we need Department approval to refurbish a social unit, never mind build a scheme.  The provision of housing needs to be devolved again, with a DAC such as the LDA there to assist local authorities, provide expertise and step in, if needed, when that process is failing in a local authority.</p> <p>  Local authority members vehemently opposed any  diminution of our powers under section 56 of the proposed Bill.  We will not accept any changes to section 211(2) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 or section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001.</p> <p>   We contend any master plan by the LDA DAC would have to get oversight and approval by the local authority members before being aligned or inserted in any city and county development plan.  Power of decision making should remain in the council chambers. </p> <p>  Only in exceptional circumstances, under ministerial direction, should land be acquired from a local authority without the consent of the chamber.  LAMA proposes that lands acquired by the LDA DAC, for which they have no further use, be vested by ministerial order in the local authority relevant to where the lands are situated.  LAMA would like to see the LDA DAC assist the local authorities in the regeneration of derelict sites.  While some of our authorities are progressive in this, others may need assistance.</p> <p>  We urge our national legislators, especially our Senators who may be attending this meeting, to protect the mandate of the local authorities members in setting up this DAC.  To do otherwise would be an affront to local democracy in Ireland.</p></speech>

As a former local authority member, I do not want to boast about it, I believe that fighting a local election is often much harder than any other election because one is contesting before people on one's street and in one's village.</p> <p>  Before we get on to the business of the LDA, the role of local authorities during the pandemic has to be acknowledged, not just the executive functions but all the elected representatives over the course of what has been an incredibly difficult year for our country.  I commend LAMA and its members and acknowledge their work.  I am also delighted the joint Oireachtas committee has the opportunity to have both the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, attend, participate in, and contribute to, our pre-legislative scrutiny.  We have also invited the County and City Management Association, CCMA, to attend and it will meet us at another meeting.</p> <p>  Coming from a local authority background myself, I understand the frustrations the councillors eloquently expressed on behalf of their members in terms of the way elected representatives' powers have been diminished but also, how their role as a frontrunner in terms of the provision of social and affordable housing falls far short of what it needs to be.</p> <p>  We see a huge opportunity with both the Land Development Agency Bill and, most important, the affordable housing Bill to empower local authorities and AILG and LAMA members to meet the housing need in their communities.</p> <p>  The biggest social housing programme in a decade is under way across the local authorities throughout the country.  When we had the CCMA attend the joint Oireachtas committee to discuss the affordable housing Bill, I asked it about what targets it had set for the delivery of affordable housing, because local authorities will have the power to deliver affordable housing to purchase and to rent.  The CCMA advised the committee it had not yet set a target for the delivery of affordable housing.  That rings alarm bells for us.</p> <p>  As part of our work on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the affordable housing Bill, I proposed that every local authority, within six months of the legislation being passed, would be required to publish three, five and ten year targets for the delivery of affordable housing in their local authority area.  The thinking behind that is each local authority would be identifying the affordable housing need is over three, five or ten years, but also, would be clearly signalling its target to the Department and that it will require funding for that.  I also suggested the Department would have to approve applications from local authorities within six months.</p> <p>  I would appreciate feedback from both AILG and LAMA on whether they think those two interventions would help local authorities to scale up and start to deliver affordable homes to purchase and rent on their lands.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the importance to our local authorities of targets for both social and affordable housing.  They would be very valuable.  It is really good that the Government has now given an indication that funding will be made available to local authorities for affordable housing as that has not been the case until now.  What will make the difference is when we get clarity on the conditions of the scheme and the funding that will be available for it.  In my view - and I am sure my colleagues would agree with this - putting together the targets will be very much possible within the kind of timeframe being spoken about because we have undertaken our housing need demand assessment as part of our county development plans and we have the granular detail on housing need.  It will all come down to the level of funding available and the provisions we get to support delivery.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.682" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Sheahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021051100002#C01300"><p>Yes, if I may.  I am coming at this from the point of view that one can set targets, aspirations and objectives, or whatever word one wants to use, all one likes; it is the delivery of action that is the key indicator on which success or otherwise on affordable housing will be judged.  The term "affordable housing" alone is somewhat strange when one sees some of the prices at which affordable houses are coming in, so I would not get too hung up on the terms.  There is a cohort of people earning salaries from perhaps &euro;35,000 up to even as far as about &euro;70,000 who are totally disenfranchised in our market.  As we have said in our presentation, we will not dwell on Members' ideology as to whether they want all publicly owned lands to have public housing or whether they want the market to produce them through a developer or similar.  There is, however, something broken within our market at the moment and it is a matter of supply versus demand.  If the supply gets ramped up, the affordability, which is not there at the moment, will come back into the system.  I agree with Senator Fitzpatrick about the six-month timeline.  You need responses and you need to put in those indicators such that if a proposal is made, a time is set on it and it will be delivered within that time.  As we have said in our statement, if delivery does not happen, somebody somewhere is accountable for that.  At present, however, with the centralised system, we find as local authority members that we go to our housing strategic policy committees, SPCs, and our main plenary meetings and hear "we will come back to you on that" or "we need to clarify this, that or the other with the Department", which leaves us in total no man's land.  The impetus should be given back to the local authorities and we should not get hung up too much on what term is used for this.  Delivery of numbers is the key.</p></speech>

Perhaps I should mention the cost-rental aspect introduced in the Affordable Housing Bill.  The LDA, when its representatives were here in session with us, indicated that the delivery of cost-rental would be very high on its agenda.  This is another form of housing delivery that provides long-term, affordable, secure rental, especially for that income cohort Mr. Sheahan mentioned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.684" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021051100002#C01500"><p>I thank Councillors Sheahan and Hoade for their presentations and written submissions.  It is very significant that both LAMA and the AILG have come out with some very strong and reasonable concerns about the legislation.  I share many of those concerns and I will happily table all 14 of the amendments.  I urge other Senators and Deputies to do likewise.  If we had a cross-party approach to this, it would make it all the stronger.  Sinn F&eacute;in's strong view is that the LDA should be involved in land assembly and that local authorities should be involved in residential development.  If those two things were done in parallel, I think we could start delivering the kinds of numbers of units Mr. Sheahan rightly outlines.  My concern is the arguments the Government is using for the provisions of the Bill that they are concerned about.  I would therefore like to give the witnesses the opportunity to respond in a little more detail to some of the Government's rationale.  My questions are very straightforward.  The Government is claiming that it has to set up the LDA this way because local authorities do not have the capacity or the ability to deliver the number of social and affordable homes needed.  I would be interested to hear both organisations' responses to that.  The Government is also claiming that the removal of the section 183 land disposal powers is required to speed up residential delivery, something I do not agree with.  Again, I would like to hear the witnesses' responses to that.  The Bill's definition of affordability is any discount on median price, rent or purchase, which means that in some constituencies in Dublin one could be looking at prices of around &euro;400,000.  Do the witnesses have a view on that aspect of the Bill?  Then, crucially, there is the power to give the LDA development authority status so it could do strategic development zones.  I am thinking in particular about Limerick and the Colbert site.  The local authority could be fully excluded from an SDZ process, whereby the LDA would do the draft and the board would approve it and elected members would be relegated simply to third party observers.  Do the witnesses have concerns about any of that?</p></speech>

The question is how to produce the number of houses required.  We have a broken system at the moment, we think.  That is evidenced when you see developers opting for the ready cash of private investment portfolios rather than being able to go to the market, to the local bank, and to finance their own developments.  We are concerned that the LDA might become the other side of that coin in that it would be attracted to the developers just to produce public housing and maybe sit on a parcel of land just waiting until the Government comes rolling in with the cash to provide the housing.</p> <p>  As for section 183, perhaps some of the other Members of the Oireachtas might be able to assist on this, but LAMA has raised that issue directly with the Minister.  I think he is considering that the diminution of that would be a last resort, whereby a local authority would not be able to make a case for the lands it has or have a project that would suit the lands lying idle.</p><p>If that was the situation, we would probably be open to some sort of litigation.</p><p> We would like the LDA DAC to be modelled on land publicly owned by the State outside of the local authorities.  This is because we are on a crash course straight away with the elected members at local authority level, whereas if we tried it from bureaucrat to bureaucrat we might see what way we are modelling it and how it works.  That would be a good pilot to start with.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned the Colbert Station development in Limerick.  We have engaged with the LDA through our own DAC, Limerick 2030.  I sit on the board of the latter.  It has been an eye-opener to me especially with regulation and procurement and so on.  The amount of expertise that we need to get projects rolling is phenomenal.  The LDA could be the answer for Ireland Inc. in that regard.</p><p> We have been working well with the LDA to date.  I am not in favour of a situation where we can say a strategic development zone could freeze us out of the loop.  That would be a detrimental step.  There is some tweaking to be done, but we can ratchet it up outside the local authorities.  I am not saying the local authority should abdicate responsibility.  We will still keep our targets going and so on.  However, we should model the new DAC with publicly owned lands other than local authority lands.</p></speech>

At the moment, a total of 30,000 units are in the pipeline in over 2,000 schemes.  These are waiting to be delivered or at various stages of delivery.<br/><br/>I wish to focus specifically on the question of affordability and the provisions in the Bill relating to it that the Deputy asked about.  Affordability is at the core of the Bill.  Since affordability is defined in terms of a drop in market price, there is no policy clarity about what it actually means.  There is no reason to suppose that a drop in market price would deliver any level of affordability, especially in urban areas.  Our view is that this needs to be replaced with something far more robust in terms of the affordability criteria.<br/><br/>Cost rental should be related to the cost of development and delivery.  In fact, that is mentioned in the Affordable Housing Bill.  We would like to see some alignment between those two tranches of legislation so that cost rental would be related to cost of production in all its elements.<br/><br/>The affordability of housing for sale needs to be worked out in terms of anything other than market price.  The LDA does not have to deal in market price.  Land is provided for it.  Its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>is about capacity to borrow at reasonable prices.  It has the possibility of efficient and effective large-scale developments.  All of those things mean it will be able to deliver housing at significantly less than market prices.  If it cannot do that, then it cannot justify its existence.  There is no reason that affordable housing for sale should be linked to market prices.  We believe that provision in the Bill needs to be reconsidered.</p></speech>

I appreciate that it was reasonably short notice.  I very much appreciate that they have come in and I read the submission with great interest.  There are some things I wish to give the witnesses the opportunity to elaborate on.  I heard Councillor Sheahan say that local authorities have worked well with the LDA.  Certainly, the LDA would speak highly of its interactions with the local authorities thus far.  I would like some examples or elaboration on that.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the requirement that the LDA have full regard of development plans.  That is an essential requirement in the same way that there is an imperative upon An Bord Plean&aacute;la to do likewise.  However, we see instances with An Bord Plean&aacute;la where that does not work out in the way the legislation provided for it.  I would like the local authority representatives to elaborate on that and on how they will ensure that is written in.</p> <p>  We have introduced and read in detail the circular on the housing needs demand assessment and how it will feed in to the development plan, housing strategies, core strategies and population projections.  One good consequence of this is that the development plan is highly informed.  It is important that the LDA takes cognisance of that.  I would like the local authority representatives to elaborate on that.  Councillor Hoade suggested in her submission that the local authority should be responsible for setting the appropriate percentage of land for affordable housing.  How does she see that working?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.695" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Hoade" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021051100002#D00500"><p>We will take this in two parts.  I will take the part of the question about the LDA engaging with local authorities.  This is our primary concern.  The LDA is not engaging with elected members.  The only engagement is with executives.  We have a major concern with the whole area around section 183 and the removal of the power of councillors.  The LDA is not engaging at any level with the locally elected members.  All the engagement is with our executives.  We are asking that this will be a partnership and that the agency would work in collaboration with the elected members of local authorities.  Ms Colgan will take the second part of the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.696" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Colgan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021051100002#D00600"><p>The matter I would like to take up relates to the percentage of homes and prices.  The proposed amendment dealing with section 75 of the Bill provides that the Minister may set a percentage of housing higher or lower than the percentage set out in section 73.  The difficulty with this is that it assumes a Minister can make a determination in any part of the country as to what the requirements are in that particular county in terms of social and affordable housing.  To us, that seems extraordinary when the local authority, through its housing needs demand assessment, has the detailed and granular knowledge of the requirements and needs of housing in that area.  It does not make sense to us that it would be possible at central level to make a determination for the county.  As the legislation is framed at the moment, the Minister would make that determination on a site-by-site basis.  That is rather strange and difficult to comprehend.</p> <p>  There is another reference in that section of the Bill.  It states that the Minister, in making a determination about that percentage, will have regard to what the State requires in terms of percentages of social and affordable housing.</p><p>The message this sends us is that this provision is being included in order to manage budgets.  Since the State will have to take account of its overall expenditure on social and affordable housing, the Minister will be influenced by that consideration in making a decision about what is required on any site.  That will bring uncertainty to the process and undermine it.  We want this section of the Bill to be amended so that setting the percentage on LDA sites of social and affordable housing or, if there is such provision on any one site, market price housing will be left to local authorities.</p></speech>

If we do not, the LDA will run roughshod over all planning frameworks, be it the national planning framework, the national development plan, regional spatial and economic strategy, RSES, plans, master plans and even retail strategies.  At local level, we have to take regard - actually, we need to take statutory notice now - of all these documents.  If we do not stitch what we are discussing into city and county development plans, we will create a body that can run roughshod over all those policies and have <i>carte blanche</i>to do what it wishes.<br/><br/>Ministerial direction was the way to go in the past.  The Planning Regulator was set up to take some of that burden off the Minister.  However, Ministers should be responsible for policy.  If the LDA is set up in the way proposed, it will be given <i>carte blanche</i>to do what it wishes in some local authority areas.  That is why we want to stitch in this point.</p></speech>

The AILG and LAMA provide good training days and briefings for councillors.  Has the LDA attended any of those?  Is it proposed to have more?  The LDA would be willing to engage.  Engagement between the LDA and elected members would be an important part of this process.  Have there been more of those days?</p></speech>

I was a member of South Dublin County Council and I know first hand the local knowledge that councillors bring to the table during the decision-making process.  I agree with Ms Hoade and Mr. Sheahan on the importance of ensuring that local authorities are central in delivering housing.  The programme for Government commits to doing that.</p> <p>  Regarding the percentage of affordable housing, the Green Party supports local authorities in setting out a minimum percentage of owner occupiers in any development.  I told the D&aacute;il that the party believes that section 183 is problematic in terms of councillors' reserved functions, that the State should not be complicit in profit model housing, in which respect there has been some talk concerning the LDA, and that the LDA should be building public housing on public land.</p> <p>  My question is on the new housing schemes - cost-rental and affordable purchase - that will be procured by the LDA in conjunction with local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs.  Both schemes are welcome.  They have not been in the public housing mix during the past decade, which was problematic for my council.  When we tried to consider different affordable models, all we could work with was social housing or private sales.  The cost-rental and affordable purchase schemes will come on stream through a Bill that is linked to the LDA Bill.  In addition to social units, they will assist in mitigating the housing crisis and offer alternative housing models for our communities.  Do the witnesses feel that these schemes can make a difference if rolled out appropriately and in quantity?</p></speech>

It has been a difficulty, particularly as house prices became unaffordable, that the only option has been social housing or market price housing.  To bridge that gap with cost-rental and affordable housing models is an extremely important development, particularly for urban areas, and we welcome it.</p> <p>  The devil will be in the detail.  &ldquo;Affordable&rdquo; will have to mean genuinely affordable, as will &ldquo;cost-rental&rdquo;.  Provided that the schemes are designed, developed and rolled out in a manner that allows them to be genuinely taken up by those who need them, they will add invaluably to the range of possibilities open to councils and the LDA.</p> <p>  The criteria will be important.  As elected council members, we would welcome the opportunity for engagement with the Department on these schemes.  There has not been a track record of elected members getting to engage on housing policy issues directly with the Department.  It would be good, as we have something constructive to offer as a stakeholder at the table when policies are being prepared.</p></speech>

Trying to get on the property ladder is the issue.  Currently, we have the double whammy of high rents and people being asked to produce records of strong savings even though one negates the other.  We welcome any scheme that does what it says on the tin and looks after the cohort of people who are caught between qualifying for social housing and being able to buy on the open market.</p></speech>

To remind everyone, two items are on our agenda.  One is the LDA, but the second is other local government matters, and I want to address those separately.</p> <p>  I have heard from the LDA, LAMA and the AILG of concerns about the management of our land assets.  We need a property management structure if we are to produce housing.</p><p>The key issue, which was touched on by Ms Colgan on a number of occasions, is the aspect of affordability.  What is affordability?  We must define and fully understand it.  My interpretation of affordability is that it pertains to no more than 30% of one's disposable income so we must build that in.  The reality is that many people are locked out of housing.  That is a real issue.  On a personal point, and I have said this many times before, I do not have any ideology or hang-ups on who is building houses.  I want houses built - private, public, social or AHB houses - anywhere we can for people who need homes.  There is so much lost in the endless debate about the ideology around who is building homes.  Clearly they must be affordable homes.  We see that &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance and various AHBs are building now.  It is a difference scenario now so it is not comparing like with like but the reality of it is that people perform.<br/><br/>In relation to the AILG, I thank the witnesses for what was a very impressive submission and the setting out of the 14 amendments, which I have no difficulty supporting.  Today, I commit that I will pursue every single one of them if this matter comes before Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  There have been suggestions about section 183 and I acknowledge what the witnesses had to say about it.  What I hear from people in Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, others parties and those not in a party is that they believe there is a redline around section 183 and that they are not prepared to go there.  They do not want to see a compromise and I agree with them on that.  Based on the engagement I have had from councillors from all groups, I am running on that basis until I hear something better.  I thank the witnesses for their engagement.  I would like to think there will be more engagement with both organisations and our committee.<br/><br/>I want to single out Councillor Gerry Warnock.  He recently had press coverage and a statement published in the <i>Longford Leader</i>.  He also spoke about how the LDA was seen to be usurping the powers and reserve functions of elected members.  I share and agree with that sentiment.  I want to hear more about the definition of affordability, which has been touched on by both groups.  I want to hear from LAMA in relation to a line from its statement that &quot;Only in exceptional circumstances under Ministerial direction should land be acquired from a local authority without the consent of the chamber.&quot;  Can Mr. Sheahan tease out what is meant by this?<br/><br/>In wrapping up, I cannot let the opportunity to acknowledge the enormous work of the elected members go, in particular those in the community call and the response around Covid.  However, more importantly, it is very disappointing that we cannot share with councillors any absolute certainties in relation to recommendations on remuneration and allowances, which support them in doing their work.  I continuously receive correspondence, letters and calls from councillors, with or without a party affiliation, who find themselves dipping into their domestic household income to subsidise their important community work.  Quite rightly, that is unacceptable.  Witnesses from both organisations might share with the committee what their latest understanding is of the Moorhead recommendations.  Are there elements which have been shared with them?  Have they received any indication from Government on where we stand in relation to what are really important issues about the work they do?  I would particularly like to hear from witnesses on those issues.</p></speech>

The members have been very clear.  In engagement with our 949 members around the country, the one issue they have is in relation to section 183.  It is very clear to us.  I am sure all of the members as elected representatives have received representations from individual councillors regarding their concerns around section 183 and councillors' powers.  We want to work with the LDA.  Local authorities want to step up to the mark and we can look at what has happened in the past.  We as elected members want to stand up to the mark and bring ourselves up to that stall.  We want to be involved here.  All we ask is that there would be a partnership with the elected members in local authorities and that would lead to a greater collaboration with the LDA.  That is all we are asking for.</p> <p>  I acknowledge what Senator Boyhan said in relation to Moorhead.  I do not know if we are going to discuss that.  I have a number of things I want to say on that issue.  I do not know if we are discussing that as a separate item or does the Chairman want me to come in on this now?</p></speech>

It is something which the committee has discussed.  Much of the pressure is on local government in terms of funding and staff resources and councillors' pay and conditions.  We have discussed many areas so I am happy for Ms Hoade to address any of those issues.</p></speech>

As the president of the AILG, I know we are acutely aware of the situation regarding Moorhead.  Our up-to-date version on it at this stage is that we are awaiting Cabinet approval.  My understanding is that there is a commitment that it will be delivered within the first anniversary of the programme for Government, which is at the end of June.  We are awaiting Cabinet approval in relation to it.</p> <p>  I want to make reference to comments made by Senator Fitzpatrick at the outset, and I thank her for them, about local authority members.  Throughout this pandemic, for the last 18 months councillors were very much to the forefront in their local communities.  They responded to the community call.  We were front-line workers, to a certain extent, in our local communities.  That is what we are meant to do.  We have a democratically elected mandate by the people and that is what we are expected to do.  At this point in time, we hope approval will be given by Cabinet.</p> <p>  Our organisation, I am sure councillor Sheahan will speak for himself and LAMA, has been involved in a non-pay working focus group set up by the Department.  We have put much work into preparing an action plan, which we are about to finalise at this stage, in relation to non-pay support elements.  That is vital for councillors when carrying out their duties going forward.  As part of the non-pay supports, we discussed the issues of maternity, paternity and adoption leave.  That is very much to the forefront at the moment.  We are currently working on finalising proposals which will be put forward in relation to the provision of maternity leave for our members.  We hope to submit that to the Minister in the coming weeks.  It is important that we recognise and look at the role of local government, the issue of getting more female members involved in local government and the retention of our members because there is a drain on that.  We find, in many cases, members who contested an election do one term and do not go forward again.  We must look at that as well.</p> <p>  We are working very closely with the Minister and the Department.  To answer Senator Boyhan's question, I hope we will see a conclusion to this by the first anniversary of the programme for Government.</p></speech>

I want to be associated with the very positive comments that other members of the committee have made about the role of councillors.  There is great appreciation from all of us who have worked as councillors in local authorities for the work all of the organisations' members are doing, in particular in recent times.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  There was a reference made to the 30,000 - I think that figure is correct - social homes which are in the pipeline.  They are in various approval processes by local authorities.  In terms of speeding up delivery, what do the witnesses think needs to be done regarding the approval process or the engagement with the Department to speed up the delivery of social homes by local authorities?  What sort of challenges do local authorities face in that regard?</p> <p>  Local authorities play an important role in building up public land banks for social and affordable housing.  They do that on a long-term basis.  Do the witnesses have any concerns with this Bill and the role of the LDA in acquiring land by local authorities?  In the long run, that could act as a disincentive to local authorities in building up their public banks.  What are the witnesses' views on that?</p></speech>

I would like to see modelling done on the other land banks and if that is successful, it should not be a deterrent for local authorities to purchase land banks.  If it is not successful, the Deputy's fear might come to pass. <br/><br/>We have discussed the Moorhead report <i>ad nauseam</i>.  I am not going to say any more about the pay and conditions.  The Government will either deliver on that or it will not.  It will be one or the other.  Ms Hoade touched on paternity leave.  My mobile phone is my office.  I do not know how I can go on paternity leave and dump that in the bin for six months.  I cannot do that.  How we are going to achieve that for councillors requires a lot of discussion. </p></speech>

What has slowed this down for a very long time is the very elaborate process.  It was an eight-stage process and is now four stages but even that is taking far too long.  The procurement process is particularly challenging.  Then there is the cap on the amount of funding available to local authorities.  A study was done not that long ago on how that process could be sped up but I do not think that was ever put on the table for implementation.  There are other straightforward issues, like design, for example.  It should be possible to come up with a number of <i>pro forma </i>designs for particular types of units, which could easily be applied across the board, a bit like the Department of Education does with schools.  It might tailor the design to a particular population of children but it does not move too much beyond that set of designs.  Our housing authorities would have to acknowledge that there is a high level of frustration involved in the process at the moment and it is not beyond the bounds of the powers that be to streamline that process and make it much more effective.  Local authorities are hamstrung at the moment and sometimes, unfortunately, we have to carry the blame for the slowness of the process because we are at the pointy end of delivery.</p></speech>

There are issues around that cap as local authorities do not want to take it on.  The Department says they have to take on the full risk and there is no contingency for any spending overruns so a lot of the local authorities are reluctant to utilise it.  That aspect needs to be sorted out.</p></speech>

I wish to associate myself with those paying tribute to the huge amount of work councillors do for their local communities on a continuous basis.  They do not get half the pay or recognition they deserve.</p> <p>  I am interested in Councillor Colgan's experiences of dealing with the LDA's delivery through both her own local electoral area, LEA, in Dundrum and the Shanganagh cost rental scheme.  Was the LDA open to dealing with her as a local authority member?  What issues arose in the course of the planning for those sites?  Was the LDA consultative?  How did it deal with residents?  I am concerned about how the LDA is currently constituted.  It is there for the delivery of houses.  Some of our largest regeneration projects are within my own area and half of that involves building communities or trying to knit them back together again.  We have found ourselves in a number of situations where, in order to build community facilities, community centres and anything that is long term, the local authority felt it had to sell off land to fund them because the funding was not available from the Department.  Did anything like that happen when it came to either the Shanganagh or Dundrum sites?  I understand that they are different situations but my concern is that if we remove section 183 of the Local Government Act, public land would be disposed of on those terms.  At least with section 183 in place, local authority members are able to intervene and negotiate other terms and conditions.</p> <p>  In Councillor Colgan's experience, and based on chatting to other members, how many local authorities are in legacy debt?  The Land Development Agency Bill provides that land will be paid for at market rate but an awful lot of local authorities took on developing and pulling together land banks at the time of the boom and consequently have legacy debt.  Have there been indications that the Department will address that when it comes to the Land Development Agency Bill?</p> <p>  The issue of affordability is interesting, as this committee will be discussing both the affordable housing Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill.  We need to make sure we are not just giving a discount at market rate.  In other countries where that has been done, a discount at market rate ended up being completely unaffordable for people and they were priced out.  We need to link affordability, whether for cost rental or affordable purchase, to people's income and wages.</p></speech>

Having personally had some involvement in Shanganagh, I can say categorically that it was a very positive engagement with the LDA.  That experience offers quite a useful and interesting model as to how the LDA and the council can work together on council land.  That land was left fallow for many years until a cross-party group of councillors put forward a proposal for social and cost rental housing on that site, together with some affordable housing for purchase.  Our proposal stayed with the Department for a considerable time but did not make any progress and eventually, the Land Development Agency came on the pitch and we engaged with it.  There was active engagement directly with the elected members both at party and individual level and there were regular briefings.  In effect, it was possible for councillors to set down and influence the proportions of the different types of tenure on that site, in agreement with the LDA.  It was only when both parties were satisfied that it was possible to deliver on that project that the question of a disposal of our land to the LDA arose.  That was done as part of section 183, with conditions attached to copper-fasten the tenure and so on.  We as elected members had several meetings with the LDA.  It was most forthcoming and open to the proposals from members and it was ultimately a highly constructive engagement.  It is a very worthwhile model for future engagements with the Land Development Agency going forward.  I have heard some criticism about the number of engagements there were but those were mostly with the architects developing the master plan with the LDA.  They were very positive engagement between our professionals and those of the LDA.</p> <p>  The situation at the Central Mental Hospital site is very different because it is not our land and belongs to another State agency.</p><p>The LDA is proceeding to prepare its master plan at the moment.  The LDA is engaging in a very significant level of public engagement around that and meeting elected members at their request but there is nothing in the Local Development Agency Bill that makes that a requirement.  It is down to goodwill and the building of relationships between the parties; getting to know each other and working together makes that possible.  There is nothing in the Bill that requires the LDA to produce a master plan in partnership or have any level of public engagement so there is scope for reviewing and revisiting the Bill in that regard.</p><p> The tricky thing for all of us is that the likely development will be handled under the strategic housing development legislation, very possibly, which, as we know, allows for the overriding of the county development plan in deference to building height and density regulations, and so on.   The point I would like to make at this point is that the future of the relationship between the LDA and the local authority needs to be one of complementarity and mutual support.  That may not be the ethos of the Bill but that may not be the fault of the LDA if the ethos of the Bill is one that says the LDA can take one's land whether one likes it or not or whatever.  The Land Development Agency is in a unique position compared with any other developer in that it is the State, effectively, because it is building large developments and neighbourhoods, and sustainable neighbourhoods are the meat and drink of a county development plan.  That is what we spend our time doing - to prepare neighbourhoods - so the LDA must work within that context.</p></speech>

I thank them for all of the work that went into their submissions and making sure that councillors are kept informed of everything that happens at a national level.  I was a member of the South Dublin County Council for a decade so I am well aware of the amount of commitment and hard work that councillors need to do their job to the full extent.  The pandemic has made the job of councillors even more difficult this past year and people have been under huge stresses and strains.  I just wanted to acknowledge all of that.</p> <p>  I thank everybody for their contributions today and we have had a fruitful discussion.  It is great to air the concerns and worries about the Bill as well as what is welcome.  The section 183 powers are an issue repeatedly mentioned.  I differ slightly from Senator Boyhan who said that no compromise can be accepted.  I would love to think that we can find a compromise and common ground that protects the democratic powers of local councillors while making sure that we give the LDA enough teeth to deliver homes, including affordable homes, and I think we are all united in that purpose.</p> <p>  From a reserved function perspective in terms of the disposal of lands, for sites in towns with a population of 30,000 or fewer where councillors know best the terrain, the population area, the needs of the population and the area, it is critical that councillors retain their powers, autonomy and ability to dispose of the land.  In towns like Ennis, Naas, Athlone, Wexford, Celbridge and Tralee we need to ensure that councillors have the deciding impact as to what should happen to land in their areas.  In bigger urban areas it is probably already acknowledged that housing is quite often going to be the best use of land but that is where I think the Land Development Agency has a role to play.  I would like to see that role being played in collaboration with elected members as well as with the chief executive and management.  It is up to councillors to determine how best to use land.  The way forward is to reach a compromise whereby smaller towns with a population of 30,000 or fewer have the ability to decide autonomously what happens to the land in their area.  Also, in collaboration with the LDA, there is the ability to work out how best to serve the higher population areas.  I would love to hear the views of the witnesses on these matters.</p> <p>  The witnesses have mentioned that a decision must be made regarding the percentages of the affordable housing scheme.  It is interesting to note that the Minister can only set percentages if it is lower than 50% rather than higher.  That makes sense to me and I would welcome hearing the perspectives of the witnesses on the matter.</p> <p>  Councillor Hoade spoke about transparency.  I welcome the fact that commercial activities will be subject to freedom of information, FOI, for anything to do with the LDA.  It is intended to get to that state eventually but I would like the LDA to be designated a public official, like we all are when it comes to the likes of the lobbying register.  I would welcome the views of the witnesses on the matter.</p> <p>  Finally, I thank the witnesses for the huge amount of work that has gone into this matter.  I hope that, as the LDA progresses, it can collaborate with the AILG and LAMA.  I hope that we will work together efficiently, well and supportively with councillors across the country.  That is what we all need to achieve.</p></speech>

We are an island nation that knows that the "no, no, no" policy does not work.  It has not recently worked in local authorities in Dublin where it was probably a catalyst for where we are today.  As a very last ditch effort, we should have something in the legislation.  If we do not set a budget at the local authority level tomorrow morning life will still go on and someone else will set it for us.  We must have something there stating what will happen if people do not get their act together.  I have no fear of that because pound for pound councillors up and down the country are the best people one will see to make local decisions, and I have total faith in our members to do that. </p></speech>

As I said in my opening statement, the one thing that angered most AILG members was the issue around section 183 and the removal of councillors' powers.  We would be very happy to sit down with this committee to discuss this matter.  I very much welcome the words in the statements made by committee members on partnership and collaboration because this is what we are looking for.  I do think that there is a role.  We would be happy to sit down with the committee to discuss this matter further but we definitely want to see that.</p> <p>  On the comments made about the LDA, I would be happy to see the agency in the same role as everybody else under the lobbying register.

I was a councillor for 12 years so I completely understand where the councillors are coming from.  For years, different Ministers have slandered local authorities for not providing housing.  They have blamed local authorities for the problems that we have now and the housing crisis.  I want to completely state here that that is not true.  From my own experience as a councillor on Cork County Council and having spoken to other councillors, the reason we have had a lack of housing is because local authorities were never supported with the funds they needed.</p><p>I come from Gurranabraher, where I live now.  It was a big social housing development 80 years ago.  Knocknaheeney is another one.  There are many areas in Cork where we know local authorities can deliver excellent social and affordable housing.  I believe the statements made today by the councillors in respect of giving the power and funding to councillors and local authorities so that they can deliver the social, affordable, private and affordable rental housing that is required.  I am 100% on board with what the councillors are saying.  I was frustrated when I was a councillor and we wanted to drive on projects and build houses but could not get the funding.  The councillors might comment on that.  Do they believe that if local authorities are given the funding they will be in a position to deliver social and affordable housing?  I believe the Land Development Agency has a part to play in getting land and putting it together, but the local authorities are the bodies to deliver social and affordable housing.</p><p> I have two other points not related to the Land Development Agency.  One relates to the sizable loans that several local authorities have and the amount of money they are paying back every year on interest.  These loans should be taken off all local authorities because they are a weight around their necks.</p><p> The other issue I have relates to local authorities paying local property tax on social houses.  That funding would be better spent in housing maintenance and the provision of other services for local authorities.  That is something we need to reverse.</p></speech>

That bodes well for the collaborative partnership that could be available down the road and it would probably enable local authorities to be even more proactive in the provision of housing.</p> <p>  We would have to agree with all the sentiments in terms of the barriers that have been in the way of local authorities previously in delivering housing.  It is also important to state that as part of the complementary nature of who does what, local authorities have an extensive track record in terms of providing housing for people with disabilities, older people and supported housing.  The market is not responding to that need and that need would never be responded to were it not for the local authorities.  Those population groups depend for housing in many cases on the local authority to deliver and that needs to be recognised.</p></speech>

If memory serves me right we had a model when the National Asset Management Agency was set up many years ago.  I remember our authority availed of derogation on debt for land that we gave back to NAMA at the time.  Something like that might need to be done again.</p> <p>  Deputy Gould referred to the local authority in Cork city.  Some local authorities got caught up in those heady days of the Celtic tiger.  When they went to Departments money was awash and they were asked about the depth of their ambition and aspiration when it came to buying houses.  They all fell into negative equity afterwards.  There is an issue but there is no way out of it really except for the State to pick up the tab.  I trust that addresses the points made by Deputy Gould.</p></speech>

We now have it at 15% above the baseline.  We did so by ring-fencing the local property tax element for local services, including the likes of housing maintenance and co-funding of other local projects to extrapolate as much money as we could from other funds.  We are doing that in the sense of ring-fencing that money from the local property tax.</p></speech>

As my party spokesperson on local government, I value the engagement.  I am not speaking on behalf of my colleagues but I believe there is an open invitation to the witnesses to participate in any of the tranches of legislation this committee is dealing with.  We are dealing with the electoral reform Bill, which deals with the register.  While we have concluded the public sessions on that the witnesses might examine it and decide whether they wish to make a written submission on that.  That would be most welcome.</p> <p>  Many of the points made around the Moorhead report are important.  My view is that the Moorhead recommendations are a minimum.  I have said this for many years.  If a councillor is lucky enough to serve for 20 or 30 years, he or she will have been paid less and have worse pension arrangements than the most junior person in the local authority.  That is unsustainable.  Councillors who commit all their time to the council should be rewarded in a way that is commensurate with other professional and administrative staff in the councils.  The Minister knows my views on that.</p> <p>  The Land Development Agency and the Affordable Housing Bill are two sides of the same coin.  I respect the rights of the councillors to protect reserve powers.  That is important throughout the country.  I do not believe it will be a major issue but that does not mean we should forgo the principle and I support the councillors on that point.  I will continue to engage with the Minister on the matter.  Many of my Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary colleagues have done so as well.</p> <p>  The real question is that we will not be fighting over a small number of projects.  There will be enough work for councils and the Land Development Agency to deliver housing.  Between the funding and the new housing Bill there will be a great deal of work ahead.  They are the questions I wanted to put to the councillors present.</p> <p>  The new Bill essentially defines a price of &euro;450,000 in Dublin as unaffordable.  It provides the new long-term rental scheme for those not eligible for social housing and provides below-cost housing for those who wish to purchase.  The term "public housing" is somewhat misunderstood and it includes owner-occupier housing.  Certainly, that is my assessment of it.</p> <p>  Do the councillors believe that the officials have the ambition to match the councillors?  My experience is that the blockage is not at the level of councillors but at the level of officials.  Part 8 housing applications come before councillors.  Does the number of Part 8 applications that come before each of the councils fall below five?  In my experience the number coming before us each year was below five.  That will not be good enough if we want to deliver affordable and social housing.  I hope we will have all the tools in the coming weeks.  The Minister says we will have the funding in June.  The question is whether the officials will have the ambition to deliver and put Part 8 applications before each of the councils.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy McAuliffe for his comments.  Certainly, we would be happy to engage with him in future.  It is a great opportunity to engage with the committee and we would be delighted to do so on any issue.</p><p>On electoral reform, our association has had an initial meeting with Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan.  We are also discussing this whole area and would love an opportunity to discuss directly elected mayors with the Deputy.  </p><p> Regarding the Bill, I totally hear what the Deputy is saying.  To go back to the lines a number of others used, it is about partnership, working collaboratively and working together on it.  Our track record has not been great in the past.  We all acknowledge that and the fact that there is an issue, but it is about all of us stepping up to the mark.  The Deputy is right in his questions on whether we are above or below five on Part 8.  I can tell him that, unfortunately, we are below five.  I will hand over to Councillor Colgan who will answer the other part of the question. </p></speech>

All are Part A projects so the ambition is there.  The barriers have been elsewhere, but local authority officials, housing departments and planners are very much up for the challenge of providing social housing of quality.  In our case, very high-quality units in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown have won international prizes for the quality of the homes that have been built and offered.  The willingness is definitely there.  We have to remove any unnecessary administrative impediments from the system that get in the way of delivery.</p></speech>

I will direct a question to Councillor Colgan.  I particularly welcome her because I worked closely with her in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  She is a very impressive individual on the issues around housing and planning, as can be seen today.  Can Councillor Colgan share her experience with the committee?  She touched earlier on the fact that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is unique in having had two major interactions with the LDA in recent times.  One was Shanganagh Castle, a very substantial block of land that was primarily suitable for housing and was zoned as such.  Councillor Colgan talked about constant engagement with the LDA, which I am delighted to hear about.  I know many of the 40 councillors there and they tell me that is their shared experience.  Councillor Colgan made a very important statement.  We can learn from that and I am very pleased to know that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown ultimately reached an agreement with the Land Development Agency there.</p> <p>  The key word here is conditionality.  One of the great things about the section 183 disposal for local authorities, a power vested exclusively and solely in elected members of the council, is that it gives power to bring in and attach conditions.  That determines outcomes.  Councillor Mary Howe, the president of the AILG, has been very strong on this particular issue.  Can Councillor Colgan share with us the type of engagement and tensions that arose in bringing conditions to disposal?  Ultimately, those conditions were accepted by both parties.  This is possibly the way out of all this, that there can be an agreement.  That is one issue.  </p> <p>  I would also like to hear more about the engagement elected members had with the LDA where State land rather than local authority property was involved, particularly in the Dundrum local electoral area, LEA, which is also in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  How did the LDA engage with elected councillors in that area?  That ongoing engagement and participation is important.  I am aware, to a certain extent, of the LDA's engagement with the community.  When I looked at its website and saw its engagement with the community, I was very impressed.  I do not live in Dundrum, but having looked at the LDA website I see very proactive engagement by it in that area.  </p> <p>  These are two different sets of circumstances, but the experience of elected members and whether they felt involved is key.  More important is the great emphasis on conditionality that can be attached by an elected member to a section 183 disposal, which was very powerful and an instrument that should be retained as an exclusive reserve function of elected members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-11a.753" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Colgan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021051100002#K00600"><p>To go back to the Shanganagh experience the Senator asked about, what was in the background in all those discussions and negotiations was the fact that we had the power of disposal.  It meant that if the Land Development Agency was to proceed on that site it could only do so with the agreement and authorisation of councillors.  What was unique about that site was that tenure mix was key.  We wanted at least a third of the 600 units on that site to be for social housing.  Some 200 social units and approximately 350 cost-rental properties are going on that site together with a smaller number of 50 affordable homes to buy.</p> <p>  Our focus was on tenure, but also on the site's community gain in terms of community facilities and so on.  It was very much around agreeing the mix.  That was the purpose of the engagement as was agreeing the design, layout and so on of the site.  It is almost as if councillors were part of the master-planning process in a very proactive way.  Ultimately, the conditions made possible by section 183 allowed us to copperfasten the findings of the master plan on tenure so they could not be reversed.  Nothing could happen, post the disposal, that would undermine the tenure mix we had already agreed.  We also built in a conditionality that should the development not go ahead in a timely fashion the land would revert to the council, which is one issue we are interested in as one of our proposed amendments to this Bill.  </p> <p>  As I said, the Central Mental Hospital is a very different situation because of the fact that it is not on council land.  We do not have section 183 available to us so our engagement is on the basis of the willingness of the Land Development Agency to engage.  We, as councillors, particularly as ward councillors, have fairly routinely sought the opportunity to put our points of view on what we think should be on that site to the Land Development Agency.  However, we do not have the influence on that site that we had on Shanganagh because we do not have the section 183 power available to us.  As the Senator said, there is significant public engagement.  If one looks at the LDA website there is a lot pushback from the community.  It is very important to ensure there is public engagement and not have resistance to any aspect of the proposals.  I made the point that there is no mechanism that guarantees members' engagement in the context of this Bill. </p></speech>

My understanding from those meetings is that its main purpose is not to purchase local authority land.  Its main purpose is to assist local authorities in developing these lands, helping with the design, all that planning aspect as well as the financial aspect.</p> <p>  I understand the concern about section 183.  I have concerns about it myself.  I have met the Green Party councillors group to discuss the matter.  It is not the LDA's purpose to set out and purchase local authority land.  The local authority land will remain local authority land and it would assist in the development of it.  We have had the opportunity to engage with the representatives of the LDA and tease that out with them.  I understand the witnesses present have not had that opportunity.</p></speech>

I have been listening to their contributions intently over the past hour or so.  The key words in this are partnership and collaboration.  They will certainly receive that from this committee.  We are more than happy to engage.  Several pieces of legislation have been referenced, including the electoral reform Bill, legislation to provide for the directly elected mayor for Limerick, this LDA Bill and the Affordable Housing Bill, which intertwine with one another.  There will be many other issues.  We are more than happy to engage with the witnesses on them.</p> <p>  I come from a local authority background.  I served for 11 years on Waterford City and County Council.  I know the issues there.  I also know how seriously local authority members take their role.  While the media and others may try to denigrate the role of local authority members, members of this committee understand the value local government brings.  Events of the past 12 months in particular have shown the importance of being able to respond to matters on the ground locally.</p> <p>  I have three questions, some of which cross over with the Affordable Housing Bill and the LDA Bill, because as Deputy McAuliffe said, they are two sides of the same coin.  Will the witnesses agree there should be a rolling open call for the serviced sites fund for the delivery of affordable purchased homes on local authority-owned land?  That is one of the recommendations from the committee.  Should local authorities be able to submit proposals as they become available at a local level rather than it just going out call by call?</p> <p>  How would the witnesses feel if section 66 relating to section 183 were just limited to high-population centres?  How would they feel if it were only used as a last resort where local authorities were not using a parcel of land for an agreed purpose?  Regarding the building of affordable homes on local authority land, what is their opinion on the 30% latitude to be given to local authorities under the general scheme for priority cases under the scheme, allowing local authorities to decide to prioritise those sections as a result of marital breakdown or families losing their home?  Do they agree with that 30% latitude, with 70% being done under the general parameters, or do they feel it should be amended?</p></speech>

That would make sense.  Irrespective of whether it is in an area of high population, I would still call it last chance saloon to do it anything other than adhering to section 183 for disposal of the land.  Putting a population limit on it becomes the thin end of the wedge.  That figure could increase or decrease by ministerial direction at some stage, which the local authorities would not have the ability to stop.</p> <p>  I would need to come back to the Senator on the 30% issue.  We have not gone into that in detail yet.</p></speech>

As I said at the outset, we are happy to engage with the committee.  I agree with what he said on the affordable housing roll-out.  It would give much more flexibility if we were to agree to that.  Section 183 was the one issue that angered most of our members.  We were mandated to come here and seek the removal of section 183.  As I said at the outset, we would be happy to engage further with the committee and to have further discussions on this.  Ms Colgan will answer the question on the 30%.</p></speech>

Local authorities are competing against each other and other sites that may have equal validity.  Having a rolling fund that responds to the deficits in infrastructure would be really valuable.</p> <p>  Regarding high-population centres and section 183, the devil is in the detail.  I am not sure if the population of the centre makes a difference for the application of section 183.  The issue here is the councillors have a measure of control over the disposal of the land and what happens on that land.  That is as important on big pieces of land as it is on small pieces.  It is also connected with the other provision in the Bill which provides that if a local authority wishes to sell a site, it must offer it first to the Land Development Agency.  Those two provide a pincer movement around the council relating to its own land.  It would rarely want to sell unless for a particular purpose in its development plan.  That is why there is a problem with undermining that.</p> <p>  Like my colleague Councillor Sheahan, I do not have sufficient familiarity with the latitude regarding affordable houses.</p></speech>

Both were very insightful and provide a great perspective on the challenges we face.  I agree with everybody that we need a collaborative approach.  Many ideas have been mentioned and many suggestions made.  The witnesses have highlighted many fears and concerns and we need to take those on board.  I am from County Longford, where the only houses built over the last ten years have been social housing.  We have seen no commercial housebuilding and that is all down to good county councillors and a very strong local authority management team.  They have collectively driven that activity.  Year after year, they have excelled and have exceeded the targets they have been given by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Particularly when one hears of the 30,000 social housing units across 2,000 projects, one cannot overstate the scale of the work under way across our local authority network.</p> <p>  I have just one query.  I am not sure which representative could answer it.  I would hope it will be one from a more rural area.  The query relates to the caps included in the affordable housing Bill, particularly the cap of &euro;225,000 which applies in smaller more rural counties.  There has not been a three-bedroom semi-detached house built in Longford in the last 11 years.  Such houses are the cornerstone of the affordable housing market.  We see this as an opportunity to finally kick-start a viable housebuilding market in Longford again.  What feedback have the associations had from their members and from local authority management with regard to the specific cap that applies in those rural counties?</p></speech>

The question of whether the cap of &euro;225,000 will work is up for debate.  As the Deputy has said, Longford has not seen much private development.  Nor has rural Limerick, where I come from.  In my area it is not an issue of affordability, as such.  We are lucky enough in that there is a lot of employment down my way.  I am told that the biggest problem at the moment is that the market in rural areas does not give developers an edge when evaluating sites on which to build.  The other big issue, on which we have not touched today, is the shortage of skills and labour needed to build all these houses, even if we could get going tomorrow morning.  I am not sure if that answers the Deputy's question.  We do not seem to have a problem with that cap in my rural area.</p></speech>

I just did not want to cut the AILG out.  I thank Councillors Hoade, Colgan, Sheahan, Fennelly and Anglim.  It has been invaluable to have the AILG and LAMA before the committee.  It was long overdue.  The two Bills are very important.  Local authorities were initially established essentially to be housing authorities.  The biggest social housing project in a decade is under way and it is being driven by the associations and their members.  It will deliver more than 30,000 social homes across the 2,000 developments that Councillor Colgan has mentioned.  It is of great importance and, as the councillor so succinctly put it, local authorities have been the housing authorities to respond to those who have the greatest housing need, who have been most vulnerable and who have been locked out of our housing market to the greatest extent.  The local authorities have played an invaluable role in this regard and that role will continue.</p> <p>  With regard to these two Bills specifically, the committee will need to engage with the two organisations on matters relating to section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001 and on other issues relating to the Bills.  We will take these issues up with the CCMA, the Minister and the Department.  The witnesses have our firm commitment on that.</p> <p>  With regard to the Moorhead report, we are all working to ensure that the Government fulfils its promise to deliver on the report within its first year in office.  We absolutely concur with the associations; it is not just about the financial side of things.  None of the witnesses is in this for financial gain.  We know that.  We all know this business.  It is not what motivates local authority members.  All of the other supports, the non-financial supports, must also be delivered.  I know I speak on behalf of the committee when I say that we are all working to ensure that these supports will be delivered.</p></speech>

We very much welcome the invitation to engage further.  We are very happy to work with the committee to prepare a submission on any issues relating to local government or other areas under the committee's remit.  We look forward to engaging with it.  We are happy to make submissions and to talk to the committee.  I thank the committee again for the opportunity to engage today.</p></speech>

It was a very worthwhile meeting.  I hope the committee has benefited from listening to the members' associations.  I have attended meetings like this before.  I do not know whether it is because today's meeting was online but when I have attended meetings in Leinster House people pop in and out every five minutes while everybody seems to have stayed online to listen to what we had to say today.  We thank members for that.</p> <p>  A few questions were asked on which Councillors Hoade, Colgan, Anglim and I could, perhaps, have done a little more preparatory work.  Perhaps in future the questions and issues the committee wishes to raise with us could be sent to us in advance.  We made our submission but perhaps it could be a two-way street and a guideline as to the questions the committee might ask could be provided.  That would enable us to engage more fully in our responses.  I thank the Chair again.</p></speech>

This committee deals with housing, local government, planning and heritage, which are all key areas in which local government delivers.  We previously had the CCMA and the approved housing bodies before the committee with regard to the affordable housing Bill.  We would welcome further engagement with both associations the witnesses represent.  They are very welcome to stay in contact with us.  From my time in local government, I know that it is when councillors are working well together and working well with the executive that the best projects are produced.  That is when the best outcomes are achieved.  I understand the concerns councillors have with regard to section 183 because it reads like they are to be excluded from the process.  I understand and have listened to those concerns.  Engagement between the organisations and the Land Development Agency would be beneficial and would allow those areas to be teased out and councillors' concerns to be discussed.  I thank the witnesses for their time this morning.  It has been very helpful for us.</p></speech>

I was coming back from the Convention Centre and it takes a little time to cross the Liffey, with our bilocation.  We had the Order of Business and then I was back across here.  We have apologies from Deputy Patrick Costello.  Deputy Martin Kenny was also in the Convention Centre and hopes to make it across but he might be late for the same reason as myself.</p> <p>  The purpose of our meeting is to consider the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018 which I think originated in the Seanad.  </p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice with responsibility for law reform, Deputy James Browne.</p> <p>  In order to participate in a division on Committee Stage, members must be physically present.  They cannot vote remotely in light of the pandemic restrictions.  In view of the remote participation of members, in order to ensure contributions are accurately recorded, I ask that members wait until I call them by name before commencing their contributions, and use their raise hand facility when they wish to speak.  We will keep an eye out for same and if we do not see them, I am sure they will make their presence felt.  This has worked smoothly so far.

Amendments Nos. 3 and 5 provide clarity regarding the interpretation of references to perjury and subornation of perjury under this Bill.  Amendment No. 4 deletes the reference to "relevant Act" which is not now required in light of the wider and more comprehensive reference to "enactment" which will cover secondary as well as primary legislation for the purposes of qualifying offences under section 6 in respect of false statutory declarations and other false statements without oath.</p><p> Amendment No. 6 provides that section 21(3) of the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 does not apply in the case of this Bill.  This is because a subsection of the 2020 Act construes references in any enactments to affidavits and statutory declarations as references to statements of truth made in place of such affidavits and statutory declarations whereas in this Bill those affidavits and statutory declarations are treated separately and distinctly, and do not need to be included here.  Effectively section 1 is the standard provision defining words and phrases used within the Bill.</p></speech>

The Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 was signed into law on 6 August 2020.  This Act includes a provision for statements of truth in civil proceedings.  Section 21(3) of the Act describes statements of truth as an electronic form of statement that can be made in place of a sworn affidavit or statutory declaration in civil proceedings.  It is important for this Bill to take account of them in section 2 so that a person making a false statement of truth will be guilty of perjury.  This is an important safeguard in respect of those statements which are made in place of affidavits.  </p></speech>

Subornation of perjury means persuading another person to commit perjury.  This is a serious matter because of the effect it has on legal proceedings.  The section provides that a prosecution for subornation of perjury can take place even where the person committing the perjury in question has not been committed of the offence.  The perpetrator of the offence of subordination of perjury must know or be reckless to the fact that the other person is committing perjury.  This means they must at least know there is a significant risk that perjury would be committed as a result of their actions and they press ahead regardless.</p></speech>

This amendment separates the different types of references already on our Statute Book into schedules for clarity.</p><p>The amendment also makes clear that where an offence of perjury is committed under an older enactment listed in Schedule 1, the offender shall be liable to be proceeded against under this new proposed Act.  Similarly, the section is amended to set out that references to perjury and subornation of perjury listed in Schedule 2 are to be construed in accordance with their definitions within the Bill.  In effect, section 4 provides that references in any law or enactment to perjury or subornation of perjury shall be read as references to perjury or subornation of perjury and not to commit perjury as provided for in relevant sections to this Bill.  </p></speech>

It is not necessary to use the adverb&quot; dishonestly&quot; for the purposes of this section.  The view taken is that its inclusion serves no useful purpose.  I am satisfied that there is sufficient qualification of the acts referred to in sections 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(b).  Section 5(1) applies to false statements made on oath made otherwise than in judicial or other proceedings.  </p><p>Amendment No. 12 makes it clearer that this subsection applies in those limited circumstances where false statements on oath are made outside and removed from the context of judicial and other proceedings.  Amendment No. 13 is a technical amendment to section 5(2) of the Bill and rewords that subsection so that it reads more clearly.  </p><p>Section 6 provides for an offence in respect of false statutory declarations and other false statements without oath.  Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 are technical amendments to the wording which are being made on the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and to include a reference to statements of truth, consistent with its inclusion elsewhere in the Bill.  Amendment No. 16 is a technical amendment which deletes the reference to material in those proceedings in section 6(1) regarding a person making a false statutory declaration or other false statement without oath.</p><p>The amendment makes it clear that the commission of any such offence is not limited to a context of proceedings and that such offences may arise otherwise than in proceedings.</p><p> Amendment No. 17 extends the ambit of potential offences in this section of the Bill to include false statements of truth made in place of statutory declarations, while amendments Nos. 18 and 19 extend the scope and application of the offences at subsections (1)(b) and (c) regarding the making of false statements and declarations so that they may apply to enactments rather than only Acts and, therefore, cover false statements and declarations made under secondary legislation as well as primary legislation.</p></speech>

Section 8 provides for an offence of making a false declaration or representation in obtaining registration for a professional calling.  An extensive review of the regulated professions in the State was undertaken by my officials and it became apparent that those professions which maintain a statutory register for entry to the profession already provided a carefully calibrated set of penalties or sanctions for this type of offence, together with appropriate practical consequences that flow from such behaviour or conduct in falsely obtaining registration for the particular profession.</p> <p>  These existing penalties and sanctions in separate specific statutes are carefully tailored to the profession at hand and carry various forms of consequences which, in many cases, are quite sophisticated, ranging from removal from the register, for example, to several years imprisonment.  Replacing all these with a simple perjury-related offence in this Bill would cause difficulties.  It would hamper the ability of the responsible bodies to deal with attempts at false registrations in a tailored way, depending on the nature of the profession and its registration requirements.  I consider it more appropriate that the existing relevant statutes and legal architecture across a range of health, social care and other specific roles requiring statutory registration in the State continue to provide for and deal with the matter of sanctioning the obtaining of false registration in such roles rather than doing so at a general level in the Bill, which would unnecessarily undermine the tailored approach that is already available to deal with this type of offence.  In short, this is dealt with by each of the relevant professions within its legislation and registration rules.  It would be unnecessary to try to duplicate that here in a more simplified manner.</p></speech>

This is a necessary and common provision in statutes such as this whereby offences can be committed by a body corporate but there stands an additional liability for directors if the offence is proven to be committed with their consent or connivance.  It is important, therefore, that I make provision for it in the Bill so that offences of this type are not overlooked.</p></speech>

The amendment further amends section 15(3) to provide that relevant offences under other enactments are limited to offences set out in sections 5 and 6 of the Bill in respect of false statements on oath made otherwise than in judicial and other proceedings and false statutory declarations and other false statements without oath.</p><p>Section 4 already provides that all references to perjury and subornation of perjury will either mean a person is liable to be proceeded against and punished as if he or she were guilty of perjury under the Bill where the reference will be construed as a reference to perjury under this Bill.  </p><p> Amendment No. 26 deletes section 15(2) of the Bill on the basis of advice received from the Office of the Attorney General that the inclusion of this subsection, which provides that this Bill does not apply to a statement without oath by a child under Part 3 of the Children Act 1997 regarding evidence of children in civil proceedings, is not needed as none of the provisions of this Bill would apply to such unsworn evidence in the first place and, therefore, this subsection serves no purpose and is proposed for deletion.  </p></speech>

No. 16 of 2020), Regulation 8(9)&rdquo;. </blockquote> <p>Amendments Nos. 29 to 35, inclusive, are a series of technical amendments to the existing Schedules 1 and 2 of the Bill.  Amendment No. 29 updates Schedule 1 to reflect changes to section 4 of the Bill.  That section, as now amended, provides that where an offence of perjury is committed under an older enactment, which is set out in Schedule 1, the offender shall be liable to proceedings against him or her under this new Act.  Similarly, the schedule is amended so that references to perjury and subornation of perjury, which are now set out in the new Schedule 2, are to be construed in accordance with their definitions in this proposed Act.  Schedule 2 of the Bill currently provides for amendments to certain older Acts that contain perjury provisions so that they may be consolidated under this proposed Act having this new statute applied to them.  </p><p>Many of the Schedule 2 amendments delete penalty provisions for false statements in historic legislation so that they may be replaced by the penalties sections within this Bill.  This, in combination, with the approach taken in section 4 and Schedule 1 of this Bill provides a more consistent approach so that perjury offences under other older enactments are subject to the relevant provisions of this Bill.  Amendment No. 30 is a technical amendment that deletes a provision deleting section 2 of the Perjury Act 1791 from Schedule 2.  This amendment is not required as that section of the 1791 Act has already been repealed by the Statute Law Revision (Ireland Act) 1879.  Amendments Nos. 31 to 33, inclusive, are technical amendments to the text in Schedule 2 pertaining, respectively, to the Assurance Companies Act 1909, the Checkweighing in Various Industries Act 1919 and the Statutory Declarations Act 1938 to update the reference to this proposed Act in that amending text and to provide that the text is read more clearly.</p><p>Amendment No. 34 deletes the text providing for changes to the Dentists Act 1985 with regard to updating penalties for falsely obtaining registration under that Act.  This deletion is no longer required or warranted as section 8 is to be deleted from the Bill for the reasons I outlined earlier.  Amendment No. 35 is a standard amending provision to the Bail Act 1997 in providing that specified serious offences are added to the schedule of the Act.  A serious offence under that Act means an offence for which a person of full capacity and not previously convicted may be punished for a term of imprisonment for a term of five years or by a more severe penalty.  Offences under this proposed Act are, therefore, to be added to the schedule of the Bail Act.  </p></speech>

Deputy Naughten has taken up the baton since then and championed the Bill.  I know the Deputy has corresponded with us a number of times.  I acknowledge the Minister of State, the Department and all parties around the Houses who have supported this Bill and helped it progress.  We did have a few false starts.  I know the Attorney General took us under his wing a few times to check and double check that everything was in order and has produced various amendments we have now considered and agreed to.  It is a case of full steam ahead.  I thank everyone for their contributions and support.  </p></speech>

I would like to be associated with the Chairman's comments about former Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and his team, who brought this Bill to the Seanad in the first place and helped bring this about.  Perjury is an offence but is very rarely prosecuted.  Putting perjury on the Statute Book will help bring about prosecutions where necessary for people who are lying in courts and in processes and are undermining justice.</p><p>It will hopefully also act as a deterrent to anyone doing that in the first place.  </p><p> I thank the Chair and the committee and former Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh</p></speech>

I wish to re-echo the sentiments on the Bill and how former Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh did so much to get the Bill through and give us something to work on.  The Regional Group has been very supportive of the Bill.  There is one item which we can discuss when it comes back to the D&aacute;il in section 14, amendment No. 22, with which we have an issue.  We are happy enough with the Bill to proceed.  It is important that everyone in the House has given their full support and I congratulate the Minister of State for the work he has done on it as well.</p></speech>
