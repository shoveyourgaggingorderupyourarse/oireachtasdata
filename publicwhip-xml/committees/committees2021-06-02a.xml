I remind them that apart from myself and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely, but from within the Leinster House complex only.  Should a division occur, members will be required to make their way to the meeting room within the normal division time in order to vote and to then return to their original location.  No apologies have been received.</p> <p>  As normal, all documentation for the meeting has been circulated on MS Teams.  The meeting is being convened for the purpose of consideration of the Sale of Tickets (Cultural, Entertainment, Recreational and Sporting Events) Bill 2021 which was referred to the select committee by order of the D&aacute;il on 13 May.  </p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Troy, and his officials to the meeting.  Does the Minister of State wish to comment briefly?</p></speech>

I thank the committee for its co-operation to date.  I appreciate its work on pre-legislative scrutiny on the scheme of the Bill.  It proved beneficial.  Four of the seven recommendations have been adopted and included in the Bill, so it was a worthwhile exercise.  I thank the committee for its co-operation in that regard.</p></speech>

All other amendments will be discussed individually.  I propose that we try to complete our consideration of Committee Stage of the Bill today.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

The amendments concern the insertion of definitions of &quot;communications media&quot; and &quot;social media platform&quot; specifically to cover the two mediums to ensure that secondary ticket sellers comply with section 17.  The concern, as I am sure the Minister of State will appreciate, is that social media platforms are not included.  These are fairly technical amendments.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the definitions already contained in the Bill do not need to be strengthened?  In my experience, small as it is - it is a long time since I bought a lot of tickets for concerts - tickets are quite regularly sold on social media platforms as well as on traditional media such as other websites and all the rest.  People share and advertise much of this information on social media.  I just want to be satisfied that the definitions contained in the legislation will be sufficient to cover any possible scenario.  We know social media and the social media platforms are very fast-moving technologies but, to the greatest extent possible, we need to be satisfied that all eventualities are catered for, and that has to include social media.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021060200002#A00900"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I fully appreciate from where she is coming.  I hope that the official explanation I will provide will relieve her anxiety or confirm there is no need for this amendment and that, for that reason, we are not proposing to accept it.  The proposed amendments to section 17(1) and section 17(2) are unnecessary in my view.  The amendment to section 17(2) is also drafted in such a way that it would not achieve its aim.  The definitions amendments Nos. 1 and 2 propose to insert in section 2 are necessary only if amendments Nos. 8 and 9 to section 17 are adopted.</p> <p>  The purpose of the four amendments is essentially to broaden the scope of sections 17(1) and 17(2) so that the information requirements for secondary ticket sellers in section 17(1), and the obligation on secondary ticket operators in section 17(2) to ensure that secondary ticket sellers comply with these requirements, would apply to advertisements or offers for the sale of tickets or ticket packages on social media platforms and through communications media as well on secondary ticket marketplaces.  The addition of a reference to social media platforms in sections 17(1) and (2) is not necessary as these platforms come within the scope of "secondary ticket marketplace" as that term is defined in section 2(1), that is, a website, online service, electronic application or print publication which provides a secondary ticket seller with a facility for the sale or advertising for sale of tickets or ticket packages, including a marketplace that also provides a facility for the sale or supply, or advertising for sale or supply, of goods or services.  Like the proposed definition of social media platform, the definition of secondary ticket marketplace refers to a website and an application.  It is broader than the corresponding part of the proposed definition of social media platform in that in also includes an online service.  The second part of the definition of secondary ticket marketplace makes clear that the term includes marketplaces that provide a facility for the sale or supply of services or goods other than tickets.</p> <p>  The addition of a reference to electronic communications media in sections 17(1) and (2) is unnecessary for various reasons.  Secondary ticket sellers do not advertise or offer tickets for sale on the broadcasting services and platforms that come within the scope of the proposed definition of electronic communications media.  Event organisers and primary ticket sellers that sell to a wide general audience advertise widely on broadcast media but secondary ticket sellers confine their advertisements and offers to marketplaces that provide a facility for the sale of tickets and permit ticket resellers to engage directly with prospective purchasers.  The broadcast media covered by the definition of electronic communications media are vehicles for general advertising and do not provide a means whereby secondary ticket sellers can engage individually with prospective buyers.  The definition of secondary ticket marketplace applies already to print publications which provide a facility for the sale or advertising for sale of event tickets.</p> <p>  Furthermore, the amendment to section 17(2) is framed in a way that would prevent it from achieving its aim.  The obligation in section 17(2) to ensure that tickets are not advertised or offered for sale without the ticket seller providing the specified information is on the secondary ticket operator.  Section 2(1) defines "secondary ticket operator" as a person who, in the context of a secondary ticket marketplace, owns or manages the marketplace or is otherwise responsible for its operation, as well as a person acting for, or on behalf of, such a person.</p><p>As the definition and section 12(2) are worded, the proposed amendment to section 17(2), therefore, would not extend the obligation to ensure that the secondary ticket sellers comply with information requirements of 17(1) to the operators of social media platforms and electronic communications media.</p></speech>

He can see where I was coming from and that the intention of the amendment was more of a belt, braces and baler twine kind of proposal.  I am satisfied that on the basis of the confirmation given to me by the Minister of State that the matters are already covered within the legislation and I thank them for the clarification.  With the leave of the Chairman, I am happy to withdraw amendments Nos. 1, 2, 8 and 9, on the basis that we have had this discussion and that the Minister of State has clarified that social media platforms are already covered.  That was my concern and I was not intending to do anything other than take, as I said, a belt, braces and baler twine approach.  I thank the Chairman and with his permission I will withdraw those amendments.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021060200002#B01000"><p>I move amendment No. 3:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 8, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:<br /><br />&ldquo;(2) It shall be necessary to provide proof that a notice or other document served on or given to a person under subsection (1) has been received by the person concerned.&rdquo;. </blockquote> <p>This, again, is a technical amendment and I am hoping that the Minister of State will be able to put my mind at rest or, as he says himself, to allay my anxiety.  I will be up all night worrying about it but it is something that is worthy of concern.  As it stands the amendment states that: &quot;It shall be necessary to provide proof that a notice or other document served on or given to a person under subsection (1) has been received by the person concerned&quot;.  The amendment is included therefore as an addition to Section 5 to ensure that where notice has been provided under the section that the person cannot turn around and simply claim that they did not receive the notice.  This is particularly pertinent for paragraphs (b) and (d) whereby the documents could be left at the address of the person concerned or sent by electronic means.  In both cases a situation could possibly arise where the person concerned simply claims that they have not received the documents.  I do not think that anyone, either myself or the Minister of State, want to find ourselves in a situation where we open the pages of a newspaper and we hear that such a person is in effect not covered by the provisions of the legislation because they simply say that they did not receive the documentation.  The intention of this amendment is to tighten that up.  Again, as with the previous amendments, I would welcome some comfort from the Minister of State on this point, please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021060200002#B01100"><p>Hopefully I can provide such reassurance on that but I will ask if any other member wishes to contribute?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021060200002#B01200"><p>Does any other member wish to contribute before the Minister of State replies?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021060200002#B01300"><p>The provisions on the service of a document are found in the statutes dealing with a wide range of different areas.  Section 5 of the Bill is in accordance with the corresponding provisions in other enactments. Officials of my Department have examined the provisions on the service of documents in all of the Acts adopted over the past decade.  None of the 20 or so Acts examined include the provision along the lines proposed by Deputy O'Reilly.  Including such provision in this Bill would have wider and possibly unforeseen consequences for provisions on the service of documents throughout the Statute Book.  The case for a proof provision along the lines proposed needs to be examined in a wider context than just in this Bill and we are therefore not in a position to accept this amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021060200002#B01400"><p>I thank the Minister of State for that reply because as an aside, this might be something that we should have a discussion about because the capacity exists for people to simply rock up to court, shrug their shoulders and say that they did not receive any letter.  That is a broader problem and I accept what the Minister of State is saying about the potential knock-on consequences.  Equally, if the Minister of State is satisfied that the provision that I have sought is not actually necessary, or indeed is perhaps necessary as part of a bigger conversation.  The amendment is a technical one and is intended to strengthen the legislation to ensure that people do not have a ready-made excuse to simply wriggle out of their responsibilities.  On the basis of what the Minister of State is saying I do not intend to push this amendment. I would welcome, however, an engagement with the Minister of State, perhaps separate to this legislation, to discuss that particular rule.  I appreciate the statutes that exist and the potential for the knock-on consequences of accepting this amendment.  Notwithstanding that, this is a discussion that is definitely worth having.</p></speech>

She is right as this does warrant broader discussion but outside the context of this Bill.  To do that in isolation just in this Bill could have unforeseen consequences on other legislation.  I appreciate the spirit in which the Deputy is offering to withdraw it and the point raised by the Deputy warrants further discussion, examination and perhaps it is a matter that we should refer to the Office of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

The amendment is a technical one, I accept what the Minister of State is saying, and on that basis I am content to withdraw it.</p></speech>

There are a number of reasons I am proposing this amendment.  The Minister of State will know as I do that many events with fewer than 1,000 people in attendance see tickets sold at over the face value and that is an issue.  This is also something in the context of the pandemic that is going to become perhaps a bigger issue in the short term than it might otherwise be because, for a great many venues, their numbers are going to be restricted.  It is restricted numbers which are driving up the prices in many instances.  We know that people are going into the marketplace, purchasing in bulk and then selling on, which is a significant problem.  That is a problem that is exacerbated when bigger venues, even venues that could reasonably accommodate over 1,000 people, for the next while may not be able to accommodate more than 1,000 people.  We need to give some consideration to broadening this definition.</p><p>If one takes the trial sporting and music events, five of them have fewer than 1,000 people who will be in attendance.  I understand that for the first few trial events, the tickets are going to be tightly controlled but that is not going to be the case for every event.  As hospitality begins to open up, it is not going to be a matter of clicking one's fingers and being back to February 2020 by any manner or means.  Consideration should be given as this is a long-term issue, but is highly pertinent in the short term, given the restrictions and the likelihood in many of these venues that tickets will be very much sought after.  We are all eager to get back to some kind of normal live entertainment, whatever it is that one wants to be doing, be it sports, music or whatever.  With the current climate and the restrictions in place, this is highly pertinent but it is pertinent in any event and I would welcome hearing the Minister of State's views on this issue.</p></speech>

The first of the conditions for the application for the designation of a venue in section 7(1) states that the venue has the capacity to hold 1,000 persons or more.</p><p>The effect of Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment would be to change this condition to "the venue has the capacity to hold an event or events."  When she references Covid-19 restrictions, the capacity of the venue that will count is not the temporary capacity, but the real capacity, so to speak.  When she talks about the 5,000 people who will be allowed into Croke Park, that is not the capacity that will be designated for the purpose of this; it will be the 80,000.  I am sure she is aware of that but I say it for the purposes of clarity.  </p><p> The amendment would make a major change to the provisions on the designation of venues in section 7.  While I appreciate that the amendment stems from a constructive desire to strengthen the Bill, I cannot accept it.  </p><p> The provisions on the designation of events and venues are a central pillar of the Bill, and the capacity threshold of 1,000 which applies to the designation of venues under section 7(1) is a core element of the venue designation provisions.  The committee&rsquo;s pre-legislative scrutiny report did not propose a change in this capacity threshold.  A major change of the kind proposed to the provisions on the designation of venues would possibly affect the objective necessity and proportionality of the obligations placed on ticketing businesses by the Bill.  Legal advice would be needed on this point before such an amendment could be considered.  </p><p> However, perhaps most importantly the removal of the capacity threshold of 1,000 would require the resubmission of the Bill to the European Commission in accordance with the provisions of Directive 2015/1535 on the procedure for the provision of information on technical standards and rules on information society services.  The scheme of the Bill was submitted to the European Commission in accordance with this requirement in February 2020 and no issues of compatibility with EU law were raised by the Commission or other member states.</p><p> The directive provides, however, that where a proposed national measure is subsequently amended in a way that significantly alters its scope, the measure must be resubmitted for further examination.  Removing the capacity threshold for venue designations would constitute a significant alteration of the scope of the Bill.  If the Bill had to be resubmitted, the result would be that it could not be enacted for a period of at least three months from the date of its notification to the European Commission.  I believe that we all understand and accept the need for the early enactment of this Bill, particularly given that sporting and entertainment events are shortly due to recommence with restricted attendances with all the potential for ticket touting that might present, as the Deputy mentioned.</p><p> My Department considers that the capacity threshold of 1,000 which applies to applications for the designation of a venue will cover the great majority of venues that are likely to host the type of high-demand events that can be expected to give rise to appreciable levels of ticket resale.  If a venue with a smaller capacity is due to hold a high-demand event, it will have the option to apply for the designation of the event.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will also have a reserve power under section 7(6) to designate a venue with a capacity of less than 1,000 after consultation with the venue operator.  If it emerges after the Act has been in operation for a time that the capacity threshold of 1,000 is impairing the effectiveness of the Act, it can be reviewed and, if necessary, amended.</p></speech>

While it may not necessarily apply in this case, if resubmission to the European Commission is required to make it right, that should happen.  We should not rule something out purely and simply because it might take some time or require some paperwork.  That is a separate issue.  I never like to hear Ministers say that while something might or might not be the right thing to do, we are not going to do it because we might need to resubmit it.  I know that is not all the Minister of State is saying.</p> <p>  I am content with the explanation given about the restrictions.  The venues will be designated based on their capacity in normal times rather than their capacity based on Covid restrictions.  I had not been certain about that and I welcome the clarification.  </p> <p>  I ask the Minister of State to give me an assurance that he will keep a close eye on venues with a capacity of less than 1,000.  I am concerned that these may fall between the cracks.  I understand that the Department is busy.  While we are talking about it today, it might not be a priority in a few months' time.  That is not to say that people will not try and will not do their best, but it is in the nature of things.  I ask the Minister of State to give me an assurance that the Department will keep a very close eye on this or that we can review the operation and have an opportunity to amend if required.  The spirit of the amendment and the intention is to ensure that as many venues, events and people as possible are covered by the legislation.  I would welcome an assurance from the Minister of State that the Department will pay close attention to the slightly smaller venues with a capacity of less than 1,000.  </p></speech>

We want to ensure that legitimate fans and patrons can get access to their particular choice of relaxation, whether that is sport, culture or music and can do so at fair value.  We have done that with this Bill after consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny as well as following Private Members Bills proposed by this committee's Chairman, the former Deputy, Noel Rock, and the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  Considerable consultation has gone into this and a capacity of 1,000 was deemed to be proportionate.</p> <p>  If a smaller venue, with a capacity of less than 1,000 is due to hold a big-ticket event that will give rise to much greater demand, it can make an application for that specific event in that venue to protect it in that instance.  I would expect that if it is not working as envisaged and smaller operators are falling foul of illegal practices, they can look for a review themselves or they can approach the Department.  Under the provisions of the Bill, the Minister of the day has the power to designate a venue with a capacity of less than 1,000.  </p> <p>  Earlier the Deputy referred to belts, braces and baling twine.  We have plenty of protections here if we find that it is not working for venues with a capacity of under 1,000.  </p></speech>

The intention of my amendment is not to delay anything but to have this discussion and ensure that the record reflects the spirit and intention of the legislation.  I will withdraw the amendment, but I reserve the right to reintroduce it on Report Stage because I want to carry out some more investigation.  Perhaps the Minister of State and I can have a chat about this.  It is a genuine concern about people falling between the cracks.  We are all on the same page in this.  This is done in the spirit of co-operation.</p></speech>

There is no dispute about that.  Fees are sometimes introduced as a deterrent, which I accept is not the case here, but I am concerned that the inclusion of a fee here might dissuade people.  Section 7(3) provides for the charging of a fee, which, I believe, might act as a deterrent.  I am interested in hearing from the Minister of State what consultation that took place in that regard, how he envisages it will operate and if he believes or not that a fee will act as a deterrent.  If he is satisfied that the opposite can be demonstrated, I am happy to accept that.</p></speech>

Likewise, I take this amendment in the spirit in which it is proposed, but I disagree with it.  The amendment proposes the deletion of section 9(4), which provides that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may prescribe a fee to accompany an application for the designation of an event under section 9(1).  While section 9(4) provides that the Minister &quot;may&quot; provide a fee for the designation of an event, it does not require the Minister to do so.</p><p>The Bill has been introduced, in part, following demands from sporting bodies and event promoters that Government take action to tackle ticket touting.  There are means such as personalised and paperless tickets available to promoters and sporting bodies that would make it more difficult for ticket touts to resell tickets for gain.<font color="#FF0000">  </font>These options involve costs for event organisers.  The enactment of this Bill will result in the cost of tackling ticket touting instead being largely borne by the State.  It is not, in my opinion, unreasonable, therefore, to include a provision under which promoters and sporting bodies who will benefit from the legislation may be required to pay a fee for the designation of their venues or events.  Any such fee would be set by reference to the administrative costs incurred in processing applications for designation and will not be used as a revenue raising measure. </p><p>While Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment proposes to delete the provision authorising fees for applications for event designation, it leaves untouched the provision at section 7(3) which permits the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to prescribe a fee for applications for the designation of a venue.  This is, presumably, because venue designations will cover all events in a venue over a long period of time and are more likely to be applied for by the operators of large venues.  Event designations by contrast will generally apply only to a single time-limited event.  A situation in which fees can be charged for one type of application for designation and not for another is open to question, however, and, depending on the level of the fee, could lead some venue operators to apply for a series of event designations rather than a more permanent venue designation.  </p><p>The aspiration and thought-process is that any such fee would be set by reference to the administrative costs incurred in processing the application and this provision will not be used as a revenue raising measure.</p></speech>

Does he have any idea of the level at which the fee will be set?  It is all very well to say it will not be used as a revenue raising measure, but he and I know, that the view of the people who will be paying it might be that it is a revenue raising measure.  Can he give a ballpark figure for the fee?</p> <p>  On section 7(3), I, probably, should have included it for amendment.  That was an oversight on my part, but the Minister of State knows where I am coming from on this issue.  I would welcome it if he could given an indication of the level of the fee and confirm if he is confident that it is not likely to act as a deterrent, which is my concern, and confident that we will not end up with a situation whereby people would find the process prohibitively expensive because the fee is only to cover the administrative costs.  Can he give us a ballpark figure for where the fee might land?</p></speech>

Many of the sporting bodies and events promoters have called on Goverment to take action against ticket touting.  There are measures that they could have taken in terms of personalised and paperless tickets, which would have made it far more difficult for ticket touts to resell tickets, but owing to the costs associated with bringing in those systems they have not done that.  There will be an associated cost under this system to the Department.  It is for that reason we are providing for the introduction of a fee to cover the administrative costs.  As the administrative burden will be insignificant, the fee will be very affordable.  We do not yet have a figure in mind, but it will not excessive or a deterrent because we want venues to apply for a designation.  We also want to cover any associated administrative costs.</p></speech>

In other words, it is not intended for anything else?  I accept that as stated by the Minister of State this is not a revenue generating measure.  That should not be the case.</p> <p>  On the fee, I remain concerned that it will act as a deterrent.  Anything that acts as a deterrent to people is problematic.  However, the Minister of State has given an assurance that the fee will be an administrative fee and not a revenue generating measure and I am satisfied with that explanation.  As in the case of the previous amendment, I propose to do a little more research on this issue with a view to resubmitting the amendment on Report Stage, if necessary.  As the Minister of State has confirmed that it is an administrative fee and not a revenue raising measure, I am content to withdraw the amendment for now.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputy Doherty and Senator Casey.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Mark Fraser to the meeting.  We will engage with the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach on the issue of the recent salary increase of the Secretary General of the Department of Health.</p> <p>  I remind members of the notice of privilege with respect to the longstanding practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are covered by privilege when in this House or in the Convention Centre Dublin but if they are attending remotely they may have only limited privilege.  I invite Mr. Fraser to make his opening remarks.  </p></speech>

I spoke to the clerk yesterday and explained that.  I presume that is okay.  My opening remarks would be to refer the Chairman to my role in this area, which I set out in a letter to the committee outlining that I have several roles in the area of assignment of Secretaries General and so on.  The committee has a copy of the minute I took of the meeting with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform, which was the meeting at which these matters were first discovered and which, ultimately, led to the process that has been recently completed.  Between that letter and those minutes, that covers my role in it.  I am conscious members will have many questions and I am happy to take their questions.</p></speech>

Are any members indicating?  Does any member wish to speak on this matter?  I call Deputy Stanley, Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  This is a joint meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.</p></speech>

I want to preface my remarks by saying I do not want to cast any aspersions over or question the competence or ability of the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  I have dealt with him on few occasions, including when he recently appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts, and I do not question his competence. </p> <p> Regarding the process for the selection of the candidate, my understanding is it was agreed at a meeting of the Taoiseach, the Minister of Health, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and Mr. Fraser.  At that initial meeting, had Mr. Fraser been aware for some period that the position in the Department of Health would become vacant?  At what stage did he find that out?  I understand the previous Secretary General in the Department of Health moved to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  I presume if he was moving to that Department that would have been known for some time.  That Department was set up last July and that Secretary General had worked with the previous Minister, Deputy Harris.  At what stage did Mr. Fraser become aware the Secretary General wanted to move or that this move was happening and would be approved?  Obviously, that Secretary General could not simply take it upon himself to decide he would move to that Department.  Can Mr. Fraser outline that briefly for me?  I am conscious of members&rsquo; time, particularly the members of the finance committee and we do not want to encroach too much on their time.</p></speech>

We found in terms of decisions that could be made that there were a few unusual situations.  The Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Social Protection had the same Minister as did the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment.  At one point it was thought the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment would be merged but in the end they ended up being separate Departments.  We had at that time a vacancy in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage because the previous Secretary General had retired.  I was asked when joining the meeting if I had been down in the Convention Centre Dublin and I remember discussing this with an individual in the convention centre on the day the Government was formed.  What happened is this,  the former Secretary General of the Department of Health &ndash; I am not using names, which I think is the correct way to proceed, based on what the Chairman said - the man Deputy Stanley referenced, went to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science.  The former Secretary General of the Department of Transport was moved to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien has just taken over.  An acting Secretary General was appointed in the Department of Transport and an acting Secretary General was appointed in the Department of Health.  In terms of the Department of Transport, things moved fairly conventionally.  There was a top level appointments committee, TLAC, process held last autumn and an appointment was made.</p></speech>

I do not want to go over the appointment of the various Ministers.</p><p>The question I am asking is a direct one.  At what point did Mr. Fraser become aware that the then Secretary General of the Department of Health was moving out of that Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.94" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Fraser" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021060200002#B00200"><p>I beg the Chairman's pardon but these issues are all sort of interlinked in my mind, so the committee might forgive me for that.  The man the Deputy is talking about was appointed to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science when the Government was formed, as I mentioned.  What happened at the Department of Health, because of the pandemic and the extremely difficult circumstances, was an acting Secretary General was appointed.  One can see from the note of the meeting in October that the first option under consideration was to ask the acting Secretary General to stay on for an extended period, but in fact that meant perhaps until the summer of this year or until there was some sense of the pandemic coming to an end, which is obviously difficult to predict.  The other option was a transfer and a Top-Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, competition.</p> <p>  In short, the man in question moved on the day Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin became Taoiseach and Deputy Harris became Minister at the Department, and thereafter, what we would do about the Department of Health was always an open question.  The acting Secretary General was clear that he was happy to serve for as long as he was asked to serve, and he did so with great distinction.  We knew we would have to make a permanent appointment to that Department at some point.  It was really the pandemic.  There is never a good time to make these big changes and it certainly was not a good time last autumn.</p></speech>

Mr. Fraser has clearly outlined how the pieces were being moved around.  It is clear to me from what he said and from the correspondence he sent to the committee that a vacancy was arising at a Department that needed a good Secretary General and that would have to be filled quickly because of Covid and the major reforms that will have to happen in the health sector over the coming years.  Why did that not happen then?</p></speech>

As the Deputy will have seen, running such a competition takes three to four months and is a period of uncertainty at any Department.  At any given moment, these matters were under review, but the acting Secretary General was doing a very good job, so people were happy to keep that as it was.  We were hoping to get to the end of the pandemic a bit more quickly, I suppose, and we are not there yet.  A good person was doing the job and sometimes people remain acting Secretary General for quite a while.  It was believed it was best to stick with the <i>status quo </i>up to a point.</p></speech>

This is what happened in this case, given that the recruitment process did not happen until this year, when the most recent acting Secretary General - now the appointed Secretary General - was already in place.  The person in the position would obviously have a natural advantage.  That is not to cast any doubt on the integrity or the ability of the person who occupies the position, but it seems to be an unusual way of doing it.  It was clear from the word go, from 27 or 29 June last year, in the days following the formation of the Government, that this position was going to become vacant.  Covid or no Covid, much had reopened at that point.  Why was a proper recruitment process not run in the months following that?  It is not clear, from either the correspondence or the answers Mr. Fraser has given, why that did not happen.</p></speech>

This matter was under review and it was believed circumstances were so difficult at the Department of Health that we needed to do what was done with the acting Secretary General.  I am sure it is clear but the acting Secretary General who was appointed in June is different to that who eventually got the job-----</p></speech>

He made it clear he did not want to but that is a separate story.  This was just the decision that was made.  As members can see, it was on people's minds at the level of the Taoiseach and the Minister in October and throughout the period.  We just thought we were better off with what we had at the Department of Health last year with the acting Secretary General.  There was a new Minister and there was an awful lot of change, and that was the decision that was made.</p></speech>

Was there an examination of what happens in other countries in respect of payments for similar positions in Europe, for example?  Was there benchmarking against them?</p></speech>

The rationale, which has been outlined and is explained in the note, was that if we were to run an open competition based on the existing salary for a Secretary General, we were likely to attract serving assistant secretaries in the Civil Service or people at that level, or even lower in the private sector.  Whether fortunately or unfortunately, the remuneration for these types of jobs in the private sector is higher.  The decision was made to increase the package, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform decided he was happy to do that but he did not want anything above &euro;300,000.  That was the rationale for coming in with a figure below &euro;300,000.</p></speech>

Scotland has a population of almost 6 million people.  In Finland, which has a population of more than 5 million, the secretary general of the department there earns &euro;131,000.  The Director-General of the World Health Organization is paid &euro;190,000.  The secretary general of the Department of Health and Social Care in England, which is in the middle of an almighty crisis with Covid and is trying to keep the National Health Service, NHS, on the road over there, earns &euro;190,000.  Where did the figure of &euro;292,000 come from?  Surely to God it would be the job of senior civil servants involved in setting up this process to examine why these salaries in other countries.  How can Finland get the best people to work for &euro;131,000?</p></speech>

My parliamentary assistant found them out in one hour by looking at comparisons and double-checking them.  If I was going to employ an electrician in the morning to carry out work for me, surely I would get two quotations and have a look at the going rate for the job.  This is the top job at the Department of Health.</p> <p>  Was there any discussion of the potential knock-on effects on the pay of other Secretaries General at any of the meetings that were held?  I accept the argument that it is a very important Department - we all agree on that - but the Departments of Finance and Housing, Local Government and Heritage are now very important as well.  Will the Secretaries General of those Departments, and indeed the principal officers, the next in line down the chain, have their hands out now, while the clerical officers will languish on &euro;24,000?  Were the potential knock-on effects considered?</p></speech>

If we look at best practice, then surely the setting of compensation for a role is always a function of a process which is detailed, analytical and comparative.  From what we have seen and what Deputy Stanley spoke of earlier, there was no comparative benchmarking, little, if any risk analysis done on the impact of knock-on claims from other Secretaries General - I do not think that the Taoiseach simply saying that there will not be is enough, a risk analysis would have been necessary -  and no calculations have been provided as to how the &euro;81,000 pay increase was reached.  Does Mr. Fraser think that a process which does not have comparative benchmarking, no detailed risk analysis and no provision of calculations meets even the bare minimum acceptable standards in this process?   </p></speech>

There is no public service pay body.  All we can do is work on what we know.  What I know from my experience of the labour market, from being on TLAC, and my own experience is what I have said in the correspondence.  I outlined the four options to the Taoiseach and Minister and they chose the option we are discussing, then this figure was arrived at which was less than &euro;300,000.  I cannot tell the Deputy that there was some big process - there was not and we both know that.  It is a number less than &euro;300,000.  That is the number that was reached.  It is higher than the normal remuneration but is less than remuneration for other jobs in the public service, as the Deputy knows.  It is not unusual internationally for people to be paid different amounts to the standard.  I would be very much in favour - in fact I would love it - if there was a more scientific benchmarking of all this.  There is plenty of evidence that would be of great use to everybody and it would be easier for everybody - the Deputy and myself, to be honest - to do it properly.  Maybe that is something the committee would consider.  These things are ascertainable, there is no doubt.  I am sure from my experience of the Irish labour market, TLAC and all the rest that my analysis is right about the types of people who apply for these jobs.  I know it, that is all I can bring to the table.  I have nothing more sophisticated than that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.112" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Fraser" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021060200002#C00400"><p>I think so, yes.  I am not looking for any sympathy for the senior public service or anything like that, it is important to get the right people for these jobs.  I would really rather be talking about a proper benchmarked assessment of the labour market.  If my experience is wrong about what the labour market says for these jobs, I would be happy to be proven wrong, but I think it would be much better if there was proper benchmarking for these things.  People do it, I am aware of reports that suggest what the labour market is but I do not stand over them either.  Deputy Stanley listed a whole load of examples of much lower pay.  It may also be that is the case.  It would be much better if it was much more transparent and people could see the basis on which these judgements are being made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021060200002#C00500"><p>I thank Mr. Fraser.  I am in full agreement with him on that.  Over the past months, the key thing that has continually been used as reasoning for this pay increase was that first, it was commensurate with the scale of responsibility but as Deputy Stanley clearly outlined, people with similar jobs are on much less pay.  Also, as Deputy Stanley said, the Secretary General with responsibility for housing, Mr. Fraser himself and other Secretaries General have just the same scale of responsibility.  Then there was the idea that it was needed to attract international talent but ultimately, we had someone who was working for the State already, doing an excellent job where he was who was fully able and capable of taking on the job which he did.  He has stated clearly that he was happy to waive that increase and that he did not feel it was needed at this time.</p> <p>  I wrote to the Commission for Public Service Appointments on this matter on the basis that it is the regulator when it comes to public service appointments.  I understand Mr. Fraser is on its board.  I asked it about this because in many ways, the appointment ended up being a lateral move within the public service and we know that in respect of public pay, lateral moves should not mean any change in pay.  The commission has told me it was not appropriate for it to comment on this.  That is a matter for it to say, but can Mr. Fraser explain to me why he thinks the regulator might feel it would not be appropriate to comment on a matter pertaining to the regulation of public service appointments and how this differs from it not to be able to comment?  </p></speech>

I do not get to go to all the meetings so it may be that I missed the Deputy's correspondence.  However we got there, and the committee is clear how we got there, there was a full, open TLAC competition for this post, which was run by the Public Appointments Service, who are people of the highest integrity.  It has extremely clear rules and guidelines and a code of practice for these things.  All the candidates were treated exactly the same.  All the candidates got a fair shout at this and the person who got it, got it.  I completely understand why people query the remuneration decision but I have to say the Public Appointments Service process was 100% above board.  I cannot over-emphasise that service's integrity.  It is absolutely straight down the line.  Everybody was treated the same and everybody had to have the same chance of getting this job too, and they did - every candidate had the same chance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021060200002#C00700"><p>I want to be clear, because that is something that is repeatedly said back to me when I ask questions about this, I am in no way suggesting that this was not above board, that the person who was chosen should not have been chosen or anything of that sort.  The point is that we keep being told that this &euro;81,000 pay increase was needed and was the only way we could attract someone to the position, when there was someone who was happy and willing to do it at its original level.  It was someone who was already working within the State and I wish him all the best in the role.</p> <p>  Mr. Fraser has been clear that there should be transparency and accountability, which I welcome.  What procedural reforms would he recommend to improve transparency and accountability and to restore public trust?  The fact is, this has really angered people.  It was not something about which it was just within the bubbles of Leinster House that people were annoyed, it was felt on the ground and something that all of us as public representatives heard regularly, because people have struggled so much this year.   The sum of &euro;81,000 is a galling figure that clearly amounts to a massive pay increase.  We need to ensure that public trust around this is restored and we need more transparency.  What are Mr. Fraser's views on that?  </p></speech>

I know the Deputy knows that but in terms of public trust, in fairness to him as a civil servant, that is a decision he made voluntarily.  Ideally, if the issue is there is a question about whether the remuneration package for the senior civil or public servants is not getting the candidates we need, all we can do is have a transparent conversation about that.  The Top-Level Appointments Committee publishes a report every year, I think its latest report will be published in the next couple of weeks, and it goes through the process and its findings.  I am a member of it, so I know the debate.  It occasionally makes glancing remarks about the type of people who apply or how people feel about the job or whether remuneration is an issue or if there are other reasons that people do not apply, all of that debate.  I think it would be much better if there was a transparent process where there was a full assessment of the labour market, the candidates and the processes and to see whether we have issues.</p><p>There may be remuneration issues, and I believe there are in a very limited number of cases.  People may feel that jobs are too challenging or easy.  I do not know, but some of these jobs are difficult enough.  If someone examined this matter independently, we would all be in a much better place.  That examination should be laid before the D&aacute;il and debated and there should be a proper conversation about it.  I would much rather it if we did not need to have a conversation like this and if we did not have problems getting good people in certain areas, but we have had those problems.  Be it requested by the Government, the Oireachtas or both, there should be a professional and independent analysis of this matter and that analysis should be debated in the Parliament and the Government.  Everyone would then know where we were coming from.  That is what we should do.</p></speech>

I wish to pick up on a point he made in his closing remarks to Deputy Farrell's questions.  He stated that the current Secretary General had waived the salary increase.  However, that Secretary General has said that it was being waived until the economic conditions improved.  What defines that improvement?  Is it at his discretion?  Is it at the discretion of central Government, be that elected representatives or officialdom?  Is this a temporary measure?</p></speech>

While it was a meaningful and welcome gesture, who knows for how long it will continue?</p> <p>  I wish to follow up on a response that Mr. Fraser gave to Deputy Stanley.  Mr. Fraser stated that he did not believe there would be a knock-on effect, but surely the precedent has already been set so that, in the appointment of any future Secretary General by any Government party or the Government as a whole, this example will be cited.  Does Mr. Fraser not concede that this has set a precedent?  Once something is done, it can happen again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.121" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Fraser" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021060200002#D00500"><p>Anything can happen regardless of whether it has happened previously.  We have appointed four Secretaries General in recent months and two appointments are under way.  None of those positions is getting an increased remuneration.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is the one that people enjoy the most, is being advertised and is subject to a Top-Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, competition on the exact same terms.  When my term is up, I would be amazed if there was any change in the terms and conditions for my successor.</p> <p>  I do not believe this situation sets a precedent.  All the evidence shows it will not be.  Of course, people may be opportunistic, but I know my colleagues - I hope I do anyway - and I do not think that anyone would believe that the Department of Health was anything other than a special case, which is the basis of this decision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021060200002#D00600"><p>I am struck by the use of the term "amazed".  This is not reflection on Mr. Fraser or any of his colleagues.  As he rightly stated, the original allocation of salary, which has been policy for quite some time, is meant to attract people from outside the Civil Service who might be the most suitable.  While we all recognise that the Department of Health is a special case, surely Mr. Fraser's own position is also a special case as the most senior civil servant, and the same argument can be made whenever it goes out to competition.  There is an impression that we have had four appointments since in a politically charged atmosphere, but once a precedent is set, clarity should be given as to whether it remains a possibility.</p> <p>  My final question will be short.  We have spoken about the difference between an acting Secretary General and an interim one and, without naming them, the two individuals who held those positions in the Department of Health.  Will Mr. Fraser clarify who appointed the interim Secretary General who is now the Secretary General and what was the process put in place for that appointment?</p></speech>

The interim Secretary General was formally appointed by the Government.  The Taoiseach informed the Government of this transfer.  Really, these decisions are made by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the relevant line Ministers and, in this case, the party leaders in the coalition, but they are formally Government decisions because the person appointed has to become the new Accounting Officer of the Department.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Fraser.  As he will see from those two answers, it is impossible for this committee and the delegation from the Committee of Public Accounts to have the sort of transparent process needed to debate and consider these matters when the relevant Secretary General believes he has nothing to do with the process and the Taoiseach of the day has yet to respond as to whether he will participate in our discussion.  Although I am a guest of this committee, I know that, perhaps for the first time ever, the Taoiseach does not intend to present the Estimates for his own Department.  I believe the Minister of State will attend instead, which would be most unusual.  It is difficult for us to do our work as committees when the culture is one of circling the wagons, telling committees nothing and, if possible, not attending at all.</p> <p>  Is Mr. Fraser a member of the TLAC?</p></speech>

I must allude to questioning the then Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about a &euro;10 million mistake that was made by the Office of Public Works, OPW.  I questioned the then chief commissioner of the OPW as to whether there was a disciplinary process afoot because somebody had made such a mistake, which was the mis-measuring of Miesian Plaza.  Mr. Fraser may recall that.  I was told there was not a disciplinary process.  I put a question at the Committee of Public Accounts to the then Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I asked him if he was aware of this technical fault and if it was a matter of surprise to him that there was no disciplinary process afoot due to the negligent behaviour that lost the State &euro;10 million over the lifetime of the lease.  I will paraphrase his response, but it is an accurate description of what the then Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said.  He said we do not employ a "gotcha" culture in the Department and mistakes - given the questioning I was putting &ndash; such as the loss of &euro;10 million, was something to be learned from.  It would be a learning experience.  Is this what we can look forward to in the Department of Health?  I refer to the culture of people losing such money from basic banana maths type mistakes that cost the taxpayer &euro;10 million.  Are we paying someone &euro;292,000 a year who can look forward to a retirement package in the region of &euro;600,000, to uphold a culture which allows such losses from basic mistakes to be a learning experience?</p></speech>

Is it the case that he, as the Secretary General to the Government, supports a culture that sees loss of moneys due to mistakes as learning experiences, as was the case with the well publicised mistake by the commissioners in the OPW, relative to Miesian Plaza, which has realised a loss of &euro;10 million to the people?  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said we do not pursue a "gotcha" culture and it is a learning experience.  Now we have upped that person's salary by &euro;81,000 and asked him to take over a &euro;22 billion Department.  Is such a culture acceptable in the public service?</p></speech>

The head of TLAC, who wrote that the Civil Service is a game with no consequences went on to say the response to failure is "sideways moves" and "easy exits".  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform told me at the Committee of Public Accounts &ndash; the record will show it &ndash; that we do not have a "gotcha" culture.  In other words, it is okay in the context of the example I am using here, to lose &euro;10 million without anything other than for that to be a learning experience.</p> <p>  Is that the culture that Mr. Fraser would like to promote?  He is a member of TLAC, which presumably chose this candidate.  He is now in charge of the biggest budget we have, along with social welfare.  Is this the culture that is there?  Conor Brady is the independent chair of TLAC.  Mr. Fraser remembers a time when he was neither a member of TLAC nor its chair.  Was he right in his article or did he introduce reforms since he came in?</p> <p>  It gives me no pleasure to say that what I am hearing from Mr. Fraser now is that he is not the head of the Civil Service and there is no head of the Civil Service and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's attitude that losing money through negligence and mistakes is an acceptable culture and that we do not have a "gotcha" culture.

Mr. Fraser is not aware of it.

The Civil Service, that has nobody in charge and no head to it, has a culture as defined by a man to whom we are after giving an extra &euro;81,000, who has a retirement package worth in excess of &euro;650,000 and &euro;146,000 every year for the rest of his life.  He stated that it is okay to make mistakes, it is a learning experience and we do not have a "gotcha" culture.</p> <p>  We keep saying we cannot get talent.  Could I suggest, as my learned colleague and friend, the Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, stated earlier, that we might talk to the Brits about how they manage to recruit?  They recruited a head of the NHS.  I take issue with the Chairman, Deputy Stanley, on his figures being slightly wrong but in the same ballpark.  The head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, is paid &euro;242,962.15.  He is responsible for 1.4 million staff and many multiples of the budget of the HSE.  The permanent secretary at the Department of Health in the UK, Chris Wormald, has 2,160 staff, as opposed to our Department of Health, which has approximately 600, and he is paid &euro;214,920.17.  We just cannot find people.  Mr. Fraser is on TLAC.</p></speech>

I believe the Government was presented some time ago with a Public Service Pay Commission report, which suggested that there be some sort of transparent higher remuneration in the public service.  This includes, obviously, senior politicians as well.  The Government decided not to set it up.  I cannot remember.  I can come back to the Deputy with the details on that.  To go back to Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell's point, I think it would be much better if there was an independent assessment of the evidence base for these decisions.</p></speech>

It is not rocket science.  When one civil servant who is already in receipt of substantial remuneration transfers from one Department to another and secures a salary increase of &euro;81,000, it is pretty standard and obvious that this is not normal or transparent.  I ask again if Mr. Fraser is aware, particularly as a member of the TLAC, of a process in which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform carried out any scrutiny of this salary increase?</p></speech>

One that I really recall was the HSE CEO competition.  We had a situation where we got nobody appointed in the end and had to rerun the competition with an increased remuneration package.

Basically, I had to advise the Taoiseach and the Ministers about their various options for appointing a Secretary General and the various possible outcomes of each option, which I did.  That is in the note the Deputy has.  I had to take on a role of doing some more work on this with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and I am also on TLAC.</p></speech>

The process of TLAC is long enough and involves shortlisting, preliminary interviews, psychological tests and references.  There is a presentation interview.

What actuarial figures were put together to apply a differentiation on the basis of value for money between 23 candidates to state we could have somebody internally at a particular cost or externally at a particular cost?  I very much fail to believe we did not have anybody of the calibre required in 23 applicants.  What was the cost differential?</p></speech>

This is public money.  We are here to ascertain how much.

They speak about how somebody on &euro;25,000 might see a 4% increase over the lifetime of that agreement.  However, we have this role, which is also a public role, for which we are looking at a 40% increase all of our sudden.  I have this concern about what message is being sent.  Mr. Fraser spoke about market sentiment and the factors that might influence those who apply or do not apply.  This is really a question for the Taoiseach about leadership and the Department of the Taoiseach with regard to the message it sends when we have this tiptoeing increase for those on lower incomes.</p> <p>  The wages of the secretarial assistants in the Seanad start at &euro;24,000.  They were told previously by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform there is a concern that if the figure were increased, it could send a politically negative message.  We have slow, incremental, tiny increases.  The goal, and the stated policy, has been that the unwinding of FEMPI would begin with those on lower incomes.  This would be the priority and it would send the signal and message we need to send to society.  Does Mr. Fraser see damage to this message when we see this large increase at the same time as we have these small measures?</p> <p>  I appreciate that we need appropriate people for roles.  I sat on a committee where the Data Protection Commission spoke about its difficulties in getting appropriate people to do its very important work because of the very rigid rules not at the top level but in the mid-level at which it hires.  These are all people who are staying within the scales of our public service.  Often, they have encountered real difficulties doing what they need to do, even within those scales.  We have seen those at the very bottom of scale getting paltry increases that will creep up and will not even match their rent increases.  Then we see this 40% spike.  Is Mr. Fraser concerned about the message this sends?  Does he see damage not just in the knock-on effect on claims?  We know of this because Mr. Fraser has already cited the CEO of the HSE and the Garda Commissioner as examples.  The very fact he is giving us these examples to justify this tells us there will be a knock-on effect at the top level.  Is he worried about the signal it sends to those on the lower incomes in our public service?</p></speech>

I share the concerns of the Senator as she has expressed them.  All I can say is I believe this is an exceptional situation.  I can only begin to explain it by reference to the overwhelming need we have to reform our health service, improve it and get better outcomes for people who need these services.</p><p>That is the rationale in the HSE.  It is a different rationale in the case of the Garda Commissioner.  These are such fundamental positions for the good of our citizens.  I understand what the Senator said, however.  Of course I do.</p></speech>

We see a great inflexibility between and within the layers.  I mentioned health.  In the case of the pay request for student nurses, for example, there was a conversation about whether there would be a knock-on effect and whether student garda&iacute; would also need it.  We have been hearing the knock-on argument used in relation to those on lower pay who are doing exceptional work in exceptional circumstances.  It is not enough to say that.  This is the Department of the Taoiseach - the leadership of the country - and there was a reason.  This is important.</p> <p>  I will go back to Mr. Fraser's specific role in relation to the pay commission.  The pay commission made a decision that the unravelling of FEMPI should begin from the bottom up.  That was a policy decision.  Does this case not contradict the decision that the restoration of public pay following that difficult period should begin from the bottom up?  Does it not contradict that policy?</p></speech>

As the Senator will be aware, there are very few people who have not had the pay cuts restored, all of whom are at the top of the system.  In that sense the policy has been fair.  This case is an exception and of course, it runs somewhat counter to that concept.</p></speech>

Mr. Fraser mentioned that he would like if there was a process in place.  That recommendation was made in 2017 or 2019.  There was a recommendation from the pay commission which Mr. Fraser is a member of that a new mechanism be put in place for senior pay.  The review body on higher remuneration in the public sector had been disbanded at the beginning of FEMPI.  Would it not be more important to send a signal of transparency?  Would it have been appropriate to seek to have the review body established and use that as a mechanism?  Mr. Fraser talked about giving advice on why we need to hike the payment for this particular role but he also told us he was not giving his personal advice in respect of implementing a transparent review body on higher remuneration.  Surely it would have been right and proper to put that body in place before making any radical or unusual decisions in respect of higher pay.  That does not mean one cannot recruit somebody under the current process or that one might not want to recruit someone for more pay but that a mechanism should have been put in place to do that properly.</p></speech>

There was a reference earlier to the Commission for Public Service Appointments, which is a new body.  The Ceann Comhairle and a couple of other people are members.  It is a little known body that deals with complaints about interviews, recruitment and stuff like that.<br/><br/>I am not on the pay commission and because the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is the Department in charge, I am not as involved in these matters as people think.  I am involved in this case because I tend to be involved in the creation of new Departments, moves by Secretaries General and so forth.  My role is limited.<br/><br/>Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell asked me a question and I gave her a truthful answer.

Given that Mr. Fraser is somebody who is being called upon in terms of his experience in this area, is that not advice that he could have given?  He informed us that this is his opinion but he also told us that he had not communicated that opinion in respect of the need for a review body on higher remuneration.  He would not have had to reinvent the wheel in that sense, in that a recommendation had already been made.</p></speech>

I am working from memory.  I was not involved in the formulation of that proposal; it was the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would have to check what the outcome of that was.  I have a memory that it was decided not to set up such a body.  It was not my decision but I have a memory that that was decided.  As I say, what we are talking about today only makes the point again that there should be some transparent way of looking at this.</p></speech>

All I can say is it is only justifiable if we can see really good improvements in our health service and much better use of resources.  That is the whole point of this appointment being made the way it was.  We will have to see.  There are so many challenges in health.  That is the rationale.

With respect, the single experience of recruiting for the CEO of the HSE is not a sufficient benchmark, rather than the many other benchmarks that have been offered from across Europe.  The reason I am highlighting the damage that is done by an increase of 40% is not to get Mr. Fraser to agree with me - he may recognise that it is damaging - but to highlight that the risk is not only the monetary amount that is lost but also the damage that is done in terms of engagement and faith in the social and economic dialogue on public pay.  That level of risk is the reason the rationale, which is still missing, is so important.  It would be great if we could see the rationale which says we cannot do this for the amount of &euro;211,700.</p></speech>

In the same way, the Senator was talking to the Data Protection Commissioner who will have a good idea of the type of people she can recruit at the type of remuneration she can offer.

The service will advertise in Ireland and in some of the better recognised international publications as well if those responsible believe it is suitable.  They will also advertise it with bodies that might have a familiarity with the area, depending on the job we are talking about.  They put it on forums like LinkedIn.  People also look for alerts on the PAS website.  It is rare enough, but sometimes we use recruitment agencies to drum up interest as well.  That did not happen on this occasion but we have done it in the past.  We certainly did it for the post of Garda Commissioner on one occasion but it is not generally the rule.  Generally, the Public Appointments Service tries to generate as much interest as it can for these posts at home and abroad.</p></speech>

I find it hard to fathom that someone at the centre of Government, as Mr. Fraser is, having been there for as long as he has, does not know some of the things that are going on.  This particular issue has gone on for some time.  In response to the question as to whether there will be knock-on effects from the increase the Secretary General has received, these individuals and others are now coming forward to say their jobs are also important.  They have written to the Department about the matter and received a dismissive letter from the Secretary General.  It is not right to say there will not be knock-on demands.  This particular demand is supported by a decision of the courts, which is approved under report No. 42 of 2007.</p> <p>  Mr. Fraser may not know about it and we will take it that he does not.  I ask him, therefore, as the secretary, if you like, to the Taoiseach and the Government, to take that up with the Department of Health and encourage resolution on behalf of those who are affected.  They seem to think a serious injustice is being done here.  They were fobbed off and told that, under FEMPI legislation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform cannot and will not do anything but the FEMPI legislation does not apply to the increase for the Secretary General.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I do not know whether FEMPI legislation still applies to that role.  I suppose it does, in a way, because it probably applies across the board.  As the Chairman knows, very few people are still subject to FEMPI legislation.</p> <p>  I genuinely do not know anything about the point the Chairman made.  The Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health are entire Government Departments.  I am happy to ask the question the Chairman has suggested.  I genuinely do not know the group to which the Chairman has referred.  It is obviously an industrial relations issue so I will-----</p></speech>

He is denying these workers the pay increase to which they are entitled.  Is it correct that FEMPI legislation did not apply to the increase the Secretary General received?</p></speech>

The Chairman is going to love me for saying this but the issue is dealt with by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and not by me.  It is complicated legislation.  It applies pay cuts to all civil servants, including new civil servants.  I do not know whether FEMPI legislation has an effect on that pay rise.  The fact that Mr. Watt waived the increase probably makes the question moot.  I will have to check that for the Chairman.</p></speech>

We do not know the position of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, because he did not reply.  The Taoiseach gave a very vague answer.  Other officials loosely pointed the finger at the Minister, Deputy McGrath.  It appears to me that it was certainly less than transparent.  Senior civil servants should have cautioned the Government about the road it was taking in this regard because it leads to demands from others for increases in their salary and some of those demands are rightly justified, such as in the case I just mentioned.  No one complained about it except to keep it under &euro;300,000 as that was probably the figure best palatable to the public.  That is what I am taking from the conversation.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has not yet decided to appear before the committee.  Mr. Brady is upset over some letter or other being published in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  In fairness to the Minister, Deputy McGrath, he has come before the committee and has been transparent about it.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, do not know.  No one seems to know anything.  Mr. Fraser has given it his best shot this morning and that is fair enough, but nobody seems to know anything and the committee is expected to accept that.  The Members of Parliament who pass budgets and go into detail on all these issues are expected to suck it up and get on with it, while those within the Department who have an issue in terms of their award of 5%, and others, are supposed to accept it as well.</p><p>There is a problem here in terms of how it is perceived.  There is a problem in terms of the necessary reform of TLAC and all those other organisations or committees or whatever they are.  I believe that reform should be driven by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Who would bother applying for a job when the outcome is that most of the jobs go to insiders?  Mr. Fraser is aware of an awful lot of what goes on in government.  He is there at the centre of things.  I will leave it at that but I agree with the sentiment expressed in this morning's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, that is, that something stinks at the heart of Government.  I think that is a fact.</p></speech>

There is a massive economic crisis yet we have this largesse in terms of the payment of salaries.  There is also the whole idea that, of all the Departments in all the world, a successful candidate could only be found in the Department in which the decision was made.  The circle of decision-making and benefit is so small in the context of this issue.</p> <p>  What is the salary ratio in the Department of Health?  What is the ratio between the highest salary and the lowest salaries in the Department of Health?</p></speech>

There are 3,000 people in the public service who are earning less than &euro;22,000.  Compared with the salary that was granted to the Secretary General, the ratio is 12:1, which is enormous.  In Nordic countries, for example, the ratio between the top salary and the bottom salary is 3:1, 4:1 or possibly 7:1.</p> <p>  Why was an increase of &euro;80,000 selected rather than one of &euro;70,000 or &euro;90,000?  From listening to the responses of Mr. Fraser, it seems the &euro;80,000 increase was plucked from the air to a certain extent.  It had no foundation in international standards with regard to salaries or anything.  Who originated the figure of &euro;80,000?</p></speech>

An international firm or a recruitment organisation seeking to put forward a package to select individuals who are the best people to do the job might go a little bit beyond a back of an envelope calculation with regard to the best way to attract those individuals.  Many people will find it shocking that this figure was literally plucked out of the air.</p><p>If any members of this committee were in ministerial roles, I would expect them to have a far better foundation in international recruitment statistics and metrics to allow them greater understanding regarding what figure to select.  It is mind-blowing that the figure was plucked out of the air in this situation.  It was reported that the information was given to the Cabinet orally and there is no paper trail.  Is that correct?  </p></speech>

Candidates are shortlisted and then preliminary interviews are held, and that is all done by the Public Appointments Service.  A secretary from the Public Appointments Service attends those interview boards and keeps all the paperwork.  Final interviews are then held.  Before those interviews, full psychological assessments are undertaken, which take three or four hours for each candidate, and reports are subsequently prepared.  References are then taken.  Candidates obviously must also submit their curricula vitae and application forms and they must then deliver a presentation to the Top-Level Appointments Committee.  That committee then interviews each candidate for up to an hour and each candidate is scored by the committee.  The committee then reaches its conclusion based on the whole process.  I can certainly get the Deputy information on the process.  Obviously, the scores for individual candidates are confidential, but that is how it works.</p></speech>

Whitaker is recorded, in a book, as saying something to the effect that there can be no greater priority than the restoration of senior civil servants.  I agree with him.  Theoretically, the Minister of the day is in charge.  However, the way the Ministers and Secretaries Acts are written means that Secretaries General are untouchable and hold all the cards.  It is a bit like a presenter on an RT&Eacute; programme.  One should not club the presenter because he or she can make you look bad.</p></speech>

I am sorry, we have only two minutes left.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Fraser for coming in today.  My questions are also brief.  Is it correct that no actuarial analysis was done of whether the appointment concerned was going to cost us much more if we appointed an internal candidate from the Civil Service?</p></speech>

I will give her a different answer this time.  If she is asking me when we make these appointments, TLAC makes appointments based on the published terms of a role.  The Deputy is correct that those terms are different depending on whether it is a serving public servant or not.  No decision is made by TLAC based on whether the person is from the public or private sectors.  In that sense, it is not as if TLAC says that a certain person is the best person for the job but that another person would be cheaper.  It does not do that and that is not how it works.</p></speech>

Would it not make more sense to do that, given that may be a very distinguishing factor?  I refer to how the public's money is spent.</p></speech>

I am also a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and we should be offering the best we can in respect of public expenditure.  The title of the Department is that of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  If nothing else, and if we cannot stop what has happened, we should most certainly be able to create a process whereby we have covered all the avenues now being discussed for use in the future.  I was in business for 30 years.  From what we have listened to today, it is beyond me to be able to understand that it appears we plucked a figure out of the sky in this regard.  The matter does not just end with that figure.</p><p>There is an actuarial process involved, if account is taken of the Civil Service pensionable interest with respect to the candidate who achieved the position.  It is in excess of hundreds of thousands of euro extra on top of what we think is the salary increase in terms of the cost to the Exchequer.  That has to be defined.  I would appreciate if that actuarial computation could be forwarded to this committee in order that we could review it.  I do not need to know who the other applicants were, but Mr. Fraser might set out that computation against that of one of the other applicants and show us the differentiation that would have applied.</p></speech>

As I said, at least he attended.  He did not avoid the issue.  We may not have liked some of the answers we received from him but at least he accounted for himself.</p> <p>  Regarding the issue itself, I believe reform is necessary.  His Department and the Taoiseach must drive that reform.  This was not a transparent process.  It has a created a major issue and damage for civil servants generally.  There is a certain truth in politicians being the glove puppets of the civil servants.  That is the way it appears to me.  Certainly, without a head person, someone who is over the Civil Service, it is easy to see how a strong character might get his or her way.  Reform is necessary.  We will revisit this in due course.  I thank Mr. Fraser again for his attendance.</p></speech>
