I remind them that apart from myself and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely, but from within the Leinster House complex only.  Should a division occur, members will be required to make their way to the meeting room within the normal division time in order to vote and to then return to their original location.  No apologies have been received.</p> <p>  As normal, all documentation for the meeting has been circulated on MS Teams.  The meeting is being convened for the purpose of consideration of the Sale of Tickets (Cultural, Entertainment, Recreational and Sporting Events) Bill 2021 which was referred to the select committee by order of the D&aacute;il on 13 May.  </p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Troy, and his officials to the meeting.  Does the Minister of State wish to comment briefly?</p></speech>

I thank the committee for its co-operation to date.  I appreciate its work on pre-legislative scrutiny on the scheme of the Bill.  It proved beneficial.  Four of the seven recommendations have been adopted and included in the Bill, so it was a worthwhile exercise.  I thank the committee for its co-operation in that regard.</p></speech>

All other amendments will be discussed individually.  I propose that we try to complete our consideration of Committee Stage of the Bill today.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

The amendments concern the insertion of definitions of &quot;communications media&quot; and &quot;social media platform&quot; specifically to cover the two mediums to ensure that secondary ticket sellers comply with section 17.  The concern, as I am sure the Minister of State will appreciate, is that social media platforms are not included.  These are fairly technical amendments.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the definitions already contained in the Bill do not need to be strengthened?  In my experience, small as it is - it is a long time since I bought a lot of tickets for concerts - tickets are quite regularly sold on social media platforms as well as on traditional media such as other websites and all the rest.  People share and advertise much of this information on social media.  I just want to be satisfied that the definitions contained in the legislation will be sufficient to cover any possible scenario.  We know social media and the social media platforms are very fast-moving technologies but, to the greatest extent possible, we need to be satisfied that all eventualities are catered for, and that has to include social media.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021060200002#A00900"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I fully appreciate from where she is coming.  I hope that the official explanation I will provide will relieve her anxiety or confirm there is no need for this amendment and that, for that reason, we are not proposing to accept it.  The proposed amendments to section 17(1) and section 17(2) are unnecessary in my view.  The amendment to section 17(2) is also drafted in such a way that it would not achieve its aim.  The definitions amendments Nos. 1 and 2 propose to insert in section 2 are necessary only if amendments Nos. 8 and 9 to section 17 are adopted.</p> <p>  The purpose of the four amendments is essentially to broaden the scope of sections 17(1) and 17(2) so that the information requirements for secondary ticket sellers in section 17(1), and the obligation on secondary ticket operators in section 17(2) to ensure that secondary ticket sellers comply with these requirements, would apply to advertisements or offers for the sale of tickets or ticket packages on social media platforms and through communications media as well on secondary ticket marketplaces.  The addition of a reference to social media platforms in sections 17(1) and (2) is not necessary as these platforms come within the scope of "secondary ticket marketplace" as that term is defined in section 2(1), that is, a website, online service, electronic application or print publication which provides a secondary ticket seller with a facility for the sale or advertising for sale of tickets or ticket packages, including a marketplace that also provides a facility for the sale or supply, or advertising for sale or supply, of goods or services.  Like the proposed definition of social media platform, the definition of secondary ticket marketplace refers to a website and an application.  It is broader than the corresponding part of the proposed definition of social media platform in that in also includes an online service.  The second part of the definition of secondary ticket marketplace makes clear that the term includes marketplaces that provide a facility for the sale or supply of services or goods other than tickets.</p> <p>  The addition of a reference to electronic communications media in sections 17(1) and (2) is unnecessary for various reasons.  Secondary ticket sellers do not advertise or offer tickets for sale on the broadcasting services and platforms that come within the scope of the proposed definition of electronic communications media.  Event organisers and primary ticket sellers that sell to a wide general audience advertise widely on broadcast media but secondary ticket sellers confine their advertisements and offers to marketplaces that provide a facility for the sale of tickets and permit ticket resellers to engage directly with prospective purchasers.  The broadcast media covered by the definition of electronic communications media are vehicles for general advertising and do not provide a means whereby secondary ticket sellers can engage individually with prospective buyers.  The definition of secondary ticket marketplace applies already to print publications which provide a facility for the sale or advertising for sale of event tickets.</p> <p>  Furthermore, the amendment to section 17(2) is framed in a way that would prevent it from achieving its aim.  The obligation in section 17(2) to ensure that tickets are not advertised or offered for sale without the ticket seller providing the specified information is on the secondary ticket operator.  Section 2(1) defines "secondary ticket operator" as a person who, in the context of a secondary ticket marketplace, owns or manages the marketplace or is otherwise responsible for its operation, as well as a person acting for, or on behalf of, such a person.</p><p>As the definition and section 12(2) are worded, the proposed amendment to section 17(2), therefore, would not extend the obligation to ensure that the secondary ticket sellers comply with information requirements of 17(1) to the operators of social media platforms and electronic communications media.</p></speech>

He can see where I was coming from and that the intention of the amendment was more of a belt, braces and baler twine kind of proposal.  I am satisfied that on the basis of the confirmation given to me by the Minister of State that the matters are already covered within the legislation and I thank them for the clarification.  With the leave of the Chairman, I am happy to withdraw amendments Nos. 1, 2, 8 and 9, on the basis that we have had this discussion and that the Minister of State has clarified that social media platforms are already covered.  That was my concern and I was not intending to do anything other than take, as I said, a belt, braces and baler twine approach.  I thank the Chairman and with his permission I will withdraw those amendments.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021060200002#B01000"><p>I move amendment No. 3:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 8, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:<br /><br />&ldquo;(2) It shall be necessary to provide proof that a notice or other document served on or given to a person under subsection (1) has been received by the person concerned.&rdquo;. </blockquote> <p>This, again, is a technical amendment and I am hoping that the Minister of State will be able to put my mind at rest or, as he says himself, to allay my anxiety.  I will be up all night worrying about it but it is something that is worthy of concern.  As it stands the amendment states that: &quot;It shall be necessary to provide proof that a notice or other document served on or given to a person under subsection (1) has been received by the person concerned&quot;.  The amendment is included therefore as an addition to Section 5 to ensure that where notice has been provided under the section that the person cannot turn around and simply claim that they did not receive the notice.  This is particularly pertinent for paragraphs (b) and (d) whereby the documents could be left at the address of the person concerned or sent by electronic means.  In both cases a situation could possibly arise where the person concerned simply claims that they have not received the documents.  I do not think that anyone, either myself or the Minister of State, want to find ourselves in a situation where we open the pages of a newspaper and we hear that such a person is in effect not covered by the provisions of the legislation because they simply say that they did not receive the documentation.  The intention of this amendment is to tighten that up.  Again, as with the previous amendments, I would welcome some comfort from the Minister of State on this point, please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021060200002#B01100"><p>Hopefully I can provide such reassurance on that but I will ask if any other member wishes to contribute?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021060200002#B01200"><p>Does any other member wish to contribute before the Minister of State replies?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021060200002#B01300"><p>The provisions on the service of a document are found in the statutes dealing with a wide range of different areas.  Section 5 of the Bill is in accordance with the corresponding provisions in other enactments. Officials of my Department have examined the provisions on the service of documents in all of the Acts adopted over the past decade.  None of the 20 or so Acts examined include the provision along the lines proposed by Deputy O'Reilly.  Including such provision in this Bill would have wider and possibly unforeseen consequences for provisions on the service of documents throughout the Statute Book.  The case for a proof provision along the lines proposed needs to be examined in a wider context than just in this Bill and we are therefore not in a position to accept this amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2021060200002#B01400"><p>I thank the Minister of State for that reply because as an aside, this might be something that we should have a discussion about because the capacity exists for people to simply rock up to court, shrug their shoulders and say that they did not receive any letter.  That is a broader problem and I accept what the Minister of State is saying about the potential knock-on consequences.  Equally, if the Minister of State is satisfied that the provision that I have sought is not actually necessary, or indeed is perhaps necessary as part of a bigger conversation.  The amendment is a technical one and is intended to strengthen the legislation to ensure that people do not have a ready-made excuse to simply wriggle out of their responsibilities.  On the basis of what the Minister of State is saying I do not intend to push this amendment. I would welcome, however, an engagement with the Minister of State, perhaps separate to this legislation, to discuss that particular rule.  I appreciate the statutes that exist and the potential for the knock-on consequences of accepting this amendment.  Notwithstanding that, this is a discussion that is definitely worth having.</p></speech>

She is right as this does warrant broader discussion but outside the context of this Bill.  To do that in isolation just in this Bill could have unforeseen consequences on other legislation.  I appreciate the spirit in which the Deputy is offering to withdraw it and the point raised by the Deputy warrants further discussion, examination and perhaps it is a matter that we should refer to the Office of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

The amendment is a technical one, I accept what the Minister of State is saying, and on that basis I am content to withdraw it.</p></speech>

There are a number of reasons I am proposing this amendment.  The Minister of State will know as I do that many events with fewer than 1,000 people in attendance see tickets sold at over the face value and that is an issue.  This is also something in the context of the pandemic that is going to become perhaps a bigger issue in the short term than it might otherwise be because, for a great many venues, their numbers are going to be restricted.  It is restricted numbers which are driving up the prices in many instances.  We know that people are going into the marketplace, purchasing in bulk and then selling on, which is a significant problem.  That is a problem that is exacerbated when bigger venues, even venues that could reasonably accommodate over 1,000 people, for the next while may not be able to accommodate more than 1,000 people.  We need to give some consideration to broadening this definition.</p><p>If one takes the trial sporting and music events, five of them have fewer than 1,000 people who will be in attendance.  I understand that for the first few trial events, the tickets are going to be tightly controlled but that is not going to be the case for every event.  As hospitality begins to open up, it is not going to be a matter of clicking one's fingers and being back to February 2020 by any manner or means.  Consideration should be given as this is a long-term issue, but is highly pertinent in the short term, given the restrictions and the likelihood in many of these venues that tickets will be very much sought after.  We are all eager to get back to some kind of normal live entertainment, whatever it is that one wants to be doing, be it sports, music or whatever.  With the current climate and the restrictions in place, this is highly pertinent but it is pertinent in any event and I would welcome hearing the Minister of State's views on this issue.</p></speech>

The first of the conditions for the application for the designation of a venue in section 7(1) states that the venue has the capacity to hold 1,000 persons or more.</p><p>The effect of Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment would be to change this condition to "the venue has the capacity to hold an event or events."  When she references Covid-19 restrictions, the capacity of the venue that will count is not the temporary capacity, but the real capacity, so to speak.  When she talks about the 5,000 people who will be allowed into Croke Park, that is not the capacity that will be designated for the purpose of this; it will be the 80,000.  I am sure she is aware of that but I say it for the purposes of clarity.  </p><p> The amendment would make a major change to the provisions on the designation of venues in section 7.  While I appreciate that the amendment stems from a constructive desire to strengthen the Bill, I cannot accept it.  </p><p> The provisions on the designation of events and venues are a central pillar of the Bill, and the capacity threshold of 1,000 which applies to the designation of venues under section 7(1) is a core element of the venue designation provisions.  The committee&rsquo;s pre-legislative scrutiny report did not propose a change in this capacity threshold.  A major change of the kind proposed to the provisions on the designation of venues would possibly affect the objective necessity and proportionality of the obligations placed on ticketing businesses by the Bill.  Legal advice would be needed on this point before such an amendment could be considered.  </p><p> However, perhaps most importantly the removal of the capacity threshold of 1,000 would require the resubmission of the Bill to the European Commission in accordance with the provisions of Directive 2015/1535 on the procedure for the provision of information on technical standards and rules on information society services.  The scheme of the Bill was submitted to the European Commission in accordance with this requirement in February 2020 and no issues of compatibility with EU law were raised by the Commission or other member states.</p><p> The directive provides, however, that where a proposed national measure is subsequently amended in a way that significantly alters its scope, the measure must be resubmitted for further examination.  Removing the capacity threshold for venue designations would constitute a significant alteration of the scope of the Bill.  If the Bill had to be resubmitted, the result would be that it could not be enacted for a period of at least three months from the date of its notification to the European Commission.  I believe that we all understand and accept the need for the early enactment of this Bill, particularly given that sporting and entertainment events are shortly due to recommence with restricted attendances with all the potential for ticket touting that might present, as the Deputy mentioned.</p><p> My Department considers that the capacity threshold of 1,000 which applies to applications for the designation of a venue will cover the great majority of venues that are likely to host the type of high-demand events that can be expected to give rise to appreciable levels of ticket resale.  If a venue with a smaller capacity is due to hold a high-demand event, it will have the option to apply for the designation of the event.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will also have a reserve power under section 7(6) to designate a venue with a capacity of less than 1,000 after consultation with the venue operator.  If it emerges after the Act has been in operation for a time that the capacity threshold of 1,000 is impairing the effectiveness of the Act, it can be reviewed and, if necessary, amended.</p></speech>

While it may not necessarily apply in this case, if resubmission to the European Commission is required to make it right, that should happen.  We should not rule something out purely and simply because it might take some time or require some paperwork.  That is a separate issue.  I never like to hear Ministers say that while something might or might not be the right thing to do, we are not going to do it because we might need to resubmit it.  I know that is not all the Minister of State is saying.</p> <p>  I am content with the explanation given about the restrictions.  The venues will be designated based on their capacity in normal times rather than their capacity based on Covid restrictions.  I had not been certain about that and I welcome the clarification.  </p> <p>  I ask the Minister of State to give me an assurance that he will keep a close eye on venues with a capacity of less than 1,000.  I am concerned that these may fall between the cracks.  I understand that the Department is busy.  While we are talking about it today, it might not be a priority in a few months' time.  That is not to say that people will not try and will not do their best, but it is in the nature of things.  I ask the Minister of State to give me an assurance that the Department will keep a very close eye on this or that we can review the operation and have an opportunity to amend if required.  The spirit of the amendment and the intention is to ensure that as many venues, events and people as possible are covered by the legislation.  I would welcome an assurance from the Minister of State that the Department will pay close attention to the slightly smaller venues with a capacity of less than 1,000.  </p></speech>

We want to ensure that legitimate fans and patrons can get access to their particular choice of relaxation, whether that is sport, culture or music and can do so at fair value.  We have done that with this Bill after consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny as well as following Private Members Bills proposed by this committee's Chairman, the former Deputy, Noel Rock, and the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  Considerable consultation has gone into this and a capacity of 1,000 was deemed to be proportionate.</p> <p>  If a smaller venue, with a capacity of less than 1,000 is due to hold a big-ticket event that will give rise to much greater demand, it can make an application for that specific event in that venue to protect it in that instance.  I would expect that if it is not working as envisaged and smaller operators are falling foul of illegal practices, they can look for a review themselves or they can approach the Department.  Under the provisions of the Bill, the Minister of the day has the power to designate a venue with a capacity of less than 1,000.  </p> <p>  Earlier the Deputy referred to belts, braces and baling twine.  We have plenty of protections here if we find that it is not working for venues with a capacity of under 1,000.  </p></speech>

The intention of my amendment is not to delay anything but to have this discussion and ensure that the record reflects the spirit and intention of the legislation.  I will withdraw the amendment, but I reserve the right to reintroduce it on Report Stage because I want to carry out some more investigation.  Perhaps the Minister of State and I can have a chat about this.  It is a genuine concern about people falling between the cracks.  We are all on the same page in this.  This is done in the spirit of co-operation.</p></speech>

There is no dispute about that.  Fees are sometimes introduced as a deterrent, which I accept is not the case here, but I am concerned that the inclusion of a fee here might dissuade people.  Section 7(3) provides for the charging of a fee, which, I believe, might act as a deterrent.  I am interested in hearing from the Minister of State what consultation that took place in that regard, how he envisages it will operate and if he believes or not that a fee will act as a deterrent.  If he is satisfied that the opposite can be demonstrated, I am happy to accept that.</p></speech>

Likewise, I take this amendment in the spirit in which it is proposed, but I disagree with it.  The amendment proposes the deletion of section 9(4), which provides that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may prescribe a fee to accompany an application for the designation of an event under section 9(1).  While section 9(4) provides that the Minister &quot;may&quot; provide a fee for the designation of an event, it does not require the Minister to do so.</p><p>The Bill has been introduced, in part, following demands from sporting bodies and event promoters that Government take action to tackle ticket touting.  There are means such as personalised and paperless tickets available to promoters and sporting bodies that would make it more difficult for ticket touts to resell tickets for gain.<font color="#FF0000">  </font>These options involve costs for event organisers.  The enactment of this Bill will result in the cost of tackling ticket touting instead being largely borne by the State.  It is not, in my opinion, unreasonable, therefore, to include a provision under which promoters and sporting bodies who will benefit from the legislation may be required to pay a fee for the designation of their venues or events.  Any such fee would be set by reference to the administrative costs incurred in processing applications for designation and will not be used as a revenue raising measure. </p><p>While Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment proposes to delete the provision authorising fees for applications for event designation, it leaves untouched the provision at section 7(3) which permits the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to prescribe a fee for applications for the designation of a venue.  This is, presumably, because venue designations will cover all events in a venue over a long period of time and are more likely to be applied for by the operators of large venues.  Event designations by contrast will generally apply only to a single time-limited event.  A situation in which fees can be charged for one type of application for designation and not for another is open to question, however, and, depending on the level of the fee, could lead some venue operators to apply for a series of event designations rather than a more permanent venue designation.  </p><p>The aspiration and thought-process is that any such fee would be set by reference to the administrative costs incurred in processing the application and this provision will not be used as a revenue raising measure.</p></speech>

Does he have any idea of the level at which the fee will be set?  It is all very well to say it will not be used as a revenue raising measure, but he and I know, that the view of the people who will be paying it might be that it is a revenue raising measure.  Can he give a ballpark figure for the fee?</p> <p>  On section 7(3), I, probably, should have included it for amendment.  That was an oversight on my part, but the Minister of State knows where I am coming from on this issue.  I would welcome it if he could given an indication of the level of the fee and confirm if he is confident that it is not likely to act as a deterrent, which is my concern, and confident that we will not end up with a situation whereby people would find the process prohibitively expensive because the fee is only to cover the administrative costs.  Can he give us a ballpark figure for where the fee might land?</p></speech>

Many of the sporting bodies and events promoters have called on Goverment to take action against ticket touting.  There are measures that they could have taken in terms of personalised and paperless tickets, which would have made it far more difficult for ticket touts to resell tickets, but owing to the costs associated with bringing in those systems they have not done that.  There will be an associated cost under this system to the Department.  It is for that reason we are providing for the introduction of a fee to cover the administrative costs.  As the administrative burden will be insignificant, the fee will be very affordable.  We do not yet have a figure in mind, but it will not excessive or a deterrent because we want venues to apply for a designation.  We also want to cover any associated administrative costs.</p></speech>

In other words, it is not intended for anything else?  I accept that as stated by the Minister of State this is not a revenue generating measure.  That should not be the case.</p> <p>  On the fee, I remain concerned that it will act as a deterrent.  Anything that acts as a deterrent to people is problematic.  However, the Minister of State has given an assurance that the fee will be an administrative fee and not a revenue generating measure and I am satisfied with that explanation.  As in the case of the previous amendment, I propose to do a little more research on this issue with a view to resubmitting the amendment on Report Stage, if necessary.  As the Minister of State has confirmed that it is an administrative fee and not a revenue raising measure, I am content to withdraw the amendment for now.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputy Doherty and Senator Casey.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Mark Fraser to the meeting.  We will engage with the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach on the issue of the recent salary increase of the Secretary General of the Department of Health.</p> <p>  I remind members of the notice of privilege with respect to the longstanding practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are covered by privilege when in this House or in the Convention Centre Dublin but if they are attending remotely they may have only limited privilege.  I invite Mr. Fraser to make his opening remarks.  </p></speech>

I spoke to the clerk yesterday and explained that.  I presume that is okay.  My opening remarks would be to refer the Chairman to my role in this area, which I set out in a letter to the committee outlining that I have several roles in the area of assignment of Secretaries General and so on.  The committee has a copy of the minute I took of the meeting with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform, which was the meeting at which these matters were first discovered and which, ultimately, led to the process that has been recently completed.  Between that letter and those minutes, that covers my role in it.  I am conscious members will have many questions and I am happy to take their questions.</p></speech>

Are any members indicating?  Does any member wish to speak on this matter?  I call Deputy Stanley, Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  This is a joint meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.</p></speech>

I want to preface my remarks by saying I do not want to cast any aspersions over or question the competence or ability of the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  I have dealt with him on few occasions, including when he recently appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts, and I do not question his competence. </p> <p> Regarding the process for the selection of the candidate, my understanding is it was agreed at a meeting of the Taoiseach, the Minister of Health, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and Mr. Fraser.  At that initial meeting, had Mr. Fraser been aware for some period that the position in the Department of Health would become vacant?  At what stage did he find that out?  I understand the previous Secretary General in the Department of Health moved to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  I presume if he was moving to that Department that would have been known for some time.  That Department was set up last July and that Secretary General had worked with the previous Minister, Deputy Harris.  At what stage did Mr. Fraser become aware the Secretary General wanted to move or that this move was happening and would be approved?  Obviously, that Secretary General could not simply take it upon himself to decide he would move to that Department.  Can Mr. Fraser outline that briefly for me?  I am conscious of members&rsquo; time, particularly the members of the finance committee and we do not want to encroach too much on their time.</p></speech>

We found in terms of decisions that could be made that there were a few unusual situations.  The Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Social Protection had the same Minister as did the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment.  At one point it was thought the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment would be merged but in the end they ended up being separate Departments.  We had at that time a vacancy in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage because the previous Secretary General had retired.  I was asked when joining the meeting if I had been down in the Convention Centre Dublin and I remember discussing this with an individual in the convention centre on the day the Government was formed.  What happened is this,  the former Secretary General of the Department of Health &ndash; I am not using names, which I think is the correct way to proceed, based on what the Chairman said - the man Deputy Stanley referenced, went to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science.  The former Secretary General of the Department of Transport was moved to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien has just taken over.  An acting Secretary General was appointed in the Department of Transport and an acting Secretary General was appointed in the Department of Health.  In terms of the Department of Transport, things moved fairly conventionally.  There was a top level appointments committee, TLAC, process held last autumn and an appointment was made.</p></speech>

I do not want to go over the appointment of the various Ministers.</p><p>The question I am asking is a direct one.  At what point did Mr. Fraser become aware that the then Secretary General of the Department of Health was moving out of that Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.94" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Fraser" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021060200002#B00200"><p>I beg the Chairman's pardon but these issues are all sort of interlinked in my mind, so the committee might forgive me for that.  The man the Deputy is talking about was appointed to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science when the Government was formed, as I mentioned.  What happened at the Department of Health, because of the pandemic and the extremely difficult circumstances, was an acting Secretary General was appointed.  One can see from the note of the meeting in October that the first option under consideration was to ask the acting Secretary General to stay on for an extended period, but in fact that meant perhaps until the summer of this year or until there was some sense of the pandemic coming to an end, which is obviously difficult to predict.  The other option was a transfer and a Top-Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, competition.</p> <p>  In short, the man in question moved on the day Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin became Taoiseach and Deputy Harris became Minister at the Department, and thereafter, what we would do about the Department of Health was always an open question.  The acting Secretary General was clear that he was happy to serve for as long as he was asked to serve, and he did so with great distinction.  We knew we would have to make a permanent appointment to that Department at some point.  It was really the pandemic.  There is never a good time to make these big changes and it certainly was not a good time last autumn.</p></speech>

Mr. Fraser has clearly outlined how the pieces were being moved around.  It is clear to me from what he said and from the correspondence he sent to the committee that a vacancy was arising at a Department that needed a good Secretary General and that would have to be filled quickly because of Covid and the major reforms that will have to happen in the health sector over the coming years.  Why did that not happen then?</p></speech>

As the Deputy will have seen, running such a competition takes three to four months and is a period of uncertainty at any Department.  At any given moment, these matters were under review, but the acting Secretary General was doing a very good job, so people were happy to keep that as it was.  We were hoping to get to the end of the pandemic a bit more quickly, I suppose, and we are not there yet.  A good person was doing the job and sometimes people remain acting Secretary General for quite a while.  It was believed it was best to stick with the <i>status quo </i>up to a point.</p></speech>

This is what happened in this case, given that the recruitment process did not happen until this year, when the most recent acting Secretary General - now the appointed Secretary General - was already in place.  The person in the position would obviously have a natural advantage.  That is not to cast any doubt on the integrity or the ability of the person who occupies the position, but it seems to be an unusual way of doing it.  It was clear from the word go, from 27 or 29 June last year, in the days following the formation of the Government, that this position was going to become vacant.  Covid or no Covid, much had reopened at that point.  Why was a proper recruitment process not run in the months following that?  It is not clear, from either the correspondence or the answers Mr. Fraser has given, why that did not happen.</p></speech>

This matter was under review and it was believed circumstances were so difficult at the Department of Health that we needed to do what was done with the acting Secretary General.  I am sure it is clear but the acting Secretary General who was appointed in June is different to that who eventually got the job-----</p></speech>

He made it clear he did not want to but that is a separate story.  This was just the decision that was made.  As members can see, it was on people's minds at the level of the Taoiseach and the Minister in October and throughout the period.  We just thought we were better off with what we had at the Department of Health last year with the acting Secretary General.  There was a new Minister and there was an awful lot of change, and that was the decision that was made.</p></speech>

Was there an examination of what happens in other countries in respect of payments for similar positions in Europe, for example?  Was there benchmarking against them?</p></speech>

The rationale, which has been outlined and is explained in the note, was that if we were to run an open competition based on the existing salary for a Secretary General, we were likely to attract serving assistant secretaries in the Civil Service or people at that level, or even lower in the private sector.  Whether fortunately or unfortunately, the remuneration for these types of jobs in the private sector is higher.  The decision was made to increase the package, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform decided he was happy to do that but he did not want anything above &euro;300,000.  That was the rationale for coming in with a figure below &euro;300,000.</p></speech>

Scotland has a population of almost 6 million people.  In Finland, which has a population of more than 5 million, the secretary general of the department there earns &euro;131,000.  The Director-General of the World Health Organization is paid &euro;190,000.  The secretary general of the Department of Health and Social Care in England, which is in the middle of an almighty crisis with Covid and is trying to keep the National Health Service, NHS, on the road over there, earns &euro;190,000.  Where did the figure of &euro;292,000 come from?  Surely to God it would be the job of senior civil servants involved in setting up this process to examine why these salaries in other countries.  How can Finland get the best people to work for &euro;131,000?</p></speech>

My parliamentary assistant found them out in one hour by looking at comparisons and double-checking them.  If I was going to employ an electrician in the morning to carry out work for me, surely I would get two quotations and have a look at the going rate for the job.  This is the top job at the Department of Health.</p> <p>  Was there any discussion of the potential knock-on effects on the pay of other Secretaries General at any of the meetings that were held?  I accept the argument that it is a very important Department - we all agree on that - but the Departments of Finance and Housing, Local Government and Heritage are now very important as well.  Will the Secretaries General of those Departments, and indeed the principal officers, the next in line down the chain, have their hands out now, while the clerical officers will languish on &euro;24,000?  Were the potential knock-on effects considered?</p></speech>

If we look at best practice, then surely the setting of compensation for a role is always a function of a process which is detailed, analytical and comparative.  From what we have seen and what Deputy Stanley spoke of earlier, there was no comparative benchmarking, little, if any risk analysis done on the impact of knock-on claims from other Secretaries General - I do not think that the Taoiseach simply saying that there will not be is enough, a risk analysis would have been necessary -  and no calculations have been provided as to how the &euro;81,000 pay increase was reached.  Does Mr. Fraser think that a process which does not have comparative benchmarking, no detailed risk analysis and no provision of calculations meets even the bare minimum acceptable standards in this process?   </p></speech>

There is no public service pay body.  All we can do is work on what we know.  What I know from my experience of the labour market, from being on TLAC, and my own experience is what I have said in the correspondence.  I outlined the four options to the Taoiseach and Minister and they chose the option we are discussing, then this figure was arrived at which was less than &euro;300,000.  I cannot tell the Deputy that there was some big process - there was not and we both know that.  It is a number less than &euro;300,000.  That is the number that was reached.  It is higher than the normal remuneration but is less than remuneration for other jobs in the public service, as the Deputy knows.  It is not unusual internationally for people to be paid different amounts to the standard.  I would be very much in favour - in fact I would love it - if there was a more scientific benchmarking of all this.  There is plenty of evidence that would be of great use to everybody and it would be easier for everybody - the Deputy and myself, to be honest - to do it properly.  Maybe that is something the committee would consider.  These things are ascertainable, there is no doubt.  I am sure from my experience of the Irish labour market, TLAC and all the rest that my analysis is right about the types of people who apply for these jobs.  I know it, that is all I can bring to the table.  I have nothing more sophisticated than that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.112" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Fraser" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021060200002#C00400"><p>I think so, yes.  I am not looking for any sympathy for the senior public service or anything like that, it is important to get the right people for these jobs.  I would really rather be talking about a proper benchmarked assessment of the labour market.  If my experience is wrong about what the labour market says for these jobs, I would be happy to be proven wrong, but I think it would be much better if there was proper benchmarking for these things.  People do it, I am aware of reports that suggest what the labour market is but I do not stand over them either.  Deputy Stanley listed a whole load of examples of much lower pay.  It may also be that is the case.  It would be much better if it was much more transparent and people could see the basis on which these judgements are being made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021060200002#C00500"><p>I thank Mr. Fraser.  I am in full agreement with him on that.  Over the past months, the key thing that has continually been used as reasoning for this pay increase was that first, it was commensurate with the scale of responsibility but as Deputy Stanley clearly outlined, people with similar jobs are on much less pay.  Also, as Deputy Stanley said, the Secretary General with responsibility for housing, Mr. Fraser himself and other Secretaries General have just the same scale of responsibility.  Then there was the idea that it was needed to attract international talent but ultimately, we had someone who was working for the State already, doing an excellent job where he was who was fully able and capable of taking on the job which he did.  He has stated clearly that he was happy to waive that increase and that he did not feel it was needed at this time.</p> <p>  I wrote to the Commission for Public Service Appointments on this matter on the basis that it is the regulator when it comes to public service appointments.  I understand Mr. Fraser is on its board.  I asked it about this because in many ways, the appointment ended up being a lateral move within the public service and we know that in respect of public pay, lateral moves should not mean any change in pay.  The commission has told me it was not appropriate for it to comment on this.  That is a matter for it to say, but can Mr. Fraser explain to me why he thinks the regulator might feel it would not be appropriate to comment on a matter pertaining to the regulation of public service appointments and how this differs from it not to be able to comment?  </p></speech>

I do not get to go to all the meetings so it may be that I missed the Deputy's correspondence.  However we got there, and the committee is clear how we got there, there was a full, open TLAC competition for this post, which was run by the Public Appointments Service, who are people of the highest integrity.  It has extremely clear rules and guidelines and a code of practice for these things.  All the candidates were treated exactly the same.  All the candidates got a fair shout at this and the person who got it, got it.  I completely understand why people query the remuneration decision but I have to say the Public Appointments Service process was 100% above board.  I cannot over-emphasise that service's integrity.  It is absolutely straight down the line.  Everybody was treated the same and everybody had to have the same chance of getting this job too, and they did - every candidate had the same chance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021060200002#C00700"><p>I want to be clear, because that is something that is repeatedly said back to me when I ask questions about this, I am in no way suggesting that this was not above board, that the person who was chosen should not have been chosen or anything of that sort.  The point is that we keep being told that this &euro;81,000 pay increase was needed and was the only way we could attract someone to the position, when there was someone who was happy and willing to do it at its original level.  It was someone who was already working within the State and I wish him all the best in the role.</p> <p>  Mr. Fraser has been clear that there should be transparency and accountability, which I welcome.  What procedural reforms would he recommend to improve transparency and accountability and to restore public trust?  The fact is, this has really angered people.  It was not something about which it was just within the bubbles of Leinster House that people were annoyed, it was felt on the ground and something that all of us as public representatives heard regularly, because people have struggled so much this year.   The sum of &euro;81,000 is a galling figure that clearly amounts to a massive pay increase.  We need to ensure that public trust around this is restored and we need more transparency.  What are Mr. Fraser's views on that?  </p></speech>

I know the Deputy knows that but in terms of public trust, in fairness to him as a civil servant, that is a decision he made voluntarily.  Ideally, if the issue is there is a question about whether the remuneration package for the senior civil or public servants is not getting the candidates we need, all we can do is have a transparent conversation about that.  The Top-Level Appointments Committee publishes a report every year, I think its latest report will be published in the next couple of weeks, and it goes through the process and its findings.  I am a member of it, so I know the debate.  It occasionally makes glancing remarks about the type of people who apply or how people feel about the job or whether remuneration is an issue or if there are other reasons that people do not apply, all of that debate.  I think it would be much better if there was a transparent process where there was a full assessment of the labour market, the candidates and the processes and to see whether we have issues.</p><p>There may be remuneration issues, and I believe there are in a very limited number of cases.  People may feel that jobs are too challenging or easy.  I do not know, but some of these jobs are difficult enough.  If someone examined this matter independently, we would all be in a much better place.  That examination should be laid before the D&aacute;il and debated and there should be a proper conversation about it.  I would much rather it if we did not need to have a conversation like this and if we did not have problems getting good people in certain areas, but we have had those problems.  Be it requested by the Government, the Oireachtas or both, there should be a professional and independent analysis of this matter and that analysis should be debated in the Parliament and the Government.  Everyone would then know where we were coming from.  That is what we should do.</p></speech>

I wish to pick up on a point he made in his closing remarks to Deputy Farrell's questions.  He stated that the current Secretary General had waived the salary increase.  However, that Secretary General has said that it was being waived until the economic conditions improved.  What defines that improvement?  Is it at his discretion?  Is it at the discretion of central Government, be that elected representatives or officialdom?  Is this a temporary measure?</p></speech>

While it was a meaningful and welcome gesture, who knows for how long it will continue?</p> <p>  I wish to follow up on a response that Mr. Fraser gave to Deputy Stanley.  Mr. Fraser stated that he did not believe there would be a knock-on effect, but surely the precedent has already been set so that, in the appointment of any future Secretary General by any Government party or the Government as a whole, this example will be cited.  Does Mr. Fraser not concede that this has set a precedent?  Once something is done, it can happen again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.121" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Fraser" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021060200002#D00500"><p>Anything can happen regardless of whether it has happened previously.  We have appointed four Secretaries General in recent months and two appointments are under way.  None of those positions is getting an increased remuneration.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is the one that people enjoy the most, is being advertised and is subject to a Top-Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, competition on the exact same terms.  When my term is up, I would be amazed if there was any change in the terms and conditions for my successor.</p> <p>  I do not believe this situation sets a precedent.  All the evidence shows it will not be.  Of course, people may be opportunistic, but I know my colleagues - I hope I do anyway - and I do not think that anyone would believe that the Department of Health was anything other than a special case, which is the basis of this decision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021060200002#D00600"><p>I am struck by the use of the term "amazed".  This is not reflection on Mr. Fraser or any of his colleagues.  As he rightly stated, the original allocation of salary, which has been policy for quite some time, is meant to attract people from outside the Civil Service who might be the most suitable.  While we all recognise that the Department of Health is a special case, surely Mr. Fraser's own position is also a special case as the most senior civil servant, and the same argument can be made whenever it goes out to competition.  There is an impression that we have had four appointments since in a politically charged atmosphere, but once a precedent is set, clarity should be given as to whether it remains a possibility.</p> <p>  My final question will be short.  We have spoken about the difference between an acting Secretary General and an interim one and, without naming them, the two individuals who held those positions in the Department of Health.  Will Mr. Fraser clarify who appointed the interim Secretary General who is now the Secretary General and what was the process put in place for that appointment?</p></speech>

The interim Secretary General was formally appointed by the Government.  The Taoiseach informed the Government of this transfer.  Really, these decisions are made by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the relevant line Ministers and, in this case, the party leaders in the coalition, but they are formally Government decisions because the person appointed has to become the new Accounting Officer of the Department.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Fraser.  As he will see from those two answers, it is impossible for this committee and the delegation from the Committee of Public Accounts to have the sort of transparent process needed to debate and consider these matters when the relevant Secretary General believes he has nothing to do with the process and the Taoiseach of the day has yet to respond as to whether he will participate in our discussion.  Although I am a guest of this committee, I know that, perhaps for the first time ever, the Taoiseach does not intend to present the Estimates for his own Department.  I believe the Minister of State will attend instead, which would be most unusual.  It is difficult for us to do our work as committees when the culture is one of circling the wagons, telling committees nothing and, if possible, not attending at all.</p> <p>  Is Mr. Fraser a member of the TLAC?</p></speech>

I must allude to questioning the then Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about a &euro;10 million mistake that was made by the Office of Public Works, OPW.  I questioned the then chief commissioner of the OPW as to whether there was a disciplinary process afoot because somebody had made such a mistake, which was the mis-measuring of Miesian Plaza.  Mr. Fraser may recall that.  I was told there was not a disciplinary process.  I put a question at the Committee of Public Accounts to the then Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I asked him if he was aware of this technical fault and if it was a matter of surprise to him that there was no disciplinary process afoot due to the negligent behaviour that lost the State &euro;10 million over the lifetime of the lease.  I will paraphrase his response, but it is an accurate description of what the then Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said.  He said we do not employ a "gotcha" culture in the Department and mistakes - given the questioning I was putting &ndash; such as the loss of &euro;10 million, was something to be learned from.  It would be a learning experience.  Is this what we can look forward to in the Department of Health?  I refer to the culture of people losing such money from basic banana maths type mistakes that cost the taxpayer &euro;10 million.  Are we paying someone &euro;292,000 a year who can look forward to a retirement package in the region of &euro;600,000, to uphold a culture which allows such losses from basic mistakes to be a learning experience?</p></speech>

Is it the case that he, as the Secretary General to the Government, supports a culture that sees loss of moneys due to mistakes as learning experiences, as was the case with the well publicised mistake by the commissioners in the OPW, relative to Miesian Plaza, which has realised a loss of &euro;10 million to the people?  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said we do not pursue a "gotcha" culture and it is a learning experience.  Now we have upped that person's salary by &euro;81,000 and asked him to take over a &euro;22 billion Department.  Is such a culture acceptable in the public service?</p></speech>

The head of TLAC, who wrote that the Civil Service is a game with no consequences went on to say the response to failure is "sideways moves" and "easy exits".  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform told me at the Committee of Public Accounts &ndash; the record will show it &ndash; that we do not have a "gotcha" culture.  In other words, it is okay in the context of the example I am using here, to lose &euro;10 million without anything other than for that to be a learning experience.</p> <p>  Is that the culture that Mr. Fraser would like to promote?  He is a member of TLAC, which presumably chose this candidate.  He is now in charge of the biggest budget we have, along with social welfare.  Is this the culture that is there?  Conor Brady is the independent chair of TLAC.  Mr. Fraser remembers a time when he was neither a member of TLAC nor its chair.  Was he right in his article or did he introduce reforms since he came in?</p> <p>  It gives me no pleasure to say that what I am hearing from Mr. Fraser now is that he is not the head of the Civil Service and there is no head of the Civil Service and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's attitude that losing money through negligence and mistakes is an acceptable culture and that we do not have a "gotcha" culture.

Mr. Fraser is not aware of it.

The Civil Service, that has nobody in charge and no head to it, has a culture as defined by a man to whom we are after giving an extra &euro;81,000, who has a retirement package worth in excess of &euro;650,000 and &euro;146,000 every year for the rest of his life.  He stated that it is okay to make mistakes, it is a learning experience and we do not have a "gotcha" culture.</p> <p>  We keep saying we cannot get talent.  Could I suggest, as my learned colleague and friend, the Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, stated earlier, that we might talk to the Brits about how they manage to recruit?  They recruited a head of the NHS.  I take issue with the Chairman, Deputy Stanley, on his figures being slightly wrong but in the same ballpark.  The head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, is paid &euro;242,962.15.  He is responsible for 1.4 million staff and many multiples of the budget of the HSE.  The permanent secretary at the Department of Health in the UK, Chris Wormald, has 2,160 staff, as opposed to our Department of Health, which has approximately 600, and he is paid &euro;214,920.17.  We just cannot find people.  Mr. Fraser is on TLAC.</p></speech>

I believe the Government was presented some time ago with a Public Service Pay Commission report, which suggested that there be some sort of transparent higher remuneration in the public service.  This includes, obviously, senior politicians as well.  The Government decided not to set it up.  I cannot remember.  I can come back to the Deputy with the details on that.  To go back to Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell's point, I think it would be much better if there was an independent assessment of the evidence base for these decisions.</p></speech>

It is not rocket science.  When one civil servant who is already in receipt of substantial remuneration transfers from one Department to another and secures a salary increase of &euro;81,000, it is pretty standard and obvious that this is not normal or transparent.  I ask again if Mr. Fraser is aware, particularly as a member of the TLAC, of a process in which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform carried out any scrutiny of this salary increase?</p></speech>

One that I really recall was the HSE CEO competition.  We had a situation where we got nobody appointed in the end and had to rerun the competition with an increased remuneration package.

Basically, I had to advise the Taoiseach and the Ministers about their various options for appointing a Secretary General and the various possible outcomes of each option, which I did.  That is in the note the Deputy has.  I had to take on a role of doing some more work on this with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and I am also on TLAC.</p></speech>

The process of TLAC is long enough and involves shortlisting, preliminary interviews, psychological tests and references.  There is a presentation interview.

What actuarial figures were put together to apply a differentiation on the basis of value for money between 23 candidates to state we could have somebody internally at a particular cost or externally at a particular cost?  I very much fail to believe we did not have anybody of the calibre required in 23 applicants.  What was the cost differential?</p></speech>

This is public money.  We are here to ascertain how much.

They speak about how somebody on &euro;25,000 might see a 4% increase over the lifetime of that agreement.  However, we have this role, which is also a public role, for which we are looking at a 40% increase all of our sudden.  I have this concern about what message is being sent.  Mr. Fraser spoke about market sentiment and the factors that might influence those who apply or do not apply.  This is really a question for the Taoiseach about leadership and the Department of the Taoiseach with regard to the message it sends when we have this tiptoeing increase for those on lower incomes.</p> <p>  The wages of the secretarial assistants in the Seanad start at &euro;24,000.  They were told previously by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform there is a concern that if the figure were increased, it could send a politically negative message.  We have slow, incremental, tiny increases.  The goal, and the stated policy, has been that the unwinding of FEMPI would begin with those on lower incomes.  This would be the priority and it would send the signal and message we need to send to society.  Does Mr. Fraser see damage to this message when we see this large increase at the same time as we have these small measures?</p> <p>  I appreciate that we need appropriate people for roles.  I sat on a committee where the Data Protection Commission spoke about its difficulties in getting appropriate people to do its very important work because of the very rigid rules not at the top level but in the mid-level at which it hires.  These are all people who are staying within the scales of our public service.  Often, they have encountered real difficulties doing what they need to do, even within those scales.  We have seen those at the very bottom of scale getting paltry increases that will creep up and will not even match their rent increases.  Then we see this 40% spike.  Is Mr. Fraser concerned about the message this sends?  Does he see damage not just in the knock-on effect on claims?  We know of this because Mr. Fraser has already cited the CEO of the HSE and the Garda Commissioner as examples.  The very fact he is giving us these examples to justify this tells us there will be a knock-on effect at the top level.  Is he worried about the signal it sends to those on the lower incomes in our public service?</p></speech>

I share the concerns of the Senator as she has expressed them.  All I can say is I believe this is an exceptional situation.  I can only begin to explain it by reference to the overwhelming need we have to reform our health service, improve it and get better outcomes for people who need these services.</p><p>That is the rationale in the HSE.  It is a different rationale in the case of the Garda Commissioner.  These are such fundamental positions for the good of our citizens.  I understand what the Senator said, however.  Of course I do.</p></speech>

We see a great inflexibility between and within the layers.  I mentioned health.  In the case of the pay request for student nurses, for example, there was a conversation about whether there would be a knock-on effect and whether student garda&iacute; would also need it.  We have been hearing the knock-on argument used in relation to those on lower pay who are doing exceptional work in exceptional circumstances.  It is not enough to say that.  This is the Department of the Taoiseach - the leadership of the country - and there was a reason.  This is important.</p> <p>  I will go back to Mr. Fraser's specific role in relation to the pay commission.  The pay commission made a decision that the unravelling of FEMPI should begin from the bottom up.  That was a policy decision.  Does this case not contradict the decision that the restoration of public pay following that difficult period should begin from the bottom up?  Does it not contradict that policy?</p></speech>

As the Senator will be aware, there are very few people who have not had the pay cuts restored, all of whom are at the top of the system.  In that sense the policy has been fair.  This case is an exception and of course, it runs somewhat counter to that concept.</p></speech>

Mr. Fraser mentioned that he would like if there was a process in place.  That recommendation was made in 2017 or 2019.  There was a recommendation from the pay commission which Mr. Fraser is a member of that a new mechanism be put in place for senior pay.  The review body on higher remuneration in the public sector had been disbanded at the beginning of FEMPI.  Would it not be more important to send a signal of transparency?  Would it have been appropriate to seek to have the review body established and use that as a mechanism?  Mr. Fraser talked about giving advice on why we need to hike the payment for this particular role but he also told us he was not giving his personal advice in respect of implementing a transparent review body on higher remuneration.  Surely it would have been right and proper to put that body in place before making any radical or unusual decisions in respect of higher pay.  That does not mean one cannot recruit somebody under the current process or that one might not want to recruit someone for more pay but that a mechanism should have been put in place to do that properly.</p></speech>

There was a reference earlier to the Commission for Public Service Appointments, which is a new body.  The Ceann Comhairle and a couple of other people are members.  It is a little known body that deals with complaints about interviews, recruitment and stuff like that.<br/><br/>I am not on the pay commission and because the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is the Department in charge, I am not as involved in these matters as people think.  I am involved in this case because I tend to be involved in the creation of new Departments, moves by Secretaries General and so forth.  My role is limited.<br/><br/>Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell asked me a question and I gave her a truthful answer.

Given that Mr. Fraser is somebody who is being called upon in terms of his experience in this area, is that not advice that he could have given?  He informed us that this is his opinion but he also told us that he had not communicated that opinion in respect of the need for a review body on higher remuneration.  He would not have had to reinvent the wheel in that sense, in that a recommendation had already been made.</p></speech>

I am working from memory.  I was not involved in the formulation of that proposal; it was the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would have to check what the outcome of that was.  I have a memory that it was decided not to set up such a body.  It was not my decision but I have a memory that that was decided.  As I say, what we are talking about today only makes the point again that there should be some transparent way of looking at this.</p></speech>

All I can say is it is only justifiable if we can see really good improvements in our health service and much better use of resources.  That is the whole point of this appointment being made the way it was.  We will have to see.  There are so many challenges in health.  That is the rationale.

With respect, the single experience of recruiting for the CEO of the HSE is not a sufficient benchmark, rather than the many other benchmarks that have been offered from across Europe.  The reason I am highlighting the damage that is done by an increase of 40% is not to get Mr. Fraser to agree with me - he may recognise that it is damaging - but to highlight that the risk is not only the monetary amount that is lost but also the damage that is done in terms of engagement and faith in the social and economic dialogue on public pay.  That level of risk is the reason the rationale, which is still missing, is so important.  It would be great if we could see the rationale which says we cannot do this for the amount of &euro;211,700.</p></speech>

In the same way, the Senator was talking to the Data Protection Commissioner who will have a good idea of the type of people she can recruit at the type of remuneration she can offer.

The service will advertise in Ireland and in some of the better recognised international publications as well if those responsible believe it is suitable.  They will also advertise it with bodies that might have a familiarity with the area, depending on the job we are talking about.  They put it on forums like LinkedIn.  People also look for alerts on the PAS website.  It is rare enough, but sometimes we use recruitment agencies to drum up interest as well.  That did not happen on this occasion but we have done it in the past.  We certainly did it for the post of Garda Commissioner on one occasion but it is not generally the rule.  Generally, the Public Appointments Service tries to generate as much interest as it can for these posts at home and abroad.</p></speech>

I find it hard to fathom that someone at the centre of Government, as Mr. Fraser is, having been there for as long as he has, does not know some of the things that are going on.  This particular issue has gone on for some time.  In response to the question as to whether there will be knock-on effects from the increase the Secretary General has received, these individuals and others are now coming forward to say their jobs are also important.  They have written to the Department about the matter and received a dismissive letter from the Secretary General.  It is not right to say there will not be knock-on demands.  This particular demand is supported by a decision of the courts, which is approved under report No. 42 of 2007.</p> <p>  Mr. Fraser may not know about it and we will take it that he does not.  I ask him, therefore, as the secretary, if you like, to the Taoiseach and the Government, to take that up with the Department of Health and encourage resolution on behalf of those who are affected.  They seem to think a serious injustice is being done here.  They were fobbed off and told that, under FEMPI legislation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform cannot and will not do anything but the FEMPI legislation does not apply to the increase for the Secretary General.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I do not know whether FEMPI legislation still applies to that role.  I suppose it does, in a way, because it probably applies across the board.  As the Chairman knows, very few people are still subject to FEMPI legislation.</p> <p>  I genuinely do not know anything about the point the Chairman made.  The Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health are entire Government Departments.  I am happy to ask the question the Chairman has suggested.  I genuinely do not know the group to which the Chairman has referred.  It is obviously an industrial relations issue so I will-----</p></speech>

He is denying these workers the pay increase to which they are entitled.  Is it correct that FEMPI legislation did not apply to the increase the Secretary General received?</p></speech>

The Chairman is going to love me for saying this but the issue is dealt with by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and not by me.  It is complicated legislation.  It applies pay cuts to all civil servants, including new civil servants.  I do not know whether FEMPI legislation has an effect on that pay rise.  The fact that Mr. Watt waived the increase probably makes the question moot.  I will have to check that for the Chairman.</p></speech>

We do not know the position of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, because he did not reply.  The Taoiseach gave a very vague answer.  Other officials loosely pointed the finger at the Minister, Deputy McGrath.  It appears to me that it was certainly less than transparent.  Senior civil servants should have cautioned the Government about the road it was taking in this regard because it leads to demands from others for increases in their salary and some of those demands are rightly justified, such as in the case I just mentioned.  No one complained about it except to keep it under &euro;300,000 as that was probably the figure best palatable to the public.  That is what I am taking from the conversation.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has not yet decided to appear before the committee.  Mr. Brady is upset over some letter or other being published in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  In fairness to the Minister, Deputy McGrath, he has come before the committee and has been transparent about it.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, do not know.  No one seems to know anything.  Mr. Fraser has given it his best shot this morning and that is fair enough, but nobody seems to know anything and the committee is expected to accept that.  The Members of Parliament who pass budgets and go into detail on all these issues are expected to suck it up and get on with it, while those within the Department who have an issue in terms of their award of 5%, and others, are supposed to accept it as well.</p><p>There is a problem here in terms of how it is perceived.  There is a problem in terms of the necessary reform of TLAC and all those other organisations or committees or whatever they are.  I believe that reform should be driven by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Who would bother applying for a job when the outcome is that most of the jobs go to insiders?  Mr. Fraser is aware of an awful lot of what goes on in government.  He is there at the centre of things.  I will leave it at that but I agree with the sentiment expressed in this morning's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, that is, that something stinks at the heart of Government.  I think that is a fact.</p></speech>

There is a massive economic crisis yet we have this largesse in terms of the payment of salaries.  There is also the whole idea that, of all the Departments in all the world, a successful candidate could only be found in the Department in which the decision was made.  The circle of decision-making and benefit is so small in the context of this issue.</p> <p>  What is the salary ratio in the Department of Health?  What is the ratio between the highest salary and the lowest salaries in the Department of Health?</p></speech>

There are 3,000 people in the public service who are earning less than &euro;22,000.  Compared with the salary that was granted to the Secretary General, the ratio is 12:1, which is enormous.  In Nordic countries, for example, the ratio between the top salary and the bottom salary is 3:1, 4:1 or possibly 7:1.</p> <p>  Why was an increase of &euro;80,000 selected rather than one of &euro;70,000 or &euro;90,000?  From listening to the responses of Mr. Fraser, it seems the &euro;80,000 increase was plucked from the air to a certain extent.  It had no foundation in international standards with regard to salaries or anything.  Who originated the figure of &euro;80,000?</p></speech>

An international firm or a recruitment organisation seeking to put forward a package to select individuals who are the best people to do the job might go a little bit beyond a back of an envelope calculation with regard to the best way to attract those individuals.  Many people will find it shocking that this figure was literally plucked out of the air.</p><p>If any members of this committee were in ministerial roles, I would expect them to have a far better foundation in international recruitment statistics and metrics to allow them greater understanding regarding what figure to select.  It is mind-blowing that the figure was plucked out of the air in this situation.  It was reported that the information was given to the Cabinet orally and there is no paper trail.  Is that correct?  </p></speech>

Candidates are shortlisted and then preliminary interviews are held, and that is all done by the Public Appointments Service.  A secretary from the Public Appointments Service attends those interview boards and keeps all the paperwork.  Final interviews are then held.  Before those interviews, full psychological assessments are undertaken, which take three or four hours for each candidate, and reports are subsequently prepared.  References are then taken.  Candidates obviously must also submit their curricula vitae and application forms and they must then deliver a presentation to the Top-Level Appointments Committee.  That committee then interviews each candidate for up to an hour and each candidate is scored by the committee.  The committee then reaches its conclusion based on the whole process.  I can certainly get the Deputy information on the process.  Obviously, the scores for individual candidates are confidential, but that is how it works.</p></speech>

Whitaker is recorded, in a book, as saying something to the effect that there can be no greater priority than the restoration of senior civil servants.  I agree with him.  Theoretically, the Minister of the day is in charge.  However, the way the Ministers and Secretaries Acts are written means that Secretaries General are untouchable and hold all the cards.  It is a bit like a presenter on an RT&Eacute; programme.  One should not club the presenter because he or she can make you look bad.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Fraser for coming in today.  My questions are also brief.  Is it correct that no actuarial analysis was done of whether the appointment concerned was going to cost us much more if we appointed an internal candidate from the Civil Service?</p></speech>

I will give her a different answer this time.  If she is asking me when we make these appointments, TLAC makes appointments based on the published terms of a role.  The Deputy is correct that those terms are different depending on whether it is a serving public servant or not.  No decision is made by TLAC based on whether the person is from the public or private sectors.  In that sense, it is not as if TLAC says that a certain person is the best person for the job but that another person would be cheaper.  It does not do that and that is not how it works.</p></speech>

Would it not make more sense to do that, given that may be a very distinguishing factor?  I refer to how the public's money is spent.</p></speech>

I am also a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and we should be offering the best we can in respect of public expenditure.  The title of the Department is that of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  If nothing else, and if we cannot stop what has happened, we should most certainly be able to create a process whereby we have covered all the avenues now being discussed for use in the future.  I was in business for 30 years.  From what we have listened to today, it is beyond me to be able to understand that it appears we plucked a figure out of the sky in this regard.  The matter does not just end with that figure.</p><p>There is an actuarial process involved, if account is taken of the Civil Service pensionable interest with respect to the candidate who achieved the position.  It is in excess of hundreds of thousands of euro extra on top of what we think is the salary increase in terms of the cost to the Exchequer.  That has to be defined.  I would appreciate if that actuarial computation could be forwarded to this committee in order that we could review it.  I do not need to know who the other applicants were, but Mr. Fraser might set out that computation against that of one of the other applicants and show us the differentiation that would have applied.</p></speech>

As I said, at least he attended.  He did not avoid the issue.  We may not have liked some of the answers we received from him but at least he accounted for himself.</p> <p>  Regarding the issue itself, I believe reform is necessary.  His Department and the Taoiseach must drive that reform.  This was not a transparent process.  It has a created a major issue and damage for civil servants generally.  There is a certain truth in politicians being the glove puppets of the civil servants.  That is the way it appears to me.  Certainly, without a head person, someone who is over the Civil Service, it is easy to see how a strong character might get his or her way.  Reform is necessary.  We will revisit this in due course.

The Irish Cancer Society is pleased that the Joint Committee on Health is continuing to focus on the impact of Covid-19 on cancer services and cancer patients.  We are incredibly worried for current and future patients, as well as for those who provide their care.</p> <p>  Cancer is a disease where time matters, but hammer blow after hammer blow to cancer services over the past 15 months means that patients are not guaranteed to get the care they need when they need it.  Cancer is a continuum and Covid has disrupted every aspect of it, from screening to diagnosis and treatment.  International experts are warning that these disruptions will lead to an increase in cancer deaths over the next ten years.  We are here today, however, to tell the committee that if we act and put in place the right resources and make the right investments, we can reduce the level of suffering and loss that lies ahead.</p> <p>  GPs, our first line of defence against cancer, have been pleading alongside the Irish Cancer Society for anyone with niggling health concerns to seek medical advice during Covid.  Our research shows that one in four people did not go to see their GP in 2020, even though they said that they needed to.  Our most recent research, which was conducted in May, shows that one in six people reported that they are still choosing not to attend a GP with health concerns.  Our healthcare professionals are already seeing the results of people presenting later, with patients presenting at more advanced stages for certain types of cancer.</p> <p>  We are also seeing delays to diagnosis for symptomatic patients after they have been referred by their GPs.  The long waiting times that characterised public healthcare before the pandemic have been further compounded by Covid.  We do not yet have the full picture of the numbers of cancers that have gone undiagnosed during Covid, but figures from the national cancer control programme for the referrals to breast, prostate and lung rapid access clinics imply that diagnoses in 2020 were at least 10% lower than expected.  This means that potentially more than 2,000 invasive cancers went undiagnosed last year.</p> <p>  Covid is not the only enemy that cancer services are battling.  The devastating cyberattack on the HSE is crippling a system that was already on its knees.  In a tweet, St. Vincent's University Hospital has said that referrals to its skin cancer clinic were down by more than 90% due to the cyberattack.</p><p>Some rapid access clinics that we have spoken to report that the cyberattack has had a much worse impact on their services and patients than Covid.</p><p> As I speak to the committee, our health system is under intolerable strain.  Our cancer services are delivered by some of the most passionate and dedicated healthcare professionals in the world but members will hear from the IMO and the IHCA that our healthcare professionals are burned out.  Cancer patients are also at breaking point.  Every day on our support line, our cancer nurses hear the stress, anxiety and exhaustion in their voices.  For 15 months they have cocooned and socially distanced from their loved ones.  They have attended appointments and heard the worst kind of news completely alone.  They have recovered from surgery and attended chemotherapy and radiotherapy without anyone to hold their hand.  The psychological and emotional effects of Covid on cancer patients will stay with them and their loved ones for the rest of their lives.</p><p> While there has been a drop in cancer diagnoses in Ireland since the start of the pandemic, those cancers have not gone away.  They are hiding underneath the chaos that Covid has visited on an already overwhelmed healthcare system.  Those cancers will eventually surface, but for some, at a much later stage.  That means more difficult treatment options for patients, reduced survival rates and a devastating impact on our stretched cancer services.  We need to prepare for a surge in more advanced cases of cancer in the coming months and years.  At the Irish Cancer Society, we appreciate that the Government started to do that at the end of last year when it provided significant extra funding for the national cancer strategy in budget 2021.  However, much more will be needed in the years ahead.</p><p> We also need much better data to ensure we are tackling the right issues and investing in the right places.  We are in the Stone Age when it comes to collecting real-time information on cancer services.  That means we are fighting Covid and cancer blindfolded.  Therefore, I appeal to members to support the adoption of the individual health identifier across cancer services and the development of robust data systems to inform policy as a priority.</p><p> What we do today really matters to the future of cancer patients in our country.  This is an opportunity to blunt the worst impact of Covid and simultaneously revolutionise how we deliver cancer care.  We have made such advances in cancer care in this country in recent decades but, as things stand, our healthcare and social care systems are not ready for the cancer epidemic that is coming down the tracks.  We must act now and build a sustainable and resilient cancer service that can cope with the inevitable surge in cases in the years ahead.</p><p> Cancer screening needs to return to 100% screening capacity as soon as possible.  We need to establish diagnostic centres that can provide predictable and timely cancer diagnoses.  We need dedicated cancer infrastructure so that cancer services no longer have to compete against emergency and unscheduled care.  We need dedicated theatres, beds, day wards, ICU capacity, staff and equipment to ensure predictable pathways to treatment for cancer patients.  Underpinning this revolution needs to be a focus on our healthcare workers and future-proofing this vital workforce.  We need to rethink the way that cancer care is delivered, not just play around the edges.  There is so much to do and it must be done urgently.  With sufficient priority and investment, we can reduce the long-term impact of Covid on cancer services and stop lives being needlessly lost in every community in Ireland.</p></speech>

Up to 45,000 people in Ireland are diagnosed with cancer each year.  Approximately 9,000 people, or one in three deaths each year, are from invasive cancer.  While survival rates vary depending on the type of cancer, it is estimated that 190,000 people living in Ireland have survived cancer.  Early detection is key both to survival rates and to good outcomes for patients.  Delays in treatment can mean the difference between routine surgery for early stage cancer or more complex surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy at a more advanced and aggressive stage.</p> <p>  Covid-19 has had a significant negative impact on our cancer services, with patients presenting late or in some cases even declining appointments for fear of catching the virus.  In addition, social distancing and infection control measures have restricted both diagnostic and treatment capacity within the hospital system.  We have a growing backlog of patients waiting for urgent time-critical diagnostics services and treatment services, while, for reasons connected to the pandemic, our life-saving screening services are falling below annual targets.  The recent cyberattack on the HSE has compounded delays, with radiotherapy and screening appointments having to be postponed or rescheduled.</p> <p>  On diagnostics, in March and April 2020 during the first wave, rapid access clinics for breast and lung cancer saw referrals fall by a third and referrals for prostate cancer fell by half.  While referrals have recovered, they remain significantly below 2019 levels, particularly for lung and prostate cancer.  Many patients have also experienced delays in accessing services.  In September 2020, just 60% of new patients attending rapid access breast, lung and prostate clinics were seen within the recommended timeframe.  More recent figures show that for the first three months of this year, 450 people per month were not seen within the recommended four weeks for an urgent colonoscopy.</p> <p>  Treatment activity has also declined.  Figures for 2020 show that activity in medical, radiation and surgical oncology services fell well below the equivalent 2019 levels, despite the fact that demand for services is predicted to increase by 5% per annum.  Chemotherapy activity in 2020 fell 12% below 2019 levels, while radiation therapy fell 10% below and urgent cancer surgery cases in public hospitals fell by 24%, although some of this decline was offset by surgery performed in private hospitals.  Data gathered by the faculty of pathology in the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in the March to June 2020 period, show that there were 668, or 12.5%, fewer cancer resections performed.  That is the surgical or precision removal of a tissue or organ that has cancer in it.  Non-urgent cancer care has also declined.  In 2020, there were 36,120 fewer elective cancer admissions compared with 2019.  Since pre-Covid times, the number of people waiting more than three months for a gastrointestinal endoscopy service has doubled to 23,800.</p> <p>  Our cancer screening services have also been affected.  They were paused in March 2020.  CervicalCheck and BowelScreen resumed in the summer of 2020, while BreastCheck resumed in October 2020.  However, as a result, all screening programmes still fell far below their annual targets for 2020.  The full impact of Covid-19 on cancer care has yet to be assessed.  However, without urgent investment, we will be dealing with a backlog of patients with much more complex and advanced stage cancers for years to come, with all the complications and side effects they will have.</p> <p>  The IMO recommends that we urgently invest in a national public health messaging campaign to help patients identify the signs and symptoms of different cancers, as well as encouraging individuals to visit their GP at the first sign of symptoms and to attend for hospital appointments.  These messages should be communicated widely.  It needs to be emphasised that patients will be cared for in a safe environment.  National cancer screening programmes should be fully reinstated.  We need an urgent and rapid expansion of access to diagnostic infrastructure, including radiography, endoscopy and laboratory services.</p> <p>  To date, there has been no assessment of diagnostic requirements to deal with our growing population, let alone the requirements to deliver this service under pandemic conditions.  Cancer care is multidisciplinary, with patients requiring input from a range of different specialties involved in diagnosis and treatment and depending on the type of cancer diagnosed.  Consultants are working flat out to catch up but we need to increase the number of consultants across our services, including specialists in diagnostic and clinical radiology, pathology, haemotology, radiation and medical oncology, colorectal surgery, urology, and ear nose and throat.  Some one in five consultant posts are unfilled on a temporary basis, while between 1,600 and 2,000 additional consultant posts are required to meet current population needs.</p> <p>  In addition to employing consultants, we need to increase capacity across the system including, staffed theatre space and additional ICU, inpatient and day case units.  There is no point in employing a surgeon if he or she does not have an operating room to work in.  We need investment in secure IT systems, including investment in electronic health records and the roll-out of the unique patient identifier.</p><p>Additional supports are required to support follow-on care in general practice for cancer patients, where appropriate.</p></speech>

The IHCA represents 3,200 hospital consultants, approximately 95% of the total in Ireland.<br/><br/>As Ms Power has articulated so well, there can be no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic has caused delayed diagnosis and suboptimal care for people with cancer.  As some cancers develop slowly, the impact of the pandemic on cancer cases and deaths will not be clear for many years.  There is a grave and realistic concern that these delays in diagnosis and treatment will lead to increased cancer mortality over the next decade or more.<br/><br/>Growing waiting lists, a low number of consultant posts on a <i>per capita</i>basis and vacant posts will severely limit the wider health system's ability to catch up after Covid and the cyberattack.  In excess of 11,600 more people were waiting for an inpatient day case gastrointestinal, GI, endoscopy at the end of April compared with before the pandemic, an increase of 51%.  Colonoscopies are the gold standard of diagnosis for bowel cancers.  Pre pandemic, urgent referrals were seen within one month, but now 60% of referrals are waiting longer than three months.  This significantly increases the risk of delayed diagnosis of cancer in these patients.<br/><br/>Difficulties in getting timely access to consultant appointments, diagnostics and tests to monitor cancer treatment response, regression or progression and to treat patients with other conditions were a problem prior to Covid, but the situation has deteriorated sharply.  Unfortunately, the HSE's cancer services were already missing targets for cancer referrals, assessments and admissions in 2019.  What is new is the scale of the growing waiting list crisis and the backlog of care that has accumulated in all specialties.<br/><br/>The cyberattack on the HSE and its public hospitals has had a devastating impact on the health service's ability to treat and manage not only those suffering from cancer, but all patients.  It has especially impacted on patients awaiting medical and surgical assessment and results of biopsies, scans and other investigative procedures.<br/><br/>As we recover from Covid and the cyberattack, hospital management must work with consultants to design solutions to address the large backlog and other service delivery constraints that have been known about for more than a decade.  The filling of one in five vacant permanent consultant posts and the appointment of additional hospital consultants on terms to be agreed with the association is the key enabler that is required to tackle the unacceptable waiting lists and the backlog of an estimated 700,000 fewer hospital appointments last year due to the pandemic and the expected reduction of 200,000 this year.  The fact that the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, could only outsource approximately 7,000 scopes for patients in 2020 highlights that it is not the magic bullet the Government believes it to be.  Expansion of public hospital capacity, including additional consultants and physical capacity, represents the effective sustainable solution.<br/><br/>Regarding the shortage of consultants, the failure to fill the one in five permanent specialist consultant posts that are vacant in our public hospitals is undermining public hospital capacity to provide high-quality and timely patient care.  In addition to filling the vacant posts, our public hospitals need to appoint more specialists, as we have the lowest number on a <i>per capita</i>basis in the EU.  In cancer services, for example, there will be a need over the next eight years for Ireland to increase the number of medical and radiation oncologists by 111% and 72%, respectively.  Meeting this level of staffing will require the recruitment of 73 additional oncologists, that is, the creation of and recruitment for an average of ten additional cancer specialists per year between now and 2028.  Overall, an increase of 1,653, or 53%, in the number of consultants working in acute hospital specialties is required by 2028 to address current shortfalls and meet increased patient demand.  That is in addition to filling existing vacancies.<br/><br/>There are a record 883,000 people now on some form of NTPF waiting list due to hospital consultant vacancies and other capacity deficits.  This is an increase of 45,000 so far in 2021.  More than 21,000 patients are now waiting longer than one year for essential hospital treatment, representing a 70% increase.  In addition, more than 200,000 people are waiting for diagnostic scans such as MRIs, CTs and ultrasounds, with a quarter of these waiting for longer than one year.  They are not on any NTPF list, so public hospital waiting lists already exceed a million people waiting for hospital treatment.  Coupled with the backlog of 900,000 fewer hospital appointments in 2020 and 2021, there is a high risk that these delays will cripple public hospitals and the health system.  Failure to address these issues urgently will lead to impaired patient outcomes, a scenario that the Government has a duty to avoid.<br/><br/>Ireland has one of the lowest acute hospital bed capacities in the EU and the highest hospital bed occupancy rate in the developed world.  Considering these and other factors, the IHCA recommends that a minimum of 6,000 additional public hospital beds must be funded in a revised national development plan, which is due in July, in order to reduce bed occupancy rates, operate with appropriate infection controls, including single occupancy rooms, and deliver more timely, safe care.  This is in contrast with the increase of 2,600 acute beds included in the 2018 plan.<br/><br/>It is essential that we expand and develop additional protected elective-only surgery facilities across our hospitals rapidly.  While plans are being advanced for the three elective hospitals in Cork, Dublin and Galway, it is known that it will take time before they are operationalised and it is not expected that this expansion will be sufficient.  We believe that dedicated theatre and bed capacity to deliver elective scheduled care must be expanded across our acute hospital base, not just in three locations.  The recently opened day surgery centre in Tallaght hospital and the additional theatre and related facilities in Croom are practical examples of what can be delivered to expand capacity.<br/><br/>A national electronic health record is a vital part of an efficient and effective health service.  It needs to be properly planned, resourced and implemented without delay.<br/><br/>Ireland trains enough doctors every year, but they are leaving for or remaining in other English-speaking countries because they are not being treated in an equitable manner here and their working conditions are much better abroad.  Our highly trained specialists will remain in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US or they will practise outside the public hospital system in Ireland unless the Government ends the 2012 inequity and ensures our public hospitals' capacity deficits are remedied.  These are the basic essentials that are required to ensure that our public hospitals recruit and retain the talent we need.  This is vital if the country wants an effective public hospital service, particularly as medical and surgical care are evolving at pace.  We need an environment that supports hospital consultants who provide the essential care to treat patients successfully.  We also need an environment where there is demonstrable equity of treatment for consultants who have taken up contracts since 2012 as was unambiguously committed to by the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, last October.  The Government's failure to address the recruitment crisis and restore pay parity is driving our highly trained specialists abroad and exacerbates the extremely challenging task post Covid with the significant backlogs and waiting lists across all specialties, including cancer.<br/><br/>In conclusion, our ability to respond to the backlog of care that has built up involves many factors, with recruitment of consultants and physical capacity being the principal two.  Without addressing these twin deficits, the structural mismatch between capacity and demand will continue to increase waiting times rather than decrease them.  We are, like Tennyson, climbing the ever climbing wave.  The solution is obvious: we simply must appoint additional consultants on terms to be agreed with the association.  This action now will prevent the current crisis from continuing for the rest of the decade and beyond.</p></speech>

It has been challenging for everyone in the healthcare sector, especially those on the front line.</p> <p>  We have had to deal with the cyberattack recently and with Covid on an ongoing basis, but if the IHCA was in charge over the next six months, what would it prioritise in order to fast-track some of the backlogs?  What action can be taken by the Minister and the HSE over the next six months?</p></speech>

In cancer care, we need to prioritise access to the diagnostics and surgeries that patients need.  We must rapidly increase our diagnostic capacity in terms of radiology and laboratory specialties and improve theatre access for cancer surgeons.</p><p>We have to reopen our hospitals after Covid and the cyberattack, which will be very difficult.  The cyberattack has set us back months, not weeks.  It will take months to recover from the cyberattack in the context of diagnostic specialties.</p><p> In summary, we need to get over the immediate crisis of the cyberattack and the disastrous effect it has had, improve our capacity in terms of diagnostics, radiology, laboratories and endoscopy and increase our theatre access.  There is no quick fix here but we must put a plan in place because, otherwise, we will be treading water for a long time.  Our worry is we do not see a plan from the HSE or the Department of Health to get us out of this.  We are available to discuss this with them but there seems to be no focus on how we will get out of this at a departmental level.</p></speech>

Where could immediate action be taken?  I know we have to deal with the computer issue first and that has to be resolved, but what five or six other issues would the IHCA highlight to assist in dealing with the backlog?  Has the association communicated to the HSE what needs to be immediately prioritised?</p></speech>

The HSE is a massive centralised bureaucracy that hinders fast and effective decision-making.  The responses to the Covid crisis and to the cyberattack have shown that when local hospital managers and clinicians are empowered, they will come up with solutions.  We have to empower local decision-making at a clinical level.  That is one of the first steps I would take.</p> <p>  At ministerial level, we have to recruit more consultants.  It is a scandal that we have the lowest number of hospital consultants in the EU.  We have to attract and employ more hospital consultants.  The Minister must immediately regain trust with hospital consultants by resolving the pay disparity, which will allow us to recruit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.510" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gabrielle Colleran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060200002#D00400"><p>It is important for people to understand the impact of the cyberattack on cancer services.  We are having issues with accessing prior results and imaging.  We have not been able to deliver our multidisciplinary team meetings, at which we discuss radiology, pathology and clinical updates and decisions are made, for the past three weeks.  That all causes delays in treatment and, ultimately, impacts on prognosis, so addressing the cyberattack is key.</p> <p>  What we have learned from Covid is that when local decision makers are empowered, such as the doctors within specific hospitals in Wexford, Galway and Limerick, they know where the capacity deficits are and where the blocks in the system are.  In the pathway, as Ms Power articulated well, the patient first has to present to the GP, who then has to refer him or her on, and the referral has to be promptly seen.  The patient has to get access to the radiology, biopsies and diagnostics and the space has to be available in theatre.  There has to be a bed in ICU for someone to return to afterwards and then there has to be a spot in the day ward for chemotherapy.</p> <p>  There are so many potential places where we can have a gap or a backlog, and it is the people on the front line who know where that specific local gap is and can say what is needed, such as more radiologists or radiographers in order that the diagnostic scans can be processed.  They will know where the backlog is in Wexford or Galway, for example.  It is about empowering local clinicians to put in those fixes because they know where the blocks are locally.  That is how we can make the fixes specific to the areas.  A blunderbuss central approach is too slow and too reactive.  We saw that during Covid and again following the cyberattack.  It is about empowering and giving the resources to the people on the front line who can offer the solutions.  That is how we will provide excellent outcomes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.511" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Denis McCauley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060200002#D00500"><p>To respond to the question about bullet points for the Department for the next six months, in the context of the patient journey from developing symptoms to cancer being diagnosed through screening and then treatment, the important message for the HSE is that we in general practice have found that people are presenting later.  There is still a fear of going to see the GP.  General practice is open and we advise people that if they have symptoms, they should not delay but see their doctor.  That is one roadblock that is easily overcome by simple messaging.</p> <p>  The major roadblock relates to a worried patient or a patient who has had something seen on a screening test actually having the test.  According to the figures, the delay in diagnosis is the major primary issue.  There are many bumps on the road but the diagnostic aspect is vital.  The waiting lists for endoscopy have increased such that the number of patients not being seen within the defined period of appropriate time has increased from 15 per month before the Covid crisis to 450 per month, a factor of 30.  People who should be getting urgent assessment, therefore, are not getting urgent assessment.  I would concentrate on that.  All politics is local.  The endoscopy list in Letterkenny is one of the longest in the country, even though we have one of the smallest populations.</p> <p>  It is about the messaging to encourage people to see their GP, as well the roadblock in cancer diagnosis.  If I were to go down one road, I would address those issues first.</p></speech>

I am very unhappy with what Sl&aacute;intecare has proposed, namely, a day facility, six days a week, 50 weeks a year, with no reference to beds.  Do our guests and others on the front line believe that what is being proposed in Sl&aacute;intecare is adequate if we want to expand those services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.513" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Clive Kilgallen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060200002#D00700"><p>I support everything that has been said by the other guests.  My job and that of my colleague Professor Landers involves looking down microscopes and diagnosing cancer.  We are in the thick of it.  We know what is going on and we talk to our clinical colleagues.  One story they tell us is that patients are presenting late because they have been at home worried, which goes back to what Dr. McCauley was saying.  We need a public health programme to tell patients that if they are at home and have symptoms, they will be cared for and that it is safe for them to come to the hospital environment and be seen.</p> <p>  One issue with cancer surgery is that it is more complicated than the simple elective surgery for, say, a hernia, so the backlog will need complicated surgery.  In some units throughout the country, surgeons have access to surgery for only about half a day a week.  Imagine if a senior plasterer or master craftsperson was allowed to work for only half a day a week.  I know what the response in north Dublin would be.  That has to change.  Surgeons need to have access to theatre space to do their work.  This is so frustrating.  They are becoming deskilled and worried and they want to leave for the private sector.  On the issue relating to elective work proposed in Sl&aacute;intecare, there obviously needs to be room for less complicated surgery but there also needs to be provision for "bigger" surgery for cancer, and that may require intensive care units.</p> <p>  In regard to local responsibility, where I work at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, centre at Beaumont Hospital we have access to some elective beds.  In skin cancer and plastics, that comes through and we are really busy in that regard.  Where there is capacity to perform to look after patients and carry out complicated surgery, patients are seen.  Professor Landers and I look at and diagnose the slides under the microscope and then also deal with the cancerous section specimens.  The faculty of pathology at the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland is working to examine the cancer biopsies and cancerous sections.  Every time a patient has a new cancer, he or she has to have a biopsy, and when he or she has a cancer removal, he or she has to have a cancerous section specimen.  All those data are examined at the Royal College of Physicians and it will produce a report in two or three weeks that will show exactly what has been happening since Covid, mathematically, down to the last histological slide.</p></speech>

There are examples of great innovation happening and if we look at what is happening in the area of endoscopy there is an opportunity to try out the list that exists at the moment as well just to ensure that those people who require the most urgent care are getting it.  There is a plan to supply fit tests to routine patients.  As was outlined earlier, the waiting list is extremely long.  People have been waiting considerable periods.  That would help prioritise the patients.</p> <p>  Other aspects of endoscopy have not been funded, such as advanced nurse practitioners who could play a key role in this.  There are also a number of capital projects.  Dr. McCauley mentioned that Letterkenny is on the list of capital projects.  It is really important that those get funding.  It is an opportunity for innovation but those examples of innovation also need to have a sustainable funding footing to ensure they can have the impact that they should.</p></speech>

It is difficult to try to chair it on Teams.  I ask everybody to bear with us and hopefully everybody who wants to come in will get in.</p></speech>

To get in as many questions as I can, I will direct my questions to the individual witnesses.  I will not need everybody to answer the same question, but if somebody has a point to make that will obviously be fine as well.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Power for her powerful opening statement.  I echo the call that was made for a strong public health campaign and a strong public health message that if people have a concern or if people have symptoms, they should go to their GP.  That needs to be a very strong message coming from the meeting.  After today's session perhaps the committee could issue a statement calling for that because it is a really important point.  If people do not go to their GP, they will not be able to get the rapid access to the diagnosis and treatment that they need.  That is an important point for the committee to make.  </p> <p>  We know that screening services were curtailed in 2020, which was very difficult.  Ms Power said that a reduction in screening can have an impact on cancer burden.  Specialists would also say that cancer screening is not a substitute for a diagnosis and people obviously still need to go and get a diagnosis.  However, screening plays a significant and important role.  Would Ms Power like to see additional capacity or maybe the rebooting or restarting of screening services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.517" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Averil Power" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060200002#E00400"><p>The Deputy is correct about the public health campaign.  We have partnered with GPs over the past year in encouraging people to go to their GPs.  We will keep doing that and it really is the most important message.  If people have worrying symptoms, such as unexpected weight loss, bleeding or a lump, the chances are it will not be cancer but it could be.  If it is, it is critical that it is identified as early as possible so that people can get into treatment.  With cancer timing is everything.  The earlier it is diagnosed, the better the treatment options are.  They are less severe, the impact on patients' quality of life is much less and their chances of survival are greater.  The Deputy is correct that this is a key issue.  It would be great if the committee were to send a strong message today to encourage people to present to their GP with any niggling concerns.</p> <p>  Regarding screening, most cancer diagnoses come through the diagnostic services.  Most cancer diagnoses are picked up where somebody either attends at GP or an emergency department with a concern and then is referred through the pathways that were mentioned earlier and identified as having a cancer.  Screening is also important in picking up precancers and in some cases cancers in the population of people who feel healthy, those who are not experiencing symptoms and think they are healthy.  Through our screening programmes, for example through CervicalCheck, we can identify precancerous changes long before they go on to become problematic.  That is why it is so important for people to attend their screening appointments.</p> <p>  It was really disappointing that screening had to be paused during the pandemic and a substantial backlog has built up.  To clear that we need not just to return to the capacity that we had prior to the pandemic but to increase capacity so that we are able to get through that backlog as soon as possible.  Pausing for the kind of period that we have had is problematic.  The diagnostic services are at greater risk because of people with symptoms who are much more likely to have cancer but when screening is paused we are losing out on people who would have been identified really early and would not have developed cancer at all.</p></speech>

Diagnostics is one of the most important steps in treating cancer patients.  Rapid diagnosis is important.  The IHCA, IMO and the Irish Cancer Society have referred to increased investment in diagnostics which is important.  The society mentioned having established diagnostic centres for cancer.  Does the IHCA support that?</p></speech>

If there is not enough capacity in the system and we have something like a pandemic or when the needs for unscheduled care at acute hospitals increases, there will be an impact on access for cancer patients.  Ireland has had great success with cancer care through the establishment of specialist cancer centres.  We need to continue that model.  We need to ensure, as Professor Landers and Dr. McCauley have outlined, that at every step in the pathway we have enough capacity.  When patients go to their GPs, the GPs need to be able to refer on promptly to the-----</p></speech>

We do not have enough consultants.  We field half a team every day and we do amazingly well for the number we have.  However, as we have the lowest number of consultants <i>per capita</i>, it affects how early people can be seen in outpatient settings.  We just do not have enough staff on the team.  Equipment is also an issue, as we have highlighted many times.  We need enough investment so that we have the most up-to-date machinery.  We always need to fight for a new CT scanners and new MRI scanners.  The MRI scanner in Temple Street Hospital is 22 years old this year and is on its last legs.  Many scanners around the country are like that.<br/><br/>The standard of care in other European countries is such that they would be automatically replaced after ten years.  We constantly need to fight for things that are routine in other countries.  Of course, if we do not have enough staff and if our equipment is out of date, and if we do not have enough equipment or enough staff, that will impact access.  Everybody having access within six weeks feels like a pipe dream at the moment.</p></speech>

The IMO and the IHCA referred to the impact the cyberattack has had on cancer care.  It seems to have had an even greater impact than Covid, which is extraordinary.  I ask him to give us a flavour of what is happening on the ground.  He works in University Hospital Waterford, which is a cancer centre.  Many services there have been affected from diagnosis through to various treatments.  What types of problems has the cyberattack caused for those who are trying to provide cancer care in acute hospitals?</p></speech>

The cyberattack has had a devastating impact.  It brought us to a standstill.  Everything we do is IT dependent and IT driven, which meant that we had to stop.  Our laboratories went from processing 150 tissue samples a day down to three, four or five tissue samples a day.  With those that we are processing, the risk of a mistake is red hot.  Many of our IT systems are installed to help us prevent mistakes, but these are missing.</p><p>It is like driving a car without a safety belt or airbags.  It will take months, not weeks, to recover.  Patients will have operations and their diagnoses delayed and there is a risk that the diagnosis would be wrong.  I am sorry to say that but it is a fact.  We just do not have the safety systems in place to deliver safe diagnoses at the moment.  This has had a worse impact on diagnostic services than Covid-19.</p></speech>

In Professor Lander&rsquo;s professional opinion, is that a view that he would support?</p></speech>

The effects of this will be seen in five, eight, ten or 15 years where patients are just not getting the diagnosis or starting treatment as early as they should be.  The effects will be seen far into the future.</p></speech>

One is for Professor Landers and the other for Dr. Kilgallen.  Addressing Professor Landers on the issue of elective-only hospitals, this is something I support and will have an impact in reducing waiting times but it is not a substitute for investing in elective capacity in other hospitals in the State.  Professor Landers is based in the south east and others will give examples across other regions.  How important is it as we move to elective-only hospitals - the point was also made by our first questioner as to whether there should be beds as part of those hospitals - to stress that it cannot be a substitute for increased capacity for electives in other acute hospitals, especially regional hospitals?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.528" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Robert Landers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060200002#F00500"><p>That is a good question.  We need to be very careful here and to differentiate between protected elective capacity and elective-only hospitals.  The elective-only hospitals is not necessarily a model that the IHCA would support.  The current model, as proposed, which is to have three elective hospitals in the country, is flawed.  It is not adequate geographically to expect the patients of the country to go to three elective centres in Cork, Dublin and Galway for all elective care.  We feel that we would be better off putting protected elective capacity into our major hospital sites across the country.  In that way all of the expertise would be on the one site and we would be able to attract and retain a higher quality of staff because of the breadth of service that we would provide.</p> <p>  The other worry among consultants on the ground is that the proposed elective-only hospitals do not have adequate ICU facilities to deal with the higher risk patients.  They are still going to have to be looked after in the major hospitals.  We strongly feel that we would be better off putting protected elective capacity into our existing centres.</p></speech>

This is also supported by the IMO.  He said that there needs to be an agreement on hospital consultant contracts on terms that are agreed by the IHCA, which I assume he would also agree with from the point of view of his own organisation, the IMO.  Has there been any negotiations with the Department, the HSE or the Minister on new contracts for dealing with the existing pay inequalities in consultant contracts in recent times?</p></speech>

We have only received the draft contract very recently.  Discussions have started but they are at a very early stage.  It is very important to understand for everybody that the healthcare system in our nation is very complicated and changing the contract of one group is not going to be the answer for everything.  We need more consultants employed on a contract that is fit for purpose and will meld into what is happening and allow them to be attracted back, which is of great importance.  The post-2012 consultants whose pay scales were reduced over and above other public sector workers has been a significant issue and has been one of the factors in recruitment and retention.  Certainly the IMO, IHCA and HSE all want the same thing.  We want more doctors working and seeing more patients.  That is what we want to do.  Surgeons love doing surgeries, endoscopists love doing endoscopies and so on.  We want to be allowed to do what we have trained to do which is to see and care for our patients.</p></speech>

They certainly paint a very stark picture of the impact and devastating double blow from both the pandemic and the cyberattack.  They have all, I believe, referred to the fact that pre-pandemic, there were major shortcomings and under-resourcing in cancer services in any event.  Our witnesses I am sure can gather from committee members that we are very keen to take a practical approach to this to see what can be done in the short to medium term.  The point that was made by Dr. Kilgallen on public health messaging is the key one that I support.  The Chairman also pointed out that the committee needs to work on that straight away.</p> <p>  There are obviously much more fundamental issues involved, which I will come to in a moment.  </p> <p>  What is the current position on the cancer strategy and its governance?  There was a sense a number of years ago when the strategy was agreed that there was strong leadership on it.  Has that fallen away now?  Why is it that each of our witnesses individually representing their different sectors have to lobby for proper investment?  Is the governance of the cancer strategy inadequate at the moment?</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for her question and for raising the national cancer strategy.  It is very important that we do not lose sight of it.  We are in this mire because of Covid-19 and we are also supposed to have a long-term national plan to improve our cancer services.  From the Irish Cancer Society&rsquo;s perspective, significant progress was made under the previous two strategies, which increased investment in the centralisation of services and greatly improved outcomes for patients.  There is still a gap.</p> <p>  We were delighted when this national cancer study was published because there was a commitment to address the remaining gaps and bring cancer services up to a world-class standard.  Lack of investment has been the problem.  We are now a number of years into the strategy and last year was the first time, which we very much welcome, that the Government put very significant investment into the national cancer strategy.  In the previous two budgets there was next to nothing and as a result things did not move.  </p> <p>  The other difficulty from our point of view is monitoring progress because the data are not available for us.  We go to great lengths in this area and my colleague, Ms Morrogh, can speak more to that issue on the lengths that she goes to try to get data from the National Cancer Registry Ireland, the National Cancer Control Programme, hospitals and different places to see if key performance indicators are being met.  There are no ready sources of data to do that.  As with any plan, it is very difficult to see if it is being implemented or if the resources are going to the right place if we are not collecting the data to hold the Government to account on it.  We are investing and have a research call going out shortly where we are going to try to do that but it should not be up to the Irish Cancer Society to do this.  If the committee can impress upon the Government and the Department to step up, that would greatly help all of us, the committee included.</p></speech>

In summary, she said it was stark but in some ways, a great deal of good work is being done behind the scenes.  In the faculty of pathology, for instance, we have the histopathology quality assurance programme, where we look at all of the blocks and quality data.  That is one example of the quality initiatives that are happening behind the scenes almost under the radar and that are working very well.  It is stark but given the fact that our healthcare system was struggling previously and now we are hitting a crisis, this is the time to do a systems reset and to rethink what we are doing.  Let us do it as we know what we need to do.  We have the will and we need the capacity, we know what we need to do and now is the time to do it.  We can use this combined Covid-19 pandemic and cyberattack to do this.</p></speech>

A forum like this is a very good place where both parties can hear what is going on.</p><p>There are several issues.  One is obviously the investment, but there is also the idea of having local groups that are able to see and respond rapidly to what is happening around them.  Rather than being stuck by a nurse, they would be able to identify specific issues and move on them quickly.  They would not be able to solve everything but could identify cohorts of patients they could deal with immediately.  For example, there may be a waiting list in a breast cancer unit.  Not all of the people on this list may have obvious breast cancer but they may have breast pain or ill-defined symptoms and some will have cancer.  It is about being able to target and move on cohorts of this kind.  These groups are supposed to be able to respond rapidly within their local areas.</p></speech>

That is unbelievable in this day and age.  Can he identify the specific reasons for that?  Is it inadequate numbers of theatres or numbers of theatre staff?  What exactly is causing that incredible logjam in the system?</p></speech>

There was always a difficulty with surgeons getting access to theatre time.  I am on the consultant appointments committee and this is something that comes up in the meetings when we are looking at job specifications and proposed jobs plans.  Sometimes we look and see that surgeons only operate once a week and say that they should be doing more theatre time.  This is a thing on which we are always picking up.  Covid has made it worse in that the reconfiguring of hospital beds to allow for Covid areas has meant it is harder to get access to theatres.  Some theatre space has also been reconfigured into ICU space.  An existing shortage has been made worse by the Covid crisis and has really thrown a spotlight on it.  It is a matter of physical space, theatre nurses and staff; it is obviously not just a matter of consultants.  There is a particular problem with a shortage of theatre nurses.  That is a major issue.</p></speech>

Such projects also have to go ahead, but what can be done in the short to medium term to improve the situation.  I am trying to identify if there are issues there.  Dr. Kilgallen has identified problems with theatre staff.  There may also be organisational issues within hospitals.</p> <p>  I also want to raise the issue of diagnostics.  Several of our visitors have referred to this.  What can be done in the short to medium term to improve access to diagnostics?  Dr. Colleran said that buying services in from the private sector has not been that successful.  Are there proposals in this regard?  Perhaps Dr. McCauley will respond followed by Dr. Colleran.</p></speech>

On that matter, and going back to the national cancer strategy, we on the ground level can only look at the parameters of the performance measures that are in place.  I must admit that the overall governance arrangements are probably above us.  From a general practice point of view, the national cancer strategy had two main aspects.  One related to giving us access to more diagnostics.  Quite a lot of the time, we find we are taking up space in outpatient departments because we are referring people for tests.  We are actually quite good gatekeepers.  We give access to tests that we can make good use of, particularly if we get feedback on them.  The crisis has sometimes given us an unexpected pathway to diagnostics.  For instance, during the malware attack currently ongoing, we have been given direct access to MRI scans and CT scans and more access to ultrasounds.  That is probably a short-term <i>force majeure</i>measure but something like that would allow us to help in early diagnosis, taking pressure off of hospitals while ultimately increasing the health of the population.  From the point of view of the national strategy, we can only look at bits we can improve on in our own sectors.  That is one offshoot that has helped in that regard.<br/><br/>The other aspect of the strategy to consider from the general practice point of view is something like the chronic disease management model, under which GPs were to get involved in cancer aftercare.  That was a good idea which has run into the sand.  It is something the IMO promotes would take pressure off of the hospitals, giving them more of a chance to do acute work rather than chronic work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.542" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gabrielle Colleran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060200002#G00600"><p>To come in on the cancer strategy, it is a great strategy but the reality is that there has been no real funding for it until this year.  For it to succeed and be implemented, there must be year-on-year support.  The costs were clearly outlined at the time of the strategy's publication in 2017 but putting in the governance without the funding impairs success.  There is a need for separate infrastructural funding.  If the strategy is to be implemented properly, we need sustained funding.  When I say infrastructure, I am talking about dedicated beds, theatres and diagnostics.  Many of the recent increases in funding were required to increase resilience in the system that had been weakened by a lack of funding in previous years.  That was particularly necessary as a result of Covid.</p> <p>  With regard to diagnostics and how to increase access within our public hospitals, it is often the case in public hospitals that staff are willing to do evening or weekend lists but that the hospitals cannot get funding to pay radiographers time and a half to provide the service.  The public hospitals are told that staff have to do this at the basic rate.  One cannot realistically expect staff to do that in the evening and at the weekend when childcare costs are higher.  We have this awful situation whereby diagnostics are outsourced at a cost higher than that of paying agreeable rates locally.  That is a short-term measure.  The long-term and medium-term solutions are to get more radiologists and radiographers and to have more equipment.  In the short term, however, we could make better use of the scanners and staff we have by doing lists evenings and weekends.  The Haddington Road agreement and pay scales cause issues with such insourcing.  Insourcing takes away the quality issues that sometimes arise with outsourcing and address the issue of being unable to compare to priors.  As to the cost of outsourcing, it is cheaper to insource but we run into issues around pay scales.  If we could get a bit more flexibility in that regard, we could do more insourcing in the short term.  It is really critical that we do because the backlogs and waiting lists for diagnostic imaging are now very long.  </p> <p>  I will make that point again with special regard to children.  It is one thing to wait a year or two for an MRI scan when someone is 40 but if someone is four and waiting for an MRI scan for a scoliosis operation, he or she will not get on the waiting list for that operation until he or she has had an MRI.  Many of these children are having trouble with running around the playground.  They are breathless.  It really impacts their quality of life and their schooling.  As a State, we are really failing them.  We just have to do better.  It is just not excusable.</p></speech>

The original idea behind the cancer strategy was to cut through those blockages with strong leadership and to make things happen and move things along.  I am not aware of the cancer strategy operating like that at the moment.</p></speech>

We need to have enough integration with the central HSE to ensure the key performance indicators and standards are uniform across all hospitals while having enough autonomy locally to empower clinicians to address specific blockages locally.  That is what we are missing.  There is a command and control model and Covid has taught us that does not work.  What we really need is empowered local services.  Integrative autonomy brings us to the sweet spot at which we have both.</p></speech>

The Deputy may be aware of this report.  Of the strategy's 23 key performance indicators, 14 expired between 2017 and 2020.  Of the 14 targets associated with deadlines, there were no data available on eight.  That highlights what colleagues have said with regard to the lack of data.  How can we expect good-quality progress and real change for patients when we cannot even measure what it is we are meant to be doing?  We are now five years into a ten-year strategy.  The fact that there are no data available for eight key performance indicators that have expired is pretty revealing.</p></speech>

They paint a very stark picture with regard to the ongoing public health emergency.  Another emergency relating to another kind of virus is the cyberattack.  The health service needed that like a hole in the head.  It has caused a great deal of disruption in every sphere of the service.  It is very concerning.  I have a number of questions.</p><p>My first question is about the impact on cancer services during the ongoing public health emergency when the Government acted in respect of the availability of the private sector.  What impact did this have on cancer services in respect of diagnosis and the backlog prior to the public health emergency?  Would the witnesses see a basis for continuing this service through the public sector in respect of addressing some of the historical backlogs in cancer services?</p></speech>

In particular, we saw a lot of things like chemotherapy moving to private hospitals, which meant that we were able to provide safe Covid-free pathways for patients at the start of the pandemic.  It also helped to get some of the other lists down in areas like surgery and clear backlogs.  I will not comment on the commercial arrangements for that but I definitely think the more capacity there is for the system the better.  If there are ways of making good value-for-money arrangements with private hospitals and being able to have access to that capacity for public patients, that is a good thing, although Dr. Colleran's point about the advantages of insourcing is very well made.  Insourcing is obviously far better where that is possible.  It is much better to build capacity in our public hospitals.</p> <p>  That was just one thing.  Positive things have happened during Covid as well with the use of the private hospitals being one of them.  Other innovations that have benefited patients include things like chemotherapy in the community.  The Mater Hospital has a really good project delivering chemotherapy in Glasnevin.  There have been other innovations.  Where they have had that local autonomy that was mentioned earlier, our healthcare staff have really stepped up.  People have stepped up and found creative and good ways of delivering services.  Another thing that has worked well is giving more responsibility to nurses.  We have fantastic nurses in this country who are such an untapped resource, particularly compared with their colleagues overseas.  The advanced nurse practitioner posts were mentioned earlier.  We really need to invest in upskilling our nurses and giving them more responsibility and a key role to play because they are a key contact for patients and can really help to address some of the capacity issues relating to staffing in hospitals.</p></speech>

It concerns breast cancer screening, which is not available to the under 50s.  This was new to me.  A very good friend of mine under the age of 50 had breast cancer.  In the meantime, we put forward a motion in the D&aacute;il relating to breast cancer screening for the under 50s.  It is stark.  There are reasons it does not happen but I will give the reasons it should happen.  Breast cancer makes up 30% of all invasive cancers in women and there are around 30,000 cases of it per year while Ireland has the eighth highest incidence rate and the fifth highest mortality rate in the EU.  Why is breast cancer screening not available to the under 50s?</p></speech>

As far as I know, the international evidence is not there to support extending it to the lower age group but the screening service constantly reviews evidence as it comes through the international channels and works with colleagues internationally concerning best practice.  I assure the Deputy that these things are constantly kept under review and that screening programmes must be delivered under the guidance that is there.</p></speech>

To what extent have they discussed the requirements of cancer services with the management of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme and the director whose responsibility it is to bring it on stream, Laura Magahy?  Have they intimated to her their requirements in terms of infrastructure, extra consultants and diagnostics?  Who wants to answer?</p></speech>

We wish there was more but it is just not happening.  We have sought meetings many times but we have not been successful in getting them.  I am not even aware of the plans for cancer care in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare should be consulting with us.  We were not consulted with in respect of the elective-only hospitals plan either.  Sl&aacute;intecare needs to broaden its consultation process and listen to the people delivering the care.</p></speech>

At individual unit level, one of the major jobs of the clinical leads is advocating for clinical services.  All of this has been done through the HSE and the local units for years so there has been no shortage of advocacy on our part down through the decades.</p></speech>

At the same time, there is a new structure with responsibility for welding together all the services in a way that makes it relevant, relative to demand and responsive.  That is the Sl&aacute;intecare programme, which is supposed to bring us up to date in terms of the delivery of services, infrastructure replacement and staffing level requirements.  We have all talked about that in these meetings over the past five to seven years.  It is imperative that the witnesses have discussions with Laura Magahy and her team.  Otherwise, although both parties are planning for the future, they will take parallel routes when the crossover needs to take place.  How do the witnesses want the committee to proceed?  My feeling is that we should have a meeting at the earliest possible date where both parties are represented.  I await the witnesses' response.</p></speech>

The first time I met Laura Magahy with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association in the context of contract negotiations, we very clearly said that we felt excluded from the Sl&aacute;intecare process, were very keen to be involved in helping and shaping it and want the health service to be a success.  Dr. Laura Durcan and I said that we would be only delighted to join committees to help with planning and solutions.  Unfortunately, we have not been invited to join those committees.  I cannot speak for the Sl&aacute;intecare committee or Laura Magahy so the Deputy probably needs to address that question to her but I can clearly say that we have offered our services and for some reason, those services have not been considered necessary.</p></speech>

There is no sense in people operating separately.  We know what each group wants, is supposed to do and hopes to achieve.  We accept all that but we cannot continue to have a health service where the staff are drained on an annual basis and go elsewhere.</p><p>We have heard this again and again.  They go elsewhere to serve in other health services.  We seem to have a relatively expensive health service in this country.  It is not the most expensive but very nearly the most expensive.  At the same time, we do not have the best services, notwithstanding the fact the people who provide the service at the front line are second to none and have done a great job throughout the pandemic and at other times.  We need to bring reality to bear on the situation in trying to ensure we have a continuous smooth line through the system whereby patients can expect to be diagnosed, treated and discharged within a reasonable time.</p></speech>

I was going to ask about the cancer strategy but I think it has been covered fairly substantially.  Obviously, there is a serious problem as a result of the pandemic and Ms Power outlined it in great detail in her presentation.  Is there any idea of the number of people who have sadly lost their lives as a result of late diagnosis?  Given it is very difficult to tell, are there any statistics in that regard?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses have any comments on the suspension of the HPV roll-out in second level schools?  Over 80% of young people were getting the HPV vaccine and a lot of that was down to the work of Laura Brennan before she passed away.  I have concerns that this has been compromised because there has not been any real confirmation from the HSE about a follow-up or catch-up programme.  I believe local pharmacists should be included in providing the HPV vaccine.  I also believe that where there is spare capacity at the mass vaccination centres, the HPV vaccine should be offered there.  I am very concerned about that issue and I would like to hear the views of the witnesses.</p> <p>  On another question to Ms Power, the Irish Cancer Society clearly relies on funding from the public.  How much impact has there been on its activities as a result of not being able to do substantial fundraising?  Has the State in any way stepped in to alleviate the pressures the Irish Cancer Society has been under as a result of not being able to raise funds?  Is there anything Ms Power would like the committee to do to highlight any gaps that may exist?</p></speech>

There is good data coming out of the United States on the impact of the Covid pandemic on cancer diagnosis and it is expected the delays will impact mortality for over a decade.  As Ms Power articulated earlier, the reality is that because cancer develops over a period of time, it will take up to a decade for us to see the impact, but we know that up to six months of an impact has been shown to have an impact on morbidity and mortality in the US.  We have had longer than that here and, of course, our access issues and our capacity issues are worse than they are in other countries; for example, we have the longest waiting lists in Europe.  Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the impact will be worse here but, without concrete figures, I do not think it is fair to speculate other than to say that, unfortunately, the impact is real and we will be seeing it for over a decade.  That is why it is key that we implement the cancer strategy in full and put in the additional resources to address the backlogs so we can try to minimise that.  We cannot change what has happened up to now but we can impact the future by taking proactive measures now.</p> <p>  We agree strongly that HPV vaccination for our young boys and girls is the way we are going to eradicate cervical cancer, regressive throat cancers and head and neck cancers for the next generation.  Therefore, we do not want any delays because those teenagers can get exposed to HPV and have that risk of progressive cancer in the interval.  Of course, in the context of the Covid pandemic, given we do not have enough staff and resources and staff had to be redirected, that was one of the areas affected.  What is key now is that we get the catch-up.  We are looking for solutions like those suggested by the Senator and those innovative, "think outside the box" solutions, using any potential spare capacity.  There rarely is spare capacity but we have to use every bit that we have to get that catch-up in place so we do not see the knock-on effect for those teenagers.  As Dr. N&oacute;ir&iacute;n Russell has said, we want to be like Australia and looking at eradicating cervical cancer for the next generation.</p></speech>

It is amazing that we have a vaccine that can eliminate a whole form of cancer in a generation and that we can get rid of cervical cancer and stop women like Laura and other young women tragically losing their lives.  We feel very passionately about making sure that every young girl and young boy, now that the programme has been extended, avails of the vaccine.  It is so important that we get back to school-based vaccination, which is probably the easiest in terms of increasing uptake.</p> <p>  I agree we should also be looking at pharmacists and other areas, and at anything we can do to make vaccination convenient.  I was at a talk recently with a vaccine expert from the WHO who said that we sometimes think about vaccine hesitancy but it is not that people are hesitant about getting the vaccine, it is just that it is not convenient enough, particularly for those from disadvantaged areas, and that any extra burdens such as having to travel can be the reason they do not get it.  Therefore, getting back to a school-based system is very important.</p> <p>  With regard to our funding, as the Senator knows, we had to cancel daffodil day at short notice last year, which was very challenging for us and also for our amazing volunteers, who look forward to doing it every year to raise funding for people affected by cancer in their community.  However, it was also amazing for us to see the strength of the Irish Cancer Society community across Ireland, in that people came together and found new and interesting ways to raise money for us.  While our income was down by &euro;2 million last year, we were also buoyed up by the work people put into doing virtual events and how well daffodil day did this year.  That means we have been able to restart some of the things we had to pause during Covid, although there is so much more that we need to do.  There are a lot of strengths in the fact we are funded by the public and we get such enormous public support.  It gives us a lot of independence.  During the pandemic, we were able to innovate, change and introduce new services faster than some of our counterparts who work in the public health system because of that flexibility.  However, we are always open to more State funding for some of our core services so we are able to pilot new things and support our medical colleagues in trying new things.</p></speech>

No, we have not made any submissions to NPHET.  I know the national cancer control programme made a submission of a piece of briefing material to NPHET in January of this year just to update it on how cancer services were running at that time.  However, we have not had any direct engagement with it.</p></speech>

From our point of view, we think our public health doctors have shown immense leadership and we are very grateful because people with cancer are one of the groups most vulnerable to the virus.  We are very grateful for the leadership we have seen in calling for the strongest possible public health measures to protect people with cancer.  I would also remind people that while the vaccination programme is proceeding at pace for the different age groups, there are many people in cohort 7 who have still not been vaccinated.  As people start to relax and maybe assume that everybody who is vulnerable is protected, that is not yet the case for cohort 7.  It is very important that we all keep up our vigilance in regard to protecting ourselves from the virus and protecting those at greatest risk.</p></speech>

The figures indicate that 60% fewer bowel screening tests were done last year.  That amounts to 75,000 tests.  With a positivity rate of 6%, 450 positive cases were not captured.  Of those, 10% would have cancer.  There are probably 45 people with bowel cancer whose diagnosis is delayed for a year.  Taking each of the other sectors into account, the figure goes up.  It will be in the next few years that the outcome of delayed diagnosis will be known.  It is too early to say now.  That is why it is important that we accelerate forward.</p> <p>  With regard to the vaccinations, there are two points to be made.  The vast majority in cohort 7 have had their first vaccine but not their second.  With regard to the HPV vaccine, I agree there has been a delay requiring acceleration.  The entire HPV programme has worked very well because it has been school-based.  The educational part has been excellent.  If there is a delay, we should consider reasons for proceeding in the way I describe.  Historically, the vaccination was done in general practice but we realised it was better done in the schools.  That is still the best model.</p></speech>

One of the people I spoke to gave me three sentences: Covid-19 has massively impacted our ability to diagnose cancer; Covid-19 has massively impacted our ability to treat cancer; and Covid-19 has impacted our ability to prevent cancer.  It is not that the first two are okay, but we kind of understood them.  What really struck me was the point that Covid-19 has impacted our ability to prevent cancer.  Could anybody offer a commentary on that?  Beyond diagnostics and delays, it is concerning that prevention, which is so important, has been affected.</p> <p>  I have only two questions.  My second relates to how GP access to diagnostics is at sea.  The Irish Cancer Society report alluded to this.  The winter initiative was cancelled.  That was supposed to provide free scans to GMS-eligible patients in private facilities.  This sort of initiative has been revoked.  Could anybody involved in this offer a commentary on it?  The person I was talking to referred to the need for publicly funded access to radiology services and a possible need to decouple the public resource.  We have got demand-soaked hospital settings.  When cancer is properly diagnosed, it is very hard for community services to access hospital-monopolised diagnostics.  Has anyone any thoughts on that?  My question is based on the comments of some of the GPs to whom I have spoken.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.572" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gabrielle Colleran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060200002#K00500"><p>Again, it all comes back to capacity and having enough staff and equipment and whether the service is provided in the hospitals or community diagnostic centres.  My husband, a radiologist, works in an acute hospital with a community diagnostic centre that is very much integrated with primary care.  It is all about the patients getting access when they need it, or as soon as possible.  Our number of radiologists is among the lowest in Europe.  We have huge issues with radiologists and radiographers.  Therefore, it is about getting the staff and using them to meet patient need.</p> <p>  With regard to the issue of screening versus diagnostics, the burden of disease is greatest in the symptomatic population, as alluded to by Ms Power.  Therefore, while we are very focused on screening and the importance of preventing cancer, to do the most good and preventing further harm, the symptomatic population has to be addressed first.  For example, of the women with postmenopausal bleeding who are awaiting access to gynaecological outpatient facilities for further evaluation, one in ten will have cancer.  That involves a huge burden of disease, so much more than among the screening population.</p> <p>  I probably sound like I am banging the same drum but we have the lowest number of consultants in Europe.  It is a major issue for capacity when there are just not enough specialists.  The answer is getting the specialists.  The infrastructure is the next issue.  There was a comment earlier about consultant surgeons with access to theatre only once per week.  When people cannot use the skills they have, they have a choice between deskilling and leaving the system to work in another that allows them to use and keep their skills.  It is about getting the capacity so patients will have access when they need it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.573" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Denis McCauley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060200002#K00600"><p>On the Senator's question regarding prevention, Covid-19  has had a significant effect on pathways, be those pathways screening pathways or referral pathways, and on the ability to be assessed in a hospital and to be diagnosed, treated and followed up.  These have all been affected.<br/><br/>To put it into numbers, while cancer is prevented through public health measures and so forth, screening is an important aspect.  With regard to breast screening, reference was made to whether it is best below 50 or above 50.  The three screening processes we have are evidence-based and work but last year they did not work as well as they should have.  There were 70% fewer mammograms last year.  There were 44% fewer smears and 60% fewer bowel screening tests were done.  Prevention was impaired because of this.  That is probably where the statement came from.  It is a fact.  There are probably cancers whose treatment has been delayed.  In the short term, we must realise we have to accelerate the process so the affected cohort will be a once-off cohort and so the problem will not recur.<br/><br/>With regard to diagnostics, Covid-19 has in a perverse way afforded opportunities.  For instance, within two weeks of the Covid crisis, we were not supposed to do online prescriptions for three years.  We could do so within two weeks when the Covid crisis started.  That was positive.  Where radiology is concerned, the Covid crisis and malware problem have meant general practice has been allowed to have direct access to diagnostics.  Unfortunately, I anticipate that this will be a short-term measure but it will be interesting to see what materialises.  It enhances our ability to test a worried patient to determine whether he or she has cancer.  It is part of a national cancer strategy.  I hope it will be continued and that it will not just be a short-term <i>force majeure</i>measure.</p></speech>

That is the job of the public health doctors.  We need a massive uplift in public health.  Recently public health doctors have got new consultant status.  That is a good sign.  Again, a big uplift in respect of public health is going to be needed.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses.  I was following the meeting remotely before coming to the office and I have been listening to the witnesses' statements.  There are a few points I would like to put to them.</p> <p>  My first question is for Dr. Colleran.  The level of diagnostic delay is worrying.</p><p>There are people who are sitting at home today, having breakfast, going to work and dropping the kids to school and who have cancer.  They could have early stage cancer or their bodies could be riddled with it, unfortunately, and they may not be aware of it.  Some of that is down to delays in cancer screening and some of it is caused by the fact that people have put off everything over the past 14 months, from seeking advice about toothaches, knee pain and everything in between.</p><p> I read in Dr. Colleran's opening statement that "More than 21,000 patients are now waiting longer than one year for essential hospital treatment".  I wish to focus on the following.  Does Dr. Colleran have any metrics on how long catch-up may take, assuming that in the midsummer period around 82% of the population will have received their first vaccine?  We are getting to the herd immunity stage, which is a term I really do not like.  We are getting close to that.  Assuming there will be public confidence to re-engage and go back to healthcare, how long might this catch-up take, in Dr. Colleran's opinion?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.578" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gabrielle Colleran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060200002#L00200"><p>It is very hard to put a concrete figure on it.  Given the additional impact of the cyberattack, we will be doing recovery on follow-up of the cases that were being looked after during the cyberattack to make sure things were not missed with the lack of access to prior imaging and labs.  There is a huge body of work around reconciling that to make sure we can stand over the care that was provided during that period.</p> <p>  In terms of capacity, it comes back to the staffing issue again.  Many people have not taken their leave.  They are exhausted after Covid.  We just do not have enough staff.  We need to get the specialists into post and they have to get access to the diagnostics and the theatre spaces to get through the backlog.  We and our colleagues in the IMO and the ICGP have done quite a lot on public messaging and communications on the importance of going to your GP with symptoms.  It is very understandable that people were nervous about engaging.  However, we have been encouraging them not to sit on symptoms because we do not want the delayed diagnoses, which we know will happen.  We need to keep up the public messaging on that and to keep encouraging people to present with symptoms so that we can investigate them.</p> <p>  Ultimately, it is about addressing the bottlenecks in our hospitals through having enough doctors to see people, enough radiographers to do CT and MRI scans, radiologists to read them, pathologists like Professor Landers and Dr. Kilgallen to read the specimens, and for everything to be going at full tilt.  However, the reality is it is like fielding half a team against the All Blacks and being surprised we are not winning and getting through the backlog.  We are running to stay still.  We are like swans.  We may look calm above the water but we are not, because we are constantly in crisis mode.</p> <p>  I must mention that in respect of burnout before the crisis, the figure among Irish consultants was 44% in 2018.  That would compare with about one in three worldwide.  That figure was at 77% in January.  That was before the impact of the cyberattack.  I have multiple colleagues who are off on sick leave due to the impact of the excessive workloads.  Other colleagues are considering leaving the system.  We do not just have an issue with recruitment, we also have an issue with retention.  The knock-on impact of that for patients is a lack of slots and outpatient and diagnostic capacity.  The critical issue is having the people power and having enough people on the team.</p></speech>

My question for Ms Power and the other representatives on the panel is this: do the cogs that were put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic have a purpose beyond the pandemic?  I have seen the European Medicines Agency, EMA, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, the WHO, M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res and international entities over and beyond our own HSE in Ireland that are all communicating.  The cogs of the wheel are working together.  Smart pharma is engaging directly with the HSE and briefing it.  It seems all of the cogs have come together during the crisis.  The pandemic has been like our Blitz.  We are in war mode, as it were.  It seems there is great cohesion and co-operation internationally on the issue.  Should some of those cogs remain in place, at least domestically, after we have rolled out the mass vaccination programme?  Should some of these big cogs that have been additions to our regular HSE capacity remain in place to achieve a heightened roll-out of the national cancer screening programme to get more people in, so that niggling pains are checked out, screened and we detect and treat more cancers?  I ask members of the panel of witnesses to respond.</p></speech>

With regard to the diagnostic delays, we concur with everything Dr. Colleran said about needing to make sure the services are there once people initially seek that medical advice.  The issue with the Covid-19 pandemic is they have not been taking that first step.  They have not been going to their GPs.  When we look at the number of cancers diagnosed in rapid access clinics last year, they are about 6% below where we would expect them to be.  With the annual increase in cancer, which is around 4%, we are probably down around 10% in cancers diagnosed, as Ms Power outlined in her opening statement.</p> <p>  These are real people.  When we see there are 800 fewer attendances at prostate cancer rapid access clinics and 300 fewer attendances at lung cancer rapid access clinics, as Dr. Colleran stated, they are people who are at home at the moment and who, out of genuine goodwill towards the healthcare professionals, do not want to burden them.  We did ask the question in research.  Respondents stated they did not want to take away from the Covid effort that healthcare workers have been so caught up with over the past year.  Earlier in 2020, one in four people told us they would not have gone to seek healthcare, even though they may have needed it.  That statistic is still one in six people.  We last ran the research in May, so we know there are still issues that we, as a community, need to address and encourage people back into healthcare.  That will have an impact on the number that Ms Power described in respect of missed cancers that have not been diagnosed yet.</p> <p>  The data that Ms Powers used are some of the only data we have.  We do not have eyes on any of the other cancers, aside from those being diagnosed in the rapid access clinics.  That leaves us in a really vulnerable position when we are talking about solutions.  What is the actual problem?  I do not know that anybody can provide the answer to that question.  For example, we cannot have targeted solutions that are needed to get head and neck cancer patients into the system because we do not know about the diagnosis rates.  That is extremely troubling.</p> <p>  With regard to data, there are things we can do, such as adopting the individual healthcare identifier.  Things that have already been progressed need to be accelerated because we need those data to inform policy responses.</p></speech>

I would like to make a request of the committee on behalf of the IHCA.  I  am sure I will be supported in this by the IMO and the Irish Cancer Society.  The committee has heard from all of the witnesses today about the huge deficit in terms of resources, capacity, diagnostics, beds and staff.  The IHCA has made a submission to the national development plan which is due to be launched in July.  It is a critical plan for the future planning of healthcare infrastructure in the State.  We have sought engagement and we have had none.  I ask the committee to encourage those putting together the national development plan to include associations like the IHCA, the IMO and the Irish Cancer Society in their planning.  What we need is joined-up thinking.  There are too many silos and organisations doing their own thing.  It all needs to be drawn together.  I ask that we are involved in the planning.  We are only too willing to help.</p></speech>

In some areas, we have the equipment but we do not have the staff.  We heard Dr. Kilgallen talk about having surgeons who only get a half day of surgery a week and the danger of people deskilling or leaving the health service.</p><p>From a personal position, I have had cancer twice.  The positive message is there is life with cancer and life after it.  That is the positive message people need to hear.  When you are told you have cancer, it is not a pleasant or nice thing but, in many cases, it is not a death sentence.</p><p> How are people being told at the moment that they have cancer?  The opening statement referenced the fact no one is there to your hand after treatment and so on.  The big positive for me on the day I was told was my wife was with me when we heard that information.  I am concerned that I have had a number of phone calls as part of my treatments since the Covid pandemic.  I would be concerned if people were getting that information over the phone.  Can anyone inform us, more so for people listening at home, how that information is told?  Can someone give us an answer on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.590" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Clive Kilgallen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060200002#M00200"><p>In terms of cancer diagnosis and treatment, the good side is that never before have there been so many opportunities.  There have been incredible recent advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment.  If patients present, particularly if they present earlier, the more likely it is they can be cured and treated.  This is new.  There is a silver lining in all of this in that, between all of us, we have an opportunity to make changes.</p> <p>  I hear from our doctors on the wards during this Covid crisis that because patients are ill and in hospital, they do not have access to relatives.  It is a communication problem in that clinicians, NCHDs and nurses are spending a lot of time texting, ringing and emailing relatives.  That is extremely difficult.  Of course, relatives at home may not be getting the full story.  They are worried and anxious.  The patients in hospital are anxious.  This is one of the major things that has happened to staff on the ground who are trying to improve that.  It has been very difficult.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.591" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060200002#M00300"><p>On that point, there are lessons we can learn post Covid.  For instance, 40 people can get an invitation to see a consultant at 9.30 a.m. and another 40 in the afternoon.  Maybe we can do things differently in that regard and make better use of consultants' time.  The phone call idea for a consultation can work in many cases.  It is probably not the same as meeting the consultant or doctor but it can help.</p> <p>  The other positive message is we hear about new drugs all the time.  In yesterday's newspapers we read about a new drug discovered in Scotland.  Again, life chances are increasing all the time with new treatment.  The positive message needs to come across.  I cannot get my head around the idea of people not attending their appointments.  This happened pre-Covid as well.  The number of people who did not turn up for BreastCheck was quite high.  People were sent a bowel cancer test and did not use it because it was somehow uncomfortable or they did not like to do it.  It is absolute nonsense because, at the end of the day, if this saves a life or the life of someone belonging to you, someone you love, you would take those tests.</p> <p>  On the one in six issue and the research on people who said they had difficulty attending doctor's referrals and so on, was some of this, again, down to mixed messaging?  For instance, it was difficult to get in touch with a GP during the Covid pandemic.  People were told to go to their GPs only for urgent cases and so on.  Did some of that mixed messaging move through the population and people said they were not really that sick?  Maybe that is something we need to concentrate on now.  We will make a statement after today's meeting if people feel that is helpful.  We will take up the issue of Irish consultants not being brought into the discussion on healthcare.</p> <p>  Is there anything else?  One of my colleagues, Deputy Burke, wants to come back in.  Specifically, is there anything else people want to make a point on?  We are coming to the end of our session.  What else can this committee do as part of its work, especially around the area of cancer?  I am conscious some cases can be down to lifestyle, obesity, alcohol, diet and so on, which all have an impact on health and the growth of cancers.  We also need to send out the message to people that we all have cancers in our body, but some are switched on and others switched off.  However, it is not the death sentence some people seem to think it is.  It is important we keep reiterating that.  Does anyone else want to come in?  I will then let Deputy Burke in.</p></speech>

I thank him for sharing his personal experience and reminding people that, increasingly, there is life after cancer.  We are in a crisis, obviously, at the minute and it is right the committee is focusing on how we can address the Covid backlog and the cyberattack to get things back on track.  However, it is also important to give people hope because there will be people watching this webcast who are going through cancer and need that hope.  Things really have improved.  Thirty years ago only three out of ten Irish people survived cancer; today six out of ten do.  Many cancers, such as childhood blood cancers, that were almost always fatal in the past are now largely curable.  Progress is being made every day, including with research we fund, to turn today's terminal cancers into tomorrow's treatable and survivable ones.</p> <p>  I urge that, in addition to addressing the current crisis and focusing on those short-term measures, we also get back to the long-term vision that it is absolutely within our grasp to end cancer deaths.  The scale of medical and scientific progress made in recent decades is incredible.  We have doubled the number of people surviving.  If we see the same political and investment priority given to cancer research after the pandemic as we have seen for Covid, it is absolutely within our grasp as a global research and medical community to end cancer deaths in a generation and make sure people do not needlessly lose their lives to this terrible disease.</p> <p>  In addition to raising short-term issues, I urge the committee, through all the work the various Deputies and Senators do here influencing Government priorities in the recovery plan, to make sure we see those political and investment priorities for the national cancer strategy and cancer research so we can realise that ambition.  If we look at how quickly we have developed not just one but many different Covid vaccines, when we make something a priority and we give experts such as those on this call and their colleagues globally the support and investment they need, we can do incredible things.  This will make such a difference to people affected by cancer currently and in the future in every community in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-02a.593" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gabrielle Colleran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021060200002#M00500"><p>We have seen today the patient perspective and advocacy from the Irish Cancer Society, the professional clinical expertise from ourselves and the political leadership from members of the committee.  What we need now, for the next step, is to have everybody available and working together to build forward better so we really deliver for patients.  It would be wonderful if the revised national doctors training and planning, NDTP, coming out in July was discussed by the Committee on Health before then, so those of us involved in delivering and receiving the care could have an opportunity to help shape that.  It is critical that is successful and has the capacity in terms of staffing and infrastructure to deal with the impact of the cyberattack, Covid and the lists that pre-existed so it works for patients.</p> <p>  To address the point about patients not attending appointments or taking up the opportunity for screening, it is very important that we centre the patient and the patient experience in that and not take a judgmental approach.</p><p>There are many reasons people struggle to engage with services or might be afraid of services.  Travellers in Ireland have experienced a lot of systemic discrimination, as have other vulnerable groups, where their experience when they deal with the medical establishment has, historically, not been a positive one.  There is a body of work around trust.  We see this with the vaccination programme and vaccination hesitancy in certain groups, where we must take an inclusive health approach.  We must also recognise that not everybody has the educational ability to interact with all of the public health measures.  A person might have a reading age of 12, for example.  Our colleagues, Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Ni Cheallaigh and Dr. Austin O' Carroll, do a lot of work in this area.  It is important when people do not engage that we do not judge them for that, and that we are curious about the reasons behind it so that we adapt our service to meet them.  Too often in the past we expected people to adapt to the service, but the HSE shaping our service for people's needs is where we need to go.</p><p> Deputy Durkan made a point about how much the health service costs and about it not being as good as it should be.  When we surveyed patients' experience of the system our satisfaction ratings for care were up in the high 80s, at 84% or 96% in the last survey.  I have worked in the best children's hospital in the world.  Ireland has fantastic staff here who are second to none.  Our issues are around capacity, not having enough staff and not having enough infrastructure.  We have a population the size of the greater Manchester area.  This is totally fixable.  Covid showed us that when we have the politicians, the Department of Health, the HSE and the front-line staff working together with the public, we could change things.  As my colleague, Dr. McCauley, pointed out, e-prescribing, which people have been working on for years, was transformed overnight when there was a will to work together.  Our health service is fixable.  We can go from the longest waiting lists in the EU to the shortest if we get everybody's shoulder to the wheel and working together.  We just need to have that collaboration.  It must be led from the front line, from the patients and the staff who are at the point of care.</p></speech>

We are now in the situation where vaccines are being rolled out and hopefully in the next few months the vast majority of the population will be vaccinated and we can slowly get back to normal.  One of the big things is the solidarity of all of us, doing what we are supposed to do, keeping our distance and wearing masks: all of those good things have paid off.  There are people at home, however, who may have symptoms, who may be losing weight and be worried.  People know their bodies.  If there is something wrong, then I would say to them "Please, please do not be afraid".  They should go to their GP.  They will be looked after and will be cared for safely.   This is the big message to get out to patients now.</p></speech>
