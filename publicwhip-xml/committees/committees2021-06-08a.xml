Deputy Emer Higgins will substitute for him.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice not to comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their contributions to the meeting, to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p>We have convened to resume consideration of Committee Stage of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021.  I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  If Committee Stage proceedings have not concluded by 12.30 p.m., it is proposed that the meeting will adjourn at that time.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Before beginning, I will address a letter sent to the committee that was reported on in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>relating to the proposed construction of a liquefied natural gas, LNG, facility.  I would like to clarify a number of points.  Deputy Whitmore's amendments were ruled out of order last week as they were outside the scope of the Bill.  I have never sought to hide the fact I worked for Arup and it is clearly stated on my LinkedIn profile.  Arup has somewhere in the region of 1,000 employees in Ireland and I never had anything to do with Arup's work on the proposed LNG plant.  I did not even become aware that Arup was working on this project until after I left the company.  Any suggestion of a conflict of interest on my part is, frankly, ridiculous.  The Green Party, including me, has campaigned vigorously against the import of fracked gas and LNG.  The Government recently published a clear and unambiguous statement on fracked gas and LNG, and it has also committed to working on an outright ban at EU level.</p><p>On the ruling of certain amendments out of order, in making these rulings I was acting on the advice of the Oireachtas officials and this advice is strictly in compliance with Standing Orders.  These are the only criteria used in ruling amendments out of order.</p></speech>

The equation we have is lopsided at the minute.  It considers emissions but is not yet sophisticated enough to account for the carbon sinks and the sequestration.  I am referring particularly to agriculture and other areas that have been doing this work for years and decades.  People are frustrated that it is not adequately taken into account at this point in time.  The fear is that decisions will be made that are not well informed and that do not account for the level of positive work happening in that sector and other sectors as well.  There is also a point there about the degree to which we are in a position at this point in time to appropriately and adequately assess emissions and the level of sequestration.</p></speech>

The national climate objective provides in section 3(1), that emissions will be "...balanced or exceeded by [their] removal".  The climate action plan is a mechanism to achieve the national climate objective.  Section 4(2)(a) sets out that the plan will be consistent with the carbon budget programme.  We must absolutely include sequestration and plan for that but that has been done successfully in the Bill so I cannot support the amendment.</p></speech>

In creating a climate action plan each year, the Minister will have to set out proposals for how it will support them.</p><p> Unfortunately, the amendment has been neutered, given that our amendment on just transition principles, which is referred to in the amendment before us, was rejected last week.  Nevertheless, I am happy to press the amendment and hear why the Minister does not want to include this one either.  We believe this amendment will strengthen the Bill.  It is not pie in the sky stuff but pragmatic.  It is reasonable and has been included in Bills in other jurisdictions.  It is a practical way to start implementing the just transition, rather than just paying lip service to it.  If there is a legal requirement to include the impact a decision will have on communities, an impact assessment will have to be undertaken in advance, and this can inform mitigation measures that can be included.  At the previous meeting, the issue of just transition was the one we brought to a vote and that was for a reason.  I firmly believe there are really strong political reasons to include this and even stronger environmental, moral and ethical reasons to do so.  It should be supported and I am interested in hearing the Minister's response.</p></speech>

We have agreed on section 4(8)(k), which sets out a requirement for a just transition to a climate neutral economy that endeavours, as far as practicable, to maximise employment opportunities and support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition.  I think that is the appropriate place to put that requirement.  As an indication of that commitment, work is starting in the midlands and three reports have to date been prepared by Kieran Mulvey.  It is the start of a much wider application of our delivery on that legislative commitment, as I said in our previous discussions, to look at how we can broaden that.  I refer also to the work being done by the National Economic and Social Council's secretariat and the extended period of social dialogue we will need in order to meet this objective.</p> <p>  The legislative requirement is clear.  It is contained in the Bill and, therefore, I will not support the amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister stated that the principles of a just transition are contained in the Bill but they are absolutely not.  A just transition is referred to once in the entire Bill, and there is no definition of it or guidance as to what it means.  This is a golden opportunity to incorporate it fully into the Bill and ensure we will meet our targets in a fair manner.  I do not agree with the Minister that it has been incorporated.  One reference is not sufficient.</p> <p>  Moreover, the thing about a just transition is that we have to be proactive with it.  It cannot come after the actions and targets are in place.  A proactive, targeted and focused approach needs to be taken, and it cannot happen after the fact because it will not happen properly.  A reactive transition is not a good transition and it will not happen organically.  In order to ensure the transition is done in a fair and just manner, we need to plan for it, and this amendment sets out how that can happen.  If something cannot be measured, it cannot be addressed.  The first step that needs to be taken is there needs to be an active analysis of which sectors and communities will be impacted and how they will be impacted, with plans set out to ensure that their needs will be met and that the direction of every Government policy will not undermine the right of those communities and those workers to access a just transition.</p> <p>  This is a really important initiative.  The Minister has been referring frequently during this debate to the just transition commissioner in the midlands.  The work he is doing is valuable but it has to be broader than that.  Not just one specific area will be impacted but everyone will be.  I have just read in my local newspaper in Wicklow that one of the Minister's Cabinet colleagues is quoted as stating that the Bill should not impact on and undermine farmers in Wicklow.  The way to ensure that is to ensure a just transition because a just transition does not relate just to Bord na M&oacute;na workers but to the majority of our communities, and to farming communities as well.  For the farming community, analysis needs to be carried out on how the obligations that will arise out of us meeting our targets could impact on them and how we can ensure they are not negatively impacted.</p> <p>  The amendment is really important.   Despite the continuing references to them, two words in the Bill is not sufficient.  The Bill will fall foul of the Government not incorporating and taking into account all communities in the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060800002#C00400"><p>I favour the Minister's approach over the alternative here.  The amendment gives the impression that much of this change is avoidable and that we can start to assess in an academic way the impacts on different sectors.  It suggests that if we think they are too great, there is some way in which we can prevent them or insulate against them.  We have to have a dialogue of the sort the Minister has set out in the section.  We are talking about creating a vision of a different, albeit prosperous, future for many of these sectors, and we are in a position where there is an imperative to change.</p> <p>  The concept of a just transition goes through the Government's entire approach.  Under the heading, Mission: A Green New Deal, in the programme for Government, a just transition is set out in several sections, including a commitment to publishing a just transition plan and establishing a permanent commission for a just transition.  There is a recognition that a just transition will go to the core of the work here.  The section before us sets out that one of the conditions to which the Government and the Minister must have regard is the requirement for a just transition to a climate-neutral economy to maximise employment opportunities and to support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition.</p> <p>  It goes to the heart of the Bill to create an environment where we deliver change that, unfortunately, we do not have the choice of considering whether we will or will not deliver.  We have to make change but, more important, we have to create the vision of an alternative future that is prosperous for farmers.  If we wait and allow an environment to develop whereby people feel we can put off change until another day, we will do a disservice to those very sectors and communities we are trying to support.  The key is the dialogue the Minister underpins in the section, with the creation of a better and more prosperous sector if it is climate resilient and sustainable in its use of resources and has anticipated the negative impacts, and that that is supported by the just transition strategy set out in section 4(8)(k).  While I can sympathise with people feeling they are threatened, the process we are in has to be about divining that new future, not analysing where we are now and hoping we can in some way prevent change happening, or wholly compensate people for everything that might change in that environment.</p> <p>  This transition is unavoidable.  The tone of the alternative being offered, compared with what the Minister has set out, is too static.</p><p>It pretends we can stay where we are, take the time to reflect on many sectoral impacts and then decide whether to make change.  We are past that period.  The challenge is to work with communities to find this alternative future, which I am convinced is there.  The sooner we start to create it, the sooner we will be on a path to sustainable prosperity.</p></speech>

Deputy Bruton said just transition appears throughout the programme for Government.  That is great but it led to an expectation that when foundational legislation such as this, which we all agree is important, was introduced, we would see what was in the programme for Government reflected therein.  We do not see it reflected to the extent we are comfortable or confident it will make a big difference.  That is where we are coming form.  Nobody wants to delay this Bill; we just want to improve it.</p> <p>  After last week, the fact these amendments will not be accepted has taken much of the air out of this committee process.  Much of the dialogue I had over the weekend with stakeholders reflected that.  It is disappointing that neither the amendments nor variations thereof will be accepted.  Nobody is protective of the exact wording.  We just want to see progress on this.  The programme for Government will remain an aspirational document until it is reflected in legislation and other actions by Government and we do not see that in this, as currently presented and debated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.51" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1592" speakername="Carol Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060800002#D00300"><p>I am disappointed the amendment is not being accepted.  We need to be reasonable and sensible, weigh up everything and make sure there is thorough assessment and evaluation.  There have been several mentions of just transmission but I can tell the committee from one of the counties most affected, namely Offaly, that it is far from just.  County Offaly will bear the brunt of the greatest job losses, with 53% of all job losses in the midlands occurring in that county.  Not one job has been created.  It is all very well to speak when one is detached from something but I am on the ground speaking to workers and communities day in, day out.</p> <p>  The just transition commissioner, Kieran Mulvey, has been mentioned.  He does not even have the sole responsibility or focus of the transition in the midlands.  He has now been given a role to examine public pay disputes, I believe.  That says it all about the lack of respect for a county that will be seriously damaged, as well as the midlands region, by a transition that is not just.  We were told we had until 2030 to transition.  I am dealing with very upset workers and families who do not know how long they have in their job or what the future holds and have not been presented with alternatives.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, they are the facts.  I wish it was more positive but it is not.  These people have bills and mortgages to pay.  It is unacceptable and shows how detached some politicians are from the real life struggles of people, families and workers.  The decent and right thing to do would be to ensure an assessment is done.  It will be too late when the fallout happens.  Unfortunately, I believe that will happen because politicians, including the Minister, are just not listening.  It is unacceptable that the just transition commissioner has been pulled and given another responsibility.  That needs to be known and exposed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060800002#D00400"><p>I have listened to contributors on what is in the legislation.  It is all well and good to talk about just transition but we have to look at the practical realities.  The form in this regard is not good.  One only has to look at the series of reports produced by the just transition commissioner.  He has made quite a number of policy recommendations that are being ignored by Government at the moment.</p><p>We talk about working with communities and then we leave communities to their own devices.  In terms of the grant aid given to date, which is welcome, communities have to come up with matching funding.  How will they come up with matching funding for a large proportion of funding when they have no ability to fundraise at the moment?  In theory, we are working with communities; in practice, it is not happening on the ground.</p><p>Let us reflect on the record in respect of seasonal workers in Bord na M&oacute;na.  It was evident from the December before last that we would have a serious situation regarding those workers.  They still do not know what is going on, 18 months later.  How can there be a just transition when a key part of the workforce in Bord na M&oacute;na still does not know what is going on or what role it will play in this?  That is the litmus test.  </p><p>I accept the legislation sets out in section 4(8)(k):</p> <blockquote> 	the requirement for a just transition to a climate neutral economy which endeavours, in so far as is practicable, to&mdash;<br /><br />(i) maximise employment opportunities, and<br /><br />(ii) support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition; </blockquote> <p>I accept that principle is set out in the legislation.  However, section 4(8) states: &quot;For the purposes of performing their respective functions under this section, the Minister and the Government shall have regard to...&quot;.  Once the Minister and Government of the day has regard to a just transition and ticks that particular box, then they comply with this legislation.  We have a perverse situation in this legislation where there is no recourse to the D&aacute;il one it is enacted.  The Government of the day, once it ticks the box regarding just transition, can do whatever it likes.  That is not right.</p><p>The difficulty is as we have seen relates to rural-proofing.  Every memorandum that goes to Cabinet must be rural-proofed but that is a box-ticking exercise that takes place after the memo has been drafted.  When it goes to the Department of the Taoiseach, then and only then is it rural-proofed.  It is rural-proofed in name only, rather than in practice.  A litany of policy programmes have come forward since rural-proofing of all Cabinet memorandums came into place, which have had a devastating impact on rural communities.  Yet, such policies were rural-proofed.  The same applies to what is presented here.  Once the box-ticking exercise relating to just transition is complied with, the D&aacute;il has no role or function in this whatsoever.  It is wrong.  We will come to the D&aacute;il's function later and it should have a function and role in monitoring the enactment and implementation of this legislation.  As currently drafted, that is not there and I hope the Minister will make that small concession.  Biogenic methane should be treated as something very distinct and the broader issue tabled by this amendment should be accepted by the Minister.</p></speech>

It is also in regard to the sectoral plan, to respond to Deputy Whitmore and 6C(10) specifies the same requirements in terms of the sectoral plan.  Similarly, right across the legislation in setting a climate strategy, we also have to have regard to European regulations which require us to show the socioeconomic strategy behind that climate strategy.  At every stage in the process, we must check to see if it meets our social as well as our environmental and economic objectives.</p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Nolan, I absolutely accept that we must be effective on the ground in delivering.  We have committed significant resources.  If I add it up, I think over &euro;150 million is targeted at the midlands to ensure that we do not leave people behind, that we do create new employment opportunities in retrofitting in Bord na M&oacute;na itself, in rewetting bogs and using some of the skills in the many projects that have been supported coming out of those reports.  It has taken time to get the European state aid approval in some of those but that is done now and I expect a huge number of community projects to be up and running very quickly to help make the transition happen.  It will continue to evolve.  Further European funding will become available to support a just transition.  Offaly County Council, particularly, will work on disbursing those funds.  Critically, the next phase of the just transition process will engage with the likes of the National Economic and Social Council as to how we spread this approach, not only in the midlands but in other parts of the country.  That is central to the work the Government is doing.  The legislation recognises that, and to my mind, defines the requirement in the right way.  Therefore, I cannot support the amendment.</p></speech>

He referred to 6C(10).  The problem is that it says "shall have regard to".  There is no legal compliance on the Government of the day once it has regard to.  That is how rural proofing is being done at the moment which is being implemented in principle, all right, but not in practice.  The difficulty with this legislation is that there is no recourse to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann once it is enacted.  I wanted to reiterate that point again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12021060800002#E00300"><p>There is still reference to the programme for Government in how we deal with this stuff.  It was an issue for us during the pre-legislative scrutiny.  The programme for Government is policy for the current Government.  Once this Government falls, that policy will be gone.  I honestly believe the Minister wants to see this Bill through and wants to achieve what is necessary but we need to make sure that this Bill is strong and that no matter who the next Minister is or his or her views, this Bill will still get us to our targets.  I have major reservations about the continual reference to the programme for Government and how it will set the direction.  It is a policy document, it is fluid and has no requirements.  Only by placing things in the legislative framework will we achieve what we need to achieve.</p></speech>

This is not a non-statutory promise of the sort Deputy Whitmore describes, it is an institutional arrangement that will be at the heart of planning.  I can understand Deputy Naughten saying that phrases such as "have regard to" would appear to offer Ministers the potential to disregard those were they not of a mood but that is clearly not the case when one puts into permanent statutory form a just transition commissioner, when one has a plan that sets it out and when one complements that with this Bill.  There is undoubtedly an obligation on any Minister that occupies the current Minister's position, to take a view of the same kind that we must endeavour, insofar as is practicable.  That is the highest bar that one ever sees in legislation, one never sees deliver because obviously there are restraints which Ministers must apply to so that they do everything that they could within their power.  That is what "insofar as practicable" means in legislative terms.  The combination of this Bill and the other Bill that is coming up the tracks provides the belt and braces that Deputies are looking for here.  One cannot put everything into this Bill.  Deputies have to acknowledge that there is a second Bill that will be dealing in a much more comprehensive way with the institutions and there will be a subsequent just transition plan that will create a broader framework.  Against that background, the Minister's approach is very reasonable.</p></speech>

It is a wish list of the current three Government partners.  We need to ensure that it happens and we can do that by including it in this legislation.</p> <p>  The legislation can set the bar high and say that something must be achieved and delivered.  The Minister has amended this Bill to say that they will achieve carbon neutrality so it can and does happen.</p></speech>

It is that wording that ensures that this entire Bill is justiciable and has real strength to meet its provisions.  There will be an ongoing, continuing Oireachtas involvement as the delivery on the climate plan is reviewed and, I expect, analysed by this committee more than any other, as we prepare budgets and so on.  The Oireachtas will be involved at every stage.  That has been a strength of our process in recent years.  Again, I cannot accept the amendment.  I believe we are committed in the legislation as well as in the programme for Government.  Deputy Whitmore is right that it is a separate political document but the legislation is equally strong in the commitment to the just transition.</p></speech>

Obviously, they are supported by a number of Deputies of different persuasions.</p> <p>  It is about tightening up and trying to address the get-out clauses, for want of a better term, of the current Bill.  The phrase, "in the Minister's opinion" is wide-ranging and vague.  It is not entirely clear how accountability will be achieved.  Also, it will vary, by definition, depending on the Minister holding office.  </p> <p>  I presume the other Deputies who submitted the amendment are coming from the same position.  From my perspective, it is about tightening up the language in order that there is a clearer line of accountability and that the legislation can be used as a tool for accountability and provide clarity in terms of decision-making and accountability.</p></speech>

One of the issues that emerged from the pre-legislative scrutiny was the looseness of the language and the flexibility within it.  The more flexibility within legislation, the more problematic it is.  Therefore, it is important that we tighten up on that language, as Deputy O'Rourke stated, and ensure that there is accountability.  We are tight for time so I will not continue.</p></speech>

Actually, accountability does reside with the Minister.  If we did not use that wording in the relevant sections, accountability with lie with the administrative side.  In my mind, that would weaken the legislation.  We have to recognise that there is political accountability in the end, and that responsibility to prepare and present the relevant plans lies with whosoever is Minister.  I stand up for political accountability.  It resides in the political system and not in the administrative system.  Therefore, I cannot support the amendment.</p></speech>

The same arguments that were made before apply in respect of this provision.  To echo the points made after the previous discussion, it is not good enough for the Minister to come here to discuss amendments and point to the programme for Government or other policy statements and commitments outside of it.  We are arguing for these amendments to be made to this legislation for a reason, that is, that they will strengthen the Bill and it is the right place for them to be included.  The suggestion that the amendments are motivated by an element of deflection and distraction, or not recognising the climate challenge and that we all have a level of lifting to do, is simply untrue.  I certainly can say that in respect of the amendments we have submitted and I see the same in terms of proposals brought forward by a number of colleagues.</p><p>The principles in regard to just transition are largely lifted from legislation elsewhere, where others in the same position as the Minister and the Government have viewed the arguments very differently.  Specifically, they have viewed them from the perspective of the need to show very clearly that the conversations and decisions around where the burden and the opportunity will fall, and the process for having those conversations, will sit within a frame that is clear, robust and acknowledges that just transition must be a primary focus and concern.  Without saying much more, this amendment stands on its merit, as did our previous amendments.  I ask the Minister to accept it or, at the very least, take on board everything he is hearing at these sessions in terms of how much more needs to be done to improve the just transition element of the Bill, for the reasons set out by me and others.</p></speech>

The Bill will be coming back to this committee for extensive work in terms of its delivery.</p> <p>  I want to give more detail on a point to which I referred earlier.  Section 4(6)(b) of the 2015 Act, as amended by section 6 of this Bill, specifies that in preparing the long-term climate action strategy, we must take into account Article 15 of EU Regulation No. 1999/2018.  The legislative context in everything we do on climate is that it is underpinned by European regulations, which give our provisions legislative strength.  In the annexe setting out how we will deliver on Article 15, it is clear that we must, in setting out our strategies for European legislation, outline the socioeconomic impacts and the sectoral plans in real detail.  The strategy we draft will be backed up not just by Irish legislation but by European legislation.  Those sectoral and socioeconomic impacts, and the requirement to present them, give us the other structures for just transition, as well as the exceptions I referred to in this Bill.  We will be looking at this as a social transition as well as an environmental one.</p> <p>  I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  However, the Deputy, his party and others will be involved in ensuring that European as well as national legislation is implemented.</p></speech>

It comes back to the fundamental issue that once this legislation is enacted, while the committee will have a role in terms of consultation and consideration, it will have no role in setting down and approving whatever targets are set across the different sectors.  The Minister and Government of the day will, in effect, make those decision without their having to be approved or ratified by the D&aacute;il.  It is frustrating that we are enacting legislation on the basis of what the Minister is saying, that is, that once it is enacted, the European Commission will have a role in considering and approving our targets, including our sectoral targets, and the impact of those targets, whereas D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will have no role in it.  Although the committee will be consulted and its considerations taken into account, the Government of the day will ultimately make the decision and that decision will not have to be ratified by the D&aacute;il.  This is an issue we will discuss again later.  At the very minimum, the Minister should accept Deputy O'Rourke's amendment.</p></speech>

The essence of all our amendments is trying to frame exactly what is meant by just transition.  It is not only in the midlands but all over the country that good, well-paid jobs are needed.  Just transition affects every aspect of what we are doing.  We are going through a complete change from the old way to a new way.  It is like a patient facing a heart transplant.  He or she will survive and thrive if the apparatus can support him or her in moving from the old system to the new.</p><p>Without a just transition as that apparatus, we are not going to bring the people with us.  The Minister should reconsider the amendment.  As Deputy O'Rourke said, we will push it to a vote.</p></speech>

This is an opportunity for the Government to show leadership in regard to how we are going to meet our climate targets, and a just transition is a key component of that.  I ask the Minister to reflect on the amendment because this has been a key ask of civil society groups, the committee and all the experts who appeared before the committee to give evidence.  There is a cross-party Opposition consensus that we need to include it.  We do not want the Government to be dragged kicking and screaming into this arena.  We want leadership and the Government to be proactive with it, take the concerns of communities on board and ensure that a just transition is a key component in how we meet our climate obligations.</p></speech>

We politicians have a role in delivering a just transition.  As Deputy Nolan said, we often have a connection to and understanding of what is happening on the ground.  We have a role in balancing the public interest in regard to the socioeconomic effects of legislative and other measures.  I am sure we will come to this later when we debate other amendments but in the context of the provisions for climate reporting, it is clear that Ministers will have to present and set out on a sectoral basis how we are complying with the targets.  Where we are failing to comply, we will have to set out measures through which we will address that.  That is the crux of the legislation.  If the targets are not being delivered, the Oireachtas has the ability to check and change.</p> <p>  The European legislation does not undermine the national Legislature but just backs it up or enhances the point I am making.  The annexe to Article 15 that we have included in this legislation provides that we will have to examine the likes of rural development effects, agricultural policies and the socioeconomic impact.  That is all provided for and that is the scientific basis on which we can make judgment calls regarding the delivery of a just transition.  That legislation supports rather than undermines the Oireachtas's role.  Accordingly, I cannot support the amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister has said that just transition has been incorporated but I am interested to know under what definition the Minister intends the Bill to operate.

Will he give it any formalisation in the document other than noting it?</p><p>I will not press the amendment because, to be honest, I know it will not be accepted and it is academic.

What we want to do is maximise employment opportunities but it is not just about employment.  It is also about recognising that some persons and communities will be negatively affected by the transition and the requirement to recognise this and support those communities.  I do not think is possible to specifically define what the supports will be or how we will do this because there is such variety and such different circumstances.  It is about supporting communities that may be negatively affected.  This is the core of the just transition.</p></speech>

Even under the Minister's own admission this is within the remit of the Bill.  I am still confused and I have written to the Ceann Comhairle to get the rationale on why these amendments have been ruled out of order because of a money message or being out of scope of the Bill.  I would like the Minister's view on this.  A few minutes ago, he said the social element is a key factor in this.  I do not know how this can be ruled out of order.</p></speech>

While I fully accept the overall thrust behind the legislation and the need for it, in some ways I am envious of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, being able to get a Bill such as this through.  It is imperative, for all of the arguments that have been made by committee members during the previous two sessions and this morning, that there is recourse to the national Parliament on all of these targets and their implementation.</p><p>Deputies Whitmore, O'Rourke and Nolan spoke earlier about the need for a just transition.  That needs to be reflected in the implementation of this legislation.  However, there is no mechanism for the D&aacute;il to review its implementation on an ongoing basis.  There is a reporting mechanism back to the committee and provision for consideration and consultation with the committee but there is no formal ratification process once this legislation is enacted in terms of the five-year targets and, more importantly, with respect to the sectoral implementation plans.</p><p> The Chairman and his colleagues published a report last week on how we could reach a 51% reduction in transport emissions between now and 2030 and he is to be commended on that.  If, however, what the Government is saying and has consistently said in terms of agriculture is accurate, the 51% reduction in emissions within the transport sector falls far short of what will be required.  I do not know what the sectoral targets will be.  We should have that level of clarity before we enact this legislation but at a minimum, that should come back before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for ratification.  That is a specific provision in my later amendments, which we will consider when we reach them.  However, this amendment proposes that the climate plan would have to be formally adopted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  This climate plan must take into account, as set out in the legislation, both the national planning framework and the national spatial strategy, both of which must be approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, yet the climate plan does not have to be formally approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p><p> We can talk about all the big bold measures we like but, realistically, we must bring the public and our citizens with us along that road if we are to turn around the challenge we face of global warming.  That is the one aspect of this debate that sadly has been lacking for a long time.  Legislating the National Parliament out of the approval and ratification process will further alienate the public, cause them to disengage and lead to reactions to measures, rather than people acting in solidarity to achieve the overall objective.  I ask the Minister and colleagues to support this amendment.</p></speech>

We have to set an objective.  The advisory council sets out budgets as to how we will achieve that.  We will keep assessing them and reviewing it.  We set out a strategy to deliver on those budgets and a plan.  It is not only at the plan review stage the Oireachtas will have a critical role.  It will also have a role, as provided in section 6B(7) which states: "Where a carbon budget is approved by the Government ... the Minister shall cause a copy of the carbon budget to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, which shall consider the carbon budget as soon as may be, and the carbon budget shall have effect from a date on which a motion approving the carbon budget has been passed by the second such House."  The section also states where the motion is not approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas under subsection (7), the Minister shall have to have a period of two months to go back on an iterative process of reviewing it.  One could consider any one element and say such and such is not provided for in the Bill but one must consider the entire process.  It is an integrated process in which the Oireachtas has a key role.  If we were to remove the role of the Government to approve the plan, I note there is a later amendment proposing that the Government needs to have more involvement.  This is a complicated structure but that structure is set out.  It involves a role for the advisory council, the Government and, critically, the Oireachtas not only in reviewing the annual report but in approving the carbon budget.  That is the appropriate place to give the Oireachtas the key intervention.  Therefore, I do not support the amendment.</p></speech>

I fully accept this is a very complex structure.  I also fully accept and do not dispute there are various elements of consultation involved in it with the Climate Change Advisory Council, the committee, the public and so forth.  However, the only ratification role D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has is in approving the 2025 carbon budget.  It has no role in the 2030 carbon budget and the draft of the 2035 carbon budget.  In a perverse drafting of this legislation, if D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rejects the 2025 budget, the Minister can bring in whatever budget he or she likes after that within 60 days.  If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rejects the carbon budget, it has no function or role regarding it.  It has no say whatsoever regarding the 2030 carbon budget, which is set in stone once this legislation is enacted, and it has the potential to amend the 2035 carbon budget.  However, at this stage we do not have the evidence to allow for us to amend that particular carbon budget, and that is the only role the D&aacute;il has.  If we reject it, we hand that power back to the Minister of the day regardless of what our objections are.  The Minister by presenting an alternative budget or the same budget again to Cabinet, will result in that budget automatically becoming law.</p> <p>  The D&aacute;il has no role whatsoever in ratifying the sectoral plans.  The Minister has given assurances regarding a just transition and I accept the sincerity with which they were given.  I full accept where he is coming from and I know his heart is in the right place in that regard, but the difficulty is that in five or ten years' time he may not be the Minister.  The Minister of the day may have a very different perspective.  We could have a Minister in office at that stage who is a climate change denier.  Such a Minister could effectively implement whatever he or she so wishes.  If the D&aacute;il rejects it, the Minister can bring in whatever he or she likes within 60 days and it automatically becomes law.  That is wrong.  The National Parliament must be involved in the approval of this.  Last week many colleagues engaged in heated debate on legislation on the health provision regarding Covid.  People argued the D&aacute;il should have a role in reviewing it.  We cannot argue that the D&aacute;il should have a role in reviewing those restrictions when in this legislation we are effectively giving a blank cheque to the Minister of the day to do whatever he or she wants - to divide up this carbon budget in whichever way he or she wants.  It is imperative there is a ratification process which must be either accepted or rejected by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann without any caveats that if we reject it, we have no further say in it.  I would plead with the Minister to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

I appreciate them joining us from abroad.   We are in totally different time zones and I hope we did not get them out of bed too early.   </p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Dr. Downes to make an opening statement, followed by Professor Hymel, and finally Professor Cefai.   The statements will be followed by questions from members of the committee.   Each member has a specific slot in which they can ask a question and the witnesses can reply.  Witnesses are probably aware that the committee will publish their opening statements on its website following this meeting.</p> <p>  Before I begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect of they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity as a witness who is physically present does.   Witnesses have already been advised of this issue.  I remind everybody of the long-standing practice.  </p> <p>  I call on Dr. Downes to make his opening statement, followed by the other witnesses, as I have outlined.  Dr. Downes has been locked out of the meeting, so we shall now start with Professor Hymel.  </p></speech>

Yet research conducted in countries around the world has consistently documented the negative impact of school bullying, especially on victims.  It can get under the skin and affect neuro-biological functioning.   Victims are at risk for depression, anxiety, and poor self-worth, challenges that often continue into adulthood.   They are more likely to consider suicide.  Far too many have found suicide to be their only option.   They at risk for later aggression, conduct problems and self-harm.  Understandably, victims are more disengaged from school and are more likely to be absent.   Academic performance suffers, and they are more likely to drop out of school early.   Children who bully others are also at risk for many of the same problems, but especially for aggressive and antisocial behaviour and delinquency, substance use, depression and anxiety.  Bullying can also become a generalised pattern of behaviour, with demonstrated links to later dating violence and criminality.   Even children who witness bullying are at risk, with evidence of feelings of helplessness, mental health difficulties, and suicidal ideation.   Given such evidence, it is critical that we address school bullying and I applaud the committee's efforts to do so but how can it be done?</p> <p>  Bullying is developmental.   It increases over the primary years, reaching a peak around grades eight to ten, and declines somewhat thereafter but never goes away.   As such, schools are an ideal place to address the problem, where we can reach the majority of our children early on and repeatedly.   Bullying is also context dependent.  The overall climate and social atmosphere of the school can either encourage or discourage bullying.   Indeed, certain subgroups are far more likely to be bullied, including racial and sexual minorities, immigrant youth and those with disabilities.  Bullying emerges within very complex social networks, with social status being a key motivating factor.   Educators need training to understand the group dynamics that underlie bullying and how they can best support vulnerable students.   Until recently, teacher education programmes have not provided such training, focusing primarily on academics.  </p> <p>  To date, several school-based programmes have been created that show some success in reducing bullying.  Although they share common elements, the diversity of approaches is important, each addressing particular contributing factors.  Still, there is no single programme that has been shown to stop school bullying.  Overall, research shows that school efforts to reduce bullying only does so by about 20%, with little evidence of effectiveness at the secondary level.  We can do better.  </p> <p>  Universal programmes aimed at all children are critical to develop pro-social behaviours and positive school cultures but they are not enough.  Given the documented consequences of bullying, we also need more targeted one-on-one interventions for those students who are most seriously impacted.  Indeed, the most effective programmes have been shown to be whole-school efforts with multiple foci, including both universal and targeted interventions.  My recommendation is that anti-bullying efforts be viewed as part of a larger mandate for schools and that schools promote social and emotional competencies, as well as academic skills.  In North America, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the positive, long-term impact of such programmes.  They teach basic pro-social skills, foster empathy, and promote acceptance and respect for others, thereby creating tolerant and inclusive classrooms.  These programmes not only reduce peer aggression and victimisation but help to create positive school climates that will not exacerbate the difficulties victimised students face.</p> <p>  Importantly, there are multiple ways through which educators can do this, allowing for flexibility and repetition with variation across the school years.</p><p>To address bullying effectively, we need to provide educators with the training they need.  Expanded training for counsellors is also needed for them to undertake targeted interventions and also to create better links to community-based mental health agencies.  Finally, ongoing assessment and evaluation are imperative to be sure that one's efforts are actually working. </p></speech>

Let us be clear, bullying is an issue that can cause anxiety, depression and self-harm and can impact on physical health.  It is also an adverse childhood experience.  It requires serious, sustained emotional counselling and therapeutic supports in schools, which we do not have in Ireland.  We need those supports at both primary and post-primary levels.  International research also highlights the point that victims of bullying tend to engage in cycles of self-blame, self-hate and a sense of hopelessness and fatalism.  We need to stop these cycles of despair early, with early intervention, through these emotional counselling and therapeutic supports.<br/><br/>On the issue of family dimensions, which is neglected in many policy aspects, I draw the members' attention to a systematic review undertaken by Lereya <i>et al.</i>of over 70 studies that indicate that negative parenting practices, destructive communication practices and violence in the home have an impact on bullying engagement.  Therefore we need to look at the family support services that I mentioned in respect of bullying.  International research also points to the significant importance of having interventions which are not only whole-school in their approach but also involve parents.  For example, Professor Donna Cross's work in Australia has highlighted the additional benefit of working with parents and not only taking a whole-school approach.  <br/><br/>On the issue of peer defenders or challengers, our report for the European Commission highlights a range of legal and psychological concerns with the active bystander approach, which encourages bystanders to actively stand up to the bully.  It is concerning from a legal perspective because it is reasonably foreseeable that the bully may retaliate against that peer defender or challenger, which puts them at risk of being bullied, with all the various long-term impacts associated with that.  Our report therefore highlights that it would be negligent to put schools in a position where they would be actively encouraging students to intervene as peer defenders.  That is not to undermine all of the excellent work on peer supports and student voices regarding bullying.  However, on that aspect, our report criticises the psychological focus.  There are many motivations that can explain why somebody may be a bullying perpetrator.  We cannot just assume that the esteem of the group is the only dimension to that.  There may also be long-term trauma and adverse child experiences for the perpetrator.  As Sourander's longitudinal study emphasised, an entrenched bullying perpetrator is a red flag that something is wrong.  Again that is an argument in favour of early intervention and the provision of emotional counselling and therapeutic support for the perpetrator.<br/><br/>Our report to the Commission emphasises the importance of the establishment of a national co-ordinating committee to drive these issues at a national level.  At a school level, a driving committee that is led by a champion is required.  It is notable that our own research of 2017 found that more than half of primary and secondary schools did not have a teacher designated as a champion to lead a whole-school bullying initiative, even though they were requested to do so by the bullying procedures.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.140" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Carmel Cefai" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#B00500"><p>There is growing recognition of social and emotional education as an aggression and bullying prevention strategy, contributing to a positive school culture where bullying is neither acceptable nor rewarding in any way.  The term "social and emotional education" refers to what we sometimes call life skills or soft skills.  In Ireland, I believe that it is referred to as social, personal and health education, SPHE.  It includes competences such as developing a positive healthy identity, managing emotions and achieving goals, solving problems effectively, feeling and showing empathy for others, establishing and maintaining healthy relationships, working with others as part of a team, resolving conflicts constructively and making responsible and ethical decisions.</p> <p>  There is strong international evidence that these competences learned at school, when supported by contextual processes, are key for personal development to challenge a culture of violence and bullying in schools.  We have research evidence, including a report which we produced for the European Commission, which shows that social and emotional education leads to decreased antisocial behaviours such as aggression, bullying, delinquency; decreased emotional distress, such as anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation; enhanced positive mental health and resilience; increased positive attitudes towards self and others; prosocial behaviour, such as sharing and collaboration; and improved academic achievement.</p> <p>  Together with my colleague, Dr. Paul Downes, and two other colleagues, we have developed a European framework on the basis of international literature on how social and emotional education may be effectively integrated in schools to promote positive development and mental health.  The whole-school systemic framework that we proposed underlines various processes which need to be in place for social and emotional education to have an impact on positive student outcomes.</p> <p>  In the limited time I have, I will briefly describe and make recommendations on two aspects of this framework.  First, there must be a curricular focus on social and emotional education, which includes direct instruction of social and emotional competences as a core content area on the timetable.  Of course, that resonates with, and relates to, SPHE in Ireland.  It also includes a transversal approach in which the social and emotional competences are embedded into the academic subjects, such as art, PE, science and language.  This focus mobilises the students&rsquo; psychological resources to challenge a culture of violence and bullying in school, with children less likely to be engaged or involved in bullying.  The curriculum needs to be in place from the early years up to high school level, adapted according to the local context, with an explicit focus on bullying intervention.</p> <p>  My first recommendation is that we need to bring social and emotional education to the fore of educational systems.  Often it finds itself in the background.  It needs to be brought in across all year groups, with sufficient time allocated to it on the timetable.  It is necessary to review whether, across the whole range of year groups, we need to increase the time dedicated to social and emotional education.</p> <p>  My second recommendation concerns the positive school climate, to which I previously referred.  This climate gives students the opportunity to observe social and emotional competences being practised  by adults and peers and to apply these skills themselves in the classroom in their learning and behaviour.  In such a climate, students feel safe and secure, they have a sense of belonging, understand and respect each other, empathise with the thoughts and feelings of others, build knowledge together, support and care for each other, resolve conflict constructively and make decisions responsibly.</p><p>It is difficult for bullying to thrive in such a context.</p><p> The teachers' own attitudes and behaviour serve as powerful role models in this respect.  For instance, it is important that teachers in their classroom management do not rely heavily on punitive coercive measures and do not bully or humiliate students themselves.  For instance, research shows us that bullying tends to be higher in schools where classroom teachers use authoritarian approaches and inflexible classroom management or where they are perceived by the students as being biased against particular groups of students.  This requires, however, that all teachers need to be adequately trained not only in teaching and implementing socio-emotional education but also in developing their own socio-emotional competences.  This is not just about social, personal and health education, SPHE, specialist teachers but about all teachers across the curriculum.  They need to have the competences to regulate their emotions, to work on their own biases and prejudices, to be empathetic, to embrace diversity, to work as part of a team with others, colleagues, parents and children, to resolve conflicts constructively, and to engage in instructional and restorative classroom management.</p><p> My second recommendation, therefore, is about teacher training, which is that we need to start at initial teacher education supported by continuing professional learning.  Teacher training programmes in higher education institutions need to include a competence framework that outlines the key competences teachers need to have to implement socio-emotional education effectively.</p></speech>

What we are talking about is, I believe, straightforward, concerns best practice, which is contained within this European framework, and it is a matter of putting it into play.  Within this State, could we do with a greater amount of gathering and monitoring of incidents of bullying just to see the particular type we are dealing with, whether that is based on gender, sexual orientation, race, family circumstances and probably many other types I have not even considered?  We then build that into what we need in respect of social and emotional education, particularly if that is SPHE.  Beyond that we need to ensure we include children, parents and teachers in that.  It is obviously vital young people are included in this part of the conversation.</p> <p>  A big issue for me with bullying is that we all understand the outworkings and how terrible it can be for particular children, and it can have a lifelong impact.  We also get scenarios where people transfer between being a bully and being bullied.  I got an understanding of what cognitive dissonance means, which is the idea that if I bully the other kid, I am not a bad person and I do it because he or she deserves it and it is not very serious in any event.  From the other end it is a case that they bully me and do so because I deserve it.  I imagine it is vital that that idea is built into any training programme and that people understand this, especially for parents, because parents are always afraid in the first instance that their children are being bullied and then that their child is engaged in bullying activity, which can happen to anybody.  Can I put those not-too-straightforward questions to the group, please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.143" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Shelley Hymel" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#C00400"><p>The Deputy asked about different types of bullying and whether it is important to identify those types.  Research has been done and teachers and schools seem to be most concerned about physical and cyberbullying.  In fact what children tell us is the commonest types of bullying are much more subtle.  These are the social and relational types of bullying, the teasing etc.  These are difficult because they are in a kind of grey zone.  Teachers do not know if the children are teasing each other for fun or if they are really trying to publicly humiliate people.  It is useful to identify those but to target specific programmes at them does not seem to be critical.  We have to do the larger picture of trying to stop the whole thing.</p> <p>  As to the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on how children think, we know that children who bully others do something that is now being dubbed as moral disengagement.  They justify and rationalise that behaviour.  That has not been prioritised to date in the intervention although there are two promising studies showing now that simple additions of components of anti-bullying programmes that address moral disengagement and create empathy are very effective.  Both of those things are important, therefore.</p></speech>

It is important to note that bullying is not a static phenomenon in a school.  It can change over the school year.  I would very much encourage school-based surveys.  I have come across situations of surveys where you could have three fourth class groups, for example, one of which with very significant bullying issues and the other two without any significant issues at all.  The class-by-class granular analysis to document that, term by term, is an important dimension we need to have as part of the school co-ordinating committee.  It can fluctuate quite significantly.</p> <p>  The challenging of the deep-seated thought processes of some of the entrenched bullying perpetrators is an intensive support that is needed at times where there may be many reasons the person is putting up cognitive defences.  That needs an intensive relationship of trust built up over time to really explore the roots of why that person is engaging in bullying and for him or her to discover his or her own motivations in respect of the bullying situation.  This is not then just a glib once-off conversation.</p></speech>

Professor Hymel was in fact saying research shows us children&rsquo;s understanding of bullying is not always the same as others' understanding of bullying.  One way of working around that is the importance of including children in any exercise in identification of the conditions that are contributing to bullying and the sense that they make of those situations.  Children should be included in bullying interventions both in terms of the resources and the types of activities.  Research is very much showing that children are more likely to be engaged in resources where fellow children have been involved in co-creating.  Research shows children can provide us with very useful insights and materials on how to deal with and overcome bullying and we need to give them a say on the way forward in the initiatives we have to do.  This is not just an academic exercise by referring to the student council but real authentic participation.</p></speech>

Professor Cefai has given a certain indication as to how this can be dealt with.  How do you engage parents in this because this can be a real difficulty?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.147" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Carmel Cefai" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#C00800"><p>I will begin the answer to that question and will then leave it to my other colleagues to continue.  From our report for the European Commission, we emphasise that a number of good practices have been found to be more effective and others which are less likely to engage parents.  Within a whole-school approach where we include all of the parents, there also needs to be a particular focus on the selected preventative approaches.  Those families and those parents where bullying is taking place or where their children have been engaged in bullying need to have a particular focus in our approaches.</p> <p>  Second, research shows very clearly that when we just provide information in a talk-down approach, those parents who we especially need to engage with do not engage with us.  We need to take an approach which is very much a sharing of our thoughts and resources together and to focus both on capacity building of the parents such as through parental education but also, and this is a very important part, to do it in an empowering rather than a talk-down way.   A further very important point is to have active parent participation.</p><p>It is not just providing information.  If there is a need to go to the parents, then we expect them to come to us.  The focus is more on community.</p></speech>

Trust building with some of the most alienated parents is a slow and difficult process but it needs family support centres as a dimension of that strategy, as well as parenting programmes, which gain credibility in the community by word of mouth.  Not all the parenting programmes have to be delivered on a school site.  They can be in community settings as well.</p> <p>  Again, we need a community dimension to this strategy.  Those parenting programmes are not just focusing on preventing bullying.  It is about a social and emotional education, as well as a culture shift.  There are interesting examples of that such as restorative practice approaches at community level that are well developed in many Irish contexts.  We need to seriously expand those dimensions.  It is not impossible but there certainly is a trust issue that needs to be bridged, which needs more than schools in that trust-building process.</p></speech>

There is also a more general point that parents are not often informed when bullying happens, meaning parents are often out of the picture completely.</p></speech>

While accepting that the idea is to stop the bullying, can we build in an element of protection for those kids who do suffer it?</p></speech>

We have the benefit of some international experience through Professor Hymel, .  Is it the case that the causes of bullying appear to be consistent throughout the world?  What are the common characteristics of a child who engages in bullying in British Columbia and elsewhere?  Are they the same as they are in Ireland or elsewhere?</p></speech>

People sometimes demonise the children who bully.  It should be remembered that these are kids.  Kids are niche finders.  They try to figure out how they survive in the world.  Many kids entertain bullying because it works.  It is a way to get power and what they need.  We have to think of them as developing individuals and worry about them from that point of view. Generally, it seems to be fairly consistent around the world.</p></speech>

Have we to be careful that we do not interfere too much in the ability of children to form relationships?  Obviously, a child may feel excluded by other children who have formed friendships.  There may be no intention behind the exclusion of that child, however.  Is that something we might also need to counteract?</p></speech>

For example, teasing brings in camaraderie between friends but it also hurts the person who is the target.  Those are real subtleties of relationships.  At least what we have to do is address them with the children and help them start learning what the impact of their behaviour is on others.</p></speech>

For example, the roots of empathy programme starts out very early.  It can start out in kindergarten.  The point is that no one programme gives someone all the skills.  There has to be a lot of diversity.  For example, there could be an empathy-based programme in one grade level and a conflict resolution programme in another.  One has to keep varying skills that are focused on because it is not one thin; it is multiple things.</p></speech>

That has been in operation, for example, in the Childhood Development Initiative, CDI, in Tallaght for children as young as three.  The intuitive social skills of turn taking, negotiating, listening to other people are embedded quite firmly in the primary school curriculum.  We have quite a complex web of social and emotional competences built into habitual practices in our system.</p> <p>  The research suggests to try to commence these as early as possible.  We look at the climate of our early years sector, the communicative practices there and then as it moves through the system.  It is about habits of communication in many ways.  Bullying within that is seen as a failure of communication.</p></speech>

This is an area about which we have to be sensitive because it is impinging on the relationship between the child and parent.  What can one do to counteract a situation where there are parents who are inflicting negative parenting practices on their child that may subsequently result in the child engaging in bullying?</p></speech>

We have some kind of national network where investment has gone into these family support centres to link in with parents who are under severe strain for various reasons.<br/><br/>I would also argue that we need to educate people to be parents and that needs to be in the life skills curriculum in secondary school.  There can be community-based parenting programmes as well.  It is very much hit and miss and lacks a systematic strategic national vision.  Anything the committee could do to  go beyond <i>ad hoc</i>, here and there bits of these sorts of parenting support programmes would be welcome.<br/><br/>This is not only in the early years or primary settings.  Adolescence is a hugely complex parenting time in terms of boundaries, rules, negotiation and dialogue.  We need a developmental dimension to that as a support for parents.  Again, it is not only within a bullying lens, but also a more social and emotional education lens.  At EU level, there are now new competences for lifelong learning called personal, social and learning to learn.  The personal and social competences across different dimensions of the education system, including lifelong learning and adult education, are now a key European priority.</p></speech>

Of course, we need to start from home.  However, in terms of formal education, we have to start as early as possible such as in kindergarten or nursery.  Research shows that, in those early years, there is a window of opportunity when personality and development behaviour are more malleable to make it easier for the children to develop these competences.  As early as possible and throughout the whole-school time is the answer.</p></speech>

My first question is for Professor Hymel.  I was very struck by what she said about moral disengagement and the challenge in that regard.  She made the point that it may be difficult to talk about this with children, given that they are not, as it were, fully formed morally at the point at which they appear to be showing this lack of empathy.  She drew a parallel with the behaviour of soldiers or terrorists in certain contexts.  How do we build empathy and establish the kinds of behavioural norms that everybody can share across identities and philosophies?  I believe it is very important to talk about creating a moral position that bullying is something that is wrong.  However, in the context of restorative justice, for example, if a person who is bullying gets some kind of satisfaction in the short term and can see that his or her behaviour causes suffering, how do we show such people that this is not the way to live a good life and is not ultimately good for them?  How do we create that sense of understanding?  Is there a need to emphasise in this that there are issues of right and wrong?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.165" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Shelley Hymel" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#E00200"><p>Yes, there is.  Unfortunately, there is not yet a lot of research on how to do that.  The first study showing a link between moral disengagement or justifications and bullying came out in 2015.  Just last week, I reviewed another study that is soon to come out, in which it is demonstrated that five simple lessons involving telling children stories about the impact of negative behaviour on others had a really strong effect in reducing bullying.  We are just beginning to explore the "how" in this regard.</p> <p>  It is sometimes the case that children do not see the impact of their behaviours on others.  Part of the answer to that is a simple matter of getting them to understand what they did and how it impacted on other people.  I tend to think of children as being in the process of developing morals and we have to help them through that process.  Frankly, we do not have a lot of opportunities to do that because it is usually left to the family or the religion.  Families are busy, often with both parents working, and religion is on the decline.  The problem is being pushed into schools and the schools are just learning how to deal with it.  There needs to be more work done to help us figure out how to deal with this.</p></speech>

I was also struck by what Professor Hymel said about the evidence showing that we are reducing bullying by only some 20%, with little evidence of effectiveness at secondary level.  That suggests to me that early intervention is required.  Thinking about what Dr. Downes said, it seems clear that parent training is a key issue here.  There may be negative experiences within the home that are obviously being reflected in the child's behaviour.  If much of the education that needs to happen must take place at an early stage, do we need to ask whether it is possible to transform parental attitudes?  I will address that question to both Professor Hymel and Dr. Downes.</p></speech>

We cannot put all our eggs in one basket, which is why I am arguing strongly for a diversity of approaches.  There are children whose parents have done everything right, but those children have, in effect, found out they can get what they want if they push other kids around.  We have to temper our response because one particular strategy will not work for everybody.  Dr. Downes may have something to say on this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.168" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Downes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#E00500"><p>To take Professor Hymel's point further, there is not a single, unitary motivation for why somebody becomes a bullying perpetrator.  Some of the research seems to assume there is but, in fact, there are many different reasons for such behaviour.</p> <p>  Going back to the Senator's point about disengagement, I would point to the capacity to connect.  If we have children who have experienced trauma, then their emotions are frozen because they are holding back and repressing those emotions.  That is when specialist intensive supports are needed, to allow them to connect first with themselves, as a dimension of their connecting with, and having empathy for, others.  There is a cohort for whom a cognitive message about being nice to everyone will not register because their emotions are frozen due to trauma-related dimensions.  There may also be issues around separation anxiety and early-years attachment that are quite deep-seated aspects, as recognised by development psychology, that relate to the formation of empathy.</p> <p>  Another point I want to make is that when I argue for restorative practice, it is important to differentiate that from restorative justice.  Restorative justice is where the offender and victim - in this case, the bullying perpetrator and the victim of bullying - would come together to confront each other in some way and make peace.  I am not advocating that in respect of bullying.  Restorative practice is a different set of competencies.  It is a way of questioning things whereby the person reflects on his or her behaviour and is helped to work out how he or she may be causing harm to others.  It is a way of getting people to reflect on how they might change their patterns of thoughts, emotions and behaviours in the future.</p></speech>

The more I have learned in recent weeks about the diversity of pretexts, means and contexts for bullying and the diversity of approaches to dealing with it, I am struck by a particular point.  We live in a time when there is very much a focus on identity, whether that identity is sexual, racial, disability-based and so on.  There are programmes that focus on particular pretexts for bullying.  However, the more I learn about all of this, the more I wonder whether it is a mistake to focus on one area.  Does such an approach risk hogging time and resources and playing down, even by implication, other kinds of bullying?  Could it appear to "other" certain categories of people whose experience is not being reflected because there is a focus on one kind of bullying?  Might it be better to reach for some kind of higher ground that seeks to be inclusive of everybody and always keeps every kind of bullying in context?  There may be particular interest groups that want to specify particular types of bullying, and they may have good reason to do so, but are there risks inherent in focusing on specific identities when trying to combat and prevent bullying?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.170" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Carmel Cefai" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#E00700"><p>I think we can do both.  As a starting point, we need to begin with a universal preventative approach.  When we talk about socio-emotional education, which includes things like developing empathy, building relationships, perspective-taking and constructive conflict resolution, that is for the whole class.  Alongside that, it is important to include examples that relate to particular types of bullying.  We do not keep it at a general level.  The approach should include all children, including those who are at risk and those who are not.  In this way, we are being inclusive.</p> <p>  Within this inclusive approach, however, there is a need for what we call proportionate universality.  We address the whole group inclusively but we give examples, within the activities for the whole classroom, that relate to particular students who may be more at risk because of, for instance, gender or disability.  I would start from there.  We need to focus more, to begin with, on a universal preventative approach.  However, research shows this may not be enough because children who are at risk or already victims of bullying may need additional support, including at a preventative level.  There are programmes that are tailored to particular needs, with activities targeted at particular groups.  I would go for a universal approach, complemented by a targeted intervention.</p></speech>

For example, we can have programmes or activities that focus on sexual identity and others that focus on racial identity.</p><p>These things have to be repeated in different ways because you reach different children with different approaches.  The more diversity we have in our programmes, activities and lesson plans, the more we are likely to hit different things that children will find relevant to their particular experiences.</p></speech>

It has come up at previous meetings, and through TUI research, that Irish children are less likely to experience bullying.  In fact it is below the OECD average.  That is positive.  I was interested by a statement at a previous committee meeting that bullying has actually halved in the last 20 years, which is welcome.  What we are dealing with is where bullying occurs outside of the school, mainly online through social media use.  That has been flagged consistently.  It is a problem and schools have to deal with a problem that did not start in the school but outside it on social media platforms.</p> <p>  I am interested to hear views on guidance counsellors.  I have strongly advocated for the guidance counsellor posts to be restored to schools to the levels we had before the recession.  There were a lot of cuts at the time of the recession and the number of posts has never been restored to the same level in second level schools.  Do the witnesses feel that guidance counsellors would have a robust role to play in tacking any bullying that emerges in schools?  My view is they have a very significant role to play in second level schools.  The restoration of these posts is something I have sought for a long time.</p></speech>

At the latter level, guidance counsellors are not qualified therapists.  I would not agree their role is for one-to-one intensive sustained support for trauma and adverse childhood experiences.  Some of them have stated publicly that they see their role as referring on to the specialist services at that level.  We need to distinguish between the two levels - the guidance counsellors who lead whole-school bullying initiatives at the universal level of a school, and those who provide specialist, intensive one-to-one support.  I am not in favour of the provision of this kind of one-to-one support by those who are not qualified therapists.  I do not think anyone would suggest giving university lecturers extra continuing professional development and put them in to be counsellors for university students when there are specialist counsellors available who work at that level.</p> <p>  On the whole-school level, a feature of international bullying prevention approaches is that they do not put guidance counsellors in a central role.  Guidance counsellors do not have a central role in many of the prevention and intervention programmes.  I would argue that the Deputy is proposing a half-baked Irish solution to an Irish problem.  I am not saying that an individual guidance counsellor could not lead and be the champion for a whole-school co-ordinating committee - there may be some who would be very good in that role, and there may be others who would not - but a lot depends on how we conceive of the composition of a driving committee at whole-school level.  The different levels of intervention need to be distinguished.</p></speech>

As someone who spent 12 years working in the education system, I suggest we need to acknowledge that we have very long waiting lists for kids to see therapists.  I am suggesting that if a guidance counsellor is there, at least the child has somebody to hear them, listen to them and talk to them, and perhaps to put a programme in place in the school to alert other teachers to the problems and to the fact that the child needs support.  I am not suggesting for a second that they fill the role of therapist but that children should have access to an adult who will listen to them if they are very overwhelmed on a particular day or there are problems in the family.  It is about having a listening ear, whether it is from a counsellor or a therapist.  We have to acknowledge that the waiting lists here are unacceptably long.  I have seen at first hand how long it can take for children who need psychiatric care to receive the services they need.  It is ridiculous.  We have a sham of a system.  All I suggest is that an adult who is already in the school can try to fill the gaping gap in services, so that the child can speak to somebody as part of the journey towards getting help, if there is trauma.  At least it would be a stepping stone if there were someone in the school who could alert other staff and put supports in place urgently.</p></speech>

I very much hope the second level focus will be there for specialist emotional counselling supports in schools, as there are in many European counties.  We are not talking about a huge amount of money.  We could have a system of the specialist supports that are urgently needed.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's wider point, there is a role across the school system for mentoring and social and emotional supports from the guidance counsellor or others in the school system.  One would hope that a supportive school culture would include a range of adults.  For many who are alienated from the school system, and there are strong links between bullying and non-attendance at school and early school leaving, a teacher may not be the best person for a child to open up to.  Students have told me on a number of occasions that they would be concerned about opening up to a teacher as opposed to other health professionals.</p></speech>

I am not familiar with the system in Ireland.  In our system, there are guidance counsellors but they do not focus on the social and emotional end, especially at second level.  They focus on college preparation and things like that.  We have to talk about the kinds of counsellor training and the kinds of counsellors who are available.  In Canada, at least, the counsellors are completely stretched.  They have way too many clients and not many kids go to them.  Kids go to the person they trust.  My experience is that if they go to anybody, it is a peer or a person in school such as their teacher, if they have the trust with the teacher.  It has to be done at many levels.  One counsellor with 2,000 kids will find it very difficult to satisfy that need.  We have several problems.  Teachers will also be at the front line.  They are most likely to see what is going on and to be the person the kids will go to initially, and then they need help to figure out what to do.  I was head of a department that trained counsellors.  Frankly, we did not train them in these types of therapies.  We need to consider what we are training them to do.</p></speech>

The principal networks from primary and post-primary levels were before the committee last week.</p><p>I asked them a similar question.  The representatives from both primary and post-primary spoke about the difficulty of engaging with parents.  They outlined how meetings may be open, public, face to face or on Zoom, but it is always the same parents and guardians who attend them.  Often, the parents the teachers really want to reach do not attend these meetings, whether they are about education or whatever.  This question has been asked in different ways during this meeting and previous meetings, but I would be interested in hearing our three guests' thoughts on it.  Is there a way to ensure that parents will concentrate on this issue?  I refer both to the parents of a bully and to those of a student who may be on the receiving end of bullying.  It might be only in order to educate them.</p><p> Turning to cyberbullying, no longer does the bullying stop in school, as it may have 15 or 20 years ago.  Now it comes home with the student, through Snapchat and all the other social media platforms.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Shelley Hymel" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#G00200"><p>On engaging parents, they first have to be interested.  Professor Donna Cross, who is based in Australia, once told me the best way to get parents involved in order that they will at least be engaged and willing to give information is to have the kids stage a play.  She had put on a play, which the kids organised in order that they had a voice, and the parents came to it.  Beyond that, it is difficult to get some parents in because they simply do not have time or energy to devote to this.  That is something we really have to work on.</p> <p>  On the social media issue, parents increasingly get access to information online about parenting and their children.  Right now, there is not a lot of good stuff out there on bullying and so on for parents, so that is another angle where we could reach some parents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.181" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Downes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#G00300"><p>To amplify the point on bridge-building or non-threatening activities, such as the example of the play that Professor Hymel gave, a trust-building exercise is needed here.  If we go straight to saying there is a bullying problem and a particular parent's child may be the one at fault, and we want to bring them into a universal parenting programme on that basis, parents may feel quite threatened by that.  It is about trying to get in earlier with the social and emotional education and softer parenting programme approaches.  It could include a range of health-based issues such as sleep-awareness issues or a range of other dimensions.</p> <p>  I reiterate that there needs to be different sites of engagement, such as community locations, where families may feel more at ease and where there is a social element, as well as the family centre dimension, where programmes can be run.  There should be community outreach, school outreach into the home and outreach to individual families.  There are home-visiting programmes, both for early years children and at primary school level, whereby there are visits to the homes of families where there are known to be major issues of mental health, domestic violence or conflict.</p> <p>  We need to have that multidimensional outreach approach but it should be more than just an information-based model.  It is also about how parents may co-construct some of the solutions. One of the criticisms we made in our report for the European Commission was that much international research tended to treat parents passively.  They were treated just as objects of information rather than being seen as co-constructers of material that may have been of relevance for, first, wider social and emotional education, and bullying as a dimension of that.</p></speech>

The community outreach point is very important.  I attended a seminar last week in which the head of the school explained the efforts they make to go out into the community where the parents are.  They speak the parents' language and relate to their culture.  This is a very important point.</p> <p>  We must realise that schools cannot always do it alone.  They need the help of other institutions and social systems, starting with the community.  For example, in the case I highlighted, the school developed an agreement with the local council, which had access to many of the parents, in order that together they could reach out to particular parents.  The school worked through the local council sometimes and through social services at other times.  Sometimes people from the school would visit the bingo nights that some of the parents often attended.</p> <p>  I recall an initiative from Australia that related to engaging the parents to lead the initiatives themselves.  To bring the parents closer to the school, a number of parents were nominated who acted as champions for that cause, and the parents themselves led the parent training.  Of course, the school invited in experts, but this was not seen as a school-based intervention but rather one organised by parents for parents.  That is a good way forward.</p></speech>

I am not sure what our guests' experiences are, whether in Canada, Malta or Ireland, although I am most familiar with this country.  Do they believe social media companies are doing enough to tackle cyberbullying?  At previous meetings, we heard terrible experiences of kids, and teachers have told me about cases of online bullying, specifically on Snapchat, which is more difficult to prove because the posts disappear, unlike on Facebook, Twitter or whatever.  Online bullying is a very significant issue.  Some children now use social media platforms until 1 a.m., 2 a.m. or even 3 a.m., if their parents are not strict about turning off the Wi-Fi in the house, or whatever the case may be.  We all will have heard dreadful stories and experiences.  I am interested in hearing our guests' views on social media platforms in particular.</p></speech>

According to the World Health Organization study on health behaviour in school-aged children, HBSC, Maltese children aged 13 and 15 years old are at the top in terms of addiction to the Internet, which of course opens the door to cyberbullying and abuse.  As a start, one way in which we are trying to address the problem is by educating both the parents and the young people - we are talking especially about teenagers but they may also be young children nowadays - about cyber safety.  This relates to what I was saying earlier about social and emotional education.  A specific part of the curriculum in the context of social and emotional education will focus on cyberbullying, cyber safety and the potential dangers of the Internet if it is not used responsibly.</p></speech>

Cyberbullying is the least frequent form of bullying; I should put that on the table.</p><p>It is also unique.  The children most at risk in traditional face-to-face bullying are what we call bully victims.  These are people who bully others but who also get victimised.  In the cyber world, this happens a great deal.  Those things are very highly correlated.  It is not that there is a subgroup of kids who are victimised and another who are bullies; they are both engaging in bullying, often in a retaliatory manner.  We are just beginning to understand this.  What seems to be happening, at least based on a number of our recent studies, is that kids are getting desensitised.  I do not really want to use that word but I cannot think of another.  They do not see it is a problem but rather just as the way the world is.  We have a really big problem with cyberbullying and, right now, it is really difficult to understand the ways in which it is unique and how it can be addressed.  I certainly agree with Professor Cefai that we need to include this in our programmes and to attack it but we also need a lot more research to understand how those relationships are different and what impact they are having on the children.</p></speech>

People sitting and look at screens for hours every day, and lockdowns have accentuated this problem, may not be particularly happy in their daily lives.  Part of it is a spillover of general unhappiness.  We need a vision for extracurricular activities, after-school projects, meaningful sports, the arts and nature and to channel people's energies in other directions.  This is linked to the discriminatory bullying I mentioned.  Research in the area of social psychology highlights that it is not enough just to have contact with people to overcome prejudice or discrimination.  Contact and structured co-operation are required.  It is about structured co-operative tasks.  The online environment is so unstructured in many ways that it facilitates that sense of mutual antagonism.  As part of a revitalisation of our society, we need to integrate arts and sport, which are individually strong in many ways, with a social and emotional education.  For example, there is increasing interest at the level of the European Commission in outdoor education, social and emotional education and the interplay between the two.  It is about challenging our young people's energies in diverse directions.</p></speech>

To revisit some of the issues that have been raised, I get the idea that any interventions need to take place as soon as possible, as is true in most other areas.  I really welcome the commentary suggesting that multiple sites must be picked and this anti-bullying framework built into everything as opposed to asking parents to come in and telling them their kid is the main problem with regard to bullying, to use the example given.  That is obviously a major issue.</p> <p>  We have a number of community-based programmes.  The example in County Louth to which I probably halfway alluded is the Genesis programme, with which I have a familial connection, to put that on the record.  This service operates parenting programmes for the parents of children of varying ages, starting from the very young.  It also operates the KiVa anti-bullying programme.  It runs stuff in the community and programmes connected to the schools.  That serves a really good purpose but a certain cohort is missed.  The witnesses spoke earlier about people who suffer multiple adverse childhood experiences.  We are possibly talking about multigenerational issues or abuse connected with poverty along with many other issues.  There is a wider piece of work to be done there.  A holistic set of interventions with particular families is required.  This probably means starting when kids are very young and dealing with a lot more than just the very specific issue of bullying.</p> <p>  In fairness, the witnesses have laid out quite well the sort of framework at which we are looking with regard to best practice.  Can resilience be built in?  As much as we want to deal with the problem of bullying and as much as we need to address it and prevent it happening, it will still happen and we need to help kids protect themselves.  We talked about social media and the amount of time people spend on these platforms.  We are in a world in which people are not doing what they did 20 or 30 years ago, which is to go out and interact with their peers.  There were good and bad points.  People fell out with each other and had fights but learned how to get over it.  To a degree, those skill sets are just not as readily available to kids these days.  That is probably an issue.</p></speech>

I served on its committee for a while so I know it pretty well.  The area-based childhood programmes present a great opportunity.  They represent a key underutilised lens for a community vision on bullying, as do the local area partnerships.  I firmly encourage the committee to make some recommendation in this regard.  Many of these have already been developing social and emotional education initiatives.  They tend to focus on the younger years while a lot is also needed for adolescents.  The scope of some of these groups does not stretch to the adolescents in their remit.  It is certainly a structure.  There are the area-based childhood, ABC, initiatives.  That is a community-based structure which has great potential.</p> <p>  With particular regard to KiVa, in our formal submission to the committee we raised concern with particular regard to the peer defenders aspect of KiVa.  It is questionable both legally and psychologically.  Those are aspects to be considered.</p> <p>  With regard to the point on resilience, Professor Cefai may disagree with me but I am concerned about some of the discourse around resilience because it risks blaming children who are suffering for supposedly not being sufficiently resilient.  I do not believe we need to make Teflon children or children who are superheroes in the midst of adversity.  I personally prefer the term "agency".  We want to enable children to respond actively to situations.  We need to create inclusive systems around them to facilitate their agency.  One part of resilience, if I was to be committed to use the term, is stopping the cycles of self-hate.  International research shows that victims blame themselves.  They internalise the logic of the perpetrator, feel hopeless and engage in patterns of fatalism, which is associated with risk behaviour.  Stopping those cycles of despair, self-blame and self-hate is a key dimension.  Intensive supports are needed to do that but universal competences may also be involved.</p></speech>

To give an example, several studies have shown that kids who are victimised by peers or more generally show a blunted cortisol response.  Their body changes.  We exert cortisol for that fight or flight response under conditions of stress but kids who have been victimised do not.  They exert less cortisol.  This is only seen in victims of the Holocaust or repeated rape.  It is a very major factor.  If we want to create resilience, we really have to start thinking about the impact of bullying in making kids less resilient and how we can compensate for that.  We do not have answers to that question yet.  We are just beginning to uncover how difficult that may be for the child who is repeatedly victimised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Carmel Cefai" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#J00100"><p>I would start with an inclusive approach where children at risk of bullying or already bullied would also benefit from general socio-emotional skills such as self-regulation and developing a positive self-concept.  That is an important point.  We are trying to create a context where bullying cannot thrive.  However, until we reach the ideal situation where bullying does not exist, we need to provide additional targeted supports for those at risk of being bullied in terms of gender, disability, ethnicity - we know who these are - while providing as much classroom and whole-school context as possible where the children are protected.</p> <p>  At the same time, there is the concept of multifinality and that is where the concept of resilience is important.  Research shows and we have seen how harmful to mental health bullying is.  However, the relationship between bullying and mental health problems is not linear.  It can be mediated and that is where resilience comes in by a number of processes that promote the resilience of the person. </p> <p>  We know what the factors are to deal with the trauma and to prevent further exacerbation of the problem and of the bullying.  Research has shown that, where children are at risk of being or already being bullied and are therefore at risk of mental health difficulties, they benefit from the support of peers.  There could be peer support schemes or mentoring.  An important point can be having a stable, close relationship with a teacher at the school, a sort of mentor.  That will be a scaffold of support.  It is also of importance that they have understanding parental support.  A further important factor can be their work, as Professor Hymel and Dr. Downes were saying, on developing a more positive self-concept, believing more in themselves and self-efficacy.  Socio-emotional learning can work in that way.  There are also social skills such as learning to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; in certain situations, how not to exacerbate a problem such that it becomes more violent, for example, and how to make the best decision in a difficult situation.</p> <p>  When it comes to the concept of resilience, I agree we should not put the onus on the victim or expect them to be resilient in tough situations.  The idea is to remove the unjust structures and tough situations.  While we work to provide a context at school, at home and in the community where bullying does not thrive, we have to give at the same time a resilience vaccine to children at risk so they are strengthened when they face a bullying situation, first, in how they deal with it and, second, so it does not have so much psychological impact on their well-being.</p></speech>

We talked abut words we like and words we are not such big fans of.  For me, the word &ldquo;bullying&rdquo; does not really describe the extent of what we face sometimes.  It does not seem to capture the seriousness.  Two earlier contributions mentioned how bullying leads to suicidal ideation.  That is the shocking horror faced by the children and families going through this.</p> <p>  With regard to many of the presentations we have had during recent meetings, I was trying to get to what a good place looks like.  What does a good school environment look like?  What does a proactive engagement with parents and other leaders in the community look like?  Would some of our speakers like to give an example?  I think Professor Hymel spoke about a play.  In my mind, I have the idea that role plays in schools might be a way to let children know what to do if they encounter a bullying incident, whether they are bystanders, upstanders, the people perpetrating the bullying or the victims.  As the witnesses mentioned, each of these groups suffer the long-term impacts of not taking action.</p> <p>  What does the perfect environment look like?  Is there a place for role plays or plays in our school system to help identify the people to go to or people students might trust or, in general, because it happens all the time and to show students how to deal with it?</p></speech>

Role play is important but it has to be done well.  There has been some great success incorporating socio-emotional learning in drama.  We have had people go in and work with students so students have a voice in creating plays and activities they do with younger children which allow for that more intense working out of what to do in a certain situation.  There is a way to do that.</p> <p>  I see schools adopting socio-emotional learning and teachers taking it to heart.  In our province, each school has counsellors and that is separate from what they call a social-emotional champion.  We meet every month with representatives from several school districts who talk, exchange ideas or whatever.  We need time to talk, exchange strategies and activities and work together.  Those things operate to begin to create really wild things.</p> <p>  The other thing we have done that has been effective is bibliographies.  Many great books can be used.  I love the diversity of approaches.  Different teachers will feel comfortable or uncomfortable with different approaches.  The more we give them the capacity and the capital to take all sorts of different approaches, the more likely we will reach some of those kids and create those environments.</p></speech>

We need to start by foregrounding SEL.  Socio-emotional education is not yet recognised in many countries, schools or regions as being of enough value to spend resources and invest in its development.  Many schools, and maybe the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, do not help in this way, and are driven by a reductionist view of education based on cognitive or academic learning.  There needs to be more awareness of the importance of socio-emotional education as a crucial part of human development.  One way of doing this is when the whole-school community mobilises its human and physical resources to put this vision of socio-emotional education into practice across all systems.</p> <p>  We need to identify the needs of our students and community.  We would start with training the adults in the school before working with the children on socio-emotional education.  In particular, we start with the teachers and school administration so they become converted.  Some teachers and parents are not convinced of the benefits of socio-emotional education.  By doing it and developing these competencies, they can be good role models for the school population.  We would also work with the parents and empower them to educate themselves.</p><p>We have to be a bit careful not to be patronising or to blame the parents in one way or another.  As I said, schools can organise training with parents themselves leading.  Once we do that and we have the whole school mobilise its resources with a clear vision, we have trained the staff and we have worked with the parents, we can then start implementing social and emotional education in the curriculum, in extracurricular activities, in academic learning, in the classroom climate and in school bullying policies.</p></speech>

It is a question of engagement across all groups in schools and at home as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-06-08a.200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Downes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021060800002#K00400"><p>To add to a number of the points, working with the principal is a key aspect so we need the professional development of principals regarding social and emotional education.  We have restorative practice schools here where there are whole-school approaches.  We are not that far away from it in many of our schools and there are a number of schools where we can see models of real openness.  Conflict is not avoidable in schools, conflict is part of life, and it is a question of how those conflicts are mediated.</p> <p>  Professor Cefai made a point that I want to amplify, which is that social and emotional education is not opposed to academic learning.  The academic research points out that social and emotional education improves academic learning because it involves a deeper engagement with the material, deeper connection to life experience and deeper processes of questioning.  For example, in English they are trying to understand characters&rsquo; motivations in a novel or they are trying to understand empathy in history.  Drama and role-play is something which is part of the primary curriculum and can be used as a method across subjects, such as in history, religion or ethics.  There are ways in which role-play helps the key social and emotional education goals, which are empathy and perspective taking.</p> <p>  On the point on the ideal features of a school, we can almost sense this when we go into schools.  One of my roles is to go around to different schools on school placement, and I can see the tangible climate in the school where all the school staff are engaged with the school process, they are happy to chat with the children and they talk at the level of the children, so there is democracy in action in the school environment.  It is about all of those whole-school aspects.</p> <p>  If I am being asked what other layers there are on that, I have already argued for a whole-school committee to drive through change at a whole-school level, not just one champion but a committee, and to have emotional counsellors and therapists onsite.  What I would add to that is a vision of a school community lifelong learning centre, where the school is available after school hours, where there can be after-school activities that children want to stay for and where parents are engaged.  The role of the arts in regard to bullying prevention and social and emotional education is usually underdeveloped.  There are many different multidimensional lenses to build on.</p> <p>  I would add that around secondary school level, many of the wider programmes have been shown to be less effective for older teenagers.  There is a risk that overly didactic approaches will get the teenagers to react against it, and they will do the opposite.  There is quite a lot of research, even going back to the 1970s, that if we try to programme youth into things, they will go the opposite way.  We have to be careful around that aspect also.  With older children, it is about co-constructing meaning-making material.</p> <p>  In our report for the commission, we also emphasised how youth would have an input into curricular materials.  In the international research, one of the key features of successful bullying programmes was video.  Videos were actively developed by minority groups who were victims of bullying to show what it is like in their life experience.  To have different minority voices come through in videos is another dimension that international research says has a key impact for bullying prevention.</p></speech>

To take away a key point, it would be that early intervention in primary school is crucial.  We heard from other schools talking about the roots of empathy programme, which was very impressive.  I take it that the focus on primary schools and early intervention is crucial, along with training the teachers within the whole school on these programmes and the emotional skills the witnesses are talking about.</p></speech>

I would also emphasise there needs to be a consistency with the climate and culture of secondary school.  It is very important that those democratic, voice-based principles at primary are carried through into the secondary school system.  We risk a disillusionment if we have a very different type of school climate from primary to post-primary.  I argue that we need to be looking for that continuity of climate, and that would obviously go back to issues such as conflict resolution skills for secondary teachers as well as primary teachers in initial teacher education.</p></speech>
